1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,444
Welcome back to Room 1.

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:04,609
So, thanks for coming.

3
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:07,711
Cool, let's get this show on the road.

4
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:09,612
This is a really full room.

5
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:11,353
Holy crap, thank you for coming.

6
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:13,795
My name is Jason Vandenberg,

7
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,317
I am a creative director at Ubisoft,

8
00:00:16,377 --> 00:00:18,378
which means that I make problems for a living.

9
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:22,761
And I'm here to talk about acting like players.

10
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:23,522
So I'm gonna get started,

11
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:25,183
because I've got a lot of stuff to get through.

12
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,965
So, I'm gonna give you a quick rehash.

13
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:30,006
First quick question,

14
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:32,368
how many people in this room saw my talk last year?

15
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:36,591
on the vault at all? Okay, about half the room, maybe a little bit less. Good.

16
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:41,434
All right. So I'm gonna do a quick intro for those of you who didn't see that,

17
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:42,895
who are going, what is this all about?

18
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:46,358
For the rest of you, you know, get on your phones and check your email or something.

19
00:00:47,118 --> 00:00:47,479
Uh, okay.

20
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:55,119
Big Five. Big Five is a structure of human psychology that is being used by academia worldwide.

21
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:57,859
I discovered this randomly about two years ago.

22
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,660
Had no idea it existed. I was thrilled to find out about it.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,161
Big Five is five different domains.

24
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:08,181
Open to Stukes. Hello. Why am I getting a...

25
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:11,222
Do not freak on me PowerPoint.

26
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,267
Go, why are you not going?

27
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:15,348
There, no, yeah, there we go.

28
00:01:15,428 --> 00:01:16,688
Okay, there we go, I was clicking on the wrong thing.

29
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:18,889
Openness to experience, conscientiousness,

30
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:22,831
extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.

31
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,413
These are five different personality groups.

32
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,534
If you're experienced in psychological theory,

33
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:30,255
you'll be familiar with the sorts of things

34
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:30,995
that these talk about.

35
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:34,037
The reason I was excited about this particular model

36
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:37,238
is that inside each of these are actually six

37
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:38,399
what are known as facets.

38
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:41,461
And these are far more specific.

39
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:46,223
And this means that altogether the system is really 30 different

40
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:48,545
spectrums of human personality and motivation.

41
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:49,505
I thought that was pretty cool.

42
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,908
So what I've been doing is, I spent the last two years correlating these.

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,931
And through correlation, I mean, I have been doing interviews with people.

44
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:02,793
asking, doing the big five test, and then asking

45
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:04,794
them about their play style, what they like in

46
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,957
games. And I discovered that they correlate. Your personality test

47
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:11,098
will predict the kinds of games that you like.

48
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:14,761
So the five domains of play are the names

49
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:18,563
of the game features that will satisfy people with

50
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:22,165
those motivations. So people who are open to experience,

51
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:25,507
like, gasp, new things in their video games.

52
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:27,848
I know that that sounds pretty obvious,

53
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:31,049
but this work hadn't been done before, so here we are.

54
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,150
At the end of the talk last year,

55
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,251
I pointed out that neuroticism,

56
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,631
which we'll talk about in a minute,

57
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,871
was a big question mark.

58
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:42,132
It didn't really correlate, and I have more data on...

59
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:43,553
It didn't correlate at all.

60
00:02:43,573 --> 00:02:45,193
It didn't seem to in any of my interviews.

61
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:47,414
Neuroticism was...

62
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:48,474
Well, I'm gonna get to it in a minute.

63
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:53,336
So, that's really all you need to know about the Big Five right now

64
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,997
to understand the rest of the talk.

65
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:55,978
That's the intro.

66
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,499
What have I been doing since last year?

67
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,880
The answer is pretty simple.

68
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,021
More research!

69
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:04,122
We're doing more research!

70
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:06,323
But this time, instead of just qualitative research,

71
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:07,824
where I was doing personal interviews,

72
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:10,385
we actually started doing some quantitative research as well.

73
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:15,307
We have, my sister is a PhD psychologist,

74
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:18,549
teacher at the University of Washington at DigiPen.

75
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:20,229
She has been testing her classes.

76
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,032
And so we have made big tests,

77
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:27,213
and we have been using students as guinea pigs

78
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:30,554
to find numbers to see if these correlations

79
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:34,756
that we found in the qualitative research actually existed.

80
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:38,539
So it looks like this, we give them the test, the ocean test,

81
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:41,321
and then we give them a test that is the five domains test,

82
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:43,823
you know, do you like these types of gameplay, etc.

83
00:03:44,744 --> 00:03:46,886
And what I have now is I have some numbers of correlation.

84
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:48,127
They look like this, 0.42.

85
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:50,969
This probably means nothing to you,

86
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:53,731
it didn't mean anything to me when it was first presented to me.

87
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:55,573
In correlation, a 1.0 is 100%, and a 0 means none.

88
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:56,193
So, 0.42, that's pretty...

89
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:05,843
okay in social, sort of psychological study terms. It's pretty good.

90
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:09,948
It's not great, it means there's some noise in the data, but it's okay.

91
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:13,973
3, 2, 7, 5, 1, 2, 8, that's low, we need to fix that.

92
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:16,616
And then neuroticism came in at a whopping 0.15.

93
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:24,526
This is precisely the same kind of results that the other guy who's done big five research

94
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:30,489
discovered. It was Nick Yee, who did a big World of Warcraft study, found pretty much the same

95
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:37,692
thing. So neuroticism doesn't jive. What the hell is going on with that? This is where we were at

96
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:40,794
the end. I'm going to quickly answer this question, and then we'll get into the meat of the talk.

97
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:41,934
Neuroticism.

98
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:45,202
It reflects the tendency to experience negative emotions.

99
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:48,144
A high score in neuroticism is Woody Allen, who is like,

100
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,305
everything sucks every time something goes bad.

101
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:53,226
And a low score is Obi-Wan Kenobi,

102
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:58,489
who meets his death like this.

103
00:04:58,849 --> 00:04:59,529
Yeah, okay, bring it on.

104
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:00,290
It's cool.

105
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,610
I'm cool with that.

106
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:09,267
But, um, the problem that I had in my test was that in my conversations is that I would ask these people with high scores,

107
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,169
what are your favorite games, and they would tell me Resident Evil.

108
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:12,751
And I would say, right, oh, cool, that makes sense.

109
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:15,254
You're like, you're freak, you get freaked out easily, right?

110
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,316
So, cool, that makes sense.

111
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,999
And then I would ask the people with the low scores, and they would say, yeah, it's Resident Evil.

112
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:19,840
And I'm like, I like it.

113
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:26,019
Okay, that makes sense, because yeah, you don't normally experience intense emotions,

114
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,861
and so you like the, wow, help.

115
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,503
Doesn't predict what game you're going to buy.

116
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:33,345
This was the problem that we left neuroticism with.

117
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:37,968
I still called this domain threat, since that seemed about right.

118
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:39,409
Turned out to be about right.

119
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,790
We solved this problem.

120
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,434
Here are the six facets of neuroticism.

121
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,486
Anxiety, anger, hostility, depression.

122
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:49,866
They're all the things that you would think they would be,

123
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:50,667
based on these things.

124
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:52,967
And what I realized this year in a conversation with one of

125
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:56,248
my game designer, Pat Harris, who he was throwing out ideas

126
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:57,049
about how to solve this thing.

127
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,349
He pointed out that we already have a name for one of these.

128
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,791
Anger, hostility means that when something goes wrong, you

129
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:04,171
freak out.

130
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,231
Really?

131
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:07,132
I have no idea what that's like.

132
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:08,052
I don't do that ever.

133
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:09,973
We have a word for that.

134
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:14,174
OK?

135
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:16,705
We know about this.

136
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:23,533
I had to stop playing racing games because I broke my seventh controller.

137
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:27,297
And yeah, it's bad.

138
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:28,018
So we know about this.

139
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:32,575
When people experience anxiety, they will stop playing a game because of intimidation.

140
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,637
When people who have a tendency towards depression

141
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:39,518
will quit their game based on despair.

142
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:42,140
If you've played Triple Town, you've had the experience of,

143
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,801
I've had this fantastic game and it's gone on for a week and a half and then I lose.

144
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:46,902
And I go,

145
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:49,043
and I put it away.

146
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:51,324
And then I always come back, of course, I always come back.

147
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:52,005
I love Triple Town.

148
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,525
Thank you, Dan. Thank you.

149
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,274
Judgment, addiction, hurt.

150
00:06:57,854 --> 00:07:02,618
These are reasons why neuroticism, so threat, the domain of neuroticism,

151
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:09,843
is a guide to the designer to explain why people will stop playing

152
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,105
a game that they are otherwise enjoying.

153
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:13,932
It's a warning.

154
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:15,194
It's a warning.

155
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:16,937
Even if you do everything else right,

156
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:17,818
and you get them to buy it,

157
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:19,180
and you put all the right features in there,

158
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,925
if they're neurotic-type people,

159
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,066
if they have high scores in here,

160
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:24,989
they're going to stop playing,

161
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:25,670
even though they like it.

162
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:26,892
So that's cool.

163
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:30,267
And it's enough for me today because I'm,

164
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:33,049
for my purposes, it's not really the part

165
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:34,790
of the psychology that I'm studying right now.

166
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:38,393
So, when we go, for the purposes of this talk,

167
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:40,575
I'm going to take that one out,

168
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:42,596
because I'm more interested in talking about appeal

169
00:07:42,856 --> 00:07:44,618
right now, I want to focus the conversation on appeal.

170
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:46,699
But, for those of you who attended the talk last year,

171
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:48,881
I kind of left it as an open question,

172
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,383
and I felt that I was obligated to then provide the answer.

173
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:52,624
So.

174
00:07:53,345 --> 00:07:54,807
That was where we got. So we're going to take that one off.

175
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:56,109
And we're just going to talk about these four.

176
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,074
Openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, and agreeableness.

177
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:00,637
Okay. So.

178
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:03,161
Since the talk that I gave, I've had this problem.

179
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:05,044
I keep asking, I keep getting asked this question.

180
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:09,426
in a... I worked on Far Cry, Far Cry 3,

181
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,366
um, there was a moment, um, that I remember vividly.

182
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,807
I was going to give this, the talk I gave last year.

183
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:16,987
I was walking across the floor,

184
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:18,787
and the producer, uh, shows up.

185
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:19,407
His name's Dan Hay.

186
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,908
You know Dan. Dan is about 6'4".

187
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:22,788
And he talks like this.

188
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,809
And I'm like, hey, Dan, I'm going to GDC.

189
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:27,269
I'm gonna give this presentation.

190
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:28,869
And he says, oh yeah? On what?

191
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,969
Human psychology. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

192
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:31,830
And Dan goes...

193
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,050
Well, what's it good for?

194
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:41,959
I was like, ah.

195
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:46,102
And I've actually had this conversation many, many, many

196
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:47,143
times since then.

197
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:48,764
But it was really the conversation with Dan that

198
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:51,426
stuck in my head, because he's really terrifying as a person.

199
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:55,229
And he's a good guy.

200
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,931
But what's it good for?

201
00:08:59,012 --> 00:08:59,713
What's it good for?

202
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:02,869
Dan, look, here's the deal.

203
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,111
I have these spectrums of personality, and I can tell

204
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:10,555
you, if your game satisfies these bands of motivation,

205
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:13,397
right, if your game kind of covers those area, and then

206
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:17,820
you test the gamer, and their scores fit inside those

207
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,242
things, then they're going to like the game, Dan.

208
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:24,585
And then, if they're outside, I can tell you that they're not

209
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,246
going to like the game.

210
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:26,707
Isn't that cool?

211
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:30,270
So what?

212
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:34,476
What's it good for?

213
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:41,544
The implication, of course, being that I'm spending Ubisoft's money on this.

214
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:44,067
So I had to answer this goddamn question.

215
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:50,514
And I hope you don't think it's bragging when I tell you that it took me only 12 months

216
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:53,998
and about 17 versions of the presentation to accomplish my answer.

217
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:57,452
was a bit of a chore.

218
00:09:57,552 --> 00:09:59,173
So here is my answer to the question,

219
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:01,354
and this is my answer to the question

220
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:04,215
for what psychology of all kinds is good for.

221
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:05,475
This is not the big five, okay?

222
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,316
I believe that it's only good for one real thing.

223
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:10,157
There are many things that we can talk about

224
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:11,897
in terms of statistics and, you know,

225
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,678
gathering and player modeling and all of that thing,

226
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:15,418
but in terms of making the game,

227
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,059
there's only one thing that this actually helps us with.

228
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,661
Developing accurate empathy.

229
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:24,942
Developing accurate...

230
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:29,660
empathy. And we devalue this because it is not a checklist.

231
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:31,104
That's cool. I'm putting that aside.

232
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:34,151
Here's the thing. Our gamers.

233
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,771
When we begin in our experiences, right?

234
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,272
We start out in kind of this, maybe when we're young,

235
00:10:40,312 --> 00:10:43,675
we're like, ha ha, nerd, he likes video games, right?

236
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,876
What the hell, right?

237
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:48,519
And then as we get into the business, we slowly evolve,

238
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:50,460
and we start to realize, OK, we have to understand

239
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,501
how this gamer is thinking.

240
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,582
How do we do this?

241
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:53,903
What do they want?

242
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,244
What do they want from us?

243
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:59,567
And the job of the designer, the job of the designer,

244
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:04,698
is to develop accurate empathy.

245
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:08,240
Is to be able to understand what is going on inside of not just your head,

246
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,480
not just the head of the guy next to you,

247
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,861
but all of your players, in best case.

248
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:13,702
Best case, all of your players.

249
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,562
All of your players.

250
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,523
I'm going to hit that point one more time,

251
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:19,024
because there was a second guy who asked me an important question

252
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:20,325
that I thought needed answering.

253
00:11:20,785 --> 00:11:21,565
Why am I doing this?

254
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:22,966
Why?

255
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:25,427
Why have I done this for two and a half years?

256
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:26,407
Why have I been chasing this?

257
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:27,388
Why am I standing up here?

258
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:29,508
Is it just attention? Do I just want to feel important?

259
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:30,669
It's not.

260
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:31,769
Here's the problem.

261
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:35,059
All gamers. Hopefully these will be my players.

262
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:43,403
Now, the issue is, when I begin designing the game,

263
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:47,405
these are the players I understand. I get these guys.

264
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:52,528
Right? But the variation in humankind means that these

265
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:56,670
guys are ones that I want to understand, but I do not naturally.

266
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,873
And my problem is, my goal, is that if you pay for my game,

267
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:05,503
You set the controller down satisfied.

268
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:09,886
Regardless of who you are.

269
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:15,311
If you saw the poster and you bought this thing,

270
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,352
I want you to go away satisfied.

271
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:20,014
If you walked into the theater with a ticket, god damn it,

272
00:12:20,294 --> 00:12:21,896
it's my obligation to entertain you.

273
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,197
That's the covenant.

274
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:26,339
That's what we've agreed to do.

275
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,742
But I don't understand all of you guys.

276
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:30,923
So.

277
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:31,683
Whoa.

278
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:34,872
Develop accurate empathy.

279
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:38,154
This is my role, this is my task, this is my job as a designer.

280
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:42,157
Develop accurate empathy so that I can understand a broader swath of humanity.

281
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:47,441
The problem is, that's actually a really nice way of saying a completely different thing.

282
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,544
We all have bias.

283
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,668
And this gets in our way as a designer.

284
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:56,868
Robert McKee is a script writing teacher.

285
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:58,029
He said a fantastic thing.

286
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,969
He says, if you're a writer, and this applies to designers,

287
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,550
it's OK for you to go through your life

288
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,171
and believe lies and misunderstand human beings

289
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,372
and not confront the truth.

290
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:09,372
That's OK.

291
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:11,553
But if you're a writer or a designer,

292
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:15,014
you are obligated to live truthfully

293
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:17,815
and to design truthfully.

294
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:20,355
Because your audience wants truth.

295
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:22,274
That's what they want.

296
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:24,355
So you have to overcome your personal bias.

297
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:26,315
It's hard.

298
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:27,575
But!

299
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:30,156
We have this tool.

300
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:33,796
And I'm going to show you now how this works.

301
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,957
So, how do we overcome personal bias?

302
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,137
You go take the test.

303
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:40,178
Let's imagine that you go and you take the big five test.

304
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:40,898
This is your scores.

305
00:13:41,178 --> 00:13:41,878
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

306
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:43,338
Actually, you're going to get more numbers than that,

307
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:45,459
but just for the purposes of this, let's say those are your scores.

308
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:46,199
Okay.

309
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,039
What you're going to do is you're going to invert those scores.

310
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:50,580
You're going to flip them around.

311
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,260
Okay?

312
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:52,118
Reverse them.

313
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,499
Those are your empathy blind spots.

314
00:13:58,781 --> 00:13:58,981
Okay?

315
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:03,602
Those are the parts of humanity that you do not naturally understand.

316
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:07,444
Your job, as a game designer,

317
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:10,645
is to go and fill those blind spots.

318
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:12,406
Fill them in with data.

319
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:14,146
However you possibly can.

320
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:18,708
At this point, you've got the whole message of the talk.

321
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,129
You're welcome to go.

322
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,372
That's my entire message.

323
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:23,052
Really.

324
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:25,074
Fill your empathy blind spots.

325
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:26,035
Okay?

326
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:29,458
Now, I have a tool that I built to make it easier for you,

327
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:30,839
because it's kind of a pain in the ass.

328
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:31,780
Okay?

329
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,741
It's really hard.

330
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:33,942
It's really hard to do.

331
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:36,324
And I have a technique that I randomly...

332
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:38,326
I don't know if invented is quite the right word.

333
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:39,127
Stumbled on.

334
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,469
It's called player acting.

335
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,404
I call it player acting.

336
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:48,646
So, and thanks to Mike, Mike, Mike Capps fixed the,

337
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,627
fixed the name, it's better.

338
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:50,387
Player acting.

339
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:52,348
Learn to play as though you were someone else.

340
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,369
I'm gonna tell you how I did this.

341
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:57,310
Tell you the story about how I learned to player act.

342
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,511
When I was a young designer, way back when we were

343
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:02,612
making games out of sticks and each other's, you know, femurs,

344
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:07,754
I was working at a large multinational corporation that was

345
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,275
very different from the large multinational corporation that I work at now.

346
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:15,600
And I attended this conference, in fact.

347
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:17,883
And I encountered for the first time in my life

348
00:15:18,003 --> 00:15:20,025
several fascinating theories.

349
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:21,066
The Bartle types.

350
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,129
First of all, who's familiar?

351
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:24,250
Are you guys familiar with the Bartle types?

352
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,272
All y'all that did not raise your hand,

353
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:28,935
take a picture of this, go and look at the website

354
00:15:29,115 --> 00:15:31,918
and read his paper and dig in and learn that.

355
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,002
Hey, Bartle types. Fascinating. Four different player types, right?

356
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:40,785
Explorers, Achievers, Socializers, Killers. I'm not going to go into detail.

357
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,666
But the problem that I had was Killers,

358
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:47,410
Killers in the Bartle type are hunting down other players

359
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,991
to try and make their experience less fun.

360
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:51,573
They're trying to troll you.

361
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:54,315
I do not understand.

362
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:57,357
I don't get this. Why?

363
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,019
Why would you ever do such a thing?

364
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,300
I don't get it. I don't have it in me.

365
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,040
Okay?

366
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,281
Nicole Lazaro's stuff.

367
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,263
You guys know Nicole Lazaro's stuff?

368
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:08,263
The four fun keys?

369
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,805
Yes? Again, homework for you.

370
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,886
That's the reason I put the link on the bottom.

371
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:13,688
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

372
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:15,429
Four fun keys.

373
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:16,370
The emotions of play.

374
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:17,031
Okay?

375
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:18,072
This is great stuff.

376
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:19,853
This talks about the feelings that we have

377
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:20,734
when we are having fun.

378
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:21,254
Right?

379
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:22,776
Um, I found it incredibly inspiring.

380
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,839
Um, curiosity, relaxation, fear, and amusement.

381
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,220
People fun.

382
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,702
Nicole's up there and she's talking about people fun.

383
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:32,644
This is the fun that you have with other people.

384
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,458
I don't understand this. I explained this to me.

385
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:40,979
I grew up in my, you know, my basement bedroom

386
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,760
making D&D modules for myself.

387
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:48,542
So other people make my game less fun.

388
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:51,023
But what's, I don't get it.

389
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:53,584
Mark LeBlanc, Eight Kinds of Fun.

390
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,406
He had this list of, of different types of fun

391
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:59,507
that he described. One of them was called Submission.

392
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:02,108
Game as a mindless pastime.

393
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,654
And I knew, immediately, I was like, yes, that's really cool.

394
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:09,036
But how do I explain this to people?

395
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:10,637
Because everyone would say, well, work's not fun.

396
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:11,437
Well, yes it is.

397
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:12,217
But no, it's not.

398
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:13,518
OK, so this was my problem.

399
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:14,298
How do I learn all this?

400
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:15,931
How do I make sense of this?

401
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:17,172
And this was in the dark ages.

402
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:21,555
So, but fortunately I was working at a large multinational corporation

403
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:23,476
and they had this thing called the IRC.

404
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:26,218
Information, this is not an actual photograph of the IRC.

405
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:27,539
That is not actually me.

406
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,360
But it was kind of like that.

407
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,922
The IRC contained every video game that had been released roughly,

408
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:35,844
of merit, over the last ten years.

409
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:39,747
And since this was in 1874, you can imagine that the games were,

410
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:41,188
you know, there was a lot of them.

411
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:46,398
And I was thinking about how I could do this, and it just struck me.

412
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,081
Okay, how about if I just try it?

413
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:49,743
How about if I just play these games?

414
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:53,368
As though I were those types that I don't understand.

415
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:54,569
What if I just faked it?

416
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:56,492
What would happen?

417
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:57,633
Okay?

418
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:00,938
So, I picked an archetype.

419
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:04,607
I pretended to play as that archetype for a single session.

420
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:07,009
And then the next session, I would pick a new archetype.

421
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,812
Now, of course, given that I am who I am,

422
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:12,614
and I am in the high-achiever category,

423
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:14,917
I went through the entire library alphabetically,

424
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:17,479
and played every game that they had

425
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:18,820
over the course of two and a half years.

426
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:24,004
So, it's a little extreme. It's not actually necessary for you to go that far.

427
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:29,527
And I can tell you that if you do this, and this is my pitches that you do,

428
00:18:30,748 --> 00:18:34,230
or something like it, play games that you don't like, that's really the pitch.

429
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,534
If you do this, you're going to find that it's less fun than it sounds.

430
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:46,697
To get a sense of that, imagine going to the game store, right?

431
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:49,779
And just starting at one end of the shelf and playing all the way through to the other

432
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:49,919
end.

433
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:56,064
You're going to play a lot of games that are not very good, that weren't really done, and

434
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:56,905
that aren't in your genre.

435
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:57,385
Right?

436
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,207
So, I had to make a couple of rules.

437
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:01,869
Four games a week per minimum.

438
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:06,453
I had to force myself to play at least four games per minimum.

439
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:08,094
I gave myself one hour of playtime.

440
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:09,435
It was required.

441
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:13,419
And if I saw a new thing, if I had a new insight while playing,

442
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:16,160
I would force myself to play another hour.

443
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,540
And then I was on my own recognizance.

444
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,301
Okay? So those are the rules.

445
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:22,741
One hour, and then if you learn something, keep going.

446
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:25,422
All right. What did I learn?

447
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:29,103
Well, first thing,

448
00:19:31,764 --> 00:19:32,644
I was a Quake guy.

449
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:36,826
Okay? I really liked the fast, hyper-real shooters.

450
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:38,886
And I gotta tell ya, those World War II shooters,

451
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:39,987
pretty cool.

452
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,986
took me a while to learn that, but that's okay,

453
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:46,408
because I played, after the seventh World War II shooter

454
00:19:46,428 --> 00:19:49,290
that I played in a row, I started to understand

455
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,152
that instead of those guns feeling kind of heavy

456
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:55,534
and clunky and kind of bangety-bang and weird, right?

457
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,995
I started to realize that it was the same gun

458
00:19:58,055 --> 00:19:59,376
I had seen in every game.

459
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,258
And instead of understanding that that was a bad thing,

460
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:05,520
I began to understand that that familiarity

461
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,481
was its own form of fun.

462
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:19,868
realism is not boring. Who knew? I had no idea.

463
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:22,811
It was a bit of a revelation. And now I

464
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:23,871
actually play these games.

465
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:27,054
Second thing. I played everything with Barbie in the

466
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:31,338
title. OK. And if you only do one thing,

467
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:34,720
I recommend that you do that. Because it's gonna

468
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,862
teach you a lot that you did not know

469
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:38,343
about horses. OK.

470
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:40,877
Okay?

471
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:45,280
They are a really big deal, and they're really cool, actually.

472
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,700
They're pretty, it's pretty neat.

473
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,561
It's, uh, it's, you know.

474
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:51,723
I'm just gonna leave that there, uh, and move on.

475
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:54,825
Um, but serene does not necessarily mean boring.

476
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:59,267
Right? Riding through the forest, you know, on a wild stallion,

477
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:03,049
does not necessarily mean that the game is not exciting.

478
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,249
Lastly,

479
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:07,371
heh, heh, heh, who knew? The Sims is fun.

480
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:08,191
Uh,

481
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,141
I got badly hooked, actually.

482
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,522
But I would never have played this game,

483
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:13,482
because I'm a story guy.

484
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:14,142
I'm a D&D.

485
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:17,645
I love setting world context, all of those things.

486
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:18,665
And I saw The Sims, and I was like,

487
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:19,326
that's a dollhouse.

488
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,107
Why would I want to do that?

489
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:22,728
Well, now I get it.

490
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:23,608
Because it's a dollhouse.

491
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:23,968
See?

492
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:25,369
It's cool.

493
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:26,510
You make your own story, right?

494
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,491
No story does not necessarily mean boring.

495
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:28,971
Okay.

496
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:31,793
So, hopefully, by now, it's all clear.

497
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:32,753
That is the technique.

498
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:33,434
It's just that.

499
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:34,414
Player acting.

500
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,836
For developing accurate empathy.

501
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:37,716
That's cool.

502
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:39,548
Took me two and a half years.

503
00:21:40,028 --> 00:21:41,148
Hopefully it wouldn't take you that long.

504
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:43,289
The question you need to answer is, which games?

505
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,751
Which games, which motivations, right?

506
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:47,691
What do we play?

507
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:49,332
What's a faster way to do this, right?

508
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:51,533
Fortunately, we have this cool map.

509
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:53,174
We have a map.

510
00:21:54,194 --> 00:21:56,855
We have a correlated, scientifically validated,

511
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,157
whoa, scientifically validated map

512
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:05,259
that connects game mechanics to player personality type.

513
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:05,719
So...

514
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:07,520
stick with that now

515
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,620
past the seatbelt

516
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:11,102
is going to get

517
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:12,804
little technical

518
00:22:12,824 --> 00:22:14,665
uh... okay

519
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,928
uh... through

520
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:19,969
let's let's do this

521
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,670
all right people

522
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:24,593
what i'm going to do is i'm going to build a great

523
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,923
I'm going to put novelty, the openness factor, here.

524
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:29,624
I'm going to put challenge, here.

525
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:30,804
I'm going to put stimulation, here.

526
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:32,085
And I'm going to put harmony, here.

527
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:32,505
OK?

528
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:33,625
This is what we're going to do.

529
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:34,405
We're going to build a map.

530
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:36,806
These are those four categories that correlate with

531
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:37,806
people's preferences.

532
00:22:37,846 --> 00:22:39,066
We've left neuroticism to the side.

533
00:22:39,486 --> 00:22:40,227
We're going to do this.

534
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:43,707
So we're going to fill these up with information that helps

535
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:47,849
you guys understand and sort of practice the idea of what

536
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:48,329
these all are.

537
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:50,829
Remember, as we're going through this, everyone has

538
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:54,270
scores, and every game has value in all four categories.

539
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:56,474
This is a four-way score.

540
00:22:57,236 --> 00:22:57,697
Okay, clear.

541
00:22:58,198 --> 00:22:58,398
Okay.

542
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:00,422
How did I get here?

543
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:02,964
So, I had to cross over an important problem.

544
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:05,925
I mentioned at the very beginning that each of these domains

545
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:08,206
is actually six individual facets.

546
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:11,267
So, of course, this is exactly what we want.

547
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:14,369
We want 24 individual things that you have to measure,

548
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:15,389
memorize, right?

549
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,430
Isn't that perfect?

550
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,911
24 different arcs? No.

551
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:18,791
This is not what we want.

552
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:21,332
So, I spent a good part of last year

553
00:23:21,592 --> 00:23:23,933
trying to figure out how to reduce this, right?

554
00:23:24,474 --> 00:23:26,875
And I came across the following question.

555
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:28,716
I wanted to ask myself,

556
00:23:28,736 --> 00:23:30,336
what are the primary motivations for gaming?

557
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,807
The question that I would ask in my test is,

558
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,610
what feature would make you put the controller down?

559
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:41,593
What feature would make you stop playing this game?

560
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:45,196
As an example, realism or fantasy?

561
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:47,437
People would generally say yes.

562
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:50,380
People who like realism tend to not want to play the fantasy games.

563
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,002
People who play the fantasy games tend to not want to play the realism games.

564
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:54,423
But if I say artistry...

565
00:23:55,746 --> 00:23:57,326
Artistry. Beautiful graphics.

566
00:23:57,966 --> 00:24:00,187
There are a lot of people like beautiful graphics,

567
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:02,287
people like, you know, the technical accomplishment.

568
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,868
But they don't tend to put the controller down for that.

569
00:24:05,588 --> 00:24:06,849
You don't tend to buy a game

570
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:11,129
because it's the great graphics genre.

571
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:12,550
Right?

572
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,891
So I made that distinction with my test subjects.

573
00:24:17,671 --> 00:24:19,151
And in that process, my 24 went to 8.

574
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:23,056
It's pretty cool, actually.

575
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:24,777
Yeah, pulled them right out.

576
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:29,138
So now I have two per domain.

577
00:24:29,998 --> 00:24:31,599
Building a map, trying to build a tool.

578
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,319
So here they are, realism versus fantasy.

579
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,300
Building versus exploring.

580
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,400
And if you're interested in how these correlations actually

581
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,761
work, that was in the talk last year.

582
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:39,761
So it's in the vault.

583
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:40,861
And it's et cetera.

584
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,722
This is what that talk last year was all about.

585
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,622
So I'm not going to go into too much detail on this.

586
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:46,183
Easy versus hard.

587
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:51,104
Work or grinding or sort of effort play,

588
00:24:51,184 --> 00:24:53,445
doing the same thing repetitive versus impulse play,

589
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:55,106
chasing thing, doing whatever I want.

590
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:57,007
Groups versus solo.

591
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,708
Thrilling versus serene.

592
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:05,050
PVP versus team or group dynamic.

593
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:07,031
We'll talk about that one in a minute.

594
00:25:07,151 --> 00:25:08,532
And then context versus mechanics.

595
00:25:10,493 --> 00:25:12,494
So out of the 30 facets of the big five,

596
00:25:12,634 --> 00:25:16,375
these appear to be the eight primary motivations

597
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:19,653
that correlate with the following elements of games

598
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:22,715
that mean the most to your players

599
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,036
in terms of wanting to be satisfied.

600
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:28,457
So this gives us a map to gamers' brains, maybe.

601
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:31,399
Now, I'm not saying that the other facets don't matter.

602
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:33,380
They do, and that was the whole point of the previous talk.

603
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,681
So I'm trying to simplify this to create a tool

604
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:36,901
to help guide us forward.

605
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:39,102
So now we have two facets.

606
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:42,644
We have two spectrums per quadrant there.

607
00:25:42,964 --> 00:25:44,445
And, of course, me being a designer and a...

608
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,391
old programmer, I know exactly what to do with this.

609
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:48,933
We're going to turn them into graphs.

610
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:50,254
Yes!

611
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:51,675
Yes!

612
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:53,456
Oh, glorious!

613
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:54,858
Oh, so,

614
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:57,900
the, the day that this popped into my head,

615
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,782
I was like, oh, it happened.

616
00:25:59,802 --> 00:25:59,882
Uh,

617
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:03,865
in fact, there may be some selection bias here,

618
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:04,746
I'm going to admit to that,

619
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,688
because it's, it's a little bit too elegant, right?

620
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:10,211
Because it can't possibly be that clean,

621
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:11,832
right? So I'm just going to cop to that.

622
00:26:12,232 --> 00:26:14,014
Okay, so I'm going to go through each one of them quickly.

623
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:21,004
Novelty, fantasy, north-south, fantasy versus realism, and exploration versus building.

624
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:24,385
It's weird that exploration and building are opposed to each other, but I can tell you

625
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:25,446
in my test they seem to be.

626
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:26,726
There are people who want to do both.

627
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:29,580
I'm not saying that the extremes are all that matter.

628
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,183
In fact, each of these are a bell-shaped curve of distribution across the population.

629
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,446
Okay? So, most of the people are going to be kind of in the middle.

630
00:26:36,906 --> 00:26:41,930
But the opinion, the people who have stronger scores, like on the sides,

631
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,033
tend to be more interested in that. That tends to be really important to them.

632
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:47,274
Okay. So, our fantasy explorer.

633
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:49,056
Our fantasy explorer is Alice in Wonderland.

634
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:51,406
Who will go right down the rabbit hole.

635
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:55,527
After anything, she will drink anything she comes across.

636
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,287
Right?

637
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:59,267
Totally psyched to go wherever she goes.

638
00:26:59,287 --> 00:26:59,648
Right?

639
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:01,208
She might kind of complain about it a little bit,

640
00:27:01,268 --> 00:27:02,048
but, eh, you know.

641
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,149
Our realism explorer is going to be Sherlock Holmes.

642
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:08,610
Sherlock, who is always after the real truth.

643
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,210
The actual events, right?

644
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,771
None of this fiffy, fantasy foofery.

645
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:14,431
None of that.

646
00:27:15,865 --> 00:27:18,586
Our realism builder is going to be Samwise Gamgee,

647
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:21,726
who, after the greatest adventure of all time,

648
00:27:22,047 --> 00:27:24,867
just really wanted to go home and garden.

649
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,308
That's really all he wanted to do, was go home.

650
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:32,129
And then our fantasy builder is going to be Tony Stark,

651
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:38,550
who is happy to make everything in the Stark Tower

652
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,430
that doesn't exist.

653
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,210
That's really his main focus of invention,

654
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:43,651
all of the non-existing things.

655
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:44,211
So.

656
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,207
What do these people want to play?

657
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:48,168
So these are our four archetypes.

658
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,310
And again, I'm giving you a guide.

659
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,291
I think you get that, but just to be totally clear.

660
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:53,173
These are guides to understanding these people.

661
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:56,457
People who have scores in these quadrants tend to identify

662
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:57,277
with these characters.

663
00:27:58,318 --> 00:27:58,879
That's the idea.

664
00:27:59,139 --> 00:27:59,820
So what do they play?

665
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:01,562
What do they play?

666
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:03,564
What does Alice in Wonderland play?

667
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,126
Well, she plays Skyrim.

668
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,211
That's what she does, right?

669
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:12,234
And I gotta tell you, if you're going to play Skyrim as Alice in Wonderland,

670
00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:13,915
you don't get to fight very much, okay?

671
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:16,077
What you have to do is get off the roads.

672
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:17,658
You have to fill up the map.

673
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,721
You have to go for the found 500 things achievement.

674
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,742
Right?

675
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:24,524
Explore the world.

676
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:29,548
Um, Sherlock Holmes is a big fan of Phoenix Wright.

677
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:31,449
Objection!

678
00:28:32,864 --> 00:28:33,765
He is on to the truth.

679
00:28:35,706 --> 00:28:36,446
Realism Explorer.

680
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:41,749
This is also a way of indicating that exploration does not necessarily only mean going over the hill.

681
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:44,510
It can be exploring an idea, it can be investigation, right?

682
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:51,635
Sam is a big fan of Eno, not the 2070 version, right?

683
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:53,616
The historical version, right?

684
00:28:53,636 --> 00:28:56,217
Where you're constructing a real colony,

685
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:59,218
and the more realistic it is, the better, right?

686
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:01,219
That's what Sam likes to play.

687
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:05,541
And then Tony Stark likes to, you know, play StarCraft II.

688
00:29:06,982 --> 00:29:09,863
StarCraft II, only single player, however.

689
00:29:10,243 --> 00:29:11,043
Only single player.

690
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:13,004
Because multiplayer is a completely different experience.

691
00:29:13,144 --> 00:29:14,164
The fantasy builder...

692
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:17,755
And the StarCraft experience is, I sit on my base,

693
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:21,539
and I collect all the hard, and I build all the way through the whole tech tree,

694
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:26,265
and then I explore that area, but it's the same kind of map, right?

695
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:29,549
I'm really not going anywhere. I'm building.

696
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:31,511
I'm not exploring.

697
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:34,315
That's what StarCraft attracts those kinds of players.

698
00:29:35,622 --> 00:29:38,784
Couple more examples just to give you an idea that not everything goes on the top.

699
00:29:38,884 --> 00:29:42,646
If you were just to talk about pure fantasy games but with

700
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:45,748
exploration and building in it, Minecraft is a great example of that.

701
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,430
And for the exploration side,

702
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,072
realism is gonna be maddened, right? Realism is a game that both

703
00:29:53,612 --> 00:29:56,354
Sherlock and Sam can agree on. Okay.

704
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:01,136
So, I'm gonna put that there.

705
00:30:02,532 --> 00:30:04,433
Okay? That's quadrant one. Done!

706
00:30:04,993 --> 00:30:06,334
And you can see where this is going, so...

707
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:08,316
Told you to fasten your seatbelts.

708
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:09,517
Okay.

709
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:12,559
Quadrant two. Challenge.

710
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:16,983
Which deals with our ability to, um, uh, control our impulses.

711
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:20,725
Okay. So a skilled play is our north-south axis.

712
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:23,127
Less skilled play is on the bottom.

713
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:25,209
And I say less skilled because I don't mean suck.

714
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,880
Okay? That's not what I mean.

715
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,422
Ah! I forgot to do something.

716
00:30:30,442 --> 00:30:31,543
I'm gonna go back for just a minute.

717
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,724
I forgot an important step here.

718
00:30:34,204 --> 00:30:36,526
We over- we skipped an important step.

719
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:38,328
I want to do- okay, quick test.

720
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:40,209
Fantasy versus realism.

721
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:40,689
Fantasy.

722
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:45,053
Excellent. Realism.

723
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:47,454
Look around.

724
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:48,415
Look around.

725
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:51,497
The population of the human race is evenly distributed.

726
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,400
Games industry is not.

727
00:30:58,492 --> 00:30:59,873
That's important information for you.

728
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:02,274
Exploration versus building.

729
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:04,075
Explorers. This is explorers.

730
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,175
You want to go over the hill first.

731
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:07,676
Not that you don't want to build, but you want to go over the hill first.

732
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:10,858
Builders. I would rather stay and build my farm first.

733
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:12,838
More evenly distributed.

734
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:14,499
Not surprising.

735
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,220
We tend to agree on that, and we don't criticize

736
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,881
the builders versus the exploration game, do we?

737
00:31:19,822 --> 00:31:21,422
We sure do criticize the realistic ones, though.

738
00:31:23,763 --> 00:31:25,064
That's my little guilt trip for the...

739
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:31,994
Okay. And I'm going to roll forward onto...

740
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:33,695
Ah! Okay, so we're going to do it again.

741
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:35,776
Skilled play versus less skilled play.

742
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:38,878
So, hard players. Hard and normal.

743
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:41,099
If you hit a hard spot, you're going to keep pushing through.

744
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,301
You like the challenge of playing a difficult game.

745
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:45,182
You... nicely done.

746
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:45,982
All right. Bravo.

747
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:47,463
Okay, less skilled players.

748
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:49,284
You're going to try it, but, you know, if it gets too hard,

749
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:50,625
you're going to move on, find something more fun.

750
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,126
Yeah, a little bit. It's evenly distributed.

751
00:31:53,146 --> 00:31:54,047
Right? Okay.

752
00:31:54,307 --> 00:31:55,508
But more hard...

753
00:31:55,992 --> 00:31:59,634
More hard players. Why? Because working in the games industry is hard.

754
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:06,297
That's why. Don't forget that.

755
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:11,000
Work play, on one side. This is grinding. I'm happy to do the...

756
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,081
It's the quest in the Barrens where you're like, please go find 300 boar tusks.

757
00:32:14,922 --> 00:32:20,645
That one. Work play. Impulse play is, I want to do this thing, and this is fun, and I'm going over here.

758
00:32:20,665 --> 00:32:21,245
So work players.

759
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,022
Work players, work players, grinders...

760
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:26,703
No? That's okay. Okay, okay, okay.

761
00:32:26,803 --> 00:32:28,324
Impulse. Impulse players.

762
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:31,385
Slight misbalance there.

763
00:32:31,665 --> 00:32:32,626
Just gonna point that one out.

764
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:34,687
And what else do we criticize?

765
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:35,968
Grinding.

766
00:32:37,348 --> 00:32:37,689
We hate it.

767
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,109
We don't understand it, do we?

768
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,550
We don't get why people would ever do it.

769
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:42,751
That's why we don't understand.

770
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:43,752
Okay?

771
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:46,933
Alright, so, skilled play work...

772
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:48,714
Who's our skilled work player?

773
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,435
This is Hermione Granger, the masterer.

774
00:32:54,324 --> 00:32:57,245
For obvious reasons, she's the one we always go to when we need a plan.

775
00:32:57,305 --> 00:32:58,986
When we need to get something done.

776
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:01,928
She's the only one who knows any of these spells.

777
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:07,190
The less skilled play, but still persistent grinder.

778
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:11,232
You're not very good at it, but you're willing to do the work and continue and persist.

779
00:33:11,352 --> 00:33:12,233
Oh, poor Ron.

780
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:14,674
It's really...

781
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:17,015
It's brutal.

782
00:33:20,228 --> 00:33:23,472
Perseverer is not a word, by the way. I just made that up.

783
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:27,296
If anyone has a better idea, I will take your advice after the talk.

784
00:33:28,197 --> 00:33:32,261
The less skilled play, impulse player, right? This is someone who is not very good at games

785
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,942
and really just wants to keep... This is the demo,

786
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:36,205
the guy who's downloading all the demos and just trying them out, right?

787
00:33:36,945 --> 00:33:40,309
That's the dude. Okay? Okay?

788
00:33:43,502 --> 00:33:44,263
It fits, doesn't it?

789
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:50,267
Yeah, he's just on the PSN network downloading everything and trying them for 30 minutes,

790
00:33:50,287 --> 00:33:52,209
and then he's like, I don't get it, and then plays something else.

791
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:57,033
He's very satisfied with his life, though, he's happy with that, right?

792
00:33:57,673 --> 00:34:01,897
Okay, and then the impulse player, the player who comes in with a high degree of skill and talent,

793
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:04,159
but doesn't want to work very hard to get it, right?

794
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,021
Just wants to keep going after that? Well, that's going to be Harry.

795
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:09,576
Bill Harry, the talent.

796
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:13,377
Now I actually had a version of this slide where all four characters were Harry Potter characters.

797
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:15,277
And there was a protest.

798
00:34:15,757 --> 00:34:15,917
So...

799
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:17,118
Uh...

800
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:18,738
Um...

801
00:34:19,018 --> 00:34:19,878
But Harry Potter is the one.

802
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,339
Okay, so what do these guys play?

803
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,299
What do these guys play?

804
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:24,060
Hermione, as it turns out, is a big fan of Dark Souls.

805
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,520
Yes.

806
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,500
Oh yes.

807
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:28,421
Oh yes.

808
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,581
The harder the better.

809
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:32,722
N plus... New game plus plus, in fact.

810
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:34,262
Uh...

811
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:35,583
She has all the weapons.

812
00:34:36,456 --> 00:34:38,697
Whereas Ron is really more of a Farmville guy.

813
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:40,138
Um...

814
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:44,840
Because you don't have to be very good at games to play Farmville.

815
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,280
Right?

816
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:48,322
Now that is not a criticism, I am level 68 in Farmville.

817
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:50,543
Yeah, uh...

818
00:34:51,243 --> 00:34:52,804
I want that time of my life back.

819
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:53,404
Um...

820
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:55,045
Okay.

821
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:56,426
Uh...

822
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,767
The dude, our less skilled player,

823
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:00,708
um, is a big fan of The Sims,

824
00:35:01,148 --> 00:35:03,269
and if you're going to play The Sims in this way

825
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:04,450
in order to understand this character,

826
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,071
you have to play with the all-money cheat.

827
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:11,190
Okay? No effort. You just, this is where you get, you give yourself a billion simoleons,

828
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:14,412
and you just do whatever in the hell you want to until you're bored with that.

829
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:21,916
Okay? It is that style of play. It is not all of the quests and the goals and all of that stuff

830
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:24,557
that satisfies the other side. Okay? That's specifically what we're talking about.

831
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:29,600
And then Harry, with his impulse-skilled play, he really just wants to be Dante.

832
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,261
The Devil May Cry guy.

833
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:35,583
FWAH! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!

834
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:36,723
I'm awesome.

835
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:45,545
they both agree on super meat boy though because that's so it's hard to

836
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,326
introduce you like

837
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:50,687
and then if you want to play a game that is just about you know what was

838
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:52,668
still playing as please double start list are worse

839
00:35:53,128 --> 00:35:53,669
fantastic

840
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:54,669
and testing

841
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:56,090
really really great okay

842
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:57,830
case on the back

843
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:00,231
wonder those guys like those names so as to

844
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:05,470
Stimulation. Stimulation deals with stimulation.

845
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:10,013
So it deals with two factors.

846
00:36:10,093 --> 00:36:12,675
North-south is multiplayer versus solo play.

847
00:36:13,035 --> 00:36:15,477
At the high end of the score, this is people who enjoy raids,

848
00:36:16,337 --> 00:36:19,660
you know, 40-person groups are okay, and prefer to play with four or five people.

849
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,082
That's usually the kinds of numbers that you get for people with a high score on that.

850
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:26,084
And solo, of course, are like, people? Why are there people in my game?

851
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,226
So multiplayer. Multiplayer. Group of players. People who like other people.

852
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:34,936
A few ads there weren't there.

853
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:35,476
Yeah.

854
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:36,957
You guys are in the middle.

855
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,157
You guys are the scorers.

856
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:39,318
Solo players.

857
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:40,659
Me too.

858
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:41,739
Look around.

859
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:43,280
Boy, there's a lot.

860
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,081
You know why?

861
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:46,981
Yes, you know why.

862
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:48,142
Because we didn't have any friends.

863
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:52,064
OK.

864
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:56,465
But this is why we're trying to solve this problem.

865
00:36:56,486 --> 00:36:58,066
Why it's hard for us to understand multiplayer.

866
00:36:58,086 --> 00:36:58,446
OK.

867
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:00,167
Excitement versus serenity.

868
00:37:00,347 --> 00:37:00,947
It's exactly that.

869
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:02,188
It's boom versus we.

870
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:08,110
Excitement players. Excitement players. You like the thrill, the roller coaster.

871
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,310
Serenity. Serenity players.

872
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:14,012
A little more evenly split, but still, eh, some missing ones.

873
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:16,812
Again, not surprising. It fits our expectation. Yeah?

874
00:37:17,393 --> 00:37:20,294
We like excitement, because being in the games industry is...

875
00:37:21,474 --> 00:37:21,954
really hard.

876
00:37:22,454 --> 00:37:24,355
Um... OK.

877
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,376
So our multiplayer excitement player.

878
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:29,697
OK, likes lots of people and loves having a good time.

879
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:30,797
Yeah, that's gonna be Austin Powers.

880
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:35,248
Yeah, baby. Okay. For obvious reasons.

881
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:38,931
Our excitement solo player. The person who loves to

882
00:37:38,951 --> 00:37:40,712
have a great time, but really wants to just

883
00:37:40,752 --> 00:37:42,213
go alone. Well, we know this guy. That's the

884
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:44,975
lone wolf. That is, that is Wolverine. That is

885
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:46,016
Wolverine. Absolutely.

886
00:37:47,257 --> 00:37:50,239
The solo serenity player. The player who wants to

887
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:53,781
just play quietly by themself, alone, on their own

888
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:59,985
swamp planet. Is Yoda. Yoda. Excitement.

889
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:02,288
I'm not going to finish it.

890
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:02,569
OK.

891
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:03,589
I'm done.

892
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:04,530
I'm done with that.

893
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,110
Serenity.

894
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:07,051
Serenity multiplayer.

895
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:08,212
I like to play with people.

896
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:08,872
I love people.

897
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,033
People are the most important thing.

898
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:12,674
But I really just wish we could all just have a peaceful environment.

899
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:14,375
That's going to be Professor X.

900
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:15,016
Right?

901
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:20,739
Now, I point out that this, I use this as an example to say that serenity does not necessarily

902
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,839
mean won't kick your ass.

903
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:22,900
Right?

904
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,542
It just means that he would prefer to not kick your ass first.

905
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:27,623
Right?

906
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:28,743
OK.

907
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:29,884
So what games do these guys play?

908
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:35,908
Turns out Austin Powers is a big Call of Duty fan.

909
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:37,549
Multiplayer only.

910
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,172
Multiplayer only, right?

911
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:44,076
But he's also a big fan of a whole other genre,

912
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:48,240
which also fits completely in the excitement category,

913
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,722
which is Just Dance.

914
00:38:50,322 --> 00:38:50,542
Yeah.

915
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:54,046
Oh yeah, party game, perfect.

916
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:57,447
So he's split on those, right?

917
00:38:57,487 --> 00:39:00,789
Wolverine, also a big fan of Call of Duty.

918
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,869
Single player only.

919
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:06,971
And if he ever tries the multiplayer mode,

920
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,872
he's playing alone, right?

921
00:39:08,952 --> 00:39:12,093
He's maybe joining that, okay?

922
00:39:12,673 --> 00:39:14,914
Yoda, big fan of Flower.

923
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:16,532
It's perfect.

924
00:39:16,972 --> 00:39:19,213
Gentle, serene, single-player experience.

925
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:20,694
Ah, the words and the bees.

926
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:23,875
Serenity Multiplayer, a gentle, calm game

927
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,015
that involves other people.

928
00:39:28,057 --> 00:39:29,077
That's a tough one.

929
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:32,479
Second Life, maybe.

930
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:34,740
But it's kind of ew right now.

931
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,201
I mean, I don't mean that in a bad way.

932
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:38,761
I'm all for it, but still.

933
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:40,742
Maybe Animal Crossing.

934
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:42,875
Right? Maybe?

935
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,437
If you're playing with friends.

936
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:46,098
And so if you want to learn how to play,

937
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:48,100
if you want to learn how Professor Xavier likes to play,

938
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:49,701
you gotta play Animal Crossing,

939
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,083
but you gotta play with your friends, man.

940
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:54,306
You gotta set it up so you're all living in one town or something.

941
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:54,686
Okay?

942
00:39:55,607 --> 00:39:58,569
I often, people often mention Journey in this one, right?

943
00:39:58,609 --> 00:39:59,550
And Journey is right in the middle.

944
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,752
It's really odd. It's between solo and multiplayer.

945
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:02,913
And it's only ever two people.

946
00:40:03,474 --> 00:40:06,056
Okay? So don't, don't, don't confuse co-op for multiplayer.

947
00:40:06,076 --> 00:40:07,337
They're different. They're actually different things.

948
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:07,698
Okay?

949
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:12,853
So, I'm going to put that there. Those guys like that game. One more to go.

950
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:14,357
Doing pretty good.

951
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,985
Harmony. Harmony. Harmony deals with social interaction.

952
00:40:18,326 --> 00:40:19,288
How do we interact with each other?

953
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:22,109
The rules of engagement, so to speak.

954
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:23,810
So, team and PvP.

955
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,931
Team actually is not always, it's not just Team Deathmatch,

956
00:40:27,951 --> 00:40:29,192
although it is Team Deathmatch.

957
00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:31,713
I find that people who like to play multiplayer competitive games

958
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:33,413
will play this game in Team Deathmatch.

959
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:35,994
But it's also, I just want to feel that my contribution

960
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:37,254
is part of a larger contribution.

961
00:40:37,755 --> 00:40:38,695
Working with other people.

962
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:41,316
Whereas PvP people want you to lose.

963
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:43,697
Okay?

964
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:45,337
Want to win that way.

965
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:46,958
So, team. Team players.

966
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:49,819
I love you. You're my people.

967
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:51,853
PPP.

968
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:52,694
PPP.

969
00:40:53,214 --> 00:40:54,055
Oh, yeah, okay.

970
00:40:54,615 --> 00:40:56,437
Steve Marecki is a PPP player.

971
00:40:56,477 --> 00:40:57,418
I'm not surprised.

972
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:58,439
Okay.

973
00:40:58,459 --> 00:40:58,720
PPP players.

974
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,020
All right.

975
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,461
I thought that was funny.

976
00:41:00,481 --> 00:41:03,404
It was fewer of those than is often common.

977
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:04,385
It must be because of the psychology interest.

978
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:04,846
I don't know.

979
00:41:04,866 --> 00:41:05,586
Maybe you're a nicer bunch.

980
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:06,067
Who knows?

981
00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:06,567
I don't know.

982
00:41:06,587 --> 00:41:06,908
I don't know.

983
00:41:06,928 --> 00:41:07,228
I don't know.

984
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:07,488
I don't know.

985
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:07,829
I don't know.

986
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:08,329
I don't know.

987
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:08,830
I don't know.

988
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,290
I don't know.

989
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:09,550
I don't know.

990
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:09,831
I don't know.

991
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:10,211
I don't know.

992
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:10,511
I don't know.

993
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:10,892
I don't know.

994
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,292
I don't know.

995
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:14,109
That's my bias coming out, by the way.

996
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:16,211
I think team is important.

997
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:17,452
Context versus mechanics.

998
00:41:17,472 --> 00:41:19,794
This one is really, this one's really hard to find.

999
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:22,676
In fact, this is the difference between

1000
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:25,118
I want to understand how the game,

1001
00:41:25,638 --> 00:41:27,900
and what's important to me is that we're playing the rules,

1002
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,201
and that's all I care about.

1003
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:32,084
I care that I win or lose, and I care about the way that that system works.

1004
00:41:32,564 --> 00:41:34,065
Context is, I care about why.

1005
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:35,987
What's the world?

1006
00:41:36,207 --> 00:41:36,868
What's the people?

1007
00:41:37,468 --> 00:41:38,809
What's happening? Right?

1008
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:39,650
That's what I care about.

1009
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,642
Right? It's tough. This is a tough one. It's a tough one.

1010
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:47,445
Okay. So, the question to ask yourself is,

1011
00:41:48,446 --> 00:41:51,868
is if your favorite game that has a story...

1012
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:52,929
Well, I'm not going to go through that.

1013
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:53,990
Anyway, you guys are going to figure it out.

1014
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,811
Context! Context people!

1015
00:41:58,594 --> 00:41:59,114
Mechanics people.

1016
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:04,614
pretty evenly split. Not surprising. Not surprising. That's consistent. Games industry.

1017
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:10,137
Okay. So, who are our people? Team versus context. A team context player. Someone who

1018
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:13,298
wants to know why, right? And someone who's all about the team and positive. That's going

1019
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:17,881
to be Mickey Mouse. Okay? Mickey is always interested to hear what's going on with you.

1020
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:22,243
It's all good. And I'm specifically talking about the Kingdom Hearts 2 Mickey Mouse, by

1021
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:27,506
the way, who's a badass. I don't know if you've played that game. But King Mickey, man, I

1022
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:28,406
would not want to cross that guy.

1023
00:42:30,455 --> 00:42:31,616
but he'll come roaring to your defense.

1024
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:36,617
Context PvP. One versus one players who want to make sure that the other guy goes down

1025
00:42:36,938 --> 00:42:39,038
but cares very much about what's at stake and why.

1026
00:42:39,638 --> 00:42:40,599
That's going to be the Jedi.

1027
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,640
There are many Jedi that could fit this slot, but of course I picked Qui-Gon Jinn

1028
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,101
because he wears his hair the same way that I do.

1029
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:52,683
Makes him instantly more noble, yes.

1030
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,441
He's actually the gray side of the force, Qui-Gon.

1031
00:42:59,461 --> 00:43:00,041
That's why I like him.

1032
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:02,162
PVP and just mechanics.

1033
00:43:02,202 --> 00:43:03,023
Don't care why.

1034
00:43:03,183 --> 00:43:03,683
Don't care why.

1035
00:43:03,703 --> 00:43:04,444
I just want to beat you up.

1036
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:05,704
Really?

1037
00:43:06,104 --> 00:43:07,205
Just want an excuse to kill you.

1038
00:43:08,626 --> 00:43:09,426
Call me Snake.

1039
00:43:12,527 --> 00:43:15,269
Snake Plissken, who in order to care about a single human being

1040
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:18,510
had to have explosives planted in his neck tied

1041
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,471
to that person's heartbeat.

1042
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:20,911
And it was the President of the United States,

1043
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,512
I would remind you.

1044
00:43:23,332 --> 00:43:23,753
Snake Plissken.

1045
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:24,953
He still fucked him at the end, right?

1046
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:27,670
Oops, I swore in the States.

1047
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:29,031
Okay, um...

1048
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:36,698
Do you guys play Far Cry 3?

1049
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,663
Mechanics, mechanics team, team players who just want to get the job done

1050
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:43,885
and don't actually care that much about why, they really just at it.

1051
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:45,066
That's going to be Nick Fury.

1052
00:43:45,886 --> 00:43:45,966
Hi!

1053
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:48,480
who is all about the team, all about the world,

1054
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,580
all about what we're doing, right?

1055
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,320
But actually what's at stake, it's good to know,

1056
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,041
and he knows it, but really it's all about getting it done.

1057
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:53,981
Execution, soldier.

1058
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:55,661
Sport night, killer soldier.

1059
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:56,482
So what do they play?

1060
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:57,702
Whew, man.

1061
00:43:58,122 --> 00:44:00,543
So, Mickey's a tough one, and at the end of the day,

1062
00:44:00,843 --> 00:44:02,603
here is the, here is what I have learned.

1063
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:06,924
Team context people tend to fall in two categories,

1064
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:11,066
but it's really the same game with or without real human beings.

1065
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:11,126
Is.

1066
00:44:11,146 --> 00:44:11,186
Is.

1067
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:11,246
Is.

1068
00:44:11,706 --> 00:44:11,786
Is.

1069
00:44:11,846 --> 00:44:11,906
Is.

1070
00:44:11,946 --> 00:44:12,146
Is.

1071
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:12,346
Is.

1072
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:12,586
Is.

1073
00:44:12,646 --> 00:44:12,986
Is.

1074
00:44:13,006 --> 00:44:13,086
Is.

1075
00:44:13,106 --> 00:44:13,146
Is.

1076
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:13,206
Is.

1077
00:44:13,226 --> 00:44:13,286
Is.

1078
00:44:13,306 --> 00:44:13,346
Is.

1079
00:44:13,366 --> 00:44:13,406
Is.

1080
00:44:13,426 --> 00:44:13,466
Is.

1081
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:13,526
Is.

1082
00:44:13,546 --> 00:44:13,586
Is.

1083
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:13,646
Is.

1084
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:13,706
Is.

1085
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:13,766
Is.

1086
00:44:13,786 --> 00:44:13,826
Is.

1087
00:44:13,846 --> 00:44:13,886
Is.

1088
00:44:13,906 --> 00:44:13,946
Is.

1089
00:44:13,966 --> 00:44:14,006
Is.

1090
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:14,066
Is.

1091
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:14,126
Is.

1092
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:14,186
Is.

1093
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:14,727
Is.

1094
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:17,807
and then RPGs in an MMO setting.

1095
00:44:17,827 --> 00:44:21,748
Uh, and you can look at the extra version,

1096
00:44:22,288 --> 00:44:24,389
the stuff, I remember multiplayer versus solo,

1097
00:44:24,489 --> 00:44:26,630
to find out which one of these are going to fall into, right?

1098
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:30,371
But in an RPG, we are doing a thing, generally, right?

1099
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:31,791
And if you don't like other people,

1100
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:34,752
you have all these fake people that we are doing things with,

1101
00:44:35,232 --> 00:44:36,753
which is great! I love them!

1102
00:44:36,793 --> 00:44:38,233
This is why I played them all in my life.

1103
00:44:38,714 --> 00:44:41,114
Um, okay, uh, context PvP,

1104
00:44:41,154 --> 00:44:42,095
I want to hunt you down and kill you,

1105
00:44:42,155 --> 00:44:43,995
and I'm going to try, that's going to be EVE Online.

1106
00:44:46,072 --> 00:44:46,172
OK.

1107
00:44:47,113 --> 00:44:47,553
Great setting.

1108
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:49,355
Can you imagine Qui-Gon playing Eve?

1109
00:44:50,936 --> 00:44:51,917
It's really easy for me.

1110
00:44:52,117 --> 00:44:52,678
I really can.

1111
00:44:52,698 --> 00:44:54,740
I really, it's just not much of a stretch.

1112
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,403
PVP mechanics, PVP versus mechanics.

1113
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,085
It's going to be Quake, Quake 3 Arena.

1114
00:45:01,144 --> 00:45:03,106
Real deathmatch, not team deathmatch.

1115
00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:05,007
Real deathmatch, right?

1116
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,729
One V. One, one winner.

1117
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,789
That style of deathmatch.

1118
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:11,332
That is all Snake plays, and that's awesome.

1119
00:45:11,492 --> 00:45:11,953
That's what he does.

1120
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,995
And then team, where the mechanics are really the whole thing

1121
00:45:15,035 --> 00:45:16,236
and really just playing the game.

1122
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:17,717
It's gonna be League of Legends.

1123
00:45:18,478 --> 00:45:20,740
Nick is a gigantic League of Legends fan.

1124
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,902
He's level 30, and he's moving up in the leaderboards.

1125
00:45:24,543 --> 00:45:25,624
But he does curse a lot.

1126
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:28,706
He really is getting downvoted a great deal.

1127
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:30,047
Okay.

1128
00:45:31,664 --> 00:45:36,206
Top, sort of context, sort of team games, Little Big Planet.

1129
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:38,707
PvP, pure PvP games is gonna be like Street Fighter.

1130
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:40,067
These are kind of examples that they can agree on.

1131
00:45:40,308 --> 00:45:41,668
Okay, so I'm gonna put that there.

1132
00:45:42,108 --> 00:45:44,669
Okay, that's it. That's my chart.

1133
00:45:44,929 --> 00:45:46,070
That's what I've done. That's the work.

1134
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,750
That's the last year of my frickin' life.

1135
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:50,771
That and the game that I'm working on.

1136
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:53,052
Okay, so, Dan Hay. You remember Dan Hay.

1137
00:45:53,212 --> 00:45:55,573
I'm Dan Hay. Hi. I'm Dan Hay.

1138
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:57,334
I love Dan, by the way.

1139
00:45:57,814 --> 00:45:59,314
He's gonna murder me if he sees this talk.

1140
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,369
I do love him. I love you, Dan. Please don't kill me.

1141
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:03,590
Uh...

1142
00:46:04,871 --> 00:46:05,371
What's it good for?

1143
00:46:07,352 --> 00:46:08,053
Well, Dan,

1144
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:10,495
we all have these empathy blind spots,

1145
00:46:10,755 --> 00:46:12,796
you see. We have these spots in our brain

1146
00:46:12,816 --> 00:46:14,538
where we don't naturally understand other human beings.

1147
00:46:14,618 --> 00:46:16,559
And because we're designers, that's not OK.

1148
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,981
We're not allowed to live our life that way.

1149
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:20,302
It's just not cool.

1150
00:46:21,338 --> 00:46:25,079
So, we have this map that shows us about all the different types of humanity.

1151
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:31,040
And it's specifically what they care about the most in games, as a place to start.

1152
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,061
It's a place to get started. There's more detail in here.

1153
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:35,601
You can use other psychological systems, and there's lots of that.

1154
00:46:35,621 --> 00:46:37,722
But this is, you know, I'm trying to boil this down to a place to start.

1155
00:46:38,102 --> 00:46:41,983
So as an example, if I were to take my scores, this is me.

1156
00:46:42,223 --> 00:46:46,343
I am a 20 Stark Hermione Granger Wolverine Mickey Mouse.

1157
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:52,123
I'm kind of a bad ass.

1158
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:04,388
Right?

1159
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,609
And the thing is, it's actually really true.

1160
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:09,290
It's really, when I see these scores, I'm like,

1161
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:11,350
yeah, actually, that's really how I play.

1162
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:12,591
I play like those people. I really do.

1163
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:15,612
So, that's me.

1164
00:47:16,908 --> 00:47:17,308
That's me.

1165
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:22,172
That is the reduction of the most important facets of the Big Five

1166
00:47:22,212 --> 00:47:26,395
into a single 4x4 chart that indicates 16 player archetypes.

1167
00:47:27,316 --> 00:47:30,658
So that, if Tim Schafer ever decided to make a game for me,

1168
00:47:31,499 --> 00:47:33,160
and I sure hope he does, because he's...

1169
00:47:34,241 --> 00:47:36,223
and he does, he has consistently, he will understand me.

1170
00:47:37,324 --> 00:47:38,805
Help me develop accurate empathy.

1171
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:41,567
The important part in that little grid are not the colors.

1172
00:47:42,387 --> 00:47:43,088
They're the blank spots.

1173
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:46,690
The blank spots are your guide to your homework.

1174
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,231
Should you choose to accept it, please do.

1175
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:50,631
Make us a better industry.

1176
00:47:52,972 --> 00:47:57,233
So those games, play those games like those people.

1177
00:47:57,613 --> 00:47:58,453
Remember player acting?

1178
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:01,554
Play those games like you were those people.

1179
00:48:02,155 --> 00:48:04,655
Play those games as though you were those people.

1180
00:48:05,536 --> 00:48:07,096
Play these games as though you were those people

1181
00:48:07,116 --> 00:48:08,276
if you want to understand stimulation.

1182
00:48:08,497 --> 00:48:10,077
If you want to understand harmony, play these games

1183
00:48:10,977 --> 00:48:11,557
as those people.

1184
00:48:11,718 --> 00:48:12,538
There are other games.

1185
00:48:14,218 --> 00:48:15,579
I recommend you play good and bad ones.

1186
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:16,760
In fact, I learn more from the bad ones

1187
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,500
than I do from the good ones.

1188
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:18,661
Okay.

1189
00:48:19,321 --> 00:48:19,481
So...

1190
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:24,604
I have 256 player types for you.

1191
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,245
Memorize them all!

1192
00:48:28,094 --> 00:48:29,375
The thing is, it doesn't actually matter.

1193
00:48:30,055 --> 00:48:32,496
Player types, it's a, it's a mnemonic for us

1194
00:48:32,516 --> 00:48:34,077
to kind of begin to memorize, right.

1195
00:48:35,058 --> 00:48:40,060
And the point is, that number, 256, it begins,

1196
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,162
it begins to feel right to me as an estimation

1197
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:45,103
for the kind of variety that I see in this room,

1198
00:48:45,243 --> 00:48:47,384
and the kind of variety that I understand in my daily life,

1199
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,085
and the kind of variety I see in the human species.

1200
00:48:49,105 --> 00:48:49,885
OK.

1201
00:48:50,725 --> 00:48:53,527
It isn't enough for us to be designing our games from

1202
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:57,111
from small selections and large divisions.

1203
00:48:57,371 --> 00:48:59,471
It's, it works. I'm not saying don't do it.

1204
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:02,092
I'm not, I put those other models in there

1205
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:04,532
because I revere the people who have, who have done them, right?

1206
00:49:04,732 --> 00:49:06,613
They are also useful, because they are talking about

1207
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,133
things that divide nicely into four things.

1208
00:49:09,213 --> 00:49:11,634
But if you want to understand human beings

1209
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:14,595
as a race, as a, as a species, right?

1210
00:49:14,615 --> 00:49:15,595
If you want to understand that,

1211
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:18,095
you need to have a number kinda like that.

1212
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:21,205
100, more than 100 types.

1213
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:25,488
Okay, because we are an incredibly varied group.

1214
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:26,969
There are things that we agree on.

1215
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,031
And this is where I'm gonna be going in the future.

1216
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:30,172
There are things that we agree on.

1217
00:49:30,212 --> 00:49:32,153
Self-determination theory is a great example

1218
00:49:32,274 --> 00:49:33,995
of the kinds of motivations that we all have.

1219
00:49:34,636 --> 00:49:36,117
Mastery, we all wanna get better.

1220
00:49:36,257 --> 00:49:38,739
Autonomy, we all wanna be free, et cetera.

1221
00:49:38,919 --> 00:49:40,060
Relatedness, we all wanna know where we are.

1222
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,301
But that's for later.

1223
00:49:41,721 --> 00:49:44,804
So, this is a map to help you develop accurate empathy

1224
00:49:45,204 --> 00:49:46,565
so that you can make great games.

1225
00:49:47,426 --> 00:49:48,247
So that I can play them.

1226
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:49,648
Okay.

1227
00:49:51,932 --> 00:49:54,633
So, what's next? What's next for me?

1228
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:57,275
More focused quantitative study.

1229
00:49:57,335 --> 00:49:59,776
The numbers that I gave you were done at the domain level.

1230
00:50:00,076 --> 00:50:02,277
The studies that we did was just a rough shot

1231
00:50:02,317 --> 00:50:03,978
to see if there was any validity to the theory.

1232
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:05,539
There is validity to the theory.

1233
00:50:05,899 --> 00:50:07,960
So I'm going to continue to drill down

1234
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,283
and create tests that validate more deeply.

1235
00:50:12,963 --> 00:50:14,064
And the other one,

1236
00:50:14,084 --> 00:50:15,725
remember this question, what's it good for?

1237
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:17,245
I've started hitting this new question

1238
00:50:17,285 --> 00:50:18,866
because now people, I think, I'm excited

1239
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:20,287
because I get positive feedback.

1240
00:50:20,307 --> 00:50:22,028
People are starting to use it. They're excited about it.

1241
00:50:22,248 --> 00:50:24,329
But I start getting asked this other new weird question.

1242
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,150
Well, are you using it on your game?

1243
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:28,252
Are you using it on your game?

1244
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:31,743
Yes I am.

1245
00:50:33,404 --> 00:50:34,644
I am going to use this on my game.

1246
00:50:34,724 --> 00:50:36,305
But here's the thing. So are you.

1247
00:50:37,186 --> 00:50:39,727
Everyone's doing this. We all use this every day.

1248
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:41,688
This is not a checklist. It's not a tool.

1249
00:50:41,988 --> 00:50:43,569
Psychology will not be that.

1250
00:50:43,689 --> 00:50:45,651
It's not going to be something that's going to be proven.

1251
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:49,513
Okay? I'm not going to give you a tool that you can just say,

1252
00:50:49,553 --> 00:50:51,834
Yep, I should use the big five, and my sales will go up.

1253
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:53,995
Not gonna happen. Doesn't work that way.

1254
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:56,677
Psychology. Human psychology.

1255
00:50:57,562 --> 00:51:02,366
Developing empathy is a way of improving you as a designer.

1256
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:05,128
And you, as a better designer,

1257
00:51:06,008 --> 00:51:08,690
will naturally make your game better.

1258
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,112
Does it work? Of course it works.

1259
00:51:11,892 --> 00:51:12,693
Of course it works.

1260
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:17,096
You can do what I've done with any psychological theory of merit.

1261
00:51:17,956 --> 00:51:18,197
Okay?

1262
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,418
They all count.

1263
00:51:21,399 --> 00:51:23,721
My message is, develop yourself.

1264
00:51:25,322 --> 00:51:26,202
Because it's your job.

1265
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,381
You took the entertainer's covenant.

1266
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:33,964
You owe it to your audience to understand them.

1267
00:51:34,305 --> 00:51:35,666
And you can choose to not.

1268
00:51:37,247 --> 00:51:39,709
I will preempt the first question that I know I'm going to be asked,

1269
00:51:39,749 --> 00:51:43,593
which is, well, isn't this just a checklist in order to make sure that you can cover the whole base

1270
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:45,314
and make every game the same? No, it's not.

1271
00:51:46,255 --> 00:51:49,418
I'm giving you the tools to choose who you want to make your game for

1272
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:53,201
so that you're not making that choice accidentally or randomly.

1273
00:51:55,285 --> 00:51:56,767
which is the danger. That's when you fail.

1274
00:51:56,787 --> 00:51:58,869
That's when you accidentally make a game for a

1275
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,010
different group than you wanted to.

1276
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,554
That's my talk. Thanks for coming. Appreciate it.

1277
00:52:14,414 --> 00:52:15,955
We've got about 10 minutes for Q&A.

1278
00:52:16,035 --> 00:52:20,216
Please fill out your reviews for the thing.

1279
00:52:20,276 --> 00:52:22,797
Please, you're going to get an email for about stuff.

1280
00:52:22,817 --> 00:52:24,717
Please tell them that I was terrible, and then I

1281
00:52:24,738 --> 00:52:25,118
won't come back.

1282
00:52:26,598 --> 00:52:28,519
And you should turn off all your cell phones, because

1283
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:29,779
it'll mess with my microphone.

1284
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:31,480
I should have said that before.

1285
00:52:33,871 --> 00:52:35,692
Dang, okay, so Q&A, go!

1286
00:52:36,593 --> 00:52:37,433
Right in the mic, thank you, yes.

1287
00:52:37,453 --> 00:52:38,614
Is this working? Alright.

1288
00:52:38,954 --> 00:52:40,375
Thank you so much, this was really informative.

1289
00:52:41,015 --> 00:52:42,416
I loved all the list of games you had.

1290
00:52:42,436 --> 00:52:44,377
I have a feeling there's about

1291
00:52:45,057 --> 00:52:46,538
10 billion more games than you just listed.

1292
00:52:46,979 --> 00:52:49,000
Do you have like a more extensive list,

1293
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,661
or have you thought about crowdsourcing out, like,

1294
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,882
hey, help me identify all these games, because I don't have time

1295
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:54,163
to play all these games, and you don't, so.

1296
00:52:54,623 --> 00:52:58,246
That is actually, in fact, I asked my Twitter,

1297
00:52:58,606 --> 00:52:59,927
I'm trying to figure out Twitter,

1298
00:53:00,348 --> 00:53:03,030
and Brian Green said, actually,

1299
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,211
oh no, it wasn't Brian, it was Roy Foster.

1300
00:53:04,271 --> 00:53:05,592
He said, you know what you should do,

1301
00:53:05,612 --> 00:53:08,875
is you should ask Twitter about games for all of your types.

1302
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:11,097
So, yes, I think it's a brilliant idea.

1303
00:53:11,537 --> 00:53:12,378
This is my initial list.

1304
00:53:12,418 --> 00:53:14,780
I just wanted to have a template to get you guys started,

1305
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,803
but I would love to see it go wider,

1306
00:53:18,003 --> 00:53:18,763
get a longer list.

1307
00:53:19,164 --> 00:53:19,324
Go ahead.

1308
00:53:20,258 --> 00:53:21,879
Thank you for the talk, it was amazing.

1309
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:27,282
Have you done any research into the proportions of players that fit into those different categories?

1310
00:53:27,442 --> 00:53:32,425
So, the proportions of humanity that fits into those categories is that it's 25% in each category.

1311
00:53:34,236 --> 00:53:36,497
because that's how the Big Five was built.

1312
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:38,798
The Big Five was built to be a standard distribution

1313
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:41,318
across all p- across all populations,

1314
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,539
which is why I'm so excited about using it

1315
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:44,980
as a foundation for this research, right?

1316
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,820
Because we know right from the get-go that that's humanity.

1317
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,441
As far as players go,

1318
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:50,121
don't have any data on that right now.

1319
00:53:50,442 --> 00:53:51,222
Um, I would love to.

1320
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:52,502
That would be a really cool study, right?

1321
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:53,363
That would be really super neat.

1322
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:55,803
Um...yeah.

1323
00:53:56,644 --> 00:53:57,164
Ha ha ha ha.

1324
00:53:57,704 --> 00:53:58,945
So we're...that would be kind of cool.

1325
00:53:58,965 --> 00:54:00,505
Like, we could do that, in fact.

1326
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:05,436
Do you have any tips for turning off the designer portion of your brain

1327
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:10,000
in order to do this research? Because every time I play a game I sit down and go,

1328
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,163
oh, I can't beat this puzzle. And I go, oh wait, think like a designer. Oh, there it is.

1329
00:54:13,724 --> 00:54:17,648
And so, yeah. Incoming across that in your person.

1330
00:54:17,668 --> 00:54:19,430
Yes, I can give you a few tips. Drink.

1331
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:24,395
Okay. Play drunk.

1332
00:54:27,452 --> 00:54:28,233
Actually, not kidding.

1333
00:54:28,653 --> 00:54:30,673
So, yeah.

1334
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:32,414
And distract yourself in a variety of ways.

1335
00:54:32,454 --> 00:54:33,434
Play with the radio on.

1336
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:33,815
I don't know.

1337
00:54:34,395 --> 00:54:35,095
Yeah.

1338
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:35,875
And practice.

1339
00:54:36,095 --> 00:54:37,036
Practice, practice, practice.

1340
00:54:37,056 --> 00:54:38,516
You just get better at it as you do it.

1341
00:54:38,816 --> 00:54:40,577
I was hard at first, and it gets easier.

1342
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:41,437
It's a skill.

1343
00:54:41,497 --> 00:54:42,118
It's actually a skill.

1344
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:43,638
And it's a skill that I continue to do.

1345
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:44,698
I continue to practice.

1346
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:46,839
So it's a long-term study.

1347
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,760
Yeah, but drinking first is a great place to start.

1348
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,240
Absolutely.

1349
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:51,941
I advocate that thoroughly.

1350
00:54:52,141 --> 00:54:52,361
Okay.

1351
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:52,981
Are we good?

1352
00:54:53,842 --> 00:54:54,222
Thank you all.

1353
00:54:54,702 --> 00:54:54,962
Take care.

1354
00:55:02,254 --> 00:55:02,600
Oh, it's okay?
