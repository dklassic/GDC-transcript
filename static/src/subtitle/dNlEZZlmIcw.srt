1
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:09,559
Okay, I think it's four o'clock, so it's about time to start.

2
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:11,920
First, I wanna say thank you so much for coming today.

3
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:13,121
It's great to see you all.

4
00:00:14,142 --> 00:00:16,002
Before we begin, I've been asked to remind you all

5
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:18,284
to please mute your phones if you'd be so kind,

6
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:20,825
and also to fill out the surveys,

7
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,546
which I believe they're gonna email to you

8
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:23,606
at the end of this talk.

9
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:31,810
So I'm guessing that most people sitting here in the audience are either producers or project managers or that way inclined in some way.

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,372
So who better than a room full of production people to appreciate the goodness of a post-mortem, right?

11
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:41,193
So any feedback you have for me, good or bad, I would really appreciate it.

12
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:44,575
And that goes for all the speakers here at GDC, so thank you in advance for that.

13
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:49,356
So with all that business out of the way, I just want to say welcome to Upshield Creek.

14
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:52,713
Pro tips for managing the unmanageable project.

15
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:56,035
I gotta give a little shout out to the GDC advisory board

16
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:57,296
for letting me use that title

17
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:58,637
because I was not entirely sure

18
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:00,778
they would find it quite as amusing as I did,

19
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:02,600
but I gotta keep it real

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,521
because this is GDC and it's production.

21
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:08,363
So before we begin, I wanna take a moment

22
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:11,406
to frame the discussion a little bit around what I mean

23
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:14,608
when I'm talking about the unmanageable project.

24
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:18,270
Just a small aside, I think Melissa McCarthy is spicy

25
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,291
is gonna keep me alive for the next four years.

26
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,451
That's how I'm gonna survive.

27
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:26,054
So I wanna frame the conversation a little bit

28
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:27,474
around what I mean when I'm talking about

29
00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:28,695
the unmanageable project.

30
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:30,876
Because it could be an entire game project,

31
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:32,977
or it could be a piece of a project.

32
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:34,738
It could be a critical feature

33
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:37,059
that needs to go out really quickly.

34
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,880
It could be a piece of the content pipeline

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,621
that's really screwed up and is potentially

36
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,862
dragging down the schedule of the entire project.

37
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:48,722
Or it could be a demo, like a demo for GDC, for example.

38
00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:51,183
I'm sure a lot of you have had demo deadlines

39
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:53,803
that you've been dealing with, or E3, or PACS.

40
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,984
So it could be any one of a number of things.

41
00:01:57,944 --> 00:02:01,005
But in the context of the unmanageable project,

42
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,826
it usually tends to meet three additional criteria.

43
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:08,063
So one is that these projects tend to be high risk

44
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:11,045
and therefore present a clear opportunity for failure.

45
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,026
I know a lot of you probably think,

46
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,607
well, all projects present a clear opportunity for failure,

47
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:16,948
but that's not necessarily true.

48
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:18,649
I've been on a lot of projects where

49
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:23,311
it's not the end of the world if you're a little bit late

50
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:24,992
or if you're a little bit over budget,

51
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:27,093
but in some cases, it is the end of the world.

52
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:32,955
So another hallmark is that they're often heavily resource

53
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:33,635
constrained.

54
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,177
And in the context of this particular conversation,

55
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:38,478
the resource I'm talking about specifically is time.

56
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,119
Because you can always add people,

57
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,280
you can always add budget.

58
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,781
But when you can't add time, sometimes that

59
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:45,643
presents a particular set of challenges.

60
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:51,606
And there are also clear consequences for failure.

61
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:54,708
So this could be anything from you

62
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:56,189
don't launch the project on time,

63
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:57,290
you might not get a promotion.

64
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:00,489
or maybe your team won't get their bonus,

65
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,071
or maybe your team will be fired,

66
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:05,154
or maybe the project will be defunded.

67
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:07,677
So there's usually pretty clear consequences

68
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:10,640
to a project going sideways of this type.

69
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:16,100
So if you haven't already been handed one of these,

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,423
I just have to say brace yourself

71
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:20,386
because if you spend any amount of time

72
00:03:20,446 --> 00:03:21,507
in the games industry,

73
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:24,391
you will be put in charge of one of these projects,

74
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,834
a chaotic project with a crazy deadline,

75
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:29,517
and it's gonna be your job to get it back on track.

76
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:30,558
So that's the bad news.

77
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:35,460
The good news is I've spent many years of my career running these kinds of projects,

78
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,022
and I have to say, in my experience, there's always a way to figure out how to get a project

79
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:44,723
back on track, as long as you're willing to adopt a particular mindset to make that happen.

80
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:48,944
And that mindset, I also want to add, does not always necessarily involve crunch.

81
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:51,205
So we'll talk about that a little bit later.

82
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:55,235
So this is probably a good point to introduce myself.

83
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,216
My name is Amy Dallas.

84
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:58,216
I'm one of the co-founders of Clutch Play Games

85
00:03:58,276 --> 00:03:59,176
out of Portland, Oregon.

86
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:01,257
I'm also on the board of directors of OGO,

87
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:03,238
which is the Oregon Games Organization.

88
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:05,398
And this year, I'm also excited to say

89
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,779
I'm on the advisory committee

90
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,739
for the Austin Games Conference.

91
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,540
So if anybody has any interesting production talks

92
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,481
you wanna present there, come and see me.

93
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,101
That's in late September,

94
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:17,222
and I hope to see a lot of you there

95
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:18,442
because it's gonna be a really cool show.

96
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:20,923
So.

97
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:28,252
little bit about Clutchblade. So we're an indie dev studio. As I mentioned, we're up in

98
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:33,455
Portland. We're all a bunch of AAA vets who used to live down in the Bay Area. We came from

99
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:40,980
studios like EA Sports, EA Games, Maxis, 2K, Stormfront, NG MoCo, DNA. So we all have a lot of

100
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,402
big game experience.

101
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:47,165
And we moved to Portland in search of affordable housing,

102
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:51,669
reasonable commutes, really good beer, wine, and coffee.

103
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:54,131
So what more do you want in life but those things?

104
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:57,594
But there isn't a lot of games industry up there.

105
00:04:57,694 --> 00:05:00,056
So we mainly work with companies down here.

106
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:04,119
And we're kind of known as like a SEAL team of development.

107
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,482
We get brought into projects that have a particular set

108
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:08,803
of needs that are really challenging.

109
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:09,944
And we basically like,

110
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:12,346
dive off the ship with a knife in the mouth,

111
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:13,727
then we go take care of business,

112
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:16,749
and then we get out and go on to another project.

113
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,611
So because all of us have a lot of

114
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,653
games industry experience and AAA experience,

115
00:05:22,853 --> 00:05:24,654
we're pretty unfazed by difficult projects,

116
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:25,395
and we all like them,

117
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:27,516
but I'd say of everyone on my team,

118
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:28,757
I like these projects the most.

119
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:36,698
And this is actually something that I never really thought I was going to like doing,

120
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:39,680
because, you know, who wakes up as a kid and goes, you know what I want to do?

121
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,803
I want to run a bunch of really shitty, hard projects for my entire career.

122
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:45,865
Nobody actually says that when they start out in games.

123
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:51,950
But for me, my love of really crazy projects began on The Sims 2 quite a long time ago.

124
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,731
So when I came onto that project,

125
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:56,354
I was put in charge of the animation pipeline.

126
00:05:56,714 --> 00:06:01,819
And I did not know this, but several producers had run screaming from that particular pipeline

127
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:04,322
before me because it was pretty messed up.

128
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:08,646
It was functionally months behind all the rest of the other discipline groups, and every

129
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:12,089
day they got more behind, and so it was my job to fix it.

130
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,173
And at points that seemed really, really impossible.

131
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,663
And so I had to come up with some creative ways

132
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:20,504
on how to do that.

133
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:22,505
I'll talk about at least one of those a little later on.

134
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,127
That could be a whole talk in and of itself.

135
00:06:24,227 --> 00:06:27,350
But at the end, kind of amazingly,

136
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,392
we went from being the team that was most behind

137
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:31,293
to the team that actually,

138
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,215
we were the only ones who finished a week early.

139
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,858
So that was kind of an amazing accomplishment,

140
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,359
and it really showed me, wow,

141
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,760
even though something seems impossible,

142
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:41,122
there is a way around it.

143
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:42,403
You can actually fix it.

144
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:45,386
But for me personally, I was like, fuck it.

145
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:46,527
This is terrible.

146
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:47,688
This is an absolutely,

147
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:50,331
like the most painful project I've ever been on.

148
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,152
I'm gonna leave games, I'm gonna move to Portland,

149
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,854
and that's gonna be the end of my life in games.

150
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:56,535
And something really interesting happens.

151
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:58,476
I bet a lot of you will know this if you've ever

152
00:06:58,596 --> 00:06:59,456
tried to leave games.

153
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:00,436
It's like the mafia.

154
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:01,957
You never really are able to leave.

155
00:07:02,017 --> 00:07:03,117
It sucks you back in.

156
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,598
And I think one of the reasons for that

157
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:08,839
is when you work in the games industry for any length of time,

158
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,140
it kind of perverts your brain in a very specific way,

159
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,221
such that when you try to live like a normal person, that

160
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,241
just feels really weird and boring.

161
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:21,063
So when I moved to Portland and there were no game jobs,

162
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:24,065
I went up there and I started working for web dev

163
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:25,926
and software dev and app dev companies,

164
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:27,987
and I thought, oh, this will be great.

165
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:30,569
And I really had a hard time with it

166
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:32,810
because it was so incredibly boring.

167
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:36,745
I've come to think of this as like the Hurt Locker effect.

168
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:40,347
So I don't know if you guys remember that scene from the Hurt Locker if you've watched

169
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:47,191
that movie, but he's a bomb defusing specialist and he's used to things blowing up all the

170
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:51,393
time and everything's crazy and then he comes home and has this existential crisis in the

171
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:55,495
middle of the grocery store because the hardest decision he has is I have to pick out cereal

172
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:58,997
and there's too much cereal and that felt really weird to him and that's how I felt.

173
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:05,541
And so to combat that, I became the person who specialized in taking on the scariest,

174
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:11,025
most painful, high-stakes projects. And the job I had right before I came back to games was

175
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:16,249
literally a job where people would bring their projects to us and say,

176
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:18,111
if you can't fix this, I'll be fired.

177
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:23,055
So super fun, super fun client interactions there.

178
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:26,238
But because I took on a lot of these projects,

179
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,360
I've spent many years teaching people

180
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,002
how to run these kinds of projects.

181
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,485
So in doing so, I've noticed that

182
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:36,348
in order to be successful, in my experience,

183
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:41,410
It does, as I mentioned, involve adopting a certain mindset.

184
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,392
So I want to talk about three elements of that mindset

185
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:45,773
and the skills around that.

186
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:49,416
And those are fear management, expectation management,

187
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:50,657
and chaos management.

188
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:56,441
Let's talk about fear first.

189
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:02,165
So I think fear management is a really interesting part

190
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,686
of the project management and production process.

191
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:10,186
Because in order to believe, in order to take on a project

192
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:13,748
that's in really bad shape or is particularly challenging

193
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:17,871
in some way, you have to believe first that it's possible.

194
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:20,513
You have to really internalize that there is a way

195
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:24,496
to solve that problem and that you are gonna be the person

196
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:26,178
who figures out how to do that.

197
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:29,254
So that takes a huge amount of confidence,

198
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:31,418
and I gotta say, it's really hard to maintain

199
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,301
that level of confidence when you're staring down

200
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:34,703
the barrel of potential failure,

201
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,987
and these projects always have an element

202
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,329
of potential failure about them.

203
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:45,305
And so I think it's kind of interesting that we as an industry don't really talk about fear that much.

204
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,749
And that's that seems weird to me because fear is is legit.

205
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:52,031
It's up there with death and spiders apparently.

206
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:59,658
I think it's actually just as a side note really funny that public speaking is higher than death in the list of human fears.

207
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:06,465
So maybe factor that into your surveys when you're thinking about I am facing a fear greater than death as we speak.

208
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:12,870
But the thing about fear of failure is it can be really paralyzing.

209
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,293
I don't know if you guys have ever been in that situation, but I certainly have been

210
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:19,296
in points where I think, oh my gosh, this really might not work.

211
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:22,598
I'm shutting down because I just don't even know what to do next.

212
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:24,580
We've probably all been in that situation.

213
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,990
So I think it's really funny that we don't talk about it more.

214
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,272
We're willing to talk about stress, but where does stress come from?

215
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,813
Well, often it comes from fear.

216
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:36,936
It comes from fear that you're going to fail, that you're going to lose your job,

217
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:39,857
that you're not good enough, that you don't have the skills, that people

218
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:41,839
aren't going to support you, all these different things.

219
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,463
So why is it that we don't talk about fear in the world of production?

220
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,562
Well I think often we don't talk about it

221
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,984
because quite frankly this is a really competitive industry

222
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:57,967
and it's definitely got a survival of the fittest vibe

223
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:01,129
and so admitting anything other than pure perfect confidence

224
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,771
is often, we fear it's gonna be perceived as weakness.

225
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:09,476
So also, we can be kind of concerned

226
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:12,338
that admitting any kind of weakness or fear in a project

227
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,780
will create a perception that we're somehow

228
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,142
unworthy of the job.

229
00:11:16,162 --> 00:11:18,143
It's a disqualifying thing.

230
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,958
And last but not least, I found this with mentoring

231
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:23,239
a lot of producers, a lot of people,

232
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,000
when they're freaked out about a project,

233
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,661
they don't want to admit it because they think

234
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:29,363
there's something wrong with them, that they're so nervous,

235
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:33,025
because they look at other people who look so calm,

236
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:35,847
and they think, oh God, they're so calm,

237
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:38,328
and I'm a wreck inside, so something must be wrong with me.

238
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,291
And there's a good reason for that.

239
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:45,653
Often, as producers, we kind of have to front a lot.

240
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:50,054
We're always under a lot of pressure to play it cool and calm, especially in the face of

241
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:55,237
chaos, and this is never more true than when you're running a really high-risk, high-stakes

242
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:55,777
project.

243
00:11:56,698 --> 00:12:00,940
It's not unlike the role that a flight attendant plays on a really turbulent flight.

244
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:05,963
In fact, on my way down here from Portland, as we were coming into San Francisco, we had

245
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:10,346
like 20 minutes of really terrifying turbulence, and the first thing I did was look at the

246
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:10,986
flight attendant.

247
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:12,047
I'm like, okay, she's calm.

248
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,182
It's cool, because I'm a nervous flyer.

249
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:15,643
But if she looked in any way scared,

250
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:20,546
I'd be reaching under my seat to get the flotation device.

251
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:24,929
You do need to have that sort of center point of calm.

252
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,490
And that's often the role that we're in,

253
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,651
whether we feel it or not.

254
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:32,354
So feeling fear and looking at other people

255
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:35,556
who don't seem to feel fear, that

256
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:38,519
is not necessarily indicative of the fact

257
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,000
that they're not feeling it also.

258
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:44,922
But there's actually another reason why someone might not

259
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:46,423
appear to feel fear.

260
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,543
And that could be that they might

261
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:51,404
be suffering from a cognitive bias known as Dunning-Kruger

262
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:51,824
effect.

263
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:53,264
And I don't know how many of you have ever

264
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:54,284
heard of Dunning-Kruger effect.

265
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:56,665
If you've not heard of it, go look that shit up tonight.

266
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:57,725
You will not regret it.

267
00:12:57,805 --> 00:12:59,486
It is really, really interesting.

268
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,226
When I first heard of it, I'm like, wow,

269
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:02,606
there's an actual name for that?

270
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,706
That is really cool.

271
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:05,987
So Dunning-Kruger effect is actually

272
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:08,488
the result of a study from David Dunning and Justin

273
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:10,508
Kruger in the Department of Psychology

274
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:11,648
at Cornell University.

275
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:16,991
And according to their study, they found that low ability individuals can often overestimate

276
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:22,333
their skills and abilities, whereas paradoxically, they also found that high ability individuals

277
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:25,555
often underestimate their skills and abilities.

278
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:30,577
That's often where imposter syndrome comes from, is people underestimating what they're

279
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:31,918
actually capable of doing.

280
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:36,638
So the fact that you might be dealing with some fear

281
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:40,421
on your project or self-doubt isn't necessarily the sign

282
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:41,382
that something's wrong with you.

283
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:44,445
It often is a sign that you're actually pretty smart,

284
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:45,546
that you know what you're doing.

285
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,428
In fact, not too long ago, my team and I were actually

286
00:13:48,648 --> 00:13:51,030
in what you would arguably say was the pitch meeting

287
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,693
of a lifetime with a pretty major company

288
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:57,476
on a project that we really wanted to land.

289
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:02,100
And they have a very ambitious timeline and scope.

290
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:07,356
And so after laying all that out for us, the VP in the room turned to me and said,

291
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:10,637
well, Amy, as the producer, are you scared by anything you heard?

292
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:13,518
And my two business partners were sitting across the table from me,

293
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:16,979
like beaming thoughts into my head going, don't screw this up, don't screw this up.

294
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,100
Cuz they were really worried I was gonna say the wrong thing.

295
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,300
And I said the only thing that I could say, which was.

296
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:24,257
little worried, a little scared.

297
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:26,359
Sure, there's a lot of things that are scary about this.

298
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,743
And instantly, I got a lot of head nods of approval.

299
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:31,565
Like, yes, that is fair enough.

300
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,008
And so we ended up talking about some of the things

301
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:36,030
that I found scary about what they were trying to do

302
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,233
and how we would work around those

303
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:40,055
and how we would mitigate those risks.

304
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:43,199
And we did go on to end up getting that project.

305
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:45,600
And afterwards someone came up to me and said,

306
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,101
I'm really glad you were willing to admit

307
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:49,403
that you found that scary, because if you hadn't,

308
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:51,484
we probably would have just ended the conversation,

309
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:52,765
because it really would have indicated

310
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:55,987
that you didn't know enough, or you were too cocky

311
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:59,629
to admit that there are some scary elements to this project.

312
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,291
So it's not necessarily a terrible thing

313
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,192
to embrace the fear.

314
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:07,795
In fact, fear actually, there's a lot of upsides to it.

315
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:09,576
It does serve a purpose.

316
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:15,555
So the reason why fear exists is to keep us out of harm's way.

317
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:18,676
So if you look at it from a historical perspective,

318
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:22,838
the reason why we're here today is that our caveman ancestors,

319
00:15:22,898 --> 00:15:25,700
if they saw a bear, they ran in the opposite direction.

320
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,161
Instead of going, hey, you look fuzzy, give me a hug.

321
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:29,922
That would have resulted in death.

322
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:32,323
So fear does serve a purpose.

323
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:35,504
It's there to actually clarify when

324
00:15:35,524 --> 00:15:36,525
there's a potential problem.

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,081
And it also can be really instructive.

326
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:43,863
I find on a lot of the projects that I run

327
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:47,225
that are really tight turn, scary projects,

328
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:50,287
the thing that actually scares me the most

329
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:53,929
is almost always the thing that ends up going sideways

330
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:55,490
and that needs the most attention.

331
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,151
So whatever is keeping me up at night

332
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,993
is the thing that I know is going to turn into the problem.

333
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,494
So it's actually really useful because usually,

334
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:07,539
By the time that thing becomes a problem, I've spent so much time thinking about it

335
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:10,803
and worrying about it and planning for it to go wrong that I actually am able to really

336
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:12,225
decisively address it.

337
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:18,772
And last but not least, fear can be a really potent driver of success.

338
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:24,413
I find this particularly when we've done some of our own projects at Clutch Play.

339
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:31,377
There are times when I find the team is stagnating, they're stuck, they're stuck in a perfectionism

340
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:31,838
loop.

341
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:35,820
So anybody who battles with perfectionism knows exactly what I'm talking about.

342
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:42,564
And so one of the things I found that has actually really helped my team is to get over this is to

343
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:50,268
inject the possibility of a failure point. So basically if I find that something is stagnating,

344
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:54,531
I'll sign us up for a conference in three weeks to demo the game. And I'm like, well,

345
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,573
we have to make this work because we've got three weeks. And I find that that actually

346
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:01,955
really helps to clarify the mind around

347
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,577
What is the best thing that we can make in the time we have

348
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:08,778
versus what is the most perfect thing that I can make?

349
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,400
So that's another upside of fear.

350
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:17,803
Because you gotta have crazy cats in your slides.

351
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:22,345
So one final thought on fear is that,

352
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:25,506
I've talked a lot about how producer, like production fear.

353
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,373
how we often feel when we're dealing

354
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:30,294
with a difficult project.

355
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:32,817
But fear has a tendency to boil over

356
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:37,402
and on a really critical, fast turn, high risk project,

357
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:40,766
fear is felt all throughout the entire team.

358
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,629
So that can boil over both on your team

359
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:46,832
and levels above you, like your boss

360
00:17:46,872 --> 00:17:49,175
or your boss's boss or your client.

361
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:53,020
And when that happens, people often turn on each other.

362
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,301
It happens a lot, especially when you're the producer,

363
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:58,923
you are often in the crosshairs of people freaking out.

364
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:02,204
So it's really critical to remember that often,

365
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:04,625
if you're in a really stressful project situation,

366
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,286
as stressed out as you can feel,

367
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,707
others on your team may actually be feeling it

368
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:10,688
far more acutely than you are.

369
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:12,869
So it's really important to keep that in mind

370
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:14,550
and not take it personally.

371
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:18,450
So I find if a member of my team is freaking out,

372
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,312
more often than not, the most successful way

373
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:22,714
to diffuse their fear or anger or stress

374
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:24,575
is to just listen to them.

375
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:28,158
Ideally recognize that they're about to boil over

376
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:29,119
before they do.

377
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,542
But generally speaking, more often than not,

378
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:35,984
if I actually sit down and talk to a team member

379
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:36,705
who's, who's,

380
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,979
really freaking out because they're stressed out and worried,

381
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:43,240
just actually talking things through

382
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,281
will help to diffuse the situation quite a bit.

383
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,742
And also, I often learn something really important

384
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:50,622
that I didn't know.

385
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:54,043
So sometimes people on the team, when it's really stressful,

386
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,964
they hold things in and they don't share

387
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:56,824
until they freak out.

388
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:00,545
So the other thing, the other kind of stress

389
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:03,206
that can be really painful when people sort of act out

390
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:04,286
is when

391
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:09,949
That stress is actually being displayed by someone

392
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:11,610
who is in a position of power above you.

393
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,830
Your boss, your boss's boss, your client.

394
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:15,471
And that can happen a lot.

395
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:16,952
That certainly happened to me quite a bit

396
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:18,272
when I was dealing with clients

397
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:21,074
who were facing losing their jobs

398
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:23,115
if I couldn't get their project out of the door.

399
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:26,736
And it's really tricky when that happens

400
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:29,337
because that often comes in the form of harsh criticism,

401
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:32,699
micromanagement, and questioning your abilities

402
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,500
as a producer or project manager.

403
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,040
And that is really, really rough.

404
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:39,458
So the one piece of advice I can give

405
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:43,541
is that if this happens to you, the best thing you can do

406
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:46,022
if you are on a really high-stress, tight-turn project

407
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:48,604
is just deal with it head-on and talk it out.

408
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:52,366
And I've had the same conversation over and over again

409
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:55,067
because I have been dealing with a lot of stressed-out people.

410
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:57,328
And often what I've found is effective

411
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:01,351
is having the conversation that, I understand

412
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:02,171
you're really stressed.

413
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:03,772
We're all super stressed.

414
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:04,693
But.

415
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:10,804
We're all on the same team, and in order for me to actually do my job and manage this project,

416
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:13,424
you need me to be as confident as I can possibly be.

417
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:18,386
So nitpicking and micromanaging is not a way to accomplish that. So we need to partner up.

418
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:23,607
And 100% of the time, that has actually gone down really effectively, because it is a good

419
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:27,428
reminder to them that they need you to be confident, and they need to have some faith

420
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:35,431
in your abilities. So again, little reminder, courage is resistance to fear.

421
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:37,314
It's not the absence of fear.

422
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:38,935
So fear's gonna happen.

423
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:40,737
It's not the end of the world.

424
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:45,201
Embrace it and go make great stuff.

425
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:49,726
So next thing I wanna talk about is expectation management.

426
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,312
When it comes to managing the unmanageable project,

427
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:56,435
you know, again, in my experience,

428
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,636
there's always a way to do it,

429
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:01,300
but a lot of this involves really extremely careful planning

430
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,641
and expectation management,

431
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,323
and that's often easier said than done.

432
00:21:04,423 --> 00:21:06,085
So I wanna talk about three components

433
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,527
of expectation management,

434
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:10,770
and those are planning, scope and schedule control,

435
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,091
and communication.

436
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:16,500
So let's start off by talking about planning first

437
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,721
because that's one of the more critical elements

438
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,623
of expectation management, I think.

439
00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:23,586
And I have no doubt whatsoever that everybody in this room

440
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:26,788
has a pretty good grasp of the basics of running a project.

441
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:29,591
In fact, probably a lot of you could teach me a thing or two.

442
00:21:31,352 --> 00:21:33,394
But as someone who spent large chunks of my career

443
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:35,716
taking over this specific type of project

444
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,197
and getting them back on track,

445
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,399
I wanna talk about some things that I've observed

446
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,100
in the planning phase that can really

447
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,722
cause problems down the line.

448
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:53,557
So when you're running a high-risk, fast-earned project,

449
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:57,978
it is incredibly important that everyone on your team

450
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,639
is bought in to the goals of the project,

451
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,940
that they understand what their personal responsibilities are

452
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,701
on that project, that they understand the risk,

453
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:11,022
and they've really internalized the consequences for failure.

454
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,363
And I know this seems like a big, fat duh.

455
00:22:14,403 --> 00:22:15,984
Well, everybody knows that we need

456
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:18,065
to make these things clear.

457
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:18,245
But.

458
00:22:18,968 --> 00:22:22,251
A lot of the projects I've taken over that have gotten into a freefall state

459
00:22:22,812 --> 00:22:28,017
often actually were the result of people not being clear on all of these things.

460
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:33,342
So important to make sure everybody is really aware of the parameters up front.

461
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:39,649
So this is a big one for the games industry, I have to say in particular.

462
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,032
Succumbing to the urge to act first and plan later.

463
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:48,669
I'm a big fan of the phrase measure twice and cut once,

464
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:51,150
especially when you're planning a project

465
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:53,992
that is very time constrained.

466
00:22:55,293 --> 00:22:57,834
But I'll also fully admit that as time bears down on you,

467
00:22:57,994 --> 00:23:00,756
as producers, we often feel really intense pressure

468
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,537
to just throw open the doors and get everybody to run

469
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:05,538
as fast as they can on the team

470
00:23:05,638 --> 00:23:07,960
towards the goal of getting the project done.

471
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:12,998
But the problem with that is, if you don't have a solid plan in place,

472
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,139
getting everybody to just run as fast as they can,

473
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,222
means that it's very likely that you're going to take a wrong turn along the way

474
00:23:19,282 --> 00:23:21,543
that's going to take some time to get you back on track.

475
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:23,765
And that might be time that you don't actually have.

476
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:29,168
Another challenge of succumbing to acting first and planning later

477
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:33,231
is that it often leaves you open to some pretty intense scope creep.

478
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:40,335
So if you don't have a really clear list of objectives and tasks that everybody's aware of,

479
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:45,840
then it really does leave you vulnerable to people saying, well, I thought that was in there

480
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,923
and it doesn't say it's not, so you're going to have to figure out a way to put this in.

481
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:55,576
So over committing is another big mistake.

482
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:59,080
This is otherwise known as failing to use the word no

483
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,101
when necessary.

484
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:02,363
And this can be a really tough one,

485
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:04,165
especially for those of us who suffer

486
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:05,686
with wanting to be a pleaser.

487
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:07,608
I definitely feel when I was younger,

488
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:08,950
I went through that a lot.

489
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,972
It was really hard for me to say no to people.

490
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:15,119
But running these kinds of projects

491
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:17,161
just knocks that right out of you immediately

492
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:19,563
because you really have to be comfortable saying no,

493
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:21,944
especially when it comes to expectation settings.

494
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:24,666
Because your number one job as a producer

495
00:24:24,786 --> 00:24:27,348
on these kinds of projects is to set your team up

496
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:31,932
to be successful by under-promising and over-delivering.

497
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:33,813
I cannot say that enough.

498
00:24:35,735 --> 00:24:38,076
So that means your plan has to be extremely focused

499
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,818
on what's practical and not what is ideal.

500
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:45,607
Too much process.

501
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:47,808
Now I imagine some of you are seeing that

502
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:49,088
and you're scrimming in your seats going,

503
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:51,329
process, don't take away my process.

504
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:52,529
What the hell are you talking about?

505
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:56,130
Because as producers, we love us some process, right?

506
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,770
This is our like safe haven in a world gone mad.

507
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,531
This is what keeps us sane.

508
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:03,651
But sometimes we have to recognize

509
00:25:03,911 --> 00:25:05,872
when process is actually just there

510
00:25:05,992 --> 00:25:08,112
to make us feel better as producers

511
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:10,253
versus being a useful tool for the team.

512
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:13,735
In the context of a burner project,

513
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:15,937
it's really important not to bog the team down

514
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:17,899
with too much project management overhead.

515
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,222
I don't know about you, but my team hates it

516
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:23,105
when I slam them with a lot of project management overhead.

517
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:24,066
It drives them crazy.

518
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:26,428
Because in my experience, on any project

519
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:27,849
that I've ever had to step into

520
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:30,532
that has a lot of heavy project management process,

521
00:25:31,484 --> 00:25:34,526
That's the first thing that goes when things go sideways.

522
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:38,590
And so what ends up happening is people spend a lot of time,

523
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:43,013
often you or your team, trying to get all these micro-processes set up.

524
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:47,256
And when those go away, that's time wasted,

525
00:25:47,496 --> 00:25:51,039
and more than likely, you've really irritated your team in the process.

526
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:58,765
So right-sizing process is really critical on a fast-turn project that's in a death spiral.

527
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:03,872
And basically my rule of thumb there is I try to start out

528
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:06,392
a project with the least amount of process

529
00:26:06,552 --> 00:26:07,893
that will be useful as possible,

530
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:09,293
and if I need to add it later,

531
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:12,494
that's a little easier on my team

532
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:14,695
than cutting process that's not working.

533
00:26:16,936 --> 00:26:20,337
So failing to stay focused is another one.

534
00:26:20,357 --> 00:26:23,218
In almost every project like this,

535
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:26,379
I feel like you're battling this constant fight

536
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,120
between the big picture and the small picture.

537
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,036
So what might be great for the picture, the big picture,

538
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:36,137
is almost always disastrous for the immediate term.

539
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:38,158
So this can present a really,

540
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:40,058
it's not necessarily the end of the world,

541
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:42,179
because it can present a really great opportunity

542
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:43,820
to do some expectation setting.

543
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,521
And if looking at the big picture does jeopardize

544
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:50,042
your immediate short-term goals,

545
00:26:50,382 --> 00:26:52,563
then it gives everyone a chance to re-evaluate

546
00:26:52,803 --> 00:26:54,103
the priorities of the project.

547
00:26:57,505 --> 00:27:00,367
And last but not least, assuming that additional resources

548
00:27:00,427 --> 00:27:01,688
will solve your problems.

549
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:04,270
And there's an old production saying,

550
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,491
it's one of my two favorite sayings next to,

551
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:07,472
it is what it is.

552
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:11,414
It is, you can't put nine women in a room

553
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,736
and have a baby in a month, have you guys heard that?

554
00:27:13,776 --> 00:27:15,257
That's like one of my favorites.

555
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:19,119
And when you're under the gun, it's really, really tempting

556
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,680
to throw resources at the problem.

557
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,441
And that's one thing I'll say in the games industry,

558
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,883
we often do have the opportunity to do that.

559
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:30,161
But oftentimes, that's not necessarily always the answer

560
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:31,322
to all of your problems.

561
00:27:31,402 --> 00:27:34,485
In fact, one of our first jobs that we did at Clutch Play,

562
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:35,606
it was a consulting gig.

563
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:37,608
We worked for a company down here in San Francisco.

564
00:27:38,248 --> 00:27:40,270
And it was a really crazy project.

565
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:44,594
We had to do a minimum viable product, MVP,

566
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:46,456
and we had 12 weeks to do it.

567
00:27:46,536 --> 00:27:48,638
And it was really tight and very ambitious.

568
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:49,839
And so.

569
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:53,259
We actually had a very small team.

570
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:56,899
It was my team plus some members of the client's team

571
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:57,520
who hired us.

572
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,601
And we actually were able, we had a very, very tight scope.

573
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,401
And we were actually able to finish the project a day early.

574
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:08,081
And the clients were beside themselves.

575
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:09,502
They were like, my God, we didn't even think

576
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,362
this was possible at all, and you finished a day early.

577
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:12,162
This is amazing.

578
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,203
And so they were so happy that when we went to phase two

579
00:28:15,223 --> 00:28:16,423
of the project, they said, you know,

580
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:18,583
if you could go this fast with...

581
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:20,144
this small number of people,

582
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:23,207
imagine how fast you can go with twice that number of people.

583
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:26,569
And I completely understand that instinct,

584
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:30,412
but not surprisingly, everything got quite a bit slower.

585
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:34,695
Because you had a bunch of people of differing skill levels,

586
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:36,196
they were ramping on the project,

587
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,338
it was harder to enforce code standards,

588
00:28:38,898 --> 00:28:41,881
and we still had these same tight deadlines.

589
00:28:42,161 --> 00:28:45,604
So it was not quite as smooth as everybody had hoped.

590
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:49,778
And so in my experience, when you're actually

591
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:51,640
really under the gun to get something done

592
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,282
in a really tight time frame,

593
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,045
often the best way to do that is to have

594
00:28:56,145 --> 00:28:59,648
a really small focused team of experts

595
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:03,052
who can really come in, take care of business,

596
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:05,494
work really cleanly, and get the job done.

597
00:29:08,357 --> 00:29:08,677
So...

598
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:15,024
Let's talk about scope and schedule control a little bit,

599
00:29:15,064 --> 00:29:17,105
which does go hand in hand with communication.

600
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:24,268
So in my experience, the best way to manage scope control

601
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,369
is to establish a framework that holds everybody

602
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,650
accountable on the team.

603
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:32,092
So everybody needs to be accountable for their actions

604
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:33,692
and decisions all across the board,

605
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,594
no matter what role you're in or what level of the company

606
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:36,934
you're in.

607
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,735
So that's you, your team, your clients, your managers,

608
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:41,296
the whole ball of wax.

609
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:45,554
So in a rushed, really difficult project environment,

610
00:29:45,594 --> 00:29:46,895
for that to work effectively,

611
00:29:47,055 --> 00:29:49,337
everyone needs to hold themselves to really high standards.

612
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:52,960
And so to do that, that involves a lot of transparency.

613
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,822
Transparency and accountability really go hand in hand.

614
00:29:58,244 --> 00:30:02,167
So it's really important that everybody is aware at all times of what's going well and

615
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:03,248
what's not going well.

616
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:06,250
So the way we often handle that is of course daily standups.

617
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:07,552
I'm sure most of you do that.

618
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:12,515
I'm a big fan of doing those as long as you can keep them very nice and tight and short

619
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:15,218
so people can go back and do their work.

620
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:21,302
But also I'm a really big fan of status reports and that's something I feel like no matter

621
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,463
what I can never skip.

622
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:28,173
And I'm very much a big fan of nothing should ever be a surprise.

623
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:30,642
So when I mentioned status reports,

624
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:32,822
I sent my slides off to my GDC advisor

625
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:34,103
and she asked a really good question.

626
00:30:34,143 --> 00:30:37,464
She was like, well, if you're doing status reports,

627
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,284
how do you get people to read them?

628
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,165
And I'm currently on a project

629
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:42,285
where I do a daily status report

630
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:43,565
and I know almost nobody reads them

631
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:45,626
except the one person I need to read them.

632
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:48,266
So that's a different story.

633
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:50,647
But I find in weekly status reports,

634
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:52,467
one of the things that's been really effective for me

635
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:54,068
in the past when I worked at EA,

636
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:55,948
I was a community manager at one point

637
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:58,809
and so it was my job to feed whatever was wrong.

638
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:01,490
in the live environment to production.

639
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:04,251
And this was on The Sims Online,

640
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:05,952
and there was a lot of things wrong

641
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:07,553
all the time on that project,

642
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:10,674
in some really kind of spectacularly strange ways.

643
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:14,536
And so the way I found that I got a really wide readership

644
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:16,717
on that status report is I just filled it

645
00:31:16,757 --> 00:31:19,738
with as much gallows, dark humor as I possibly could.

646
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,239
And that's how I would know that everybody was reading it,

647
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,181
is I'd hear like these groans and laughs coming all

648
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,501
as soon as I would hit send.

649
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:29,362
And a lot of people would come up to me on a weekly basis

650
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:30,622
and say, you know, you are always

651
00:31:30,662 --> 00:31:33,103
delivering such shitty news in those status reports.

652
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:37,264
But at least having a laugh over it

653
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:38,564
makes the bitter pill go down.

654
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:39,644
So that's one way to do it.

655
00:31:40,104 --> 00:31:42,045
Another way I've seen people do it is I

656
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:45,085
have a friend who would often put things in her status

657
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:48,006
report like, the first three people who come up to my desk,

658
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:48,846
you'll get chocolate.

659
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:52,187
And so she would know exactly who read her status

660
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:54,427
report by who asked for chocolate.

661
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:56,068
And so that's another way you can do it.

662
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:01,688
So another thing that's really important to keep track of

663
00:32:01,748 --> 00:32:05,148
and highly visible is what is not accounted for in planning.

664
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:08,109
So you can be the greatest planner in the world,

665
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:11,510
but there are going to be things you're going to forget.

666
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,450
It just happens all the time.

667
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,070
And there's no shame in that.

668
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,791
It's generally recognized that you

669
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:19,911
can't know every single need of the project

670
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:21,071
right from the very beginning.

671
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:23,792
So it's really important to call those out and keep track

672
00:32:23,832 --> 00:32:25,512
of those in case any trade-offs need

673
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:27,933
to be made, which of course brings us to trade-off

674
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:28,313
tracking.

675
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:32,727
On projects with a really, really tight scope,

676
00:32:33,147 --> 00:32:35,648
it is incredibly important that you keep track

677
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:39,990
of what's getting rolled off and what's getting rolled on.

678
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,291
So at the end of the project,

679
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:44,911
you don't have any unhappy surprise

680
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:46,272
with a client or a boss saying,

681
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:47,352
well, I thought this feature

682
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:48,733
was gonna be part of this release.

683
00:32:48,813 --> 00:32:51,174
And you have to have some kind of,

684
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:55,356
historical log that says, well, actually, if you remember,

685
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,137
we took it out.

686
00:32:56,317 --> 00:32:57,898
Because again, games are chaos.

687
00:32:57,918 --> 00:32:59,600
These kinds of projects are really chaotic.

688
00:32:59,780 --> 00:32:59,980
Oops.

689
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:03,003
So it's really important to keep track of that,

690
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,205
because people will not remember decisions

691
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:06,306
that are made in the moment.

692
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:11,078
Another thing that's actually really important to do,

693
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:13,579
I think, is especially with weekly status reports,

694
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:16,481
keeping a running list of action items

695
00:33:17,322 --> 00:33:19,203
across all levels of the company.

696
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:21,464
I find that keeps me really accountable.

697
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:23,505
Often if I'm doing a weekly status report,

698
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:25,907
and I suddenly will see, oh crap,

699
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:27,928
I committed to do this last week and I didn't do it.

700
00:33:27,988 --> 00:33:29,709
So it gives me the opportunity to run around

701
00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:31,930
and make sure that all of my commitments are solid.

702
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,212
But it's also really good in terms of managing up,

703
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:36,793
because I often find that

704
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:45,143
Sometimes what stalls the project is when somebody in leadership is just super busy and they don't have time to get you what you need,

705
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:47,726
which could be a decision, it could be a design document.

706
00:33:48,608 --> 00:33:54,395
And so I find that basically that's a really good way of, in a non-confrontational way, saying...

707
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:57,916
Okay, we have had this thing.

708
00:33:57,996 --> 00:33:59,757
It's been out there for a couple weeks now.

709
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:01,759
I know you're really busy,

710
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:05,782
but if I can't get this from you in the next day or so,

711
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:07,703
we're not gonna meet our project deadlines.

712
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:11,887
And often I've actually found that this is really helpful

713
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:14,689
when you're having these difficult conversations

714
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:16,871
because often leadership is a little more forgiving on.

715
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:20,832
the consequences of stuff like that

716
00:34:21,012 --> 00:34:23,715
if they're the ones who are actually causing the bottleneck.

717
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:30,223
So out of scope requests happens on every single project.

718
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,046
Never had a project where there wasn't out of scope requests.

719
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,124
And again, I'm a really big fan of under-promise

720
00:34:37,164 --> 00:34:39,126
and over-deliver, so on a tight turn,

721
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:40,588
when out-of-scope requests come up

722
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:42,591
without an obvious trade-off on the table,

723
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:45,595
I will always try to accommodate it if I can.

724
00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:48,018
I always keep a running list, and when there's time,

725
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:50,762
I will throw things in when at all humanly possible.

726
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:52,584
That's part of the over-deliver part of it.

727
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,492
But it's also really important to track those

728
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:58,434
and keep a big, long running list.

729
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:02,037
And one of my projects, it was a non-game project.

730
00:35:02,057 --> 00:35:04,500
It was kind of one of the best client interactions I had.

731
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,563
I had a woman who I really liked.

732
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,746
I had given her a lot of extras on her project

733
00:35:10,926 --> 00:35:12,628
and I kept this big, long running list

734
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:14,310
of here's all the extra things I've given you.

735
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,192
And then at the end of the project, she came to me and said,

736
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:19,473
okay, I need these five other things.

737
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:22,434
And these were things, I just, I couldn't do it.

738
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:24,416
I could not make that concession to her.

739
00:35:25,496 --> 00:35:28,238
And so as I was sitting there, you know, trying to think,

740
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:29,378
how am I gonna?

741
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,220
How am I gonna very politely tell her no?

742
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,421
I let out this unconscious sigh,

743
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:38,461
and she immediately said, oh, okay, no, I hear you.

744
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:40,082
I know you've given me a lot of extra stuff.

745
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:42,102
There's this huge long list of things you've given me,

746
00:35:42,262 --> 00:35:44,143
so I'm gonna give you a change order.

747
00:35:44,723 --> 00:35:46,263
You'll have $10,000 more tomorrow.

748
00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:48,024
And I'm like, wow, that was the easiest conversation

749
00:35:48,044 --> 00:35:48,664
I ever had.

750
00:35:49,384 --> 00:35:52,244
And it's actually the list that had the conversation for me,

751
00:35:52,304 --> 00:35:53,405
so it was really good.

752
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:59,166
So, a couple of thoughts on crunch.

753
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:06,715
So, too often in this industry,

754
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:09,857
crunch is actually used as a crutch,

755
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:14,301
a never-ending crutch, a painful, painful crutch.

756
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:19,064
And that's a shame, because I do think, you know,

757
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,506
crunching has a very bad reputation.

758
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:25,569
And I actually think that crunching can be really useful

759
00:36:25,749 --> 00:36:30,133
if it's used in the right way, in a surgical way, as it were.

760
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:35,765
So going back to, as I mentioned, I talked about my experience on the Sims.

761
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:41,346
And one of the ways we were able to go from being the piece of the pipeline

762
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:46,967
that was most behind to the piece that actually got ahead was we did something

763
00:36:47,007 --> 00:36:48,428
kind of interesting with crunch.

764
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:54,189
So at that time, this was back in the EA spouse days, as many of you might

765
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:57,690
remember that, where there was a lot of mandatory weekend work.

766
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:02,722
And so it was very common to say everybody has to come in

767
00:37:02,862 --> 00:37:04,803
and work at least one day on the weekend,

768
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,544
maybe even two days if people are really behind.

769
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:09,004
So my animation director and I

770
00:37:09,084 --> 00:37:11,685
actually went to senior management before any of that began

771
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:13,326
and we said, look, we're really far behind

772
00:37:13,406 --> 00:37:14,286
and we need to catch up.

773
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:15,987
So here's our proposal.

774
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,387
We're gonna give the team some notice

775
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,708
and in a month, we're gonna crunch for a month.

776
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,929
And during that time, I'm gonna schedule them

777
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:23,349
for six days worth of work.

778
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:26,370
And if they can get that done in five, which is possible,

779
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,051
just work a little bit longer every day.

780
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,431
they will never have to come in on the weekend.

781
00:37:31,312 --> 00:37:32,993
And so what I asked of them is,

782
00:37:33,013 --> 00:37:35,695
okay, if they catch up,

783
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:39,919
then I want you to agree to not make them come in

784
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,200
and do mandatory weekends.

785
00:37:42,308 --> 00:37:43,508
They're like, well, that'll never happen,

786
00:37:43,548 --> 00:37:44,708
so okay, we'll agree to that.

787
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:46,189
And as it turned out,

788
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:48,029
there were some really interesting results

789
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,710
in bringing the team into Crunch in that way.

790
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,271
For one thing, everybody really appreciated

791
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:54,771
that they got a month's notice.

792
00:37:55,431 --> 00:37:57,972
So it gave them time to finish up their projects,

793
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:01,113
it gave them time to arrange for childcare

794
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,253
if they needed to do that.

795
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:05,094
They got to get their yah-yahs out and have fun.

796
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:07,214
It was the beginning of summer,

797
00:38:07,314 --> 00:38:09,135
so people got to go and do what they needed to do,

798
00:38:09,535 --> 00:38:11,235
and they knew that the Crunch was coming.

799
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,662
So another interesting thing that happened,

800
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:16,904
so people were actually, they were pretty okay with it.

801
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:19,065
They weren't as angry as you often find

802
00:38:19,085 --> 00:38:20,527
when you announce that there's gonna be crunch.

803
00:38:21,948 --> 00:38:23,229
Another thing that it accomplished

804
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:26,471
was that it made everybody rabidly efficient

805
00:38:26,632 --> 00:38:29,594
because nobody wanted to come in on a weekend ever.

806
00:38:31,235 --> 00:38:33,857
And so by actually telling people,

807
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:35,158
if you can get ahead,

808
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,860
if you can just be really efficient

809
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,961
with your time during the week.

810
00:38:39,118 --> 00:38:40,539
then you don't have to come in on the weekend.

811
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,461
That made everybody insanely efficient

812
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,623
because people realized if they could get their work done

813
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,924
for the week at about three o'clock on Friday,

814
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:50,266
they could actually start the next week's work.

815
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:54,188
And that meant that they were almost certainly guaranteed

816
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,970
to not have to work the following weekend.

817
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,412
So people got really competitive with each other,

818
00:38:58,432 --> 00:39:01,274
like, ha, I've not worked at all, and I'm this far ahead.

819
00:39:01,314 --> 00:39:04,156
So people were actually getting quite far ahead of even

820
00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:05,437
where we expected them to be.

821
00:39:06,198 --> 00:39:07,999
The other thing that this actually did, too,

822
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:11,922
was it enabled me to see who was not using their time well.

823
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,664
Because there were definitely some people,

824
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:15,926
the same people were there every weekend.

825
00:39:15,946 --> 00:39:18,688
The ones who did work were the same people.

826
00:39:18,808 --> 00:39:20,349
And those are the people that I would actually

827
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:22,231
see horsing around a lot during the day.

828
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:24,573
So that was also really useful information.

829
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,932
So my team and I, we do a lot of these kinds of projects,

830
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:29,934
and honestly, we don't crunch that much.

831
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:34,758
And again, the reason for that is really careful planning,

832
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:37,301
but when we do crunch, we try to front load it

833
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:41,384
as much as we can to use it as a way to get some velocity

834
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:45,968
and get ahead versus it being a stop gap

835
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:48,330
because everything is going sideways really hard.

836
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,652
So for whatever that's worth,

837
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:51,853
I wanted to throw that out there

838
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:53,095
because I think crunch...

839
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,662
is very useful if used correctly.

840
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:01,044
So some final thoughts on expectation setting,

841
00:40:01,084 --> 00:40:02,344
just to summarize a few things.

842
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,865
Never assume everyone is on the same page

843
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:05,946
or knows what to do next.

844
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:09,807
I gotta say, in my team, I would much rather

845
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:11,268
that they roll their eyes at me

846
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,789
and be super irritated by me repeating

847
00:40:14,169 --> 00:40:15,570
exactly what I expect them to do

848
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,490
rather than assuming that they know what to do

849
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,991
and being horribly disappointed.

850
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,313
Another thing is, again, over-promising.

851
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:25,940
I'm sorry, under-promise and over-deliver.

852
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,741
First thing I said would be bad.

853
00:40:28,381 --> 00:40:29,482
I can't say that enough.

854
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:31,323
Always, always, always set your team up

855
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,845
to over-deliver when possible.

856
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:38,847
Again, nothing should ever be a surprise.

857
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,708
Big, big fan of that.

858
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:44,811
And escalate issues early and often.

859
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,029
Sometimes when you're on a crazy project

860
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:49,811
and things go a little sideways,

861
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:51,352
it's tempting to wanna say,

862
00:40:51,372 --> 00:40:54,294
this might not turn into something,

863
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:55,915
so I'm just gonna sit on this.

864
00:40:56,035 --> 00:40:58,777
But it's always much easier to just take responsibility.

865
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,118
If something is a little bit off,

866
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:02,420
raise the flag and say, it's a little bit off,

867
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,661
and we need to keep an eye on it.

868
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:06,282
This might turn into something bad.

869
00:41:08,904 --> 00:41:12,487
So, last but not least, let's talk a little bit about chaos.

870
00:41:12,547 --> 00:41:13,788
I'm running low on time here, but.

871
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:17,078
The thing about chaos is,

872
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:19,238
no matter how great a producer you are

873
00:41:19,258 --> 00:41:20,618
or how carefully you've planned,

874
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:23,499
chances are something is just gonna go sideways.

875
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:25,159
It is just gonna happen.

876
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,581
So it's really important to figure out how to cope

877
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:31,441
when things go sideways.

878
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:39,583
And the first thing to do is recognize

879
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,503
that you don't have to be perfect.

880
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:45,292
The only person who thinks you have to be perfect often is you.

881
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:47,654
All you have to do is be effective.

882
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:57,005
So adopting a policy of constant evaluation and adjustment

883
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:59,168
is also really important.

884
00:42:00,808 --> 00:42:06,252
And I think one of the best ways to do that is have very, very regular personal conversations

885
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:10,754
with your team, one-on-one, something beyond the daily stand-ups, where you really get

886
00:42:10,774 --> 00:42:14,957
a sense of how they're feeling about things, what is working for them and what's not working

887
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:17,018
for them.

888
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:25,443
If you are a producer, I personally feel like if you run these kinds of projects, the most

889
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:29,145
important job that you have is to make problems go away.

890
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:34,121
That is 95% of what I do all day long.

891
00:42:35,562 --> 00:42:37,203
So if something is frustrating your team

892
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,605
or slowing them down or generally causing annoyance,

893
00:42:40,185 --> 00:42:41,546
make whatever adjustments you need

894
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:42,907
to make those problems go away.

895
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,349
And that's actually often what keeps the team

896
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:46,550
really happy and productive.

897
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:52,334
So this is the answer to the riddle

898
00:42:52,454 --> 00:42:53,875
of how do you eat the elephant?

899
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:55,636
One bite at a time, of course.

900
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:01,217
So I found when you're managing an unmanageable project,

901
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:03,178
one of the things that often happens is that

902
00:43:03,738 --> 00:43:05,779
it's not ever one thing that goes wrong,

903
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,419
it's the one thing that causes a chain reaction

904
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:09,980
of many, many things to go wrong.

905
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,521
So it's rarely like one big problem you're dealing with

906
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:14,461
at a time, it's often many.

907
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,842
So when things go sideways, they go sideways pretty hard.

908
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:26,789
So it's really important when that happens to make sure that you're not trying to run in 20 different directions at once to fix it all at once, and sometimes it's really tempting.

909
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:41,463
So one of the best things that I've found is to just make sure that you're always prioritizing what the problems are and just taking them down really methodically, and doing it in an orderly and methodical way.

910
00:43:44,745 --> 00:43:47,027
So another one, this is actually a big thing

911
00:43:47,047 --> 00:43:51,590
to just keep your sanity when things are in a chaos mode,

912
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:55,213
is stay clear about what is and what is not

913
00:43:55,253 --> 00:43:58,155
within your control, fix the things you can control,

914
00:43:59,736 --> 00:44:02,178
delegate some of the things that are outside of your control

915
00:44:02,218 --> 00:44:06,622
but still controllable, and breathe heavily

916
00:44:07,402 --> 00:44:09,124
when there are things that are just utterly

917
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:10,085
outside of your control.

918
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:12,506
There are some problems you can solve and some you can't.

919
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:16,326
So do what you can with what's solvable.

920
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:19,687
So again, escalating, very, very important.

921
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:24,448
And last but not least, leaning on your team

922
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:26,869
is really important in times of chaos.

923
00:44:28,129 --> 00:44:30,310
It's really tempting sometimes to feel like

924
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,131
when you're on a project that is in a free fall mode

925
00:44:33,651 --> 00:44:35,471
that you're carrying the weight of the world

926
00:44:35,511 --> 00:44:37,392
on your shoulder and you're doing that by yourself.

927
00:44:38,272 --> 00:44:40,713
But you don't actually have to do that nor should you

928
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:41,673
because.

929
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:47,269
That is actually a big part of being part of a really highly functional team.

930
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,470
That's what your teams are for.

931
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:52,857
So it's really important to make sure that you're prioritizing,

932
00:44:52,897 --> 00:44:57,003
developing strong relationships with your teams that you're working with.

933
00:44:58,151 --> 00:44:59,712
You can be the greatest producer in the world.

934
00:44:59,952 --> 00:45:00,892
You can know how to code.

935
00:45:00,913 --> 00:45:01,933
You can know how to do art.

936
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:03,014
You can know how to animate.

937
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,975
But unless you can clone yourself eight million times,

938
00:45:06,255 --> 00:45:10,218
you're not going to be able to launch a project by yourself.

939
00:45:10,258 --> 00:45:13,499
So you are only as good as the team that you have around you.

940
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,562
And this is never more true when things are going sideways.

941
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,444
So running these kinds of projects, above all,

942
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:25,226
involves a really high degree of trust and respect

943
00:45:25,546 --> 00:45:26,146
with your team.

944
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,343
So you should never underestimate the power of loyalty

945
00:45:31,443 --> 00:45:34,245
and sheer force of will in making something happen.

946
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:36,566
And I've had that many times when I've been

947
00:45:36,606 --> 00:45:37,967
in a really difficult situation

948
00:45:37,987 --> 00:45:39,388
with a team I've worked with a lot.

949
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:42,771
They will often say, all right, you know,

950
00:45:43,351 --> 00:45:46,673
I'm really burnt out and I'm really over it,

951
00:45:46,773 --> 00:45:47,694
but I'm gonna do it for you

952
00:45:47,714 --> 00:45:51,057
because I know that you have my back all the time.

953
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:53,478
So never underestimate that.

954
00:45:55,594 --> 00:45:58,437
Also, don't ask people to do more than you're willing to do.

955
00:45:59,018 --> 00:46:01,601
That is a really big deal to a lot of teams,

956
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:03,664
especially when they're in a crazy project

957
00:46:03,744 --> 00:46:04,685
or maybe they're crunching.

958
00:46:05,772 --> 00:46:09,295
And this goes for working late or weekend work.

959
00:46:09,315 --> 00:46:10,636
If you're asking people to work late,

960
00:46:10,656 --> 00:46:12,378
you kind of have to work late with them.

961
00:46:12,778 --> 00:46:14,259
If you're asking them to work on the weekend,

962
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,941
you got to be there with them.

963
00:46:17,222 --> 00:46:18,703
And there's nothing I have to say

964
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:23,427
that destroys morale faster than asking people to do stuff

965
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,307
that you weren't willing to do.

966
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:26,229
In fact, a lot of the projects I've inherited

967
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:27,910
that have actually been in a free fall

968
00:46:28,511 --> 00:46:30,292
have been the result of people doing that

969
00:46:30,312 --> 00:46:31,693
to their team one too many times.

970
00:46:31,713 --> 00:46:32,794
And the team will say, you know what?

971
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:34,095
I'm going to let you fail.

972
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:35,833
Happens a lot.

973
00:46:38,054 --> 00:46:38,615
So don't do that.

974
00:46:40,396 --> 00:46:42,897
And find opportunities to lift up your team.

975
00:46:44,878 --> 00:46:47,960
I got to say, early on in my career, when I was an associate,

976
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,401
I worked with a really amazing executive producer.

977
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:53,463
And he really set a great example

978
00:46:53,703 --> 00:46:58,245
of what it is to run a team that inspires a lot of loyalty.

979
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,868
Everyone wanted to work with him because, quite frankly, he

980
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,389
If you were on his team, you got promoted.

981
00:47:06,749 --> 00:47:08,952
If you did something wrong, he took the hit for you.

982
00:47:09,152 --> 00:47:13,877
If you did something right, he shined the spotlight on you.

983
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:15,959
It was a pretty amazing experience.

984
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,844
And because of that, we were all rabidly loyal to him.

985
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:22,306
To this day, if that man called me up and said,

986
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:23,548
I need you, I'd get in my car

987
00:47:23,588 --> 00:47:25,189
and I'd drive nine hours to go to his house

988
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,411
because he was pretty amazing.

989
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:31,224
So it's really important to look for opportunities

990
00:47:31,304 --> 00:47:34,206
to reward a team that's been working really hard for you.

991
00:47:34,787 --> 00:47:37,789
If there's a kind of project they wanna work on,

992
00:47:38,149 --> 00:47:39,671
then look for that kind of project.

993
00:47:39,851 --> 00:47:43,574
If they want to have a particular role in the company,

994
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:45,555
look for opportunities to give them experience

995
00:47:45,575 --> 00:47:47,957
so they can actually get into that position.

996
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:50,980
If they know that you have their back,

997
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,041
they will have your back.

998
00:47:53,614 --> 00:47:54,515
And last but not least,

999
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:56,637
I think I'm gonna just let this one sit here

1000
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:59,199
because I don't even know if it requires any explanation,

1001
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:01,641
but be a champion and not an asshole.

1002
00:48:02,682 --> 00:48:03,963
On really crazy projects,

1003
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:06,665
being an asshole buys you exactly nothing.

1004
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:12,469
So that is pretty much the end of my talk here.

1005
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,311
I am open to some questions.

1006
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,392
Thank you.

1007
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:24,591
Hi.

1008
00:48:24,871 --> 00:48:25,691
Hey.

1009
00:48:25,832 --> 00:48:28,973
So you talked about succumbing the urge of doing now

1010
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:29,933
and planning later.

1011
00:48:31,114 --> 00:48:33,895
So one of the tools that have been very useful, especially

1012
00:48:33,975 --> 00:48:36,396
like pre-production, early phase, is a prototype.

1013
00:48:37,356 --> 00:48:39,477
Like building prototypes to prove things are working,

1014
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:41,378
to prove this is what we want to do.

1015
00:48:42,018 --> 00:48:45,259
The problem I've been facing several times

1016
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:46,780
is that when a prototype works.

1017
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,521
It's like, hey, it's working great, and we ship it.

1018
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:53,284
Like there's not really a transition between we finished

1019
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:55,985
a prototype, now let's plan for this and build this right.

1020
00:48:56,586 --> 00:48:58,407
So kind of wondering if you have any advice.

1021
00:48:58,667 --> 00:49:01,629
How do you identify that prototype is done, and you're

1022
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:04,331
actually working on the real thing, and you need to stop

1023
00:49:04,371 --> 00:49:04,752
and plan?

1024
00:49:06,052 --> 00:49:06,773
That's a good question.

1025
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:09,275
So the question was, how do you know when

1026
00:49:09,315 --> 00:49:11,136
a prototype is done?

1027
00:49:12,997 --> 00:49:16,120
So basically, you have something, and it's.

1028
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:18,847
you don't know when to stop.

1029
00:49:18,947 --> 00:49:19,888
Is that your question basically?

1030
00:49:19,908 --> 00:49:21,689
Yeah, we kind of like say, oh, the prototype works great.

1031
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,490
We just keep building on the prototype and ship that.

1032
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:29,092
And, but then the infrastructure is prototype.

1033
00:49:29,652 --> 00:49:30,553
It's nothing that was before.

1034
00:49:30,573 --> 00:49:32,074
Yeah, well that's again, that kind of goes back

1035
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:34,655
to that big picture versus small picture.

1036
00:49:34,695 --> 00:49:37,336
And a lot of products do actually start like that.

1037
00:49:37,396 --> 00:49:40,518
It's like, here's a crappy prototype, you know, code base.

1038
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,979
And suddenly this has to exist as a functioning product.

1039
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,380
And I think it really depends on what your ultimate goals are.

1040
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,381
If scalability is really, really challenging on a code base

1041
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:53,182
that was not designed to be scalable.

1042
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:57,783
So if you're asking, how do you push back on that?

1043
00:49:57,803 --> 00:50:00,824
So at some point, the prototype is done.

1044
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,224
You say, OK, it works.

1045
00:50:02,424 --> 00:50:03,285
We want to build it.

1046
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:05,045
You need to stop building the prototype

1047
00:50:05,065 --> 00:50:06,505
and then plan for the actual thing.

1048
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:09,226
But I notice that doesn't always happen.

1049
00:50:09,586 --> 00:50:11,807
You just keep on working with the prototype,

1050
00:50:12,227 --> 00:50:12,987
even though it's shitty.

1051
00:50:13,997 --> 00:50:16,578
Yeah so that is a very good question.

1052
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:21,899
On some projects that we've worked on we have certainly been

1053
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:25,420
in that situation and often what we will try to do in that case

1054
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,040
is to try and figure out what is salvageable versus what is

1055
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:32,821
unscalable and start to actually build a project plan around what

1056
00:50:32,881 --> 00:50:36,262
needs to be retrofitted to make the project more scalable.

1057
00:50:37,742 --> 00:50:40,523
That is an open ended question so I'd be happy to talk to you

1058
00:50:40,563 --> 00:50:41,423
about that afterward.

1059
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:44,141
Hey.

1060
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,144
Hi.

1061
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,227
Great talk.

1062
00:50:46,347 --> 00:50:47,169
I enjoyed a lot.

1063
00:50:48,091 --> 00:50:49,174
So one of the things that.

1064
00:50:50,552 --> 00:50:54,173
we have problems with is that I'm part of the development team,

1065
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:57,475
but I'm also the manager because we have a very small team.

1066
00:50:57,955 --> 00:50:59,816
It's a studio based in Costa Rica,

1067
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:03,177
so I don't really have access to other producers and stuff.

1068
00:51:03,878 --> 00:51:07,980
So prioritizing becomes a huge issue for me,

1069
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,021
because since I'm already part of the team,

1070
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:12,602
everything seems important.

1071
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:16,343
So what would be your advice in order to try to prioritize better?

1072
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:19,862
So you are in a position, the question is,

1073
00:51:20,562 --> 00:51:22,585
what is the advice to help prioritize a team

1074
00:51:22,605 --> 00:51:23,946
that does not have a producer?

1075
00:51:25,128 --> 00:51:28,071
So you do not have the ability

1076
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:29,833
to also have a producer at any point.

1077
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:32,696
We tried using a remote producer,

1078
00:51:32,736 --> 00:51:35,960
but it just doesn't do it.

1079
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,321
Right, I got it.

1080
00:51:38,698 --> 00:51:41,439
So this comes up a lot, particularly in the indie community,

1081
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:44,041
because a lot of indie teams don't have producers.

1082
00:51:44,121 --> 00:51:47,283
In fact, last year I was part of the indie soapbox rants

1083
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:50,144
and my talk title was make a fucking budget for fuck's sake

1084
00:51:50,184 --> 00:51:52,226
because most indies don't actually have them

1085
00:51:52,246 --> 00:51:53,346
because they don't have producers

1086
00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:54,747
and they get into a lot of hot water.

1087
00:51:55,748 --> 00:51:58,409
And so often this is a big challenge

1088
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:59,930
and I think the best way to do that

1089
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,892
is there's usually someone on the team

1090
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:05,774
who has a vague interest in being a producer.

1091
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:06,674
Is that normally you?

1092
00:52:07,315 --> 00:52:08,756
It's always me.

1093
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:09,597
Oh, it is always you.

1094
00:52:09,717 --> 00:52:11,058
And do you want to be a producer?

1095
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,481
Well, I like it, but I would prefer

1096
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:19,264
to be on the sign coding, which is my actual background.

1097
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:19,945
Right.

1098
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:27,971
Well, often I've found when indies

1099
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,472
say they can't afford a producer.

1100
00:52:31,768 --> 00:52:35,009
I'm a living example that that is not necessarily true.

1101
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:40,412
I'm probably the highest billing person on my company when we run multiple projects.

1102
00:52:40,552 --> 00:52:42,273
I actually bill on all those projects.

1103
00:52:42,373 --> 00:52:43,593
I sell in a lot of the work.

1104
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:48,456
So you might actually find that there is a way that you could afford to have a producer

1105
00:52:48,616 --> 00:52:50,377
on your team to help you with some of that.

1106
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:52,097
But failing that...

1107
00:52:56,107 --> 00:52:58,288
I understand that that's a really challenging question

1108
00:52:58,328 --> 00:53:01,550
because you also have your own set of work

1109
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:02,370
that you have to do.

1110
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:07,613
So, you've stumped me slightly.

1111
00:53:14,596 --> 00:53:14,857
Yeah.

1112
00:53:15,497 --> 00:53:18,298
I think the best thing is to carve out a fair,

1113
00:53:18,418 --> 00:53:20,579
you have to carve out time to be a producer.

1114
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:23,681
I guess that's the best answer I can have is that.

1115
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:28,918
A production job is not really, it's not an afterthought.

1116
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:32,380
It's something that you actually have to devote time to.

1117
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,382
You have to devote thinking time to.

1118
00:53:34,442 --> 00:53:36,123
You have to devote planning time to.

1119
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:39,906
So I think if you are actually functioning as a producer

1120
00:53:40,046 --> 00:53:41,567
on your team and you don't have one,

1121
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:44,809
then you need to actually have specific hours

1122
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,652
carved out of your week where that is all you focus on.

1123
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,634
That's really the best advice I can really give you.

1124
00:53:51,014 --> 00:53:51,775
Thank you. Sure.

1125
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,804
Great talk, especially the title, loved it.

1126
00:53:57,824 --> 00:53:59,025
Thank you.

1127
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:02,929
So you had a picture of a fire and someone was looking at it

1128
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:04,310
and saying everything's going to be OK.

1129
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,513
People like yourself, other people too, it comes naturally

1130
00:54:07,613 --> 00:54:09,896
to have that kind of leadership skills to look at a shitty

1131
00:54:09,936 --> 00:54:12,999
situation and say, hey, be that conduit, we're going to be OK,

1132
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:13,639
we're going to be OK.

1133
00:54:15,512 --> 00:54:20,077
Is there a way to, do you have any tips in terms of training people to head toward that

1134
00:54:20,117 --> 00:54:23,540
path in terms of that skill to be able to look at a crazy situation and move forward?

1135
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,824
I know experience is the best teacher and just going through the paces helps, but any

1136
00:54:27,884 --> 00:54:31,748
training tips, anything you've seen that helps you grow that skill within people?

1137
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,109
Yeah, that's a great question.

1138
00:54:33,629 --> 00:54:39,194
So the question was, how do you get people to want to take on these kinds of projects?

1139
00:54:41,435 --> 00:54:44,137
So I think the people who tend to gravitate

1140
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,158
towards these kind of projects are people

1141
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,280
with a lot of really good soft skills

1142
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,782
because there is a huge amount of people management

1143
00:54:50,882 --> 00:54:51,762
involved in that.

1144
00:54:52,383 --> 00:54:54,504
So the people who tend to do really well

1145
00:54:54,584 --> 00:54:55,945
at these kinds of things are people

1146
00:54:56,005 --> 00:55:00,448
who can soothe a lot of emotional upheaval.

1147
00:55:00,808 --> 00:55:03,770
So those are the kinds of people who often.

1148
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,451
are kind of predisposed to it.

1149
00:55:07,172 --> 00:55:09,494
I think the way that you actually help a producer,

1150
00:55:10,115 --> 00:55:12,137
in my experience when I've been mentoring people,

1151
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:14,459
is putting them in a position

1152
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:17,422
where they are set up to be successful.

1153
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:20,825
So, kind of like I was talking about with my old boss,

1154
00:55:20,925 --> 00:55:23,187
he would actually take the hit if things went bad

1155
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:26,010
and he would actually point out when things went well.

1156
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:29,153
Again, part of this is getting over that fear.

1157
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:29,213
So.

1158
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:33,616
A lot of people don't want to take on these projects because they're really scary.

1159
00:55:33,696 --> 00:55:35,238
There's an opportunity for failure.

1160
00:55:36,058 --> 00:55:40,561
So if you want people to take on these kinds of projects, give them a support network so

1161
00:55:40,601 --> 00:55:44,744
they have someone standing behind them who can actually help them get the project off

1162
00:55:44,784 --> 00:55:45,265
the ground.

1163
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:49,268
And then actually reward them when they do well.

1164
00:55:49,328 --> 00:55:54,411
It's really important to reward successes of people who take on projects like this.

1165
00:55:55,572 --> 00:55:55,732
Yeah.

1166
00:55:55,832 --> 00:55:56,012
Thank you.

1167
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:57,513
Hey.

1168
00:55:57,903 --> 00:55:58,964
Hello, great talk.

1169
00:56:00,345 --> 00:56:02,666
In the middle of the crisis, how do you

1170
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,708
evaluate if the problem is with the process

1171
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:07,569
or is with the people?

1172
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:09,470
That is a good question.

1173
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:12,212
So the question was, how do you evaluate, ooh, gosh,

1174
00:56:12,232 --> 00:56:13,513
when the problem is with the process versus the people?

1175
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:14,653
So the question was, how do you evaluate, ooh, gosh,

1176
00:56:14,693 --> 00:56:17,535
when the problem is with the process versus the people?

1177
00:56:28,277 --> 00:56:31,859
It's kind of a power to weight ratio thing.

1178
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:35,540
If something is taking an enormous amount of time

1179
00:56:35,581 --> 00:56:38,182
and overhead of my time and my team's time,

1180
00:56:38,722 --> 00:56:42,123
then there has to be a really demonstrable value

1181
00:56:42,604 --> 00:56:43,624
in doing that.

1182
00:56:44,384 --> 00:56:46,125
So I was on a project not too long ago

1183
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:48,706
where there was an enormous amount of overhead.

1184
00:56:48,726 --> 00:56:52,808
There was a lot of project tasks that were broken down

1185
00:56:52,848 --> 00:56:54,269
in a very micro fashion.

1186
00:56:54,529 --> 00:56:55,950
And that took a huge amount of work.

1187
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:59,211
And sometimes it caused more confusion than it helped.

1188
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:04,754
I understood the reason why that was what was being asked.

1189
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:08,036
But at the same time, it took a lot of time

1190
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:10,357
and it actually sort of confused everybody

1191
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:12,798
about what was done versus what was not done

1192
00:57:13,018 --> 00:57:15,540
because it's really hard to close out a task

1193
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:19,121
when it's related to a larger system that's not done.

1194
00:57:19,722 --> 00:57:23,644
So that was a good example of something that quickly went out the window.

1195
00:57:24,424 --> 00:57:28,587
And that was a good example of something where it took everybody a lot of time to enter all

1196
00:57:28,607 --> 00:57:36,131
those tasks, to break them down in that micro way, and it ended up not being worthwhile.

1197
00:57:36,691 --> 00:57:38,152
So it really, there's a couple things.

1198
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:43,675
I think part of it is, does the amount of time that I'm actually spending on this project

1199
00:57:45,522 --> 00:57:49,183
this particular task, does it actually bear out good results?

1200
00:57:50,023 --> 00:57:50,604
So that's one way.

1201
00:57:50,644 --> 00:57:52,264
Another way is to just talk to the team.

1202
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:54,785
My team is very much a,

1203
00:57:54,885 --> 00:57:57,646
they don't like a lot of heavy process overhead.

1204
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:00,568
And so they will be very quick to tell me,

1205
00:58:00,748 --> 00:58:02,468
like, I don't know why you're making me do this.

1206
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:04,149
What is the value?

1207
00:58:04,209 --> 00:58:05,990
You explain to me what the value is of this.

1208
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,730
And if I can't explain the value to them,

1209
00:58:08,311 --> 00:58:09,491
then I'm like, well, that's fair.

1210
00:58:09,511 --> 00:58:10,472
We're gonna drop it.

1211
00:58:10,812 --> 00:58:12,532
So just being in dialogue with your team

1212
00:58:12,592 --> 00:58:13,793
is really helpful, I would say.

1213
00:58:13,813 --> 00:58:15,173
Thank you.

1214
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:15,668
Thank you.

1215
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:17,871
Hi.

1216
00:58:18,091 --> 00:58:18,352
Hello.

1217
00:58:19,473 --> 00:58:19,533
Hi.

1218
00:58:20,014 --> 00:58:22,197
So one of my questions, or I guess this is the most

1219
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:22,758
important one, but.

1220
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,381
When I come to start a new project,

1221
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:30,081
there seems to be this really kind of a production crunch

1222
00:58:30,101 --> 00:58:32,162
where we're trying to like waterfall out the whole design

1223
00:58:32,182 --> 00:58:33,482
and then we take an agile approach when

1224
00:58:33,502 --> 00:58:34,422
we're moving through our sprints.

1225
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:37,343
But at every project, there seems

1226
00:58:37,363 --> 00:58:39,083
to be like this nebulous in the first few weeks

1227
00:58:39,103 --> 00:58:40,983
where everyone's like, I don't really know what I'm doing.

1228
00:58:41,003 --> 00:58:42,104
Not everything's planned.

1229
00:58:42,164 --> 00:58:43,744
And we're like wasting time at the start.

1230
00:58:43,764 --> 00:58:45,244
So we get off to a bad start.

1231
00:58:45,284 --> 00:58:46,705
And then we kind of have to now catch up.

1232
00:58:47,305 --> 00:58:49,945
So what should I do to try and mitigate that

1233
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:50,945
on these projects that I have?

1234
00:58:52,408 --> 00:58:57,152
Well I guess, so the question is, at the beginning of the project there's often a nebulous phase

1235
00:58:57,212 --> 00:59:03,497
where productivity kind of goes into a black hole while the product is, while the schedule

1236
00:59:03,537 --> 00:59:05,579
is being solidified?

1237
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,843
If it's an any dev project, we need to design a lot of the features of the game, do a lot

1238
00:59:10,863 --> 00:59:15,207
of breaking the tasks down and what they're going to do, and that takes a week, two weeks,

1239
00:59:15,547 --> 00:59:17,529
all the leads need to get together and consistently talk.

1240
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,391
revamp what we're doing, but in that time,

1241
00:59:21,031 --> 00:59:23,572
no one's really doing constructive work

1242
00:59:23,632 --> 00:59:24,892
towards the goals, just kind of like,

1243
00:59:24,972 --> 00:59:26,673
oh, well, I guess I can work on this,

1244
00:59:26,713 --> 00:59:27,894
or I can try and prototype that,

1245
00:59:27,914 --> 00:59:30,355
but it ends up being stuff that either never gets used,

1246
00:59:31,355 --> 00:59:32,916
or just was a waste of time to do,

1247
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:35,677
and I want to try and better use that time

1248
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,697
at the beginning of a project,

1249
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:40,699
rather than let it slow us down and have a bad start.

1250
00:59:41,019 --> 00:59:41,159
Yeah.

1251
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:45,714
Well, usually, when we're actually in our planning phase,

1252
00:59:46,394 --> 00:59:49,235
I have every member of my team involved in the planning phase

1253
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:51,416
because there's always some element of the project

1254
00:59:51,456 --> 00:59:52,977
that they need to be involved in.

1255
00:59:53,097 --> 00:59:56,359
So if I'm actually working on like,

1256
00:59:57,139 --> 01:00:02,202
design task breakdowns, then my engineers are working on engineering task breakdowns.

1257
01:00:02,702 --> 01:00:06,104
There's always something that they can, you know, I guess I understand your point.

1258
01:00:06,264 --> 01:00:09,606
If you're working on design, then there's not a lot that the engineering team can do

1259
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:10,607
without design.

1260
01:00:11,147 --> 01:00:13,688
But there is often stuff they can do for core tech.

1261
01:00:14,329 --> 01:00:18,331
So that is often what I have the team do if we're at the beginning of the project and

1262
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:19,111
there's dead time.

1263
01:00:20,615 --> 01:00:25,439
I have them focusing their energies as engineers on, OK, what is the core tech that we know

1264
01:00:25,479 --> 01:00:26,180
we're going to need?

1265
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,143
OK, start thinking about that and breaking down that task time.

1266
01:00:30,163 --> 01:00:37,289
I do find that generally in the beginning of the project, there is a little bit of R&D

1267
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:38,930
that goes on at the beginning of the project.

1268
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:42,293
So sometimes there is stuff that just has to be thrown out.

1269
01:00:42,353 --> 01:00:44,635
We're working on a project right now where there's...

1270
01:00:45,415 --> 01:00:46,356
There is some R&D.

1271
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:47,457
Some of it will be thrown out.

1272
01:00:47,537 --> 01:00:48,919
It's a really fast-turning project,

1273
01:00:48,959 --> 01:00:51,361
so we're going to throw it out really fast if we have to.

1274
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:55,184
But I think some of that is a little bit unavoidable.

1275
01:00:56,205 --> 01:00:59,828
The planning phase can be a little bit of a dead time.

1276
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:05,726
That's not necessarily the end of the world, but if you can get people working on core

1277
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:08,087
stuff, then that is always a good way to do it.

1278
01:01:08,647 --> 01:01:14,769
Or getting them talking to QA, or getting them thinking about other things that are

1279
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:17,530
going to be coming down the line that you have to be factoring in later.

1280
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,011
Does that make sense?

1281
01:01:20,651 --> 01:01:20,951
Thank you.

1282
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:23,192
Yeah.

1283
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:23,472
Okay.

1284
01:01:23,592 --> 01:01:24,432
Well, thanks, guys.
