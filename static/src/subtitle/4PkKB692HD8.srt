00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:10,768
Hello, my name is Soha. I'm a manager of diversity inclusion programs at Riot and

2
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:16,112
thank you for coming to see me talk this early in the morning. At some point

3
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:19,914
during my talk GDC is going to be sending you a survey to just ask you how

4
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:25,217
I did and this is really the first time that I'm speaking in an external way

5
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:29,340
about what we're doing at Riot so I would love to hear some feedback if

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,902
there's anything we can do to make it better for next time.

7
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:35,399
Or if you never want to see me speak again,

8
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,759
that's totally understandable.

9
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,580
I get it.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,160
And then at some point, I'm going

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,981
to do my best to make room at the end for talks.

12
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:45,382
We do have a mic in the middle of the room.

13
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:48,402
But if we run out of time, we have a wrap-up area

14
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:50,663
that we can go to.

15
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:54,584
And our lovely friends will help us get to it safely and soundly.

16
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:56,745
So yeah, thanks for coming.

17
00:00:57,835 --> 00:01:03,458
A heads up that I'll be shortening the words diversity and inclusion to D&I just because

18
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:07,119
I'm going to keep repeating the words over and over and over and driving myself and probably

19
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:07,700
you up the wall.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,642
So keep in mind, D&I means diversity and inclusion.

21
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:14,823
So some of the things that what I want to talk about today are some of the things that

22
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:19,966
I've learned as I'm journeying through different spaces of diversity inclusion leading up to

23
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:22,427
Riot and also during my time at Riot.

24
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:27,224
And the mouse isn't working.

25
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:27,724
Sweet.

26
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:28,024
Got it.

27
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:29,604
So when I say making it work, I don't

28
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:34,426
mean to suggest that there's a finite list of proven ways

29
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:36,206
to solve D&I. It's not like here's

30
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:38,066
a list of 10 things to do, and then bam,

31
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:40,067
you've got diversity and another five things,

32
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,887
and boom, you've got inclusion.

33
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:44,228
And there's also not one solution

34
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:46,749
that fits every single organization.

35
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:48,769
So you might find that things are different where

36
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:51,330
you work or the organizations that you're a part of.

37
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,286
It's not really an end result.

38
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:57,447
It's not like you do stuff and then you get diversity.

39
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:59,268
It's really more about ongoing actions

40
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:01,568
that shift and evolve and mature over time.

41
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:04,269
And really in the title of diversity and inclusion,

42
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:07,631
there's an implication that it's about learning

43
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:08,991
and embracing different perspectives.

44
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:11,772
And being someone who is willing to be a manager

45
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:13,933
in that space, that means being someone

46
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,173
who's willing to be challenged and question

47
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:17,194
your own assumptions and your own values

48
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:18,174
coming into the space.

49
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:19,655
It's really about a combination of.

50
00:02:23,047 --> 00:02:26,870
building bridges to create deep connections with people,

51
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,192
and also to embolden ourselves with a growth mindset.

52
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,794
And these are two things that I will get more into later on.

53
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:35,835
I wanna add something to the conversation about D&I

54
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:39,297
that I believe is missing from a lot of mainstream,

55
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:40,178
mainstream conversations.

56
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:42,439
It feels like this,

57
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,901
this subject kind of just exploded at some point

58
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:46,842
and now everybody's talking about it.

59
00:02:46,842 --> 00:02:50,564
And it's great, but we're also missing a few valuable

60
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,770
pieces of the puzzle that I believe are foundational.

61
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,791
You'll also hear me say like,

62
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:01,612
hey, this isn't about programs or training sessions

63
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:04,053
or courses or initiatives or policies.

64
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,974
And it's not to bash any of those things.

65
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:07,554
It's not to say those things don't work.

66
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,355
It's not to say that those things aren't valuable.

67
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,355
It's to say that before we get into that,

68
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:14,616
we really have to understand why we are choosing these things

69
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:16,417
why we're choosing a program or a course

70
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:19,178
or whatever sort of output comes out of that.

71
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:24,701
You can't really tack on products about improving DNI

72
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:28,503
unless you really understand the space that you're

73
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:32,365
working within, and on just a deep, fundamental, valuable

74
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,626
level in the organization that you're a part of.

75
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:38,508
So to step back, I'm going to do a deep dive

76
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:41,389
into my background leading up to Riot.

77
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,811
I get this question asked a lot, like, what do you do?

78
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:47,092
And it's mostly from people who are also interested in coming

79
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:47,693
into the space.

80
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,013
And I kind of have, like, a very wonky.

81
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:53,227
route getting into the role that I'm in today.

82
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:55,009
So I just wanted to talk about that a little bit.

83
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:59,232
And I feel like to, my philosophy on diversity

84
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:03,496
and inclusion has evolved in a way, hopefully,

85
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:06,498
and has matured alongside sort of my interest

86
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:07,479
coming into it.

87
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,401
So I've been a gamer my whole life.

88
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:13,724
My two earliest memories were actually in Saudi Arabia

89
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:14,744
and they were,

90
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:17,937
Michael Jackson's Moonwalker on Sega,

91
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:21,539
and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game on NES.

92
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,981
And when I was seven, my family had just immigrated

93
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,922
to Canada for about a couple years,

94
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:28,064
and I'm the youngest of a really big family.

95
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:29,344
So I was kind of left alone.

96
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,200
while they were teaching themselves English,

97
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,920
I was kind of left alone because like,

98
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,940
it's when you're five,

99
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,761
it's pretty easy to pick up another language.

100
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:42,762
So I had all these floppy disks that were like,

101
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,982
vocabulary games and math games in addition,

102
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:47,963
but then I found another floppy disk that had Doom 2.

103
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:51,404
And that's kind of when I became a gamer for,

104
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:52,684
and I knew that this is something that I wanted to do

105
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:55,705
for the rest of my life.

106
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:58,105
But when it came to like an academic and professional life,

107
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,642
I didn't get into games right away.

108
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:03,304
So at first I studied political science and criminology.

109
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:07,888
And I say it's because I wanted to be a human rights lawyer,

110
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:10,810
but I think I just wanted a sexy, crime-fighting forensics

111
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,091
job.

112
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:15,995
And fortunately, that dream dissipated.

113
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:20,038
But unfortunately, I took into film studies and philosophy,

114
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:23,881
so I wanted to be unemployed for the rest of my life.

115
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:26,083
But this is really the point where

116
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:32,354
I started looking at media and like representation in media

117
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:33,515
and race relations in media

118
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:37,298
and how powerful of a tool it can be.

119
00:05:37,298 --> 00:05:39,699
I specialize specifically in black exploitation cinema

120
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,741
and Palestinian cinema.

121
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,002
And this is where a lot of my interests

122
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:46,083
in terms of like, okay, the media that we have

123
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:46,984
is not just entertainment,

124
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:49,826
it could be something really meaningful and valuable.

125
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:54,068
And not just because we see diverse characters in something,

126
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:55,349
but they're actually,

127
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:55,429
the

128
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,799
Films in black exploitation in Palestinian cinema

129
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,520
are made by those people.

130
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,702
So it's very much an introspective externalization.

131
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:05,802
So I then moved to Toronto.

132
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:10,684
I pursued my master's in, again, nothing game related.

133
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:12,745
It was film and photographic preservation.

134
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:16,047
And strangely, this is actually

135
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:18,128
where my career in games began.

136
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,129
So Toronto has an awesome indie game scene.

137
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:23,190
And it was there that I stumbled upon

138
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:24,783
Dane's making games and they're like all here,

139
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:26,664
like dispersed throughout.

140
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:29,125
So if you see them, you should say hello to them

141
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,306
and find out what they're working on.

142
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,507
They're a great initiative.

143
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:35,228
It's a non-profit to support women and non-binary folks

144
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,450
to make games and provide them with mentorship

145
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,792
and accessible tools, particularly open source tools.

146
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:45,914
And this blew my mind because up until this point,

147
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:48,535
I hadn't really seen people make games

148
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,396
when they didn't have technical backgrounds.

149
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:54,969
one of the sort of myths about the tech industry

150
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,450
is that you have to be a programmer

151
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,092
or you have to be a computer scientist to make it big

152
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:01,273
and that's not true.

153
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:06,677
And this is where DMG really started to shape a lot

154
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:07,398
of how I felt about game making.

155
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:10,120
And really up until this point in my life,

156
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,641
I never really like played indie games.

157
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,023
It was mostly AAA games and the indie games

158
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:16,284
were ones that were on console.

159
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:17,105
It's not kind of like.

160
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:19,409
how today there's a lot of, you know,

161
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:21,090
there are marketplaces on consoles

162
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,290
where there's tons of indie games.

163
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,111
This was before that was happening.

164
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,632
So this was a really cool experience.

165
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:28,152
I volunteered with them for a couple of years

166
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:30,513
and then shortly after that,

167
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:31,834
I sat on their board of directors.

168
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:35,575
And this is where I seriously started thinking about

169
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:38,296
accessible game making and how many stories

170
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:40,697
that aren't represented in blockbuster games

171
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:43,778
that can be mobilized in, like, through indie game making.

172
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,806
One of my favorite highlights was Indigicaid.

173
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:50,327
And it's a collaboration between DMG

174
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:51,727
and the Indigenous Routes Collective

175
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:54,147
to teach a group of six indigenous girls and women

176
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:55,808
between the age of 13 to 24

177
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,108
on how to make their first video game from scratch.

178
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:01,469
And this was really eye-opening for me.

179
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:04,869
It was eye-opening to watch this group

180
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:06,970
give voice to their experiences and imaginations

181
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,970
in a way that is entirely new to them.

182
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,710
They were artists in different ways,

183
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,651
but this is the first time

184
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:14,191
that they're using game-making tools.

185
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:17,085
And like, game making is really intimidating.

186
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:19,546
Even when you know what you're doing,

187
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:21,666
it's an overwhelming career choice to get into.

188
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,768
And so mentoring just one of the women

189
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:27,048
to help her create her story,

190
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,549
that gave me a lot of hope for the future

191
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:32,170
of girls and women of color in games.

192
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,811
So at this point in my career,

193
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:36,871
I considered dropping out of grad school.

194
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:39,812
And I didn't, and there's like one reason

195
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:41,533
I feel like that I didn't drop out of grad school.

196
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:48,093
My master's thesis was so not what photo historians wanted to talk about or deal with that they

197
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,354
buddied me up with a game studies professor.

198
00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:58,920
So we just spent most of our time talking about Resident Evil and he was just like,

199
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,141
yeah, submit it whenever you're ready.

200
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:00,261
Sweet.

201
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:00,542
So one point.

202
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:06,666
But the changes really started in terms of the changes in how I thought about diverse

203
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,748
communities and indie game making.

204
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:12,997
it really started to foster when I worked

205
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:14,919
in community management for a mobile game studio

206
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,500
called Yukon.

207
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,704
And I was also lecturing about DIY game making on the side.

208
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:24,247
So I had the pleasure to speak at Brandeis at NYU.

209
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:27,009
I got to Skype into Birzeit University in Ramallah

210
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,671
in the West Bank, which is awesome.

211
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:30,792
I'm half Palestinian, so that was a really huge moment

212
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:31,693
for me.

213
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:35,436
And at the same time running workshops

214
00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:37,899
on text adventures game, text, that,

215
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,260
text adventure games, there we go.

216
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,110
at OCAD, York, and Ryerson University.

217
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,392
So at this point, I was particularly interested

218
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:50,594
in understanding marginalized communities and their voices.

219
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:53,595
And by that, I mean groups that are often not included

220
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:55,536
as part of the status quo.

221
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:56,796
They've been othered in society,

222
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,377
either implicitly or explicitly,

223
00:09:58,377 --> 00:10:02,519
due to differences in race, gender, sexuality,

224
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,000
disability, socioeconomic status, and religion, and so forth.

225
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:09,994
And I wanted to be part of including and appreciating

226
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:13,777
different voices outside of non-profits.

227
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:15,799
Like, non-profits, when you're already

228
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,780
a community of activists, it's quite easy

229
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,342
to kind of do a grassroots collaboration

230
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:22,744
and get started on D&I initiatives.

231
00:10:22,744 --> 00:10:28,769
What I wanted to do was actually work at an organization.

232
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,391
Because really, I wanted to normalize D&I.

233
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:33,673
I wanted to have it be something that we all can talk about

234
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:36,035
and that we all feel pretty comfortable talking about.

235
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:41,285
At first it was mostly about boosting marginalized voices,

236
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:43,966
but to also raise the quality bar

237
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:45,347
of teams in creative spaces.

238
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:49,368
So when Riot was looking for a manager of D&I programs,

239
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:51,149
I thought, this is the kind of role

240
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,750
I've been working towards.

241
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,111
You know, like despite the twists and turns in my life,

242
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:58,452
like a common thread is that I'm a pretty political person.

243
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:00,893
It's really difficult for me to view the world

244
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,254
in a way that's not influenced by my gender or my race.

245
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:06,095
That's always kind of a prevalent lens.

246
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,781
And this didn't change when I talked about games

247
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:13,702
or worked within them or mentored folks.

248
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:14,602
So in case this is a relatively new topic

249
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:16,983
for some of you in the audience,

250
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:20,784
I wanna just touch on the conversations

251
00:11:20,784 --> 00:11:22,885
about diversity and inclusion in the games

252
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:24,865
and the tech world and kind of circle back

253
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:28,387
into sort of how my philosophy has grown

254
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,527
leading up to my role.

255
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:31,968
So diversity is on a lot of people's minds.

256
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:34,477
with something like Facebook, Google, Apple.

257
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:37,277
They're releasing their demographic data every year,

258
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:40,378
and they're recognizing that, hey,

259
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:42,939
we have an overwhelming status quo.

260
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:46,340
We want to be better at representing under,

261
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,501
at including underrepresented groups to have better balance

262
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,722
and to have, you know, better outcomes.

263
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:54,582
Because there's a lot of evidence

264
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:56,823
to support the benefits of the DNI.

265
00:11:56,823 --> 00:12:00,404
When a group of people is trying to solve a complex problem,

266
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:01,384
progress often results.

267
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:05,023
from when diverse perspectives are brought in.

268
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:09,005
So it's not just about how smart or capable you are,

269
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,166
but how much you're willing to look at a problem

270
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,988
through a multitude of different ways

271
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:15,268
and then you land a breakthrough.

272
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,190
So when a group of intelligent individuals

273
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,391
are trying to solve a problem,

274
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:22,632
the diversity of those individuals

275
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:25,113
has just as much if not more potential

276
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:27,775
than just their ability or their education alone.

277
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:32,560
And there's also evidence that implicit biases

278
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,121
and stereotypes break down trust

279
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,343
and productivity and morale in teams.

280
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:40,725
So our implicit biases refer to attitudes

281
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,125
or stereotypes that affect our decisions.

282
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,627
They also affect our understanding and our actions

283
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:47,789
in an unintended or unconscious way.

284
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:49,670
So they're pervasive.

285
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,391
They usually favor our own in-group

286
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:55,533
and they actually don't always align

287
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,815
with what our declared beliefs are.

288
00:12:57,815 --> 00:12:58,115
So we can.

289
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:04,486
say one thing but our implicit biases actually that affect our actions indicate maybe sometimes

290
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,187
the opposite or just a different route.

291
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:14,109
So these sorts of biases create echo chambers or groupthink, and that's detrimental to teams

292
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:15,410
and individuals in them.

293
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,931
They impact how we communicate, which can also dominate what

294
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:25,726
sort of direction you're going through on a project, or if you are in a meeting about

295
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:30,047
maybe compensation or performance management. That's a lot of areas where our biases can

296
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:35,328
trickle in. So it sounds pretty obvious that, you know, we'd want to be working on these

297
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:42,970
spaces. If diversity of thought coming from a diversity of people and a diversity of experiences

298
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:49,212
is a good thing, then let's fix it. But it's difficult. Getting it right is complicated.

299
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,843
And one of the first reasons, honestly,

300
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:54,684
is that it's really overwhelming.

301
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:58,845
Diversity and inclusion,

302
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:01,785
some of the most common sorts of concerns that I hear

303
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:03,785
is that it focuses on one group over other.

304
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:06,846
Like, you have to include everybody in this,

305
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,726
and that can be overwhelming,

306
00:14:07,726 --> 00:14:08,946
and you have to start somewhere,

307
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:09,707
and where do you start,

308
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,827
and why do you start with that group, et cetera, et cetera.

309
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:12,407
And on top of understanding,

310
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:20,057
different experiences and different perspectives,

311
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:21,818
it takes a lot of introspection

312
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:23,679
to break down implicit biases,

313
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,541
and that doesn't always feel great.

314
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:31,703
Like, whether we like it or not, we all have biases.

315
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:34,885
It's neurologically impossible to not have them.

316
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:36,566
And it can be really uncomfortable

317
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:39,907
to try and unlearn our socializations,

318
00:14:39,907 --> 00:14:42,069
the things that we grew up thinking,

319
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:43,889
like, this has always been like this,

320
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:44,890
it's always been this way,

321
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,930
these jokes have always been funny.

322
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,461
That's hard to undo.

323
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:52,043
So, for example, if any of you have ever had

324
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:53,744
to address your own privilege,

325
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:55,945
you'll know that it's a very uncomfortable thing

326
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:57,546
to do at first.

327
00:14:57,546 --> 00:15:01,227
Privilege seems like a very dirty, very loaded word.

328
00:15:01,227 --> 00:15:05,349
And really, it's more about, it's a study

329
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:08,731
of how we all have blind spots due to our lived experiences.

330
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:11,672
And there's no way that you are going

331
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:13,613
to understand every lived experiences

332
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,474
just because you haven't actually experienced them.

333
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:16,855
That's all that it really means.

334
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,661
It's that recognition that, okay, this doesn't affect me,

335
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:22,422
but I also have never had that experience.

336
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,766
So I understand that you also haven't had my experiences

337
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:27,386
and so forth.

338
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,388
But the thing is, like every one of us,

339
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,530
we wanna believe that the reason we're successful in life

340
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,552
is due to a constant hard work.

341
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:36,733
When the revelation is made that, hey,

342
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,575
we actually all face different obstacles,

343
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:41,017
and sometimes that means that you are further ahead

344
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:43,158
than others by things that you can't control,

345
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:46,421
like gender or race or wealth or physical ability.

346
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:48,743
it can feel like a punch to the gut.

347
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:51,784
And it's especially complicated

348
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,444
when identities are made up of balancing intersections

349
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:58,365
of their advantages and disadvantages

350
00:15:58,365 --> 00:15:59,766
from majority and minority groups.

351
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:02,926
So for example, I'm a woman, I'm a woman of color,

352
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,466
I face sexism, I face racism,

353
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:09,308
but I also have high education, I have a good job.

354
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:12,588
There's all of these things that sort of make up like,

355
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:13,968
hey, these are places I don't struggle,

356
00:16:13,968 --> 00:16:15,449
but these are places that I have struggled.

357
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,021
And it's important to see ourselves

358
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:23,543
as a sum of many parts and that they're not necessarily

359
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:24,503
opposites, right?

360
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:25,983
They're not like battling with each other.

361
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,544
They're more of just tensions and frictions

362
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:30,185
that we just have to understand on a deeper level.

363
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:31,145
Another reason diversity initiatives

364
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:33,826
are difficult to get right comes from a belief

365
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,308
that people should be rewarded based

366
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:42,850
on their merit, which is based on their ability and effort.

367
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,130
This is what's known as a meritocracy.

368
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,871
So meritocracy is like the best ideas rise to the top

369
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,692
based on whether or not they're actually the best ideas.

370
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:54,434
And that's a theoretically super sound,

371
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:56,655
fair, clean cut approach.

372
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:58,656
But in reality, there's evidence showing

373
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:00,537
that unchecked meritocracies can lead

374
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:02,198
to a higher likelihood of bias.

375
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:04,679
And that's because there's kind of this pursuit

376
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,781
of objectivity that's not really possible.

377
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:10,521
None of us can actually be truly objective.

378
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:13,603
And especially when we're working in creative spaces,

379
00:17:13,603 --> 00:17:13,863
that's.

380
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,150
that's even harder to become objective

381
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,111
because it's all about emotion and passion

382
00:17:19,111 --> 00:17:20,832
and gut feelings.

383
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:25,333
So, does that mean, fuck meritocracy,

384
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,393
let's never talk about it again,

385
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:27,874
let's do something different?

386
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:30,515
I would actually say not really.

387
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:31,855
I still think there's a benefit to it

388
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:35,396
if we're willing to actually make it work.

389
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,437
And using it as an aspiration,

390
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:39,858
that can actually help us identify

391
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,118
the behaviors that would stifle it.

392
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:42,178
So,

393
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:48,548
The sort of famous research that came out about,

394
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:51,049
it's called the Paradox of Meritocracy,

395
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,670
was made by Emilio J. Castilla.

396
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,172
And he's a professor at MIT's Sloan School of Management.

397
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:58,434
He's written extensively and researched extensively

398
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,695
about these issues.

399
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:02,556
And at a Stanford conference,

400
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:05,178
he was addressing the sort of like,

401
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:08,260
well, if it's a paradox, should we even try and pursue it?

402
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,401
And he says, it doesn't mean the pursuit is futile.

403
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,102
My research provides a cautionary lesson

404
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:18,104
that practices implemented to increase fairness and equity

405
00:18:18,104 --> 00:18:20,725
need to be carefully addressed,

406
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,448
need to be carefully thought through, sorry,

407
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,049
so that potential opportunities for biases are addressed.

408
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:31,172
And the thing is, it's a prevalent thing

409
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:33,333
in the tech industry, which we're a part of.

410
00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:36,736
So meritocracy is a core belief at Riot,

411
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,917
and we recently had a roundtable internally

412
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,079
to talk about specifically the intersection

413
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,100
of meritocracy and diversity.

414
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,161
What influences it, what doesn't influence it?

415
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:47,562
Like we actually have to address this problem

416
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:50,623
instead of sort of being too afraid to say like,

417
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:52,464
hey, there's a problem with meritocracy.

418
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,146
I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna start any trouble.

419
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:55,986
It's like, no, let's talk about it.

420
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:58,988
Let's see how we can actually make this work.

421
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:01,629
We also have teams that are dedicated to building models

422
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:03,170
for solving this kind of issue.

423
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:03,270
Like.

424
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,781
How do you define fairness?

425
00:19:05,781 --> 00:19:08,242
And how do you know that somebody is being fairly rewarded

426
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:09,623
or fairly recognized?

427
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:14,285
The more aware of where we can all make mistakes as humans

428
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:15,566
as part of the process,

429
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:19,428
the more likely that something as sort of idealistic

430
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:25,511
as meritocracy could actually be closer to be a reality.

431
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,372
And honestly, my philosophy

432
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:29,533
is that diversity and meritocracy,

433
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,274
they're not opposing ends of a spectrum.

434
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:32,575
It's not one or the other.

435
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,663
they're really working together in a symbiotic relationship.

436
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:39,746
Like, how do you know that you have the best ideas rising

437
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,988
to the top if everybody on the team

438
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:43,549
has very like-minded thoughts?

439
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,271
Like, if you're all in an echo chamber

440
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,812
and it's all groupthink, you're not actually

441
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:47,853
getting the best ideas.

442
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,614
You're getting what you think is the best idea.

443
00:19:49,614 --> 00:19:53,738
If more diverse perspectives are included,

444
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:56,561
will the best ideas that rise to the top

445
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:58,382
actually end up looking different from each other?

446
00:19:58,382 --> 00:19:58,763
And there's so much.

447
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:05,120
creativity bursting from marginalized communities in video games.

448
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,722
So if I could find a way to be part of including and inspiring and empowering

449
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:13,544
different voices and therefore help teams be more successful,

450
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,445
that's a future that I wanted to be a part of.

451
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:15,765
So fast forward,

452
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:19,486
I'm a D and I manager and my hope is that like I'm going to change the world.

453
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:24,988
I'm going to make it a better place and I'm going to do it my first 90 days

454
00:20:24,988 --> 00:20:27,789
preferably. Um, but you know,

455
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,411
no big deal if I need to wait a couple of months before making this like amazing

456
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:33,393
breakthrough in the world.

457
00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:36,294
I just wanted to make an impact really,

458
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:38,776
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy,

459
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:41,618
but I figured the first baby steps would be pretty clear.

460
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:45,820
Like, okay, let's partner with diversity initiatives, easy.

461
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,182
And hey, if implicit biases are a problem,

462
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:50,863
let's develop courses and training

463
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:52,444
and programs to tackle them.

464
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:54,125
So cool, plan is all laid out.

465
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,166
And none of it happens.

466
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:55,406
And.

467
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:03,559
There's really no shortage of support.

468
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,801
It wasn't like anybody stopped me

469
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,064
from pursuing the plans that I had laid out.

470
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:10,046
It really wasn't about that.

471
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:13,910
It was that for all the nuance involved in this space

472
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,933
and how overwhelming and intimidating it can be,

473
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,995
people are actually very curious

474
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:21,177
about making diversity and inclusion work.

475
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,719
want to get involved.

476
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:27,421
There's really no one stopping me.

477
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:30,262
But I was just missing a vital piece of the information,

478
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:33,944
which is really that if you want to make something work,

479
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:37,606
you have to understand why you're doing it

480
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:40,888
on a very foundational, fundamental, philosophical level.

481
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:44,090
The problem is that I spent a lot of time

482
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,091
trying to tack on solutions

483
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:48,792
to an existing organizational culture

484
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,013
without deeply understanding

485
00:21:50,013 --> 00:21:51,274
how they'll interact with each other.

486
00:21:52,026 --> 00:21:53,006
I was essentially undoing my own work

487
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:53,747
and doing myself a huge disservice.

488
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,228
So what I really needed to do was step back

489
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:56,428
and reassess my own assumptions coming into this place,

490
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:57,329
coming into this line of work.

491
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:58,609
So two months into my role,

492
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,510
Harvard Business Review published an article titled,

493
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,371
Diversity Policies Rarely Make Companies Fairer

494
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:03,512
and They Feel Threatening to White Men,

495
00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:05,433
which is a brutal, which is a brutal headline.

496
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:26,869
And to summarize what, and it's always the case

497
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:28,350
where it's like the headline is super brutal,

498
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,973
but like the content is actually like pretty chill.

499
00:22:31,973 --> 00:22:33,995
Like it's not like crazy.

500
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:35,456
But to summarize, it found that companies

501
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:38,698
that were using the existence of a diversity policy,

502
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:42,221
they use it as a logical or legal defense

503
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:45,564
to sort of discount claims of unfair treatment.

504
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:49,347
And white men who were the status quo in these examples,

505
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:51,616
they perceived women and minorities

506
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:53,757
as being treated differently,

507
00:22:53,757 --> 00:22:55,278
so they perceived it as they were then

508
00:22:55,278 --> 00:22:56,578
being treated unfairly.

509
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:59,059
They were the ones being treated differently too,

510
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:00,860
but in a negative way.

511
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,101
It's hard for me to not panic at first reading this,

512
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:07,563
because it's like, I just got hired to do this.

513
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,125
But it actually makes sense.

514
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,306
And I was like the first person to sort of,

515
00:23:13,306 --> 00:23:19,811
that Riot hired to tackle these issues, sorry, head on.

516
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:22,153
People had been thinking and talking about diversity.

517
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:24,235
They were super involved in it,

518
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:26,536
especially since in the games and tech industry specifically

519
00:23:26,536 --> 00:23:29,098
it was kind of exploding all of a sudden.

520
00:23:29,098 --> 00:23:30,559
Everybody wanted to talk about it.

521
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,241
But this is the first time somebody who's me

522
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:35,403
was like hired to work on this full time

523
00:23:35,403 --> 00:23:36,824
and actually develop a solution.

524
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:43,161
So, small panic attack over after reading that article,

525
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:46,483
I realized that these reactions make complete sense.

526
00:23:46,483 --> 00:23:49,605
These reactions to policies and trainings

527
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:52,327
and sort of like sensitivity training sessions,

528
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:54,929
they make sense.

529
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,151
And the reason I feel it's because

530
00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:00,132
people don't change because of company policy.

531
00:24:00,132 --> 00:24:00,613
I feel like

532
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,728
There are some folks in here who work in HR

533
00:24:02,728 --> 00:24:05,211
can probably attest to that, where it's like,

534
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,333
yeah, if you put up a policy,

535
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,776
it's not like everybody's going to be suddenly inspired

536
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:10,518
to change all of the behaviors

537
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:12,000
that are included with that policy.

538
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:16,964
focusing on policies doesn't actually address

539
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:19,126
the root cause of exclusionary behavior.

540
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,607
And diversity policies especially,

541
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,729
they can create an illusion that's not real.

542
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,530
They can create an illusion that different people

543
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,412
are treated, that they're unfairly rewarded

544
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,873
or unfairly treated or that they're

545
00:24:29,873 --> 00:24:31,094
too fairly treated and rewarded.

546
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,756
And that causes a lot of tension and resentment internally.

547
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:36,077
So we're pretty quick to think of tactics like policies

548
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:45,917
or trainings to solve D&I issues.

549
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,138
But without understanding what it is that we're aiming for

550
00:24:48,138 --> 00:24:49,219
or trying to learn or trying to change,

551
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:50,059
a lot of damage can be unintentionally done

552
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,099
because of distrust or misperceptions.

553
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,040
So there are a couple of key values

554
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,140
that I wanted to share today

555
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,341
that I found particularly helpful for my own growth

556
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:55,241
as a diversity inclusion manager.

557
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:10,758
And my hypothesis is that hopefully what I share

558
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:12,679
can help programs be successful and meaningful

559
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,799
and have lasting effect.

560
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,940
So it's not about not having programs.

561
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,321
It's not about not having policies.

562
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:20,162
It's about understanding why you're doing them.

563
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:22,403
So as a D&I manager, I'm obviously, I'm for the people.

564
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:26,185
And that probably sounds super obvious,

565
00:25:26,185 --> 00:25:29,486
but it's all people.

566
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,868
Everybody wants to talk to the diversity inclusion manager

567
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:34,329
because we all have different experiences

568
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:36,890
that we believe are valuable to our teams.

569
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,675
But there was this light bulb moment

570
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:43,397
that where I had to pivot how I engaged with everyone,

571
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:45,259
not just everybody at my work,

572
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:47,861
but also in the industry as well.

573
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:51,444
This is the part of the larger sort of D&I discourse

574
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:54,406
that I feel like a lot of professionals don't stress

575
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:56,708
and it can be really easy to take for granted.

576
00:25:58,212 --> 00:26:01,654
Because I came in thinking like, all right, I'm an advocate.

577
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:03,435
I'm going to find all the underrepresented groups.

578
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:05,397
I'm going to peer them out.

579
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,878
And I'm going to create programs and initiatives

580
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:08,618
based on what they need.

581
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:11,940
And that sounds like a great thing to do.

582
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,941
Because it's not a bad thing to do.

583
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:16,863
That's not a negative solution.

584
00:26:16,863 --> 00:26:20,466
But without taking the time to understand the majority groups

585
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:23,047
that these underrepresented groups are collaborating

586
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:26,309
with on a daily basis and working with on a daily basis.

587
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:40,795
Programs and trainings and so forth that are targeting the majority groups will probably feel a little bit like this

588
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:43,316
Gentle persuasion

589
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:48,218
So especially with the current political climate

590
00:26:48,218 --> 00:26:53,220
Building bridges to each other now is more crucial than ever

591
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,200
So NPR published an article

592
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:57,396
about how after the American election,

593
00:26:57,396 --> 00:27:00,558
there was this new version of us versus them,

594
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:03,000
and where professional peacemakers,

595
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,802
who would be diversity managers,

596
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:07,263
share some of the immediate challenges

597
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:09,464
of a deeply divided country,

598
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:12,086
like addressing the concerns of people

599
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:14,007
usually thought of as privileged,

600
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,169
or having to navigate a language minefield

601
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,651
where the wrong word can ignite conflict.

602
00:27:20,463 --> 00:27:23,324
And speaking of my own personal experiences after the election,

603
00:27:23,324 --> 00:27:26,645
it was just like all of a sudden everybody on Facebook had an opinion

604
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,186
and everybody wanted to tell you it.

605
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:33,368
And there was just like threads of drama and blocking and freak outs.

606
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:36,009
And it makes, like, there's a lot of anxiety right now.

607
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:37,970
There is a lot of tension.

608
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,071
And there's an uptick that, you know,

609
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:42,192
I don't think a lot of people were expecting to see in 2017.

610
00:27:42,192 --> 00:27:45,553
We're seeing more division and resentment.

611
00:27:45,553 --> 00:27:48,074
It's leading to isolation.

612
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:49,635
It's resorting to groupthink.

613
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:53,263
and we're starting to fear the unknown.

614
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:56,425
And there's a restlessness and a whirlwind of breaking news.

615
00:27:56,425 --> 00:28:00,607
Like every day, something new is happening and it's awful.

616
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:02,668
And it's like moving leaders and managers

617
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:04,009
to sort of have to realize,

618
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:06,210
how do I keep the calm internally?

619
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,292
And how do I like call for everybody to unite?

620
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:14,528
And there's also growing research on how social media

621
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,528
is disrupting the way that we communicate with each other

622
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,569
about specifically political issues.

623
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:22,049
And I've been seeing a lot of parallels personally

624
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:26,810
with how that's been specifically

625
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,091
affecting the D&I conversation.

626
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:31,291
And if we don't address the sort of disconnect

627
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,732
that's happening between how people look at each other

628
00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:35,872
politically and how people look at each other,

629
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:38,313
how people communicate to each other on social media,

630
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:40,193
I feel like we're ignoring a vital piece of the puzzle.

631
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,732
And it's most recently played an unprecedented role

632
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:48,973
in the American election and in the current administration.

633
00:28:48,973 --> 00:28:52,294
Like in January, we saw press secretary Sean Spicer,

634
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:55,236
the Spice Man, hold up a printed tweet

635
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:57,436
to address it at an actual press conference.

636
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,437
Like at the rate that we're going,

637
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:01,638
we're gonna see political tweets in textbooks.

638
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:03,479
It's gonna be part of language.

639
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:07,175
And like, listen, like as a millennial,

640
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:09,516
I hate when people blame shit on social media,

641
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:10,417
even though that's like low key

642
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,118
what I'm trying to do right now.

643
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:15,199
Because obviously like majority and minority tensions,

644
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:17,960
like tensions between majority and minority groups,

645
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,921
that's been around forever.

646
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:25,443
But it's impossible to kind of ignore the growing impact

647
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:28,284
of how online spaces directly frame

648
00:29:28,284 --> 00:29:30,545
and affect the conversations that we have in person

649
00:29:30,545 --> 00:29:31,906
as colleagues and as teammates.

650
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,052
And we in the games industry especially,

651
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:39,395
we have a lexicon that's built almost entirely

652
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:41,337
on how we speak on the internet.

653
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:43,479
Like we engage and care about an audience

654
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:46,462
that knows the ins and outs of Reddit.

655
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:48,384
They call us out for misusing memes

656
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:51,327
and make sure to know that we're embarrassing ourselves.

657
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:53,870
And they can easily out shit post all of us combined.

658
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:58,900
In terms of social media affecting D&I in games,

659
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,881
a number of initiatives and movements began as hashtags,

660
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:04,642
and they sparked into something bigger.

661
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:07,263
So this point and example,

662
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,464
it began as hashtag one reason why,

663
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:11,945
where a designer asked on Twitter

664
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:13,866
why there are so few women creating games,

665
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:16,227
and hundreds of women responded

666
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:18,128
with anecdotes of sexism in the industry.

667
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:20,208
And that evolved into hashtag one reason to be.

668
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:21,689
And this was started,

669
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:29,289
again on Twitter in response by narrative designer Rihanna Pratchett

670
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:33,553
as to the positive reasons of why women are in games and why

671
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:36,895
they should stay in games and why they should pursue their career

672
00:30:36,895 --> 00:30:41,599
in games. And this evolved into a series of GDC panels where women

673
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,602
and minorities empower each other and inspire creators to make the industry

674
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:48,925
more inclusive and to make us a better place.

675
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:51,227
We also can't deny how

676
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,823
social media field groups like GamerGate or the alt-right,

677
00:30:55,823 --> 00:30:58,364
and that have hugely impacted the conversations

678
00:30:58,364 --> 00:30:59,305
that we have every day about D&I.

679
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:04,548
So what we're seeing is kind of like this wild evolution

680
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:07,110
of not only media and how media is changing,

681
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,771
but also our language with each other.

682
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:12,233
Because on the one hand, you have free, accessible tools

683
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:14,775
that are potential platforms and opportunities,

684
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:17,897
which is a key part of mobilizing groups and ideas.

685
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:18,417
And on the other hand,

686
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:24,713
you have free accessible tools that are potential platforms

687
00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:28,174
and opportunities, which is a key part of mobilizing groups

688
00:31:28,174 --> 00:31:28,554
and ideas.

689
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,255
So you have this potential for greater good

690
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:34,116
and incredible change and this other potential

691
00:31:34,116 --> 00:31:35,637
of just raging dumpster fires.

692
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:40,758
But really what I've noticed the most within this new lexicon

693
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:44,219
is that we have a tendency to group people

694
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:45,360
and shorthand them with labels

695
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,860
that are loaded with assumptions.

696
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:50,790
I've seen far too many conversations and I've like,

697
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,550
I've had to catch myself from being part

698
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,911
of those conversations where we devolve

699
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:57,812
into a reductive dismissal of the other person

700
00:31:57,812 --> 00:31:59,993
and those reductive dismissals like appear

701
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:01,553
on social media first.

702
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:04,854
So like, you're a Bernie bro or you're a Feminazi

703
00:32:04,854 --> 00:32:06,815
or like you're a triggered snowflake.

704
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:10,116
Like that all happens online but we actually use

705
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:12,017
that sort of thinking too in person.

706
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:15,298
And it's this quick clumping of.

707
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:20,629
people to an online identity, it bleeds into the way that we talk to each other in real

708
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:21,749
life.

709
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:29,115
And even if we're more politically or philosophically aligned than not, I can't say that I'm entirely

710
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:29,836
surprised.

711
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:34,439
There are years of shorthanding and labeling and grouping that we've socially assigned

712
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:37,622
each other that up until this point we're a very divided country.

713
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:42,426
We're reducing each other to identities and affiliations and not considering much else.

714
00:32:43,624 --> 00:32:46,225
There is a great talk by Howard J. Ross,

715
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:50,647
who he spoke about managing fear,

716
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:52,808
managing bias in a time of fear.

717
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:56,049
And it was all specifically about this kind of work,

718
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:57,429
where it's like, how do you,

719
00:32:57,429 --> 00:32:58,810
people feel a lot of anxiety,

720
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,131
where it's like, there the rise of sort of like,

721
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:03,092
Black Lives Matter, and then people feeling like,

722
00:33:03,092 --> 00:33:04,632
do you mean like only Black Lives Matter,

723
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:06,453
or like Black Lives Matter too?

724
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:09,614
And then it kind of grows and grows,

725
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:10,895
and especially with the election, you have,

726
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:13,856
people reducing to each other to like,

727
00:33:13,856 --> 00:33:17,657
what do you believe in and what do you believe in

728
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:18,617
versus anything else.

729
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:20,017
We've lost a lot of nuance.

730
00:33:20,017 --> 00:33:23,678
So as a D&I manager, if I'm working for the people,

731
00:33:23,678 --> 00:33:25,139
I have to understand what makes them tick,

732
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:29,340
what gives them pause, or else nothing that I give them

733
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,241
is gonna address the root sort of cause

734
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:34,402
of intolerance or exclusion.

735
00:33:35,592 --> 00:33:38,835
That means engaging with people I vehemently disagree with.

736
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:40,436
And mind you, I'm not talking about trolls.

737
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:42,357
I'm talking about people that you're working with,

738
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:45,499
people in your industry, your peer group.

739
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:48,321
If we believe that games are such a profound,

740
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:49,863
core part of our lives,

741
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,884
then we have to be working together on this.

742
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,812
And it's not easy.

743
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:56,793
Coming from, oops, sorry,

744
00:33:56,793 --> 00:33:58,634
just like brushed up against my mic,

745
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:00,655
that probably didn't sound great.

746
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:04,818
Coming from a non-profit that's rooted in social activism

747
00:34:04,818 --> 00:34:06,499
and moving directly into the industry

748
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:08,621
where this is a conversation people are having

749
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:11,923
for the first time, that made me have to stop

750
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:14,665
and sort of refamiliarize myself with how I got into.

751
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:20,575
this space and the sort of ways that I've stumbled along the way.

752
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:25,177
And that can be super humbling and grounding and a reminder that we all have to start somewhere.

753
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:30,779
So when we focus on building relationships, we're making an effort to find where bridges

754
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:34,500
can connect, not watch them burn in the rearview mirror.

755
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,381
And that's just one part of my hypothesis.

756
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:39,291
You know, I'm not only invested in working with people

757
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:43,132
who are heavily affected by diversity concerns,

758
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:47,613
but also the skeptics and especially the people

759
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:49,334
who are indifferent, the people who can kind of take it

760
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:52,254
or leave it or never really had an opinion either way.

761
00:34:52,254 --> 00:34:57,136
And again, that might sound really painfully obvious,

762
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:00,136
but like it's super blindsiding when that is not part

763
00:35:00,136 --> 00:35:03,997
of the core conversations that we have in D&I as a peer group.

764
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:07,511
And another core part in navigating the space

765
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:08,631
in a way that feels more authentic

766
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:10,693
and is more meaningful to me

767
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:13,054
is by fostering an organizational mindset

768
00:35:13,054 --> 00:35:14,615
that embraces diversity.

769
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:18,797
And that means digging deep into a company culture

770
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:21,359
and embedding values and frameworks of thought

771
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,221
when it comes to diversity seamlessly into it.

772
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:28,263
Diversity is more like a model that matures over time

773
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:30,605
and taking shortcuts in order to increase head counts

774
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:31,925
or improve quotas.

775
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:36,792
aren't addressing the real problem of what might actually be alienating people, which

776
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,773
could very well be your company culture.

777
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:44,014
So knowing the core values of a company is when D&I programs become more of a rational

778
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:44,354
choice.

779
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:49,996
Like obviously we would go for something like this instead of giving way to sort of a righteous

780
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:54,057
moral stance or paying lip service to what's seen as a hot topic issue.

781
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:58,378
Again, investing in this is not just a theoretically good thing to do.

782
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:02,669
It's something that gives companies competitive edge

783
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:03,889
and makes them more innovative.

784
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:07,009
So let's say, for example, as a company,

785
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:10,010
you value teamwork and creativity,

786
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,671
and that's kind of seen what's upholding the company vision.

787
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:18,212
What you can do is that maybe instead of adding training

788
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:19,732
that's like high-level implicit biases,

789
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:22,612
hey, here are all the different biases that you can have,

790
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:24,133
a solution would be to actually put together

791
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:26,253
like a team-building workshop.

792
00:36:27,797 --> 00:36:31,019
to address biases and behaviors that exclude other people who

793
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:32,340
are trying to collaborate with each other.

794
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,562
And this is obviously where diversity heavily overlaps

795
00:36:35,562 --> 00:36:38,903
into biases and how they can break down team morale.

796
00:36:38,903 --> 00:36:42,846
It's this alignment of, hey, well, if we care about teams,

797
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:45,787
then on the positive side, this is

798
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,509
what a healthy team looks like and the results that they get.

799
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:50,950
And on a negative side, this is how toxicity can form.

800
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,052
That could be a better starting point

801
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:56,473
to actually start initiating changes.

802
00:36:57,365 --> 00:37:03,008
to address actual root causes, to get people to look more deeply into themselves and to

803
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:05,109
be more introspective.

804
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:09,851
So embedding diversity of thought as like a core tenet of a company's mental model,

805
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:16,014
that's really helped me understand how to connect with my peers in a deeper way regardless

806
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:18,235
of our political or philosophical differences.

807
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:21,948
Because now we have a value that binds us,

808
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:25,831
and it's the value, it's why we come to work every day.

809
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:27,393
It's our common ground.

810
00:37:27,393 --> 00:37:31,936
A mindset that encourages diversity, in my opinion,

811
00:37:31,936 --> 00:37:34,318
is psychologist Carol Dweck's growth mindset principle,

812
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,220
which I mentioned at the beginning of my talk.

813
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,762
So to summarize, Dweck makes a distinction

814
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:39,983
between two mindsets.

815
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:41,784
The first is a fixed mindset,

816
00:37:41,784 --> 00:37:43,806
and this is when people believe qualities

817
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:44,987
like intelligence or talent

818
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:46,868
are predetermined or unchangeable traits.

819
00:37:47,553 --> 00:37:49,074
and that influences how they grow.

820
00:37:49,074 --> 00:37:51,056
So students, Dweck found that students

821
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:55,200
that have a fixed mindset are more likely to learn slower,

822
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,942
they're more likely to give up on challenges,

823
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,743
and they're more likely to avoid taking risks.

824
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:02,527
A growth mindset is when people believe

825
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:04,009
that qualities can be developed

826
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:05,930
through dedication and hard work.

827
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,012
It's like building a muscle.

828
00:38:07,012 --> 00:38:10,735
So she found that students who embrace growth mindsets

829
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:11,956
were more likely to learn quickly.

830
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:20,467
and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve rather than confirmations that,

831
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:24,028
well, I was never good at this to begin with, so why should I even do it?

832
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:29,430
Applying that framework to an organizational mindset is so important.

833
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,030
Like when a company embraces a growth mindset,

834
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,672
the kinds of people that thrive are the ones who aren't afraid of being wrong.

835
00:38:35,672 --> 00:38:38,513
They're the ones that are not afraid of making mistakes.

836
00:38:38,513 --> 00:38:42,654
They see conflicts and tensions as learning opportunities.

837
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:49,523
And they see different perspectives that test their own

838
00:38:49,523 --> 00:38:50,503
as ultimately positive and educational.

839
00:38:50,503 --> 00:38:51,183
And really up until this point,

840
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:54,024
I had been so hyper-focused on delivering DNI as a product.

841
00:38:54,024 --> 00:38:57,485
Like, here it is, diversity and inclusion, we did it.

842
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:05,948
And like leaders in that, like, sorry, totally jumped ahead.

843
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,222
The thing is that no one solves it.

844
00:39:11,222 --> 00:39:13,203
Even as researchers uncover more data

845
00:39:13,203 --> 00:39:15,105
about the inclusion of underrepresented groups,

846
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,066
we're still finding more problems.

847
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:21,069
So as companies are including more people,

848
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:22,331
they're finding that they're actually

849
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:23,872
maybe including more white women.

850
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:25,793
There's more diversity of white women.

851
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:27,535
And black indigenous people of color

852
00:39:27,535 --> 00:39:28,956
are still being underrepresented.

853
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:32,280
And there's a lot of sociological layers

854
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,965
kind of mixed in that you have to be aware of.

855
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:37,567
And when you're thinking of a global mindset,

856
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:39,069
if it's a global company,

857
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:41,412
you have to understand that the problems

858
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,834
that affect North America

859
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:44,536
are not the problems that affect Brazil.

860
00:39:44,536 --> 00:39:46,058
They're not the problems that affect Turkey.

861
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:46,839
You have to really.

862
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:50,461
think deeply and when you embrace a growth mindset,

863
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:52,843
that means that as more data is uncovered

864
00:39:52,843 --> 00:39:57,326
about how diversity can keep diversifying,

865
00:39:57,326 --> 00:40:01,289
leaders in the space can develop alongside those changes.

866
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:04,972
And one of the examples is the way

867
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:07,294
that hiring managers think about candidates.

868
00:40:07,294 --> 00:40:13,138
Like if you're prioritizing people who wanna hire,

869
00:40:13,138 --> 00:40:14,859
if you're prioritizing learners,

870
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:22,409
not people who are self-proclaimed geniuses or rock stars,

871
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:25,112
you're creating a possibility for growth.

872
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:27,654
Learners, they know they don't have all the solutions,

873
00:40:27,654 --> 00:40:30,337
but they will do whatever it takes to get them.

874
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:32,179
And they'll see failure as part of the process.

875
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,031
and not as a setback or a reason to give up.

876
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:37,912
And this tactic is actually specifically to target

877
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:41,934
women who either opt out of applying to jobs

878
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:43,834
that say like, hey, we want rock stars,

879
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:45,175
hey, we want geniuses,

880
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:47,636
because they're less likely to see themselves as such,

881
00:40:47,636 --> 00:40:49,356
but if they do go through the process,

882
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:51,797
they're more likely to be stereotyped against

883
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:54,018
as not being geniuses and not being rock stars.

884
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,841
So a fixed mindset will probably tell you

885
00:40:57,841 --> 00:40:59,862
that this is a risky thing to do.

886
00:40:59,862 --> 00:41:03,504
But I do want to add that yes,

887
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:06,425
it's risky to hire people based on their potential

888
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:09,326
versus here is proof that I have done

889
00:41:09,326 --> 00:41:11,687
all the rockstar awesome genius things in my life.

890
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:18,519
But keep in mind that our industry is almost entirely based on taking risks.

891
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,360
From crowd-sourced indie-developed games

892
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,801
to the ambitious of new studios or first-timers,

893
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:27,723
the chances of failure are extremely high all the time.

894
00:41:27,723 --> 00:41:30,304
And a growth mindset can extend outside the hiring process, too.

895
00:41:30,304 --> 00:41:33,086
So there's an awesome podcast, it's called Code Switch.

896
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:37,928
I talk about it all the time, so of course I'm going to shoehorn it here.

897
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:38,868
It's called Code Switch.

898
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:41,730
It's by journalists Shireen Marisol Maragi and Jeanne Demby.

899
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,471
And one episode featured Professor Catherine Orr,

900
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:48,071
who teaches courses on whiteness

901
00:41:48,071 --> 00:41:51,152
as part of critical identity studies at Beloit College.

902
00:41:51,152 --> 00:41:54,153
So she framed the teaching of race relations

903
00:41:54,153 --> 00:41:56,933
specifically with regards to white privilege

904
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:57,993
as an intellectual habit.

905
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:01,334
And that means that her class would ask themselves

906
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:03,474
questions that have to do with understanding

907
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:04,915
who they are in the room.

908
00:42:04,915 --> 00:42:07,555
How or why did they get to where they are?

909
00:42:07,555 --> 00:42:09,095
And then allowing those questions

910
00:42:09,095 --> 00:42:12,116
to begin informing their situations outside the classroom.

911
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,901
So teaching complex, nuanced topics related to diversity

912
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:19,881
as if it was an intellectual habit,

913
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:22,902
that would have all of us stop and ask ourselves,

914
00:42:22,902 --> 00:42:25,462
why do I prefer living in this neighborhood?

915
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:28,203
Why do I not feel great when a friend of mine

916
00:42:28,203 --> 00:42:34,164
who looks different than me has this controversial view

917
00:42:34,164 --> 00:42:35,305
on my favorite hobby?

918
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,365
Why did I feel really great about that candidate?

919
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:40,106
The concept of a growth mindset where D&I concepts

920
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:42,666
and experiences that we have about D&I

921
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:48,861
That is what ultimately, if we're thinking about things as an intellectual habit,

922
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:52,244
that can fundamentally shift the conversations that we have.

923
00:42:52,244 --> 00:42:56,629
And ultimately, that will be the thing that affects programs and trainings and initiatives.

924
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,002
So where do I go from here?

925
00:43:02,002 --> 00:43:03,444
I've been thinking about this problem space

926
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:05,025
for just over a year now.

927
00:43:05,025 --> 00:43:08,128
And for starters, D&I at Riot,

928
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:11,251
it originally sat as a pod of just me.

929
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:15,836
Like I'm the diversity and inclusion person team right here.

930
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:16,677
And it sat within talent,

931
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,979
which is our human resources discipline.

932
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:20,961
And I was mostly thinking about like,

933
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:22,202
okay, how do I affect?

934
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,762
learning and development. How do I affect our rewards and perks? How do we make that

935
00:43:27,762 --> 00:43:32,424
more inclusive? How do we make things more diverse? But this year we're actually building

936
00:43:32,424 --> 00:43:37,446
an initiative in the company that works directly on defining, strengthening, and expanding

937
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:39,607
the foundations of our organizational culture.

938
00:43:40,796 --> 00:43:44,319
So our team is now dedicated to keeping a pulse on culture,

939
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,162
which means codifying the values that we find crucial

940
00:43:47,162 --> 00:43:50,085
and how we work together and communicate with each other

941
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:53,628
and ensuring that those values are baked into projects

942
00:43:53,628 --> 00:43:55,130
and programs across Riot.

943
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:58,953
And that affects things like manager development

944
00:43:58,953 --> 00:44:03,778
or performance management, leadership development, and...

945
00:44:04,736 --> 00:44:09,017
That, like we, and all levels of sort of decision making

946
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:10,417
across the company.

947
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,498
So we're ensuring that we're thoughtful

948
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:16,899
and that we're consistent in how our values manifest

949
00:44:16,899 --> 00:44:18,099
from the inside out.

950
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:21,440
So that means thinking about how do we work together?

951
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,061
How do we collaborate?

952
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:23,861
How do we make decisions?

953
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:27,402
How do we communicate and share stories with each other

954
00:44:27,402 --> 00:44:30,983
and also with our players and also with our peers?

955
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:33,303
We take culture extremely seriously.

956
00:44:34,263 --> 00:44:38,366
And we believe that being deliberate about who we are,

957
00:44:38,366 --> 00:44:40,867
that will help us grow and evolve in the right way.

958
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:42,267
And we want to hold all rioters accountable

959
00:44:42,267 --> 00:44:43,288
to upholding our culture.

960
00:44:43,288 --> 00:44:44,308
And the fact that D&I is now a part of that team,

961
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:45,189
that's a significant shift forward.

962
00:44:52,934 --> 00:44:56,637
Because it doesn't actually change about whether or not I consider programs and

963
00:44:56,637 --> 00:44:59,820
trainings and policies, et cetera, as potential outputs.

964
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,082
These are things that can still happen.

965
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:07,546
But we're actually thinking about it not as a pocket that influences part of

966
00:45:07,546 --> 00:45:11,510
the organization, but as something that is deeply embedded in our values,

967
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,031
which fuels our passion.

968
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:16,374
At the end of the day, diversity is everyone's problem.

969
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,500
It's not just talents, it's not legals,

970
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,881
it's not just PRs or marketings or philanthropies.

971
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:26,222
It's part of everyday life and public discourse.

972
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:31,063
And when it becomes integral to your organization's success,

973
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:32,343
people start to buy in on their own.

974
00:45:32,343 --> 00:45:33,283
You don't have to convince them.

975
00:45:33,283 --> 00:45:35,624
Because now everyone knows that they have a stake in it,

976
00:45:35,624 --> 00:45:38,065
that they have a stake in improving it,

977
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:40,985
and they have a stake in making the company stronger.

978
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:47,633
So I hope that what I shared today about learning to build bridges to all types of people and

979
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:52,316
having a belief system that welcomes growth and flourishes under challenges is helpful.

980
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:56,319
Keep in mind, it is a very hard thing to do.

981
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,582
You're not going to wake up one day and just have all of these things sort of clear and

982
00:46:00,582 --> 00:46:01,523
cut.

983
00:46:01,523 --> 00:46:05,926
It takes patience, it takes time, and constant action.

984
00:46:07,315 --> 00:46:09,796
And it'll be messy, and it will be awkward,

985
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:11,497
and it will be frustrating.

986
00:46:11,497 --> 00:46:13,418
But my bet is that if we learn to do this,

987
00:46:13,418 --> 00:46:16,079
if we learn to unite and work together,

988
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,020
not only as a company, but as part of an industry,

989
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,681
we can make diversity and inclusion work.

990
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:25,683
So I wanna thank you for listening and GDC for having me.

991
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:27,884
And just a reminder, you will get a...

992
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:32,136
survey to say like, how'd she do?

993
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:35,358
And you can be like, oh God, finally, she's terrible.

994
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,020
And there will be a, we have 10 minutes for questions

995
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,442
and there will be a wrap up room that we can move over

996
00:46:41,442 --> 00:46:42,402
if we're going over time.

997
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:45,084
There is a mic in the middle of the room.

998
00:46:45,084 --> 00:46:47,326
So if you can please speak clearly into the mic,

999
00:46:47,326 --> 00:46:48,566
I would deeply appreciate that.

1000
00:46:59,743 --> 00:47:02,184
Great talk, thank you so much.

1001
00:47:02,184 --> 00:47:02,965
Thank you.

1002
00:47:02,965 --> 00:47:05,966
A few months ago I came across Dr. Robin D'Angelo's

1003
00:47:05,966 --> 00:47:08,227
work on white fragility.

1004
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:09,928
You familiar with that?

1005
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:10,108
I am.

1006
00:47:10,108 --> 00:47:11,789
Okay, so very briefly, I'm sure you are,

1007
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:13,410
for very briefly for those who aren't,

1008
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,291
like I wasn't just a few months ago,

1009
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:19,733
the way I remember it all is people like me

1010
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:23,695
often think of racism specifically as a binary issue

1011
00:47:23,695 --> 00:47:25,496
and an individual issue.

1012
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:28,738
So I or somebody else is either racist or not,

1013
00:47:29,398 --> 00:47:31,380
and it's good and bad.

1014
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,861
And what a lot of people like me don't understand

1015
00:47:34,861 --> 00:47:38,583
is how systemic it is and how much gray there is in between.

1016
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:42,125
So that was, woo, light bulb for me, super helpful.

1017
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,686
Question is, do you find that helpful

1018
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:45,707
in the work you do around racism?

1019
00:47:45,707 --> 00:47:48,288
And is there equal fragility?

1020
00:47:48,288 --> 00:47:51,170
Does that framework work for other inclusion issues?

1021
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:51,670
Yeah, I found...

1022
00:47:55,525 --> 00:48:02,150
Honestly, taking the time to explain to people in a very sort of soft and gentle way how

1023
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:07,174
these things are, how these things can affect you on a daily basis where it's like, hey,

1024
00:48:07,174 --> 00:48:11,077
it's not that you're racist, it's that you've just grown up only knowing this thing and

1025
00:48:11,077 --> 00:48:12,598
only believing this thing is right.

1026
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:16,321
That has a much, I feel like that's super useful.

1027
00:48:16,321 --> 00:48:22,106
And really, like part of me hates that we sometimes have to sterilize a lot of the

1028
00:48:22,797 --> 00:48:27,660
real pain and real anger from underrepresented groups and marginalized communities to sort

1029
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:33,043
of make other people feel better. But again, as like NPR calls it, diversity managers are

1030
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:37,506
professional peacemakers. You have to sort of work within that framework. So yeah, I

1031
00:48:37,506 --> 00:48:43,790
have found it really helpful. And also what I found working really well, surprisingly,

1032
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,972
is teaching people about intersectionality, is teaching people that you're not just one

1033
00:48:47,972 --> 00:48:52,135
thing or the other, that you are a person who's had many experiences and maybe

1034
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:56,068
you have sort of invisible disadvantages

1035
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:57,229
that other people don't see,

1036
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:59,690
but they will make assumptions that you're super advantaged

1037
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:00,570
when they look at you.

1038
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,731
That has been a very helpful approach

1039
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,292
in just calling out the nuance

1040
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:10,914
and sort of reducing this binary thinking that you mentioned.

1041
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:11,214
Yeah, thank you.

1042
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:11,254
Hi.

1043
00:49:11,254 --> 00:49:12,014
Hey there.

1044
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:13,534
Great talk.

1045
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,475
I'm Shrek.

1046
00:49:15,475 --> 00:49:16,456
I'm from New Zealand.

1047
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:16,656
Hi.

1048
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:24,253
I'm glad you brought up the topic of nuance. And so I would like to introduce one of those

1049
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:28,301
nuances and get your thoughts on it. And that's that say

1050
00:49:29,616 --> 00:49:35,478
myself as an Indian dude from south India, growing up for instance, one of the anecdotes I

1051
00:49:35,478 --> 00:49:39,740
like to bring up is that when I was around 12 years old, I won a violin award. Sounds like a

1052
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:45,702
great thing, right? I have this creative side. And you would think that my community would

1053
00:49:45,702 --> 00:49:49,904
reward that. But the sort of response to that was actually that my parents would grill me that I

1054
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,625
didn't actually get an academic award, right?

1055
00:49:53,085 --> 00:49:54,986
And now I work in games, right?

1056
00:49:54,986 --> 00:50:01,989
So, you know, but what it took for there to be this sort of acceptance in my family that this was okay

1057
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:07,912
was this sort of 10-year struggle of constant conversation and constant criticism of my own community, right?

1058
00:50:09,782 --> 00:50:12,023
So when we talk about diversity and conclusion, I often see

1059
00:50:12,023 --> 00:50:16,525
that there's this onus on the majority to welcome us in.

1060
00:50:16,525 --> 00:50:18,246
And I completely agree.

1061
00:50:18,246 --> 00:50:18,906
That's totally valid.

1062
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:21,948
But what I see missing from the conversation is active

1063
00:50:21,948 --> 00:50:24,629
criticism of minority communities, because it helps

1064
00:50:24,629 --> 00:50:26,891
the leaders in those communities, right?

1065
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:29,392
It helps us to challenge our own communities

1066
00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:30,532
so that they can grow.

1067
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:32,614
I mean, don't get me started on if I was a woman.

1068
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:35,735
I mean, I'd probably be right now married with two kids,

1069
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:37,376
right?

1070
00:50:39,314 --> 00:50:40,595
What I just want to throw out there,

1071
00:50:40,595 --> 00:50:42,196
and I'd like to get your thoughts on it,

1072
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:45,759
is where does the role of criticism come in, right?

1073
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:47,020
And as a majority towards a minority,

1074
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,701
and I'll let you take it from there.

1075
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:50,622
I think it depends on the goal of the conversation.

1076
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:52,284
Like, are you criticizing,

1077
00:50:52,284 --> 00:50:54,966
like, when people criticize each other,

1078
00:50:54,966 --> 00:50:56,747
criticism is a good thing.

1079
00:50:56,747 --> 00:50:57,348
But if it is,

1080
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:58,889
if it's not to get a deeper understanding,

1081
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,710
that's when I feel like it's a problem.

1082
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:10,881
So right now, with all the Islamophobia,

1083
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:12,742
it's kind of like how I feel.

1084
00:51:12,742 --> 00:51:14,503
I grew up in a, I'm non-practicing,

1085
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:16,185
but I grew up in a Muslim family,

1086
00:51:16,185 --> 00:51:20,127
and it kind of always feels like I have to explain

1087
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:23,029
on behalf of the billions of,

1088
00:51:23,029 --> 00:51:25,371
billion of Muslims across the world

1089
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:27,732
of this is why we might think this way,

1090
00:51:27,732 --> 00:51:29,573
or this is why this thing might have happened.

1091
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:33,036
So it really depends on what is being asked.

1092
00:51:33,036 --> 00:51:35,998
I think healthy criticism is crucial,

1093
00:51:35,998 --> 00:51:36,838
but if it's kind of like a.

1094
00:51:37,785 --> 00:51:40,507
If it further, if you're trying to go for nuance,

1095
00:51:40,507 --> 00:51:45,191
but you're actually furthering, reducing the problem

1096
00:51:45,191 --> 00:51:46,352
and making it more binary,

1097
00:51:46,352 --> 00:51:47,654
that's where I think it's like,

1098
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:49,896
you need to step back and just understand

1099
00:51:49,896 --> 00:51:50,837
what you're trying to achieve.

1100
00:51:50,837 --> 00:51:51,177
Cool.

1101
00:51:51,177 --> 00:51:53,439
Do you think there's a place in an organization

1102
00:51:53,439 --> 00:51:56,502
to criticize minority communities?

1103
00:51:56,502 --> 00:51:57,302
That depends.

1104
00:51:57,302 --> 00:52:01,706
Can you give me an example of what you mean by that?

1105
00:52:03,727 --> 00:52:09,429
I just meant that the focus is entirely, seems to be to be inclusive, but to also go and

1106
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:13,351
challenge individuals and grow their leadership skills and things like that.

1107
00:52:13,351 --> 00:52:14,692
I kind of meant, yeah.

1108
00:52:14,692 --> 00:52:18,674
Let me, you know what, I think my answer will probably take a bit longer.

1109
00:52:18,674 --> 00:52:21,715
Let me think about that and I'll meet you in the wrap-up room.

1110
00:52:21,715 --> 00:52:22,676
I'll see you there.

1111
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:23,236
Thank you.

1112
00:52:23,236 --> 00:52:24,017
Hi.

1113
00:52:24,017 --> 00:52:24,157
Hi.

1114
00:52:24,157 --> 00:52:25,097
Thank you.

1115
00:52:25,097 --> 00:52:26,138
Thank you.

1116
00:52:27,108 --> 00:52:31,630
I work in Japan in a Japanese company and 97% are Japanese.

1117
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:39,355
In that kind of a context, I can tell you that this kind of slow and steady approach isn't going to work in my situation to create diversity.

1118
00:52:39,355 --> 00:52:43,457
I've been sent here as a foreigner to try and bring diversity back to the Japanese company.

1119
00:52:43,457 --> 00:52:46,259
Do you have any kind of more specific tactical ideas?

1120
00:52:46,259 --> 00:52:48,440
Maybe you could share with me later for how to...

1121
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,661
try and change the situation there.

1122
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:51,882
The company is about 40 years old.

1123
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:52,543
It's a gaming company.

1124
00:52:52,543 --> 00:52:53,423
Well, they have a gaming division,

1125
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:55,185
but they're not really committed to gaming.

1126
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:55,925
The culture is messed up.

1127
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:57,787
And this is a company, sorry if I

1128
00:52:57,787 --> 00:52:59,388
might have misheard you, in Japan?

1129
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:00,869
Yeah, it's a Japanese company in Japan.

1130
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:04,232
I think you have to sort of like short answer,

1131
00:53:04,232 --> 00:53:06,013
and then we can talk more,

1132
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:07,855
is you have to understand what diversity

1133
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:08,875
they're looking for.

1134
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:09,456
They don't know.

1135
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:11,297
They don't know, okay.

1136
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:13,679
Well, this is like, this is sort of, thank you,

1137
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:15,581
this is sort of like the time for assessment.

1138
00:53:15,581 --> 00:53:18,223
I feel like my, one of the most crucial things

1139
00:53:18,223 --> 00:53:19,103
that D&I managers.

1140
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:22,548
might not do right away is actually do a full assessment

1141
00:53:22,548 --> 00:53:25,269
of what is the pockets that are missing?

1142
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,849
What is the story that's missing?

1143
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:30,550
Do you think that manager should be Japanese or foreign?

1144
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:33,631
I don't really have an answer for that.

1145
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:34,211
Yeah.

1146
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,251
We can talk later.

1147
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:35,572
Yeah.

1148
00:53:35,572 --> 00:53:36,052
Thanks.

1149
00:53:36,052 --> 00:53:36,212
Hi.

1150
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:36,292
Hi.

1151
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,487
I like to talk.

1152
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:48,528
I have these diversity discussions sometimes.

1153
00:53:48,528 --> 00:53:50,469
I wondered, do you have any advice

1154
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:54,230
on how to keep your cool when you're talking with someone

1155
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,571
about an issue that deeply affects you

1156
00:53:56,571 --> 00:53:59,553
but doesn't affect them and they don't believe

1157
00:53:59,553 --> 00:54:03,694
it's actually harmful to you or that kind of thing?

1158
00:54:03,694 --> 00:54:04,775
Meditation has really helped me.

1159
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:10,917
To kind of go back to the second question,

1160
00:54:11,956 --> 00:54:13,677
That was answered.

1161
00:54:13,677 --> 00:54:16,599
This idea of what is the goal, right?

1162
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:21,882
Sometimes I have to set very clear parameters of listen,

1163
00:54:21,882 --> 00:54:23,123
I can try and help you understand

1164
00:54:23,123 --> 00:54:24,804
why people would feel a certain way,

1165
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:27,385
but I'm not gonna sit here and justify why I'm upset.

1166
00:54:27,385 --> 00:54:29,447
You just need to accept that I'm upset about this thing.

1167
00:54:29,447 --> 00:54:31,908
And I find that that kind of sets the tone

1168
00:54:31,908 --> 00:54:35,250
of the conversation that not only helps them understand

1169
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,391
that they don't have to like.

1170
00:54:37,008 --> 00:54:38,829
you know, be sort of a devil's advocate.

1171
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:40,629
They don't have to play that position.

1172
00:54:40,629 --> 00:54:45,051
But it also helps me look at, kind of distance myself

1173
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:46,632
and be a bit more anthropological

1174
00:54:46,632 --> 00:54:49,773
when trying to talk about my problems.

1175
00:54:49,773 --> 00:54:53,794
And that's kind of what I've, like, being very intentional

1176
00:54:53,794 --> 00:54:56,476
and setting a tone from the very beginning

1177
00:54:56,476 --> 00:54:57,416
is pretty crucial.

1178
00:54:57,416 --> 00:54:59,977
Like, I've seen conversations,

1179
00:54:59,977 --> 00:55:02,998
so we actually have like an internal Slack group

1180
00:55:02,998 --> 00:55:05,119
for diversity.

1181
00:55:05,996 --> 00:55:09,299
And there I've seen people use pretty great tactics of like,

1182
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:11,280
I can't get into why I'm upset right now,

1183
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,861
but like short points,

1184
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:14,422
like this is how I feel about this thing.

1185
00:55:14,422 --> 00:55:15,984
Happy to talk about it more later,

1186
00:55:15,984 --> 00:55:17,865
but sort of short version.

1187
00:55:17,865 --> 00:55:20,047
And I feel like that has only been met

1188
00:55:20,047 --> 00:55:22,669
with like understanding and respect and compassion

1189
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:24,810
because of people understand like,

1190
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:26,752
okay, you're actually trying to open up to me

1191
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:29,174
and this is a difficult thing to talk about.

1192
00:55:29,174 --> 00:55:29,614
That's helped.

1193
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:31,295
Okay, thank you so much.

1194
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:33,337
Yeah, thank you.

1195
00:55:33,337 --> 00:55:34,398
We have two minutes.

1196
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,760
Okay, I think this might be a quick one.

1197
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,343
Thank you for the talk, it was lovely.

1198
00:55:40,343 --> 00:55:42,905
In your work at Riot, would you say that most

1199
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:45,927
of your attention and I guess your job,

1200
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:49,770
your energy is going toward potential or new hires?

1201
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:53,153
Or would it be more of like changing the internal,

1202
00:55:53,153 --> 00:55:56,335
like who's already there and being more inclusive

1203
00:55:56,335 --> 00:55:58,477
to the people that maybe already exist there?

1204
00:55:58,477 --> 00:55:59,698
Or both, I guess.

1205
00:55:59,698 --> 00:56:01,719
Yeah, so.

1206
00:56:03,089 --> 00:56:05,631
For me, it's actually been more so of the latter,

1207
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:09,174
so that when new people are introduced and brought in,

1208
00:56:09,174 --> 00:56:12,016
they actually feel included,

1209
00:56:12,016 --> 00:56:13,878
and they actually feel like they're part of the culture.

1210
00:56:13,878 --> 00:56:15,359
I feel like when you're,

1211
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,621
part of the problem that I personally have

1212
00:56:17,621 --> 00:56:19,502
with sort of headcounts

1213
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:22,665
and trying to increase quotas of people,

1214
00:56:22,665 --> 00:56:23,726
is that if you're not understanding

1215
00:56:23,726 --> 00:56:26,008
why maybe you do have those underrepresented groups

1216
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,169
to begin with,

1217
00:56:27,169 --> 00:56:28,490
bringing them in might not.

1218
00:56:29,182 --> 00:56:31,263
be the most obvious solution.

1219
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:33,164
But I also don't think that those things

1220
00:56:33,164 --> 00:56:35,025
have to be one or the other, right?

1221
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:37,527
I think that these two things can happen in parallel

1222
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:38,607
and they can work together.

1223
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:40,128
Thank you very much.

1224
00:56:40,128 --> 00:56:40,548
Yeah, thank you.

1225
00:56:41,487 --> 00:56:44,729
It's maybe less of a two minute question, so I apologize.

1226
00:56:44,729 --> 00:56:47,671
But you mentioned in your presentation

1227
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:50,353
like fostering relationships with people who are not affected by DNI.

1228
00:56:50,353 --> 00:56:52,494
And I was curious if you could elaborate a little bit on that,

1229
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:56,357
because I, too, am a little bit tired of for my entire life

1230
00:56:56,357 --> 00:57:00,139
being the one Arab Muslim that you know and being the good one and all that.

1231
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:00,199
So.

1232
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,601
it gets a little bit exhausting, particularly in this current climate.

1233
00:57:03,601 --> 00:57:08,564
So my gut instinct is, why do we need to seek those people out every single time?

1234
00:57:08,564 --> 00:57:12,506
I mean, is that not what we've been doing pretty much all the time?

1235
00:57:12,506 --> 00:57:13,327
So if you could just...

1236
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:17,389
I think it's because people have an understanding or an assumption that

1237
00:57:17,389 --> 00:57:20,110
when you're talking about islamophobia or you're talking about racism,

1238
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:26,434
you're talking about KKK or something so incredibly obvious and straightforward

1239
00:57:26,434 --> 00:57:30,036
that without addressing the daily ways that you can...

1240
00:57:31,023 --> 00:57:39,049
you know, undermine somebody or disengage somebody from a conversation because they

1241
00:57:39,049 --> 00:57:41,190
don't feel safe having that conversation.

1242
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,251
That's where I feel like most of our problems are at.

1243
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,132
We're actually just out of time.

1244
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:47,855
So I would love to talk to you more about that, especially Arab Muslim.

1245
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:48,315
I feel you.

1246
00:57:48,315 --> 00:57:50,316
Thank you so much.
