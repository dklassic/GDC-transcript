1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:14,545
So my name is Miriam Palosari-Eladhari and I'm a game designer. I just started in the

2
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:21,668
studio just a few days ago. I'm also a researcher affiliated to the University

3
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:29,852
of Malta and to Stockholm University in Sweden. So I've been teaching games for

4
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:31,633
for a while.

5
00:00:32,154 --> 00:00:32,334
since 2004.

6
00:00:32,714 --> 00:00:41,357
And this talk is a case study of a course concerned

7
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:45,139
with AI-based game design and computational expression.

8
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:48,600
And the reason that I want to give this talk

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,042
is to show you how it's possible to enable students to expand

10
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:56,343
their technological palette, how they can make.

11
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,421
AI technologies as part of their artistic practice as designers.

12
00:01:04,743 --> 00:01:11,806
It's something that's super empowering to know that you have lots of technologies at

13
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:12,626
your fingertips.

14
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:16,748
And for those who are already proficient.

15
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:20,406
they will, in coding and using these technologies,

16
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:22,968
it's also a way to show that,

17
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:25,009
okay, so this is the sharded territory,

18
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,772
and that makes it possible to see what is uncharted,

19
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:33,155
and where you can do innovations and new things.

20
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:38,098
In designing this course I wanted to make it accessible

21
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:41,561
for both programmers and non-programmers.

22
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:47,326
So the mix of technologies that we have been using

23
00:01:48,327 --> 00:01:51,369
are things that can be used just off the shelf

24
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,971
even if you don't know how to program.

25
00:01:53,491 --> 00:02:00,317
However, the students that I've had are mostly programmers.

26
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:05,060
Just shortly, what AI based game design means,

27
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,343
it's simply when the AI is in the foreground

28
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:11,785
and central for designing a game, simply put.

29
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:19,771
So, back in 2011, I was spending a lot of time

30
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:24,254
in Santa Cruz, and having lots of good discussion

31
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:26,636
with some of my favorite collaborators,

32
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:30,659
Josh McCoy, Gillian Smith, and Ann Sullivan.

33
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:38,310
And we started to compare how do we work with AI and design.

34
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,011
And we could see commonalities.

35
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:43,973
First of all, we could see that we usually kind of looked

36
00:02:44,193 --> 00:02:47,295
at three different knowledge domains

37
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:50,137
all across the case studies that we did,

38
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:53,279
usually having one rich metaphor of a system

39
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,201
like personality psychology or social behavior.

40
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:01,045
And then some sort of either existing AI technology

41
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:02,867
or whatever we were building.

42
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:09,233
And also the type of genre that we were kind of adhering to

43
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:11,835
when we were doing our development, if any.

44
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:17,280
We also kind of saw that back then,

45
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,242
the main challenges that we were facing

46
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,704
in our own practice was how to make the.

47
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,681
the AI really be foregrounded?

48
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:28,043
How do you make it transparent to the player

49
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,664
that something interesting is happening?

50
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:34,628
So that you don't have a super tailspin-like system

51
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,029
where you don't see what's on the surface

52
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,450
and how it's played.

53
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,013
Another one was looking at particular sweet spots

54
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:47,276
for emergence, like when a game is fun and understandable,

55
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:49,737
but still rich and something that you can explore.

56
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:53,856
We reasoned a lot about that.

57
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:57,897
And then when I designed the course,

58
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:02,459
computational expression, I tried to find a way

59
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:05,540
to give this to the students.

60
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,981
Like at the same time, give them a method

61
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:10,721
for how to work with it in design,

62
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:12,882
and also give them a palette.

63
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:16,809
of AI methods, but not only AI methods,

64
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:21,017
also some interesting input technologies and things

65
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:25,365
like Oculus or Connect, so things like that.

66
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:29,589
And practically about the course,

67
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,071
it's a five ECTS course.

68
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:37,054
And in Europe, this means that one ECTS

69
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,736
is 25 hours of student work.

70
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:44,199
And one semester is 30 ECTSes in total.

71
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,762
So this was the sixth of a semester time.

72
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:50,063
And the semester is 4 and 1 1⁄2 months long.

73
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:57,696
The students that I had, this was

74
00:04:57,736 --> 00:04:59,237
given at the University of Malta.

75
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:02,680
Mostly they were bachelors in computing science,

76
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,763
but also a few of them didn't have programming backgrounds.

77
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:11,527
They also already knew how to iteratively design and develop

78
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:15,471
games, because they were students in our game design

79
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:15,911
master.

80
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:26,744
The course, we used the great book, Expressive Processing, by Noah Ward-Ripruen as our kind

81
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,967
of red line in our tech seminars.

82
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:34,172
And we had workshops and some guest lectures.

83
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,396
And this is kind of what the,

84
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:42,158
I'm first gonna see, the course was divided

85
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:43,578
into two main parts.

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,841
Where the first six weeks was an intense period

87
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,683
of knowledge gathering.

88
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:55,405
So having seminars and workshops.

89
00:05:56,157 --> 00:06:00,579
And this is kind of like the things which are on that top row

90
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:00,839
there.

91
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,280
Those were the technological palette

92
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,861
that I wanted to give my students.

93
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:07,322
I mean, whoever, kind of like when you use this,

94
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:09,823
you use the things which you think is, OK,

95
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:12,324
what are the technologies that exist

96
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:14,365
and could be useful for game design?

97
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:17,006
And these were the ones that we kind of looked at.

98
00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:21,791
basically having AI based game design

99
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:23,192
that was one of the starting points

100
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,855
and also looking at methods for research prototyping

101
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:28,317
like how can you answer a research question

102
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:31,060
by posing it as a prototype.

103
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:34,423
Looking at agents and characters,

104
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,586
interactive narrative systems for that.

105
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:43,830
Game worlds, how you build full, rich ontologies for a game,

106
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,331
systems for help you create those.

107
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:51,073
Looking at procedurally generated content methods,

108
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:52,933
data mining, big data.

109
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:59,876
And then also the kind of the toolbox and the toy box,

110
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:06,039
using things like bio data and other types of inputs

111
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,280
like the Kinect.

112
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:10,532
or things like that, mainly looking

113
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:15,233
at the huge area of presence, research, and immersion.

114
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:18,795
And this was kind of also interspersed

115
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,895
with hands-on workshops when students

116
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:21,936
use these technologies.

117
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:27,477
So at the end of this six-week period,

118
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:29,738
the students delivered a game concept,

119
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:32,419
like what are we going to build?

120
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:38,722
When we had the tech seminars, we divided up all the readings among the group.

121
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:46,265
So each student picked the technology he or she was most interested in, and then championed

122
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:53,027
that and kind of held that seminar and presented the tech or the tool or the approach to the

123
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,728
group and we had a discussion about that.

124
00:07:57,446 --> 00:08:06,048
But in addition to just reading papers, I invited guest speakers who could give demonstrations

125
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:11,669
like okay, Richard Evans skyped in and said, this is how I developed Versu.

126
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:15,590
This is how I think about narrative when I build this system.

127
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,691
It was also a good opportunity for the students to ask about.

128
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:24,088
basic BDI agent architectures.

129
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,734
Jillian Smith showed her prototype, The Endless Web.

130
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:35,217
And students also read her publications

131
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:39,781
so that when she Skyped in, they could both kind of get

132
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:42,143
the hands-on demonstration of her work,

133
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:46,887
but also ask questions about her academic publications on that.

134
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,792
Brian McGurkow showed his viewpoints AI,

135
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:56,655
where a dancing player is kind of represented

136
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:57,975
in a very artistic manner.

137
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:01,017
Also, an interesting way to use computation

138
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:02,598
for artistic expression.

139
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:07,940
We had Noah also Skyping in, since we

140
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,383
had his book as the red thread in the talk in the whole course.

141
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:14,223
So.

142
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:18,707
mainly talking about the different effects,

143
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:22,807
like how you can use the Eliza effect,

144
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:26,048
how you try to not be in the tailspin effect

145
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:29,489
when your super impressive fantastic AI system

146
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,289
is not really visible to the player,

147
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,790
even though it's a fantastically beautiful system,

148
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,810
and instead use the SimCity effect,

149
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,691
where you have this rich metaphor

150
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:41,231
really feeding into the design

151
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,392
and making it accessible for the player.

152
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:50,892
In the workshops, we were both looking at digital systems,

153
00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:54,254
but we were also doing paper prototyping AI.

154
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:56,815
And this was especially to make it accessible

155
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:57,896
for non-programmers.

156
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:03,019
Like, if you do a paper prototyping of the strip system,

157
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,941
for example, building a story together in groups,

158
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:10,323
you literally can't walk out of the room

159
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,005
not understanding plan-based problem solvers.

160
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,981
It's something that I really kind of recommend

161
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:23,086
as doing when you teach AI to also combine it

162
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:26,648
with these kind of more tangible hands and methods for teaching.

163
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:37,716
So the tasks that the students got was to,

164
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,096
when they brainstormed.

165
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:45,671
look at, choose one AI technology from the palette,

166
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:48,612
and choose one rich metaphor from real life.

167
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:51,053
So those were the two starting points.

168
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:55,514
The third one, looking at the game conventions in the design,

169
00:10:55,534 --> 00:11:01,455
it was something that they should be aware of,

170
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:04,596
so if they were using game design conventions.

171
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:14,403
they would be kind of know when they made something innovative.

172
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:16,584
The development process, it was iterative.

173
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:19,587
They already knew what cycles to go through

174
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,228
with play testing and iteration.

175
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,510
So they kind of did that naturally.

176
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,312
I didn't have to teach that part in the course.

177
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:32,336
So I'm going to show a few quick examples of games.

178
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:38,537
So one, this is Highway Code.

179
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,720
It's a small racing game where the students use machine

180
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,442
learning as the central technology

181
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:49,046
and use traffic systems on Malta as their main knowledge

182
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:49,506
domain.

183
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:54,130
So in the game, the cars learned how

184
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,411
to have the right speed.

185
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:01,128
CompoBlocks is another game that the students made

186
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:05,835
were using procedurally generated platforms

187
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,437
for music composition.

188
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,381
So just the.

189
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:17,874
by playing the game, you would compose music

190
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:22,957
as you went along, and the little platforms there,

191
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:27,339
kind of they emerged in real time during play.

192
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,020
So, but also bear in mind that these little prototypes

193
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,282
were made, you know, in just a few days time.

194
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:36,924
They didn't have much time for this kind of development.

195
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:38,765
Another example.

196
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,348
is Organitron, where students use PCG

197
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,571
in combination with genetic algorithms

198
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,515
to make a robot war strategy game

199
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:52,077
that was played by two players who share the keyboard

200
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:54,679
and kind of watch their little robots evolve.

201
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:55,340
It was very fun.

202
00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:59,524
Another one was a dungeon crawler,

203
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:02,046
procedurally generating

204
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:10,707
So it was kind of this mixed media thing

205
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:13,631
that you would get support for how

206
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:16,915
to build your dungeons for your board game role play

207
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:17,976
that you would play.

208
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:23,784
So it was looking at quest flags and PCG quests.

209
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:29,395
There were also a couple of people, groups,

210
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:33,458
used input technologies instead of AI as the central part,

211
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:35,199
which is totally viable as well,

212
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,840
at least within the scope of this course.

213
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:42,284
So, ones were using the gyro as the central thing

214
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:46,106
and the Hercules myth with being attacked by birds,

215
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:51,169
so mounting a cell phone using the gyro

216
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,690
to play a level of that.

217
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:59,054
Another was using multi-device to kind of have,

218
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:04,697
to play a kind of art game.

219
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:10,381
So to win, your squigglies need to kind of traverse

220
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,821
to the end of the screen,

221
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:18,325
and you'd have a kind of art piece being created

222
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:20,006
as you play.

223
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,224
They were inspired by minimalist art

224
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:27,086
and used the yellow tail code base for doing that

225
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,026
and did their own thing.

226
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:32,269
So the resulting things, this is kind

227
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,430
of like the competitive mode or the fight mode.

228
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,972
And this would be the kind of result of that play.

229
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,273
Those, the collaborative play part,

230
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:48,477
were resulting in images that kind of looked a bit like this.

231
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:57,072
So after this month of prototyping,

232
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,593
there was a development stop in order to reflect.

233
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:02,533
This was a very important part of the course

234
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:07,014
because you can't really make sense

235
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:09,295
of all these technologies unless you get time

236
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:12,215
to really reflect about how can you use this

237
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:15,776
in your own artistic practice as a designer in the future.

238
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:25,797
And some of the questions they were looking at was kind of going back to how the technology and the design affect each other.

239
00:15:28,638 --> 00:15:31,240
So looking at the course structure,

240
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,322
the last three ending months of the course

241
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:38,963
after the knowledge gathering phase

242
00:15:40,124 --> 00:15:42,745
was spent one month prototyping and testing,

243
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:46,526
then a full reflection phase where people wrote reports

244
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:47,887
and played each other's games.

245
00:15:48,508 --> 00:15:54,477
But then also making sure that they had a full month for polish so that the feedback that they got from each other

246
00:15:54,497 --> 00:15:57,482
And for me was something that they could use

247
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:00,847
in in their their absolute last iteration

248
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:08,447
What I saw as a teacher, which was strangely obvious,

249
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:10,109
was that those groups of students

250
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:12,831
who were really embracing the idea

251
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,073
to have a rich metaphor from real life

252
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:18,056
that they were kind of using in their design work

253
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:22,480
were the ones who made the most innovative and interesting

254
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,083
games during this short dev time that they have.

255
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:38,336
Another thing that I saw was that because I was using this kind of traditional style defense,

256
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:45,162
having kind of people defend their argument in class, combining that academic rigor together

257
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:50,187
with practical work was something that it kind of fed into each other nicely.

258
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:53,644
The outcomes for the students was

259
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:56,268
that they got games to put into their portfolios.

260
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,530
Some got seats for research papers

261
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,432
that they then were writing.

262
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,316
It was also a kind of feasibility test

263
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,438
for their forthcoming thesis work, something

264
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,860
that we would spend a year doing.

265
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:09,703
So that is kind of a time saver there.

266
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:16,752
And an important thing, too, was to have a hands-on experience

267
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:20,314
of what it means to build an AI module specifically for a game.

268
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:24,818
Because the process of iterations together

269
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:26,699
with the game design is really fun,

270
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,781
but it's also resource heavy.

271
00:17:29,402 --> 00:17:32,004
And this is something which is very good to know when

272
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:36,207
you go out in the industry.

273
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,649
Sometimes it's a super good idea, but maybe not always.

274
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,031
But most important was that the students

275
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:46,992
have really gotten an idea about a palette

276
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:49,393
for how to use technology and also see

277
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:53,814
where can we innovate and where can we do new things

278
00:17:53,854 --> 00:17:55,315
that doesn't exist already.

279
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:02,579
The course materials and stuff is possible to download.

280
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,722
I just threw up all the PDFs and things on that address.

281
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:10,523
So if anyone is interested, it's all there.

282
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:11,864
I'll put the slides there as well.

283
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:15,325
And that's it.

284
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:16,306
Questions?

285
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:36,567
Hi.

286
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:37,048
Hi.

287
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:37,989
Thank you for a talk.

288
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:42,515
If I understand well, in this course,

289
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:45,820
they have to program their own AI.

290
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,201
Do you have other course for the same student

291
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:54,065
when they use standard tools, AIs you find in engines

292
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:57,748
and using industrial tools for AI?

293
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,050
Yes, in addition in the program, there

294
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,714
is several game AI courses and also

295
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:07,997
PCG courses for those who do the technology strand.

296
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:14,503
So they already, most of the students already have lots of things,

297
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:17,665
kind of technologies on their fingertips that they can use.

298
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:21,548
So this is not, this course doesn't exist in isolation.

299
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:32,917
Okay, thank you so much for listening.
