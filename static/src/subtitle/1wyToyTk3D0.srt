1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:08,110
Right.

2
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:09,431
Hi.

3
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,093
Thanks for coming, everyone.

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,715
It's really nice to be back at GDC,

5
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,838
back in the coolest numbered room in this whole building.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:28,172
And to be showing Tearaway again, I showed it last year.

7
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:32,854
That time, very much focusing on the paper construction

8
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:33,354
of the world.

9
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:36,495
This time, I'm going to take a slightly different angle

10
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:40,376
and show some of the stuff that subverts what you might

11
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:41,757
think the game was about.

12
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:45,178
If you'd seen it in screenshots and you see this kind of.

13
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:50,516
This world of bright, kind of youthful paper craft.

14
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:54,719
You might not have necessarily realized that all of this other stuff,

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,283
the way that we sort of tore the fourth wall off the game world

16
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:02,947
and did all sorts of strange things with the context of the game

17
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:06,510
and sort of thought about the wider thing of this is a handheld game,

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,051
there's a world outside of it.

19
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:11,256
I'm trying to focus on more of that kind of stuff.

20
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:14,160
I can never resist talking a bit about paper,

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,805
so there will be some in here for paper fans.

22
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:24,074
So the title of the talk, let's get this started, get that.

23
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:26,296
Disturbing image of me off the screen.

24
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:31,922
Is believable, make-believe, how we built our fantasy world.

25
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,685
And built that world around the player.

26
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:39,430
And bringing the player into the narrative and into the experience.

27
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:48,039
allowing them to collaborate with the story in ways that were more than just moving the narrative forward

28
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:56,047
to actually sort of play a role, play a part, and feel very engaged with what was happening in the game.

29
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,151
Now, what I'll be talking about will...

30
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:03,014
It's kind of like highly...

31
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:08,350
It's highly flavored with our kind of medium molecule special

32
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,333
sauce, you know, and it's pretty spicy.

33
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:16,321
So, you know, it might not be exactly what other people would

34
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:19,726
be able to take and suddenly, you know, make an FPS with

35
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,150
Your face appearing in the sun or something like that.

36
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:28,558
But I think there's some core things behind what we were trying to do with the game

37
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:31,302
that are maybe interesting to think about.

38
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:37,310
And just the way that we've been a little more overt really with what a game is.

39
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:44,255
I'm also, I've actually forgotten to say,

40
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:46,097
tearing the fourth wall off this talk,

41
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:48,039
I've forgotten to say all the stuff I was supposed to say

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,222
about turning phones off,

43
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:53,226
so you've had like a couple of minutes

44
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,769
of being able to make phone calls before I said that.

45
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,832
And also, I think you probably, you would have been sent a survey thing.

46
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:08,354
So if you could fill that in and tell everyone how amazingly professional I am at pressing

47
00:03:08,394 --> 00:03:14,417
the left arrow on a laptop while making my lips move, that would be much appreciated.

48
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:19,559
So let's start digging in further now.

49
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,840
So we should probably put some hearts on just to...

50
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:25,621
There.

51
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:26,516
Perfect.

52
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:33,665
So just in case that you've not seen Tear Away,

53
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:36,028
has anyone played Tear Away?

54
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,174
Oh, nice.

55
00:03:38,815 --> 00:03:39,495
I like this room.

56
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:43,077
I was just going to play a trailer just

57
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:48,259
to kind of refresh our memories of how the game looked

58
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:51,621
a couple of years ago when we first announced it at Gamescom

59
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:55,223
and kind of remember the context at that point.

60
00:03:55,323 --> 00:03:58,664
And I mean, it did develop on since then,

61
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:01,846
but I think it's still a good representation of what

62
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:03,426
the game was all about.

63
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:26,840
You should have got a better bed, better for your head, better heads meet sharp ties.

64
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:36,266
You should have got a better bed, better for your head, better heads meet sharp ties.

65
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:42,029
You should have got a better bed, better head for all you feel,

66
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:46,352
And then the bad dads leave, promise it to me, promise me they'll see.

67
00:04:48,344 --> 00:04:51,375
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.

68
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:55,128
Ain't got no time to make it, I'm on my way.

69
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:38,475
He was also over the image quality of the game, so some of the most unresponsive comments didn't show up.

70
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:42,316
If you changed the graphics too, the enemy player would have been in big trouble.

71
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:48,917
There was also a warning sign that said that the enemy player wanted to die, but it still didn't show up.

72
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:52,998
As a result of putting death in the comments, the game's game was delays and unanswered.

73
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:54,938
So I made a correction, and it's a bit frustrating.

74
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:56,433
You

75
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:29,866
So there we go.

76
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:36,711
Now obviously, as I started saying, it would be very hard

77
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:40,634
to talk about Tearaway without mentioning this stuff, paper.

78
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:50,700
It was really the main way that we achieved a believable, make-believe world

79
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:53,943
through the simulation of a world made of paper.

80
00:06:54,523 --> 00:07:00,507
And it enabled us to have a fantasy world, but one that was realistically constructed.

81
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:06,731
Because it was made from an everyday material, it's one that we all recognize, we all understand.

82
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,453
It's kind of our way in.

83
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:16,578
It was just really important to the game to really ground the fantasy.

84
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:21,419
It united and unified our ideas.

85
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
And it really meant that we could go much more,

86
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:29,642
well, far crazier with all of the stuff that we would later add to it.

87
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:35,574
And it made that fantasy very tactile, very tangible,

88
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:37,935
and something that you really felt

89
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:40,016
that you could hold it in your hands

90
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:45,159
and see how it reacted to your input in very dynamic ways.

91
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,562
And plus it looks cool. You know, it's great colors,

92
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:54,645
you know, interesting shapes.

93
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:59,728
I kind of feel that it feels a little bit like sort of polygons have sort of sneaked out of the

94
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:04,030
digital world and come into our world. You know, this sort of strange alien shape you

95
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:09,554
only really ever get to see in a game. You suddenly see it sort of sitting on a desk.

96
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,523
But I'm not going to really focus on paper today.

97
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:23,629
You can hopefully still access the talk I gave last year on the GDC Vault,

98
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,853
which was all about the paper world, the paper engine that we used to build it,

99
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:32,997
showed how we pieced together each piece of paper and glued it all together

100
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:36,099
in just the same way that you would if you were...

101
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,620
building a real paper world.

102
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,022
I'm going to focus on some of the design decisions

103
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:45,784
and the process that we went through in coming up

104
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:47,925
with lots of the other elements of the game,

105
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:51,967
especially those ones that were to do

106
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,228
with what was going on outside of the paper world,

107
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,070
the features that really connected with the player

108
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,292
and made them part of the game and brought them

109
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:01,712
into the game.

110
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:09,115
So we've got this sort of sketchy, rough timeline

111
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:14,539
of how the development, how it played out.

112
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:18,583
All the time, looking at just how we could center it

113
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:20,884
around the player.

114
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:26,349
So like with lots of projects, we started off

115
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,110
with some new hardware.

116
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:30,872
New hardware means new ideas.

117
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:36,679
And just having the Vita for the first time

118
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:38,281
and sort of exploring it and wondering

119
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:40,304
what we could do with it, it had all these kind

120
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:41,946
of new functions that.

121
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,218
It hadn't really been possible before.

122
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:50,742
So that instantly gave us a starting point, a spark.

123
00:09:52,303 --> 00:09:56,567
From that, we then concentrated on building out a world,

124
00:09:57,147 --> 00:10:00,050
creating a fantasy landscape, something

125
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,352
that we could interact with inside of the Vita,

126
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,054
working out what that wider context was.

127
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:12,820
And then we discovered that that world we'd been building was just a bit too generic.

128
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,801
It was quite dull, really.

129
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:16,262
There wasn't really enough...

130
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:22,246
It wasn't really true enough to the initial first ideas of, like, really focusing on the hardware.

131
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:29,391
So that's when we had a game jam, and we really sort of pulled apart what a game was,

132
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:32,553
and really thought about, like, new ways to...

133
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:40,286
but to interact with the content that was inside of this digital box that you've got in your hands.

134
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,092
And then we went through an editing process,

135
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,594
because the ideas that we'd come up with

136
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:49,055
were pretty left field.

137
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:52,158
And we really needed to figure out

138
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,180
what of those experimental elements

139
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,662
were going to be usable in a shippable game,

140
00:10:58,363 --> 00:11:02,206
and which ones also we could even take further and go

141
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:06,249
even more bizarre with them, really

142
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:09,031
get into the core of what was good about those experiments.

143
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:15,624
And having done that, we also needed to establish a goal of the game.

144
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:18,245
What was the player trying to achieve?

145
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:21,966
What would be the end result?

146
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,268
What would they get out of playing the game?

147
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:30,850
And just make sure that with all of this sort of new, strange interactions,

148
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,472
that there was still always a clear goal to keep them very focused and motivated

149
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:38,773
with this journey that they'd be going on.

150
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:43,584
And then we did that minor stage of building the whole game.

151
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:49,270
And then after that, we needed to figure out

152
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,613
as well simultaneously how we were

153
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:58,138
going to be able to allow the, let the player have

154
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:01,762
a feeling of authorship on this story

155
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:03,283
so that it was.

156
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:07,483
It became more like their world.

157
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:10,144
It started off as our world and then kind of

158
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:11,924
transferred to themselves.

159
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:16,085
So just rewinding back to our timeline, I'll go through all

160
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:18,346
of these stages now in a bit more detail.

161
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:24,768
So back to our initial new piece of hardware and a weird

162
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,468
idea on how we could use it.

163
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,742
So here's what we started off with, PS Vita.

164
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:35,083
As you've played Tearaway,

165
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,404
you've probably seen one of those before.

166
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:39,246
It's kind of an intriguing box.

167
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:43,388
It's very shiny, covered in inputs

168
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:47,611
and new ways to kind of touch it

169
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,632
and get responses from it.

170
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,783
But also, it's got the classic controls on there as well.

171
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:56,143
So there's a huge amount of scope with what

172
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:57,884
we could do with it.

173
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:03,266
I mean, that's obviously a promo shot of how you're kind

174
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:05,867
of supposed to interact with the Vita.

175
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:08,809
But what I really wanted to do was something more like that,

176
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,630
where you could actually pick it up.

177
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:19,339
And by pushing on the bottom of the Vita actually tear your fingers up through the world and see them kind of

178
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,760
erupting up into the

179
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:23,702
into the the game world inside.

180
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:29,737
I mean, it was obviously something that we couldn't do on any other hardware, which made

181
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:32,579
it kind of compelling to try out this idea.

182
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:40,303
And it straightaway suggested that you were doing something, well, it was more connected

183
00:13:40,363 --> 00:13:45,166
with the wider context of what was outside of the game console.

184
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:47,247
You know, as you're pushing your fingers in, you can see.

185
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:57,116
There's like a little hole and you would be able to see a little bit of video through there and see the floor and it sort of, you know, it starts to unite these two worlds together.

186
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:05,419
And the way that the player holds the device,

187
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,661
and it becomes very important.

188
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,603
It means that obviously their fingers

189
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:11,964
need to match with their hands.

190
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:16,828
So we needed to make sure that we got the skin color right,

191
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:18,850
and the size and shape so that it really

192
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,091
felt like their fingers.

193
00:14:21,752 --> 00:14:27,759
And it really had this sort of strange feeling of, it makes you look at your fingers again,

194
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:32,665
like, you know, they're quite strange objects when you really stare at them.

195
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:39,452
Our technical artist, Stefan, is kind of haunted by staring at very close-up images of giant fingers.

196
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:41,795
Because...

197
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:48,738
Placing them in this new world makes them look both very alien,

198
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,659
but also kind of reassuring as well.

199
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,942
Just like the paper, it's a way of understanding

200
00:14:56,223 --> 00:15:00,365
there's a bit of our world in this other completely different world.

201
00:15:01,906 --> 00:15:05,509
And I think that's kind of a quite good way of summing up the game,

202
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,309
really, in some ways.

203
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:09,952
It's sort of like reassuring, but also kind of quite alien as well,

204
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:11,493
and the combination of the two.

205
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:18,950
So here's a very early video from this time of just how the

206
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,952
game could have started.

207
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:24,536
This is actually very similar, weirdly, to how the

208
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:28,221
game actually ended up, with the rift kind of being formed

209
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:32,526
between the real world and then the fantasy world inside it.

210
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:45,461
You actually get a little tiny glimpse of the finger popping up into the world, but it is a very tiny glimpse, so blink and you'll miss it.

211
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:50,487
The finger's actually dressed up as a lion as well, just to add an extra layer of bizarreness on top of it.

212
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:51,669
So here we go.

213
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:16,076
There we go. Short and sweet. The end.

214
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:21,379
So, yeah, I mean you can see there already, you know,

215
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,542
the world's sort of starting to come together.

216
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:28,946
But here's some very early piece of concept art,

217
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:30,327
which is quite abstract.

218
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:33,930
You know, started to see little things

219
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,472
like the video feed poking in through the background.

220
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:39,055
You can see the finger poking up in the foreground,

221
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:41,237
although it doesn't actually look anything like a finger.

222
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:42,458
It kind of looks like a brown egg.

223
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:46,923
It's not that understandable.

224
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:50,207
It's kind of quite hard to understand what's going on in the scene.

225
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,631
Although the one thing I really like is that the gophers there

226
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:55,854
actually ended up in the final game.

227
00:16:55,914 --> 00:17:00,680
They're like the earliest piece of artwork that stayed all the way through the project.

228
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:05,935
But, you know, we were really trying to sort of pare this back and figure it out.

229
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:13,762
And we really needed to just take it back a bit more to what was in front of us, what was around us directly.

230
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:20,308
And, you know, here's what's directly in front of me at work, which is apparently a desk.

231
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:24,836
You know, it's just covered in paper and doodles.

232
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:28,199
And our whole studio is kind of quite a chaotic,

233
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:31,982
creative bundle of stuff.

234
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:37,547
And as we were doing these early stages,

235
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:40,369
we were sort of pulling together all these concept art,

236
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:41,690
like the image you just saw,

237
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,831
and we were printing them out.

238
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:51,581
And they were just building up around us, and that started to become a more interesting environment than the imagery that we were creating.

239
00:17:51,821 --> 00:18:00,065
So, you know, that's where we really pushed the paperiness a lot further and really developed that as a...

240
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:13,740
It's just the over, the kind of unifying look for the whole game, so that we could actually be kind of more experimental with the content, and be more realistic with the way that it was constructed.

241
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:15,722
You know, it would...

242
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:21,384
It was sort of, well it would just make our fantasy world like very very believable

243
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:28,527
And and it was important that the world it wouldn't just it wouldn't just look different, but it would it would feel different

244
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:34,549
Whilst remaining very approachable and and very relevant as well

245
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:41,151
Because it was because it was so sort of realistically constructed we could then go we could go you know pretty out there with

246
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,783
what we were making with it.

247
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,727
So that's kind of...

248
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,871
I'm going to stop talking about paper now.

249
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:48,913
I've done my paper bit.

250
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:51,017
I'll move on with the rest of the game now.

251
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:52,741
There we go.

252
00:18:55,273 --> 00:19:00,999
So this was the starting point in our design process,

253
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,321
this idea of pushing your fingers

254
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:09,367
into our papery world.

255
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:11,369
That was just this novel interaction.

256
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,772
And it really needed more of a game world around it.

257
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:20,575
The actual game was unclear for a while and went through a number of iterations,

258
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:24,557
transforming from an isometric dungeon crawler,

259
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,898
which you kind of controlled with your finger as the character,

260
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,640
all dressed up like a lion, as you saw just now.

261
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,943
And then we tried out a more sort of 3D RPG style,

262
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:38,743
because...

263
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:42,439
The change in that direction was so that we could,

264
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,681
we wanted to feel like we could explore

265
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:46,821
this paper world more, you know,

266
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:49,563
it's a very different type of experience.

267
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:52,064
So, you know, we really wanted to be able to

268
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,306
sort of look at it up close and see off

269
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:58,548
and see vistas of this sort of, of this material

270
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:02,010
and see what that meant to build a world

271
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:02,731
that looked like that.

272
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:08,875
So we started working on this, let's move this on.

273
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:16,027
We started working on a 3D paper world that you could travel through.

274
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:25,131
This was a little character that we created when we realized that controlling the game just with your fingers,

275
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:30,874
using the back touch all of the time, was quite a hard thing to expect of a player.

276
00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:34,815
It wasn't, you know, ergonomically, it wasn't that comfortable really.

277
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:41,777
So, and we wanted to have a little character that was in the world, you know, someone that could sort of respond more to...

278
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:48,259
If you're pushing your fingers in, you know, it's kind of nice to have someone to actually react to this, rather than you just sort of looking at it, you know.

279
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,660
It's like the old, if a tree falls down and there's no one to hear it, does it really make a sound?

280
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,381
Where it's like, if a giant finger rips up through the floor and there's nobody to see it, was it really there?

281
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,781
Um... possibly not.

282
00:21:01,223 --> 00:21:05,229
So, uh, this was, this was, uh, the, the 3D world that we were

283
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:09,255
building at this time. I can, there we go, at night as well.

284
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:14,422
Um, but it wasn't really, uh, showing, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

285
00:21:15,498 --> 00:21:18,540
It wasn't really sort of involving the player that much.

286
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,063
You were essentially just pushing up on the stick.

287
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:28,946
It didn't really suggest how you could do novel things to this world,

288
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:30,787
how you could reach into it, how you could...

289
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:35,311
you know, started doing more dramatic or chaotic things,

290
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:41,455
didn't really have a good way to allow the pushing of your fingers into the world.

291
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:46,318
There didn't seem to be a particularly strong reason for that to happen

292
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:50,321
and it would only happen very few and far between.

293
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:52,603
And we needed the player to be...

294
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:57,146
to be much more sort of present outside of the game world, like all the time.

295
00:21:57,206 --> 00:22:03,090
So it's really reinforced and it's not just, you know, it doesn't just happen occasionally.

296
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:09,395
So, to be honest, you know, we just wanted to go a little weirder.

297
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:18,081
So we kind of took a step back and went into a new phase, which was Game Jam.

298
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:26,041
Which, you know, we knew we had enough of the game to make a fairly sort of generic experience.

299
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:31,524
But we really wanted to challenge ourselves to do something a little bit better than that.

300
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,611
something a little more experimental and surprising.

301
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:40,052
And just generally do something that really supported

302
00:22:40,112 --> 00:22:44,294
that oddness at the core of the starting idea, really.

303
00:22:45,394 --> 00:22:48,415
And just build out from what we could

304
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,836
do with this hardware platform.

305
00:22:51,516 --> 00:22:53,817
So in order for it to be a successful game jam,

306
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:58,959
we really needed to have a really good subject to jam on

307
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:01,579
so that we could actually go kind of wilder.

308
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,461
with our experiments and judge them.

309
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:13,308
So we jammed on this idea of it being

310
00:23:13,328 --> 00:23:16,971
a world held in your hands.

311
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:20,990
You know a world that knows

312
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:24,232
Knows about the player outside of the game world

313
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:30,196
and and and sort of make something more of the way that the world like

314
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:36,180
Responds to them being outside of it the way that they're holding the Vita the way that they're they're looking at the Vita

315
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:44,265
You know because it felt that that there was a nice sort of truthfulness in that really you know games are often kind of trying to

316
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:45,426
simulate

317
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:48,333
Well, pretend they don't exist, almost.

318
00:23:49,974 --> 00:23:52,215
You know, and I think tutorials are often hated

319
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:54,557
because they kind of remind you that it's a game, but

320
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:59,239
it felt like it would be really true to actually say,

321
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,561
yes, this is a world that you're holding,

322
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:03,722
and, you know, it's inside your game console.

323
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:07,003
The characters in there are looking up and seeing you.

324
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:11,065
And it felt like it made a much more interesting relationship.

325
00:24:11,745 --> 00:24:14,946
And that truthful realism, that really chimed with me as well.

326
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:20,268
Because I'm particularly inspired as a child

327
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:23,930
and continue to be now by stories

328
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,031
that have got a fantasy that's really

329
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:29,472
based on some kind of realistic starting point.

330
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:33,654
So that the fantasy then felt more believable.

331
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:38,418
And I think what was great about those was

332
00:24:38,898 --> 00:24:40,939
that then you could be more inspired

333
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,681
to create your own fan art and kind of,

334
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:45,662
you know, add your own stuff to it

335
00:24:45,742 --> 00:24:49,405
and really expand out that fantasy

336
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:53,668
because it had a sort of, a fact underneath it

337
00:24:53,748 --> 00:24:56,109
that was very truthful that you could understand

338
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,570
and build upon.

339
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:02,235
So I mean, I'll just rattle through a couple of quick examples, but

340
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:06,199
Where the Wild Things Are is a really big influence.

341
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,166
The kind of kid, like, you know, sort of escaping from the real world

342
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:16,250
into this more fantasy world where he can just have a great big wild rumpus

343
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,193
like lots of us did last night.

344
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:25,295
And also Time Bandits, another favorite of mine,

345
00:25:25,896 --> 00:25:29,217
where the fourth wall kind of actually does get torn off.

346
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:35,259
And Labyrinth, another fantastic film.

347
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,920
Because they're all pieces of fantasy,

348
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,442
but they're based on a realistic core, and kind of quite

349
00:25:42,462 --> 00:25:43,862
a mundane core, really.

350
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:49,744
Like, the center of Labyrinth is really Sarah's bedroom.

351
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,545
It's like her creative sanctuary.

352
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:56,366
It's filled with her personality and her creativity.

353
00:25:57,466 --> 00:26:00,267
All these decorative elements around the room,

354
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:04,588
they all gradually form the basis of the fantasy world

355
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:08,629
that she's transported to later in the movie.

356
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:13,429
It's not really clear whether the items in the room

357
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:17,350
have influenced her to create this fantasy

358
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,971
or whether the fantasy is inspired

359
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:21,071
by the things in the room,

360
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:25,052
but it's just the way that the two are really intertwined.

361
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:28,613
So if I zoom in on a little bit of it, Blade Runner style.

362
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:29,574
There we go.

363
00:26:30,554 --> 00:26:34,455
You know, you can see there the Escher drawing on the wall

364
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:36,135
and then you see later on,

365
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,336
there she is kind of in that environment.

366
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:45,573
I think it's the way that the, all the characters as well, you know, you can see them represented

367
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:48,576
in the stuffed toys that are scattered around on her floor.

368
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:56,304
It just makes it the surreal adventure from the everyday objects around her, you know,

369
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:57,685
it's very personal to her.

370
00:26:58,606 --> 00:27:03,669
And that felt like a pretty interesting concept to have behind the game as well.

371
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:09,092
You know, this fantasy world seen through the eyes of like an everyday person.

372
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:14,374
But obviously we can't cast an actor to play the gamer, you know.

373
00:27:15,215 --> 00:27:16,977
It's got to be the gamer themselves.

374
00:27:17,717 --> 00:27:20,260
So we needed to like actually think a little bit about,

375
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,283
well, what can we say about our gamer?

376
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:24,605
You know, we can't have a Sarah.

377
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:27,828
We've got to have, it's got to be the person holding the Vita.

378
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:30,191
So, you know, we kind of...

379
00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:35,480
This was, this needed to be the reality that we would base it off.

380
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:39,284
You know, the way that someone is holding it.

381
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:43,949
You know, we knew one fact about someone playing a video game,

382
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,833
and that's, you know, they're pretty likely to be playing a video game.

383
00:27:49,615 --> 00:27:54,697
So, you know, and that became, you know, it's fairly obvious, really.

384
00:27:54,857 --> 00:28:00,380
But, you know, it's kind of an important thing to bear in mind, really.

385
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:07,624
And when we started with this process, you know, we knew that it would be a handheld game.

386
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:10,825
So we knew that, you know, players would be holding it with their hands.

387
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:14,107
And we'd already made a thing of the fact that you could push your fingers in.

388
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:21,653
But we also knew they'll probably be looking at it with their face, so maybe we could do something with their face.

389
00:28:22,854 --> 00:28:28,398
It's always going to be in pretty much the same place staring down on the game world.

390
00:28:30,596 --> 00:28:34,719
And also, they're pretty likely to have items all around them,

391
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:37,801
you know, items that are important to them, you know,

392
00:28:37,821 --> 00:28:41,084
the little pieces of everyday treasure that you have

393
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:44,386
around yourself, like it might be your wallet or a photo

394
00:28:44,426 --> 00:28:49,330
of a loved one or, you know, a glass of orange juice.

395
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:54,694
And, you know, it felt that we could maybe, you know,

396
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:57,456
combine all of these elements and start sort

397
00:28:57,496 --> 00:28:59,197
of building a fantasy out of them.

398
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:03,820
to draw the player more into this fantasy

399
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,201
because it would be all things that they recognize

400
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:09,442
and they know that it's been partly based on them.

401
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:13,203
So that was really the basis of our game jam,

402
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:15,244
to just think about, well, okay,

403
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:17,945
so someone is holding this world in their hands,

404
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:19,146
looking at it with their face.

405
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,547
What's the greatest context of the world around them?

406
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:23,967
What items do they have with them?

407
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,961
And through our timeline, we really got together as a whole team and did various experiments

408
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:41,983
to work on these ways of drawing the player in and making something of their existence

409
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:45,464
in the game world, to make it a world held in their hands.

410
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:50,825
So I've got a couple of videos from this period.

411
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:56,246
So this first one is Omar.

412
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:59,628
There's Omar down there.

413
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:06,439
Give us a wave, Omar.

414
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,581
Let's get him going.

415
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:17,790
I've been testing using the face detection to, when I roll my head.

416
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:19,952
So it's using the front camera?

417
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:24,434
Yeah, it's using the front camera and seeing my face and evaluating the roll of my face

418
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:25,875
and rotating the camera accordingly.

419
00:30:25,895 --> 00:30:31,618
This very important door opens up when you smile.

420
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:39,367
It just freaks out.

421
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,028
Oh wow.

422
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:42,389
Hang on, your smile is doing that?

423
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:43,229
Yeah.

424
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:44,650
It's a bit dodgy.

425
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:49,291
It only recognizes Omar's smile though.

426
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:50,692
That's kind of the idea.

427
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:54,834
That's very cool.

428
00:30:55,034 --> 00:30:58,815
There's a lot of issues, but it's kind of here to exhibit the design and technical issue

429
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:03,417
and see how we can design around that, maybe use that for something.

430
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:10,586
There's other parameters that the library gives us, such as we can have a glass door that only opens if you have glasses.

431
00:31:10,606 --> 00:31:15,228
It could be a door, though.

432
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:17,129
It could be a girl door.

433
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:32,131
It can be a girl doll.

434
00:31:32,412 --> 00:31:33,412
Only open if you're a girl.

435
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:34,152
No.

436
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:38,434
So that's, I guess, that's a bit,

437
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:44,396
I'm trying to get that in a state enough that it's kind of working in the game

438
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,117
without breaking the rest of the game.

439
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:49,838
It's very experimental but maybe you can find used to that.

440
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:52,619
Well, that's great. That's helpful.

441
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:54,820
Yeah. Cool. Great.

442
00:31:58,478 --> 00:32:00,540
So it's something quite experimental.

443
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,681
It's also my desk there.

444
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:03,141
Whoops.

445
00:32:03,441 --> 00:32:04,021
Let's move on.

446
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:07,123
And here's Matt.

447
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:10,405
He was also working on some experiments as well.

448
00:32:10,785 --> 00:32:12,526
This is one using the microphone,

449
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:18,389
thinking about how we could use audio to draw the player

450
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:19,489
into the world as well.

451
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:20,690
So let's.

452
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:25,611
The first part of a megaphone.

453
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:30,473
I was trying to think how we could do the recording voices a good way.

454
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:32,913
I'm not sure I've got it in the right place.

455
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:37,535
So this is his megaphone object, and if you hold down this button, he holds it above his head,

456
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:39,375
which allows you to talk into it.

457
00:32:40,115 --> 00:32:41,175
So you're like,

458
00:32:41,436 --> 00:32:41,956
CABBAGES!

459
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,796
And then when you press this button,

460
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,657
CABBAGES!

461
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:48,377
CABBAGES!

462
00:32:48,437 --> 00:32:50,198
CABBAGES!

463
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:56,299
It's powerful enough.

464
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:56,719
Can't do.

465
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,022
You can drop it as like a mine.

466
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:01,823
Can't do.

467
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:02,664
Bit silly.

468
00:33:02,704 --> 00:33:04,505
Does it work with any vegetables?

469
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,226
With vegetables?

470
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:07,267
Carrots, doesn't work with lettuce.

471
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:22,894
So actually, I'm going to skip through that one.

472
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:27,623
Let's move on to, well, there's a little bit of paper,

473
00:33:28,043 --> 00:33:28,864
just to keep me happy.

474
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:29,284
There we go.

475
00:33:30,524 --> 00:33:36,565
So through this mixture of the whole team experimenting

476
00:33:36,605 --> 00:33:38,185
with all these different things, I mean,

477
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,686
I had certain things I wanted to try, and Dave Smith,

478
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:42,966
he also wanted to try a bunch of stuff.

479
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:45,847
But everyone could really get involved

480
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:48,487
and try out their own ideas.

481
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,808
And we ended up with quite an overwhelming list.

482
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:51,788
So we had things like.

483
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:55,071
which you could tap the back of the Vita

484
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:56,472
and things would fly in the air.

485
00:33:56,572 --> 00:33:59,936
We had allowing you to put fingerprints on the landscape

486
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:01,898
and sort of make it messy so that you really felt

487
00:34:01,938 --> 00:34:03,419
like you were touching the land.

488
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:08,304
Flicking glue around, matching,

489
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:12,248
using the camera to match the color of the camera feed

490
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:13,689
with the things in the world.

491
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:18,553
Face detection so that we could angle the camera

492
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:22,015
depending on how you're looking at it, and the gravity

493
00:34:22,575 --> 00:34:28,498
using the gyros the way you were tilting the world, having the Vita buttons actually inside of the world.

494
00:34:28,558 --> 00:34:31,119
So it's like that's kind of a quite a mad thing.

495
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,600
As you saw or heard,

496
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:38,503
sound recording, bringing in the player's voice is a powerful force.

497
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:43,046
A really big one was actually bringing in this feeling of a pop-up book

498
00:34:43,126 --> 00:34:45,469
and making the world fold and unfold

499
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:50,753
and how that really pushed the gameplay forward

500
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:53,736
as a 3D environment that you could traverse.

501
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:56,438
Record scratching,

502
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,080
beard doors,

503
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:02,023
that should probably be a bullet point on any game.

504
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:08,340
Augmented reality, like actually allowing the character to come out of the game and

505
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,981
start running around on your podium when you're trying to do a conference.

506
00:35:13,962 --> 00:35:16,222
Using the front touch to unpeel things.

507
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:20,884
Using crafting so that you could actually cut out bits of paper and move them around.

508
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:22,664
I don't know what that last one is.

509
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:23,085
Growing.

510
00:35:23,145 --> 00:35:23,905
It's going off screen.

511
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:26,286
Maybe it's growing a beard to open a door.

512
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:26,686
I don't know.

513
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:32,291
So having got all of that stuff, it's quite an overwhelming list.

514
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,373
So we really needed to edit it.

515
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:41,141
We really needed to think, what could we actually

516
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:42,362
have in the game that would?

517
00:35:44,295 --> 00:35:49,797
that could guarantee a certain level of experience for all players.

518
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:57,940
And I think the big takeaway from this period was learning the things that would require...

519
00:36:02,014 --> 00:36:05,056
require skill and timing, and should require skill and timing.

520
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:12,000
And then separating those from the things that are just there to make you laugh,

521
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:18,764
to make you feel, you know, an emotional reaction to the world, to make you, you know, just enjoy yourself.

522
00:36:21,786 --> 00:36:26,248
And, you know, that was just a really core thing for us, you know.

523
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:29,851
We tried out this idea of having

524
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:31,951
I

525
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:32,171
mean

526
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:32,932
it has been written.

527
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:56,476
Maybe you haven't got like studio quality lighting in your house.

528
00:36:56,536 --> 00:36:58,458
So, you know, it felt like we just...

529
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:01,981
It was much better to just allow players to go,

530
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,643
right, I want that bridge to be pink.

531
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:06,706
And, you know, they take a photo of a pink thing and they move on

532
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:10,469
rather than just being blocked all the time by having to solve,

533
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,492
you know, sort of hard problems with this kind of stuff.

534
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:14,993
Leave all of those...

535
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:24,142
Those activities for the more platforming things with the folding, unfolding world, the drums, you know, those kind of elements.

536
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:30,539
And the same went for Matt's sound recording experiment

537
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:33,160
that you just heard.

538
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,242
We tried it as this sonic weapon,

539
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:39,565
using the player's voice as a way of blasting the enemies

540
00:37:39,645 --> 00:37:42,106
away and unfolding the papery landscape.

541
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,808
And while it was fun for a few seconds,

542
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,530
and it's kind of entertaining when you see it in a short

543
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,773
video, it didn't really hold up as a long-term experience

544
00:37:52,393 --> 00:37:53,434
of going on this journey.

545
00:37:54,892 --> 00:37:58,875
So let's just play it a couple of times, just to annoy Michelle.

546
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:04,900
So we paired it back, so it just became a character.

547
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:07,722
We wanted to get the most out of it,

548
00:38:07,762 --> 00:38:11,605
which was seeing the way that the world was responding

549
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,646
to this bellowing voice.

550
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:16,589
So instead of having it happen all over the place,

551
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:19,631
we brought it down and made it more characterful

552
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:22,013
by turning it into a scarecrow.

553
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:30,020
So that, you know, the player would get a more memorable, less repetitive version

554
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:34,986
that felt more helpful to the world because you were actually helping a specific character.

555
00:38:35,787 --> 00:38:42,133
And also probably, you know, it lowers the chance of players getting arrested for playing in a public place.

556
00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:43,595
So, you know, that's always good.

557
00:38:44,676 --> 00:38:49,282
And the face tracking tech for the beard doors,

558
00:38:49,342 --> 00:38:51,946
well, that was just too glitchy.

559
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:54,669
We wouldn't have been able to ship a game with that.

560
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:58,090
But we really enjoyed the way that it made you smile,

561
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:02,694
made you sort of think about what you were doing with your face while you were playing.

562
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,456
You know, so it felt like there was something there,

563
00:39:06,516 --> 00:39:09,879
but that wasn't the right implementation of it at that point.

564
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:15,523
So, you know, we knew by this stage that we had our paper world coming together.

565
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:20,307
We knew that we were going on a journey through the paper world, you know, with our little

566
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:21,228
messenger character.

567
00:39:21,248 --> 00:39:29,775
But our goal was really to involve the player more directly than usual.

568
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:35,560
You know, we wanted to push it further and give the player, you know, an actual visual

569
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:36,641
identity in the game.

570
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:45,627
And it was trying to figure out how we could get that same feeling of pulling facial expressions

571
00:39:45,747 --> 00:39:51,912
and that we saw in the beard doors, but not letting the technology get in the way of that

572
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:52,213
really.

573
00:39:53,847 --> 00:40:00,910
So, you know, we knew that the character would be trying to progress through this world and get to a goal to reach on this adventure.

574
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:04,712
And it needed to be visual, you know, they needed something to walk towards.

575
00:40:05,753 --> 00:40:09,874
And it needed to be something that they wouldn't need a, you know, crazy mini-map to find.

576
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:15,036
And so many folk tales have the sun as the core of their

577
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:19,717
as their stories, you know, that it's like the starting point for

578
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:28,339
you know a world's creation or often used as a climax for the world's end. So, you know, a sun is a very very recognizable

579
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:34,520
you know thing up in the sky, but just walking towards it as a goal of the game didn't seem very compelling.

580
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,961
But you know, maybe if it was broken

581
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:41,544
If it was torn open and it revealed the player looking through,

582
00:40:42,644 --> 00:40:44,606
they would then be ever present in the game.

583
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:50,689
And it would start to be a story about reuniting the character with the player.

584
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,381
So that really established the goal of the game,

585
00:40:56,082 --> 00:41:00,026
guiding the in-game character back to the player

586
00:41:00,906 --> 00:41:02,208
so that they could be reunited.

587
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:06,252
And that kind of elevated the player's importance

588
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:06,912
in the story.

589
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,775
It made it a more meaningful relationship

590
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:11,017
between the two of them.

591
00:41:13,315 --> 00:41:16,977
And it really, it meant that they were pulling faces

592
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,958
and they were doing all of the things that we were talking about,

593
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:20,779
you know, seeing that video just now,

594
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:23,621
but now they're just doing it for their own entertainment.

595
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:27,483
It meant that instead of, in a cut scene,

596
00:41:27,523 --> 00:41:29,004
instead of pressing the skip button,

597
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:32,165
you know, they're actually just kind of getting involved with the drama

598
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:35,707
and kind of pulling their own faces and acting things out.

599
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:37,809
A bit like this little example,

600
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,690
you see the two of them looking at each other.

601
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:43,164
Quite cute.

602
00:41:43,184 --> 00:41:46,107
And essentially, we got this sort of hyper-realistic main

603
00:41:46,147 --> 00:41:47,369
character for free.

604
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:50,832
We didn't need 50 customization sliders to make

605
00:41:50,872 --> 00:41:52,814
it look like the player, because it is the player.

606
00:41:52,914 --> 00:41:55,596
So that's quite handy.

607
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:07,378
But it is a divisive feature and not everyone, you know, for some it's been their favorite part of the game,

608
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:13,820
other ones, you know, it's less so, but a few people have said, you know, it should be something that you can toggle on and off.

609
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,820
But, you know, I think...

610
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,582
I think that would be a huge shame.

611
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:21,244
It's not like you would turn off Ellie in Last of Us.

612
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:23,665
They're a core character in the game.

613
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:26,687
So I think they really need to be there.

614
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:30,389
I think it's really important sometimes in design

615
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:32,570
to make a big decision like that

616
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,673
and make something that, well, sort of divides people a little more

617
00:42:37,753 --> 00:42:41,435
just so that you make something really memorable for some people.

618
00:42:44,322 --> 00:42:46,423
Yeah, let's put some hearts on just to show that.

619
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:52,266
So moving on through our timeline,

620
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:53,906
we're getting towards the end now.

621
00:42:57,295 --> 00:43:04,938
We were now in the process, we've done our game jam, we've edited it down, we've established the goal of the game.

622
00:43:05,978 --> 00:43:10,840
And now we were building the world, the most intensive phase.

623
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:18,262
There's not quite so much to say about that, but something that was very important throughout the whole experience was making sure that...

624
00:43:19,202 --> 00:43:24,644
The player was just having positive feedback all of the time to really draw them through this world

625
00:43:24,724 --> 00:43:27,445
and make sure that everything was being rewarded.

626
00:43:27,545 --> 00:43:35,948
Every footstep they took was just getting pleasant visual feedback as they progressed on through the world.

627
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:47,605
And, you know, the world is just celebrating the player's presence the whole time, you know,

628
00:43:47,645 --> 00:43:52,751
just sort of spawning particles and hearts and, you know, just being really, really happy

629
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:54,473
about the fact that they're there.

630
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:59,299
You know, I think a key point, when I was talking about the sun earlier, is that

631
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:04,417
All of these characters are looking up at the sun and, you know, sort of like almost

632
00:44:04,457 --> 00:44:05,219
worshipping it.

633
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:10,169
So, you know, that should, you know, hopefully feel like a nice experience for any player

634
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:10,790
like looking in.

635
00:44:14,478 --> 00:44:17,779
And then as the game was forming,

636
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,840
we knew that we wanted it to be more than just our story.

637
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,621
We wanted the players to be able to add to it,

638
00:44:26,461 --> 00:44:29,742
so that it would gradually transfer the ownership from us,

639
00:44:29,842 --> 00:44:33,443
the people that started making it, to them.

640
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:39,204
I started the game with the line, this is not your world.

641
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:41,005
It's a world of stories.

642
00:44:41,465 --> 00:44:43,685
The idea being that it's kind of like a folk tale

643
00:44:43,705 --> 00:44:43,945
of that.

644
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:47,387
You know, it gets told and retold.

645
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:54,170
The basic structure is there, but the details change each time because this is this massive

646
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,472
wild card that gets introduced every time, which is the player themselves.

647
00:44:59,553 --> 00:45:07,276
And the way that we did that was through lots of simple and almost instant customization,

648
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:10,158
lots of creativity, which all adds up.

649
00:45:13,387 --> 00:45:15,247
Because that was kind of the most...

650
00:45:17,868 --> 00:45:22,690
Well, the strongest way to really set the player at the heart of this world

651
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,611
was to make it their world as they progressed through it.

652
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:43,349
Yes, so we'd learned from LittleBigPlanet, you know, like what amazing, amazingly complex things people will make if you give them the tools.

653
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,331
But it's something that not everyone does.

654
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:53,899
So for Tearaway, we really wanted to make sure that it was very inclusive and everyone could create and add.

655
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,601
So, you know...

656
00:45:56,902 --> 00:46:02,568
Like using cameras and things like that just made it very, very quick and easy to change

657
00:46:02,608 --> 00:46:03,629
bits of the environment.

658
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:10,516
You see here with this elk, you know, you can almost instantly make him spotty.

659
00:46:16,182 --> 00:46:17,363
Which just makes him very happy.

660
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:23,857
You know, and photography became a huge part of the game.

661
00:46:24,978 --> 00:46:27,678
Because it's a very democratic form of creativity.

662
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:30,359
If you've got a beautiful world to photograph,

663
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:35,880
then obviously everyone can take beautiful photos as a sort of baseline, really.

664
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,621
But adding on top of that, we added filters and other things

665
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:45,402
so that players could go deeper and add their own elements to...

666
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:47,303
to that system.

667
00:46:48,483 --> 00:46:55,666
You know, it became more like Instagram, really, where, you know, you can make something look

668
00:46:55,706 --> 00:46:59,707
cool in the time that it just takes to press a button, essentially.

669
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:01,908
You can't fail that challenge.

670
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:07,971
And there wasn't any point in us creating, you know, sort of impossible algorithms to

671
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,372
try and figure out if someone had made something that looked good.

672
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:12,893
You know, it's kind of, it's up to them if they're happy with it.

673
00:47:13,825 --> 00:47:16,771
And if they're happy with it, they'll probably want to share it out as well.

674
00:47:16,811 --> 00:47:22,423
So, you know, we produced a system so that they could do that as well.

675
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:36,558
And then for many in LittleBigPlanet, choosing costumes was a way that they customized their

676
00:47:36,598 --> 00:47:39,200
experience without delving into the level creation.

677
00:47:40,261 --> 00:47:45,966
And for Tearaway, we didn't really want to go down the same route of having ready-made

678
00:47:46,026 --> 00:47:47,328
sort of costume pieces.

679
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:53,070
But it felt that without having character customization,

680
00:47:53,691 --> 00:47:55,091
it was much harder for the player

681
00:47:55,131 --> 00:47:57,732
to feel the bond with this messenger

682
00:47:57,772 --> 00:47:59,312
that they're going to be taking through the world.

683
00:48:00,673 --> 00:48:03,274
So one of the engineers on the Tearaway team, Nathan,

684
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:08,235
he wanted to give the ability to cut out bits of paper

685
00:48:08,295 --> 00:48:13,297
and create a similar feeling for character customization.

686
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,531
based entirely on what you could do with a cutting mat

687
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:21,159
and a pair of scissors and some bits of paper.

688
00:48:23,149 --> 00:48:28,392
And when he first pitched it to me, I was a little bit concerned that it was quite easy

689
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:33,474
that it could be a huge amount of feature creep and it could really bloat out into something

690
00:48:33,534 --> 00:48:33,874
huge.

691
00:48:34,235 --> 00:48:38,977
So it was really important for us to really stick to that real world metaphor of the cutting

692
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:43,559
mat and the pieces of paper.

693
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:50,183
Just to make sure that it stayed very real and very well.

694
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:59,461
Like, if you actually did have a cutting mat and you met a squirrel with delusions of grandeur,

695
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:03,147
you know, you could quite easily sort him out with a crown.

696
00:49:06,008 --> 00:49:13,795
Here's some images that I grabbed off our website, showing a lot of the creativity that

697
00:49:13,835 --> 00:49:14,755
players have been doing.

698
00:49:14,775 --> 00:49:18,098
None of them are particularly complex.

699
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:20,380
Most of them are quite similar.

700
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:26,225
But the important thing is that they're the personal creation of everyone that made them.

701
00:49:27,406 --> 00:49:38,989
And we chose to make this Challenger crown because it's such an easy shape to describe.

702
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:43,230
But it's also one that you can add your own details onto, you know, if you want to collage

703
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,031
a load of gems or...

704
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:48,793
You know, extra details on them. That's all, it's all possible.

705
00:49:49,313 --> 00:49:52,355
But ultimately, you know, they get to stick them on a cute character

706
00:49:52,835 --> 00:49:55,817
that's being, you know, professionally animated, so that, you know,

707
00:49:55,837 --> 00:49:58,379
they kind of feel like they've made the squirrel because, you know,

708
00:49:58,439 --> 00:50:01,941
it's kind of unified, you know, their bit of the world and ours together.

709
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:07,644
And then that extends on into being able to do it for the main character as well.

710
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:14,200
And plus, also, you know, when you make a system like that,

711
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,701
you allow people to make all sorts of things as well,

712
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:19,641
which you might recognize.

713
00:50:20,181 --> 00:50:21,342
But I'm not going to say what they are.

714
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:27,203
You know, I mean, I think it's, I would rather people make,

715
00:50:27,363 --> 00:50:29,524
you know, their own imaginative characters,

716
00:50:29,624 --> 00:50:32,225
but I think fan art's a really good way to start.

717
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:36,045
You know, it's a way to learn and experiment and work

718
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:37,226
within the parameters of...

719
00:50:39,482 --> 00:50:42,507
of the other IPs that they're aiming at.

720
00:50:44,591 --> 00:50:47,696
Developing this also really showed how we needed a selfie camera,

721
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:50,281
otherwise you'd never be able to see any of these images.

722
00:50:52,857 --> 00:50:55,840
So then the final point I'd like to make

723
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,244
was that once we built this fantasy around the player

724
00:50:59,304 --> 00:51:05,550
and let them, well, we wanted to allow them to sort of close

725
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:08,413
that loop, really, and just take all of this world out

726
00:51:08,453 --> 00:51:08,854
of the game.

727
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:13,758
It wasn't just a world around them in a sort of digital way.

728
00:51:13,778 --> 00:51:20,185
It actually was possible to bring that world kind of physically around them.

729
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:26,391
So that we could get more of this sort of feeling from Labyrinth again.

730
00:51:27,492 --> 00:51:33,338
So, we all know about 3D printers and how they're the...

731
00:51:33,718 --> 00:51:38,699
The future of turning digital things into physical things.

732
00:51:38,799 --> 00:51:42,120
But for Tearaway, we went a little more old school.

733
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,181
We went for 2D printers.

734
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:49,661
They kind of sit around being all beige and unused

735
00:51:49,762 --> 00:51:50,722
and unloved.

736
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:53,762
And they don't really get to have any fun with video games.

737
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:58,764
So we designed all the mechanisms, the reward systems

738
00:51:58,804 --> 00:52:01,724
in the game so that the player could then print out

739
00:52:01,764 --> 00:52:02,784
the things that they find.

740
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:07,348
You know, take them out and print out all of these things as like physical trophies.

741
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:13,613
With the aim of making these what would normally be a digital trophy, like, really make mean something.

742
00:52:14,554 --> 00:52:19,518
Make it tangible and not only visible to other players of that particular game,

743
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:24,562
but make them visible to everyone, you know, out in the real world.

744
00:52:25,163 --> 00:52:27,565
To make them real, not just a fantasy.

745
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:33,450
And obviously, you know, if players actually make that paper craft trophy themselves,

746
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,152
then it becomes theirs, it becomes unique to them.

747
00:52:36,172 --> 00:52:40,994
You know, unlocking it in the game is like the initial challenge that everyone has,

748
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:46,276
but creating it in real life is when it really becomes their own object.

749
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:50,559
So, kind of a little summary.

750
00:52:53,182 --> 00:52:59,110
Some of the examples of how we tried to merge the player's world with the world that they were playing with

751
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:05,999
to make something a little more interesting out of the mundane and really put the player at the heart of it.

752
00:53:07,439 --> 00:53:12,404
We gave players a way to play in our fantasy world

753
00:53:12,444 --> 00:53:17,608
through a material that they would recognize and understand.

754
00:53:17,688 --> 00:53:20,531
We tried to then make it very relevant to their lives

755
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,232
by drawing in what was around them,

756
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:23,894
using the cameras and the microphone

757
00:53:24,554 --> 00:53:28,418
to sort of treat their world

758
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:31,080
like a sort of photographic texture library, almost,

759
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,822
of how they could unite the two systems.

760
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:42,475
And making sure that they could easily add to it with challenges that were almost instantaneous,

761
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:44,316
but that were additive.

762
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:51,880
So they would, over time, they would really sort of change the world in ways that were

763
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,822
far beyond what they thought they were capable of themselves.

764
00:53:58,115 --> 00:54:02,417
And then also we needed to figure out when to challenge the player,

765
00:54:02,478 --> 00:54:08,521
but also when to just celebrate them and just let them, you know, have free reign and enjoy

766
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:12,163
the mechanics that we were supplying them with.

767
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:17,422
And then finally, just treating the game as a starting point

768
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:23,927
so that they could hopefully start building this world

769
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:26,949
outside of the game or actually get involved

770
00:54:27,009 --> 00:54:31,012
and have some other creative experiences that don't actually

771
00:54:31,052 --> 00:54:32,513
have anything to do with the game at all,

772
00:54:32,653 --> 00:54:34,294
but just enjoy making.

773
00:54:35,335 --> 00:54:37,857
And that is pretty much me done.

774
00:54:37,877 --> 00:54:42,661
Thank you.

775
00:54:42,701 --> 00:54:42,941
Thank you.

776
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:43,141
Thank you.

777
00:54:49,773 --> 00:54:50,974
Do we have any questions?

778
00:54:50,994 --> 00:55:00,279
I think that might be a no.

779
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,261
Oh, sorry.

780
00:55:02,901 --> 00:55:04,762
So much light over there, I can't see you.

781
00:55:06,023 --> 00:55:06,283
Hello.

782
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:06,803
Hi.

783
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:08,384
Great talk, thank you.

784
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:09,485
Thank you.

785
00:55:09,825 --> 00:55:12,627
I was wondering how long it took to make the game

786
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:14,948
and how long the game jam was in relation to that, too.

787
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:19,287
So, how long was the game and how long was the game jam?

788
00:55:20,588 --> 00:55:26,331
Well, the game in total development was about two and a half years, I guess.

789
00:55:28,012 --> 00:55:33,595
And the game jam... I mean, we had a very concentrated period, which would have been...

790
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:36,457
I guess maybe a month or two.

791
00:55:38,197 --> 00:55:41,278
But once we'd done that, then it became more sort of part

792
00:55:41,298 --> 00:55:46,280
of the culture of Tearaway so that we would have mini ones

793
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:50,381
as we proceeded, which kind of got shorter

794
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:54,242
as we sort of figured out the mechanics more and more.

795
00:55:54,402 --> 00:55:57,603
But yeah, so yeah, I guess.

796
00:55:59,175 --> 00:56:03,259
It's obviously a smaller part of the overall development time,

797
00:56:03,339 --> 00:56:05,161
but a very important one.

798
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:05,682
Great.

799
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:06,342
Thank you very much.

800
00:56:06,423 --> 00:56:06,683
Thank you.

801
00:56:09,688 --> 00:56:13,530
Thank you for remembering me how amazing the game was

802
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:14,470
in the first place.

803
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,231
The question is, I loved it so much.

804
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,572
There was only one thing that kind of annoyed me.

805
00:56:19,652 --> 00:56:21,972
I was wondering if you guys had any problem with that

806
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:24,073
during designing and testing.

807
00:56:24,773 --> 00:56:26,834
Some of the animations of the paper things

808
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:32,316
like really change every few frames, not on a smooth basis.

809
00:56:32,576 --> 00:56:34,156
I understand where this comes from.

810
00:56:34,677 --> 00:56:36,697
But on the other hand, the other animations,

811
00:56:36,737 --> 00:56:38,678
like character animation, are very smooth.

812
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:43,893
So kind of my perception was this kind of disjoint

813
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:47,155
of this trying to simulate how we did a classic animation

814
00:56:47,175 --> 00:56:52,038
with paper, changing like 10 times a second, not 30 or 60,

815
00:56:52,939 --> 00:56:54,299
but the other part being smooth.

816
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,801
So did you have any thoughts about that?

817
00:56:58,362 --> 00:57:00,843
So I'll try to summarize that.

818
00:57:02,204 --> 00:57:06,167
Yeah, so the different frame rates of the paper.

819
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:14,455
I mean, to be honest, we designed it so that everything animated was not animated at full

820
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,096
frame rate.

821
00:57:15,777 --> 00:57:22,122
So all of the characters are animated at like 15 frames a second, so that they do still

822
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:23,123
have that stop motion.

823
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:26,926
But you maybe don't see it quite so much because they're smaller on the screen.

824
00:57:28,187 --> 00:57:32,190
But I mean, it was important to us to get that sort of aesthetic of feeling like the

825
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,311
paper was coming to life.

826
00:57:35,053 --> 00:57:37,535
It was kind of self-conscious about the fact that it's moving.

827
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:41,518
But obviously, the game needed to run at full frame rate

828
00:57:41,678 --> 00:57:44,241
in order for you to move around and have

829
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:45,942
kind of action-based gameplay.

830
00:57:46,002 --> 00:57:48,184
So we weren't sure for a while whether we

831
00:57:48,224 --> 00:57:53,208
would be able to unite the stop-motion style

832
00:57:53,308 --> 00:57:55,130
with full-motion movement.

833
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:59,033
But I feel that we got a good balance there.

834
00:57:59,573 --> 00:57:59,834
Thank you.

835
00:58:00,194 --> 00:58:00,454
Thank you.

836
00:58:03,078 --> 00:58:04,821
Okay, well, thank you very much.

837
00:58:05,643 --> 00:58:09,470
I think I probably need to say about the form again,

838
