1
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:11,539
There's Markus. So my history, I've been working on software projects for about 25 years.

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,004
Initially, like multimedia, CD-ROMs and websites.

3
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:20,050
And then a couple of friends of mine started a company called Sulake, where I joined to make Hubble Hotel for about 10 years.

4
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:26,154
I was also the lead designer for Virtual Magic Kingdom for Disney in that company.

5
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:32,997
Then started my own startup in London called Neki Lab where I made 3D printed toys and games.

6
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:37,019
After that moved back to Helsinki to work on next games where I've been

7
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:40,580
working as an executive producer and a game designer.

8
00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:45,122
My name is Markus Montola.

9
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,805
I've been working on location-based games for 15

10
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:48,605
years.

11
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:52,528
In 2009, we wrote a book and published a book called

12
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:55,751
Pervasive Games, Theory and Design, because we already

13
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,272
knew how to design this kind of stuff.

14
00:00:57,993 --> 00:01:01,616
Then iPhone happened, and the playbook was rewritten.

15
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:05,839
I was working on the first mobile location-based MMO

16
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,461
Shadows at least, and after that, I've been working on

17
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,343
different mobile gaming startups in

18
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:12,204
Helsinki since then.

19
00:01:14,403 --> 00:01:18,966
Well, so today's topics.

20
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,648
So we're basically going to talk about how we made the

21
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,970
original source of gameplay for the game.

22
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,913
And to get you started, we're going to first basically

23
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:29,374
explain what the game is.

24
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:31,455
So how many of you have actually played it?

25
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:35,523
Okay, quite a few. Awesome.

26
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:38,344
But for the rest of you, to give some context,

27
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:41,825
then we're going to be talking about the prototyping and pre-production research

28
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:46,145
and things that we did to really figure out what the game was that we wanted to build

29
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,606
and then about some of the designs that we actually landed on.

30
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,227
So Walking Dead Our World, it's a location-based game.

31
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:57,748
It's a single shard MMO, world scale,

32
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:59,728
where every single one of the players is in the same...

33
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:01,198
reality.

34
00:02:01,258 --> 00:02:04,759
Same to same missions, you can persist things on the map so you can actually put that stuff

35
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:05,939
down, other people will see it.

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,641
And you basically play the game by going to these missions that you see around you, kill

37
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:16,963
the walkers, get some collectibles, and become more powerful to go into even harder missions.

38
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:25,209
And this being based on the TV series, it features a lot of the characters from the TV series as collectibles.

39
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:35,740
So you can actually find and play with the actual show cast and get them to be more powerful and help you in the missions as well as collecting weapons that you can use yourself.

40
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:38,159
And when you go to the missions, it kind of looks like this.

41
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:40,843
So here I'm with Carl shooting some zombies.

42
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:44,028
You can use AR if your phone is compatible.

43
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:48,254
So they actually like do real world human scale AR things, which is really cool.

44
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:58,220
Last but not least, we do a guild system where each one of the players is pushed into a guild very early on during the game where you can chat.

45
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:13,684
But they also have these task boards where you start to complete these tasks together collaboratively with the rest of the guild and unlock some of the best rewards and then get progressively harder challenges as a group to complete.

46
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:20,519
And this actually turned out to be a lot more successful than we thought it would.

47
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:26,604
Where for me as a game designer, basically I've been reading some of the feedback we've been getting on this particular feature.

48
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:34,211
And people are telling us crazy stuff like somebody is biking 30 kilometers every freaking day

49
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:39,416
to complete more missions to actually be able to help the guild advance in the tasks.

50
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:47,503
And a lot of people actually telling that they never quite felt this deeply about collaborative social gameplay in any of the games that they've played before.

51
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:56,992
Which I think is a really cool achievement for me as a game designer to actually be able to pull it off in a small mobile game.

52
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:03,121
So how did we end up on this and creating a Walking Dead game in the first place?

53
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:08,445
So the previous game we made was called The Walking Dead Domain's Land, which is a tactical

54
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:13,409
kind of like turn-based shooter. Looks a bit like maybe XCOM but super simplified for mobile.

55
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:21,275
And we featured similar elements where you were collecting the show cast, you made teams of three,

56
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:27,140
went into missions and like of different types like solve little puzzles with these guys.

57
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,071
And we were really happy about how this game turned out.

58
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:34,773
And AMC seemed to really enjoy us as well and like the game.

59
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:38,596
And simultaneously, the Walking Dead as TV series

60
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:40,817
is still doing incredibly well.

61
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,639
So back when we were starting the project,

62
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,880
we were looking at the show and figured that like,

63
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:48,483
the brand has some true longevity.

64
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,824
And AMC was quite happy with us,

65
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,326
so we figured it's kind of like a no-brainer

66
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,068
to make another game with those guys.

67
00:04:57,584 --> 00:05:05,708
And at Next, when we start working on new projects, one of the things we really want to do is figure out gameplay mechanics in the games that make sense from the brand perspective.

68
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:16,012
So we primarily do games based on IPs, and now that we were creating a new game for The Walking Dead, we wanted to figure out what would be a logical combination for that brand.

69
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:25,727
And many of the viewers of the show actually like were telling us that they have this core fantasy of like really thinking what they would do if the zombie infestation actually happened.

70
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:41,933
So we figured that like, let's maybe try to prototype location based gaming and see if that works, because it's a really good brand fit actually, like being able to really put you in the situation where like now you're alone, you need to get better weapons, better teams to be able to survive the zombies.

71
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:46,512
Now, this being the beginning of the project, we kind of figured,

72
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:49,633
OK, let's actually look at location-based gaming, what's

73
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:52,434
been done in the genre before, to understand it better.

74
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:57,695
But also come up with a really live in the present and plan

75
00:05:57,715 --> 00:05:59,916
for the launch, where you need to come up

76
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:01,516
with a feature set that's actually

77
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:03,977
doable in high quality during the production,

78
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,878
which has to be also really competitive when

79
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:07,558
the game goes out.

80
00:06:07,964 --> 00:06:12,068
So I think one of the big problems is when you have a production schedule of a couple of years,

81
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:17,895
you need to figure out a set of features and gameplay that's going to be competitive and

82
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:21,579
compelling to the players when you actually ship the game when the market's already changed to

83
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:27,886
something different. So what can we learn from the past? Shadow Cities is like where you will

84
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:29,127
actually look into multiple games.

85
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:36,021
Including Shadow Cities, one of the really early ones that Marcos had made back in the day.

86
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:42,285
And the gameplay basically was that you could build resource production buildings on the map,

87
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:47,908
become more powerful, build teleports that allowed people to cooperate and travel the world.

88
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,851
Super interesting. But also featured really brutal PvP, where when you logged in,

89
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:56,734
you could see your surroundings, but all the other players immediately as well.

90
00:06:57,514 --> 00:07:00,736
And if they weren't powerful, you just got ganked immediately.

91
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,898
And that was kind of really cool if you were the most powerful kid on the block.

92
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:05,999
But many weren't.

93
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:11,622
So the location where you logged in and what time of the day really mattered.

94
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:16,004
Because you started to learn these patterns of where the other powerful players were.

95
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:19,786
That's the areas to actually avoid due to some of the other players being there.

96
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:28,710
Pokémon Go had just come out, so it was in the early stages of a lot of people trying to play the game.

97
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:35,895
And this used a fundamentally different design from what Shadow Cities had done back in the day.

98
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:42,520
In Pokémon, one of the things compared to Shadow Cities is that Shadow Cities gives you perfect information as a player immediately.

99
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,442
So everything on the map was immediately interactable and you could see it.

100
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:48,716
In Pokemon, they actually hide the vast majority of the content,

101
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:52,298
and they want to incentivize you to move to be able to play the game,

102
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,979
so you find the things on the world,

103
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:57,860
and you could really not play without moving at all.

104
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:00,081
Some of the content was obviously visible,

105
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:03,063
so if you wanted to get more Pokeballs,

106
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:07,665
you'd need to go to the PokeStops you did see somewhere around in your neighborhood.

107
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,406
And in order to access a gym,

108
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:12,427
it's very likely that you again needed to move,

109
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:13,888
because they've been so sparsely...

110
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:18,436
placed in the world that it was quite unlikely there was anything next to you.

111
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,801
And with Pokémon, one of the other things I got asked a lot in the early stages of the project,

112
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:29,686
like how do we replicate this level of success? Or I think the primary reason why Pokémon is so

113
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:35,011
successful is, again, simply the fact that the activities the players do in the game is an

114
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:40,275
excellent, like, real brand fit that people were expecting to make in the game.

115
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:44,926
So if you see the animated series ever, you're going to expect it.

116
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:48,468
Yeah, I'm going to walk around the world and throw balls at the Pokemon and collect them.

117
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,430
And this is exactly what you do in the game.

118
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,052
So the mental model that people had in their heads before they started playing

119
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:58,315
perfectly matched the gameplay that they actually got when they started playing the game.

120
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:05,974
So the hard thing when you start making a location-based

121
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:08,795
game is that there are not really that many

122
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,295
location-based games.

123
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:12,415
And especially, there are not that many successful

124
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:13,356
location-based games.

125
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:17,536
So when we started, we knew that we would be, again, into

126
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:20,837
a very exciting and challenging endeavor where we

127
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:23,438
would need to figure out a lot of basic

128
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:24,438
stuff from the get-go.

129
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,739
The thing is that usually when you see people playing mobile

130
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,079
games, the play pattern is something like this.

131
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:35,690
You're somewhere, and then you play there for two seconds,

132
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:36,991
and then you go somewhere else.

133
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,272
Most mobile games are not really mobile.

134
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:43,033
Location-based games are actually mobile.

135
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,975
So we had to face all these kind of different play

136
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:48,495
patterns that players might have.

137
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:51,797
We had to figure out from the design angle, again, based on

138
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:54,018
Shadow Cities, based on Pokemon Go, based on other

139
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:57,659
games, how would players maybe possibly use this game?

140
00:09:59,148 --> 00:09:59,888
This would be me.

141
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:01,849
Most of the time, I'm a commuter player.

142
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,110
So if I'm at work, if I'm at home, if I'm at a games

143
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,411
conference, if I'm in the bus, that's when I play.

144
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:10,891
This is one of our key use cases.

145
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,452
But we have to also figure, how is this game going to work

146
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:17,313
for people who walk their dogs for one hour every day?

147
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:19,914
And how are we going to keep it balanced for them?

148
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,560
Some people like to jog a lot.

149
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,783
They like to play real-world games while they're jogging.

150
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:29,727
We don't necessarily approve, but this is something they

151
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:31,528
will anyway do, so we have to figure out how

152
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:32,009
to deal with it.

153
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:36,507
Something we learned once we actually had launched the game,

154
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,288
we had a lot of tram riders.

155
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:41,169
Trams move a little bit slower than buses, so they are

156
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:44,689
perfect for playing The Walking Dead Our World.

157
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,610
You're sitting in the tram, you're grinding a mission, and

158
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,551
the reason why you're sitting in the tram is that you're

159
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:53,132
trying to grind as efficiently as you can.

160
00:10:53,492 --> 00:10:56,312
We had half of our team sitting in the tram one week

161
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:58,113
when we were in the soft launch trying to

162
00:10:58,173 --> 00:10:59,013
optimize on a mission.

163
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,014
The key point you have to decide is.

164
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:09,164
Do you want the players to move in order to play, or do you want them to play while they're already on the move?

165
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,335
This is how Helsinki looks like.

166
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:14,936
Next Games is based on Helsinki.

167
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:16,918
And you can see the little dots on the map.

168
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:20,261
They are the Google POIs where we spawn all our content.

169
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:23,103
And when you're looking at this kind of map and when

170
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:26,506
you're working in this kind of a city, you get all these

171
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:30,029
exciting ideas about how this kind of a game could work.

172
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,532
Maybe you go to a gas station to get some gas, and then you

173
00:11:33,572 --> 00:11:36,775
go to, I don't know, to the riverfront to get some fish,

174
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:37,755
and then you craft something.

175
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:41,676
And that's, of course, a very good way of doing a game if

176
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:43,836
you make a full collector game, like, for

177
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:44,576
instance, Pokemon.

178
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,498
But we knew that the brand of The Walking Dead is not about

179
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:49,658
assembling collections.

180
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:50,538
It's about something else.

181
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:52,559
It's about survival and fighting and that kind of

182
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,900
stuff. So we couldn't really do that.

183
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,081
And the reality is that much of the map looks like this.

184
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:01,582
This is Kansas in our world.

185
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,803
You can, again, see the POIs on the few roads

186
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:05,443
that you have there.

187
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:11,950
We couldn't really afford to have the fantasy of going to the gas station to get some gas,

188
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:18,192
because let's face it, we are in the mobile free-to-play market, and mobile free-to-play

189
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:19,113
market is about...

190
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,211
about allowing players to generate value

191
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:24,652
through going through core loop,

192
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:26,974
iterating over the core loop again and again.

193
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:28,475
And if you're in this business,

194
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:29,916
you have to be able to get the player

195
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:31,717
into the core loop and out of the core loop

196
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:32,898
and again into the core loop

197
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,420
multiple times during their first session,

198
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,601
no matter where they start.

199
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:39,523
And since we were not doing a full collector,

200
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:41,925
we had to make sure that our game

201
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:43,586
was always playable everywhere

202
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:46,608
and it would be nice and exciting experience

203
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:47,649
no matter where you were.

204
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:53,319
Of course, you can add that kind of frills later, but fundamentally we had to be a core loop game.

205
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,920
So, we went back to the basic.

206
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:03,742
Let's forget about the location for a moment and let's focus on how to make a really great mobile game.

207
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:11,243
Like many other designers, we got highly inspired by the self-determination theory of motivation.

208
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:17,101
If you provide players with competence, if you provide players with autonomy, and if

209
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:21,845
you provide players with relatedness, then they will be highly motivated to play your

210
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:22,185
game.

211
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:26,208
This is one very good recipe for a very good game.

212
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:33,113
Especially we identified the relatedness as a key USP that we could reach in the game.

213
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,743
Other location-based games are also social, but we wanted to focus on guild play.

214
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:44,188
We wanted to focus on the inclined social, because that is very much what the series

215
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:45,529
is also about.

216
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,652
It's about pulling together, not apart, as Rick Grimes would say.

217
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:57,399
So based on this round work, we started shaping up these core design pillars.

218
00:13:58,922 --> 00:13:59,722
Play everywhere.

219
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:03,424
Wherever you log in for the first time, wherever you log

220
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:09,668
in for the first time on every day, you will get a full and

221
00:14:09,768 --> 00:14:11,650
interesting complete session in there.

222
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,192
It's always worth opening the game in the new location.

223
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:17,753
There needs to be enough discovery that I want to see

224
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:18,554
what's surrounding me.

225
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,192
We wanted to support couch play.

226
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:23,392
We wanted to make a little bit more traditional game.

227
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:26,473
So we wanted to make sure that people who would be mostly

228
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,113
playing at home and at work would have a nice experience

229
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:29,873
nevertheless.

230
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:34,754
In our philosophy, getting a better location, moving

231
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:37,655
around, it gives you a nice opportunity.

232
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:40,135
It gives you better optimal situations, but

233
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:41,135
it's never mandatory.

234
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,656
We wanted to focus on the strong collaborative social

235
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:45,096
mechanics.

236
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:48,796
And finally, we wanted to be true to the Walking Dead TV

237
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:49,137
series.

238
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:54,797
So now we have some core pillars,

239
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:57,020
and we should start to get thinking about,

240
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,743
like, how do we approach these?

241
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:00,806
How do we validate these ideas?

242
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:02,389
And how do we prototype them?

243
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,013
And Sulka is going to tell you a lot more about that.

244
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:15,173
All right, so we kind of figured out that there's five big questions that we needed to answer before we knew exactly what we wanted to build.

245
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:25,455
With the core loop, what were the constraints of how you actually can create missions that are meaningful on the map that people will be interacting with?

246
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:28,495
And does the locational context bring something to the gameplay?

247
00:15:28,535 --> 00:15:29,896
Like, what are the things that you can do?

248
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:34,497
And are there some must not do's that we needed to take into account?

249
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:42,426
We figured that this is a map and with geography there might be really interesting opportunities to create area-based gameplay.

250
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:49,715
And with being able to place things on the map, we knew from Shadow Cities that this is a good opportunity,

251
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:54,301
but we needed to figure out what is the gameplay that we would be doing within the context of this game.

252
00:15:55,531 --> 00:16:00,634
For the social gameplay, we wanted to try two different ways of adding social into the game.

253
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:06,017
One would be on-location social, so that you'd actually need to be interacting with the other players

254
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:08,058
or the content that people have been placed on the map.

255
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:15,883
But also, could we do a meta game on the social level that would be played through the on-location missions,

256
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:18,485
but you still progress things on the meta level.

257
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:25,918
Dan Cook has this really fantastic iteration, like illustration file actually iterated on the games.

258
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:31,479
So the way we think about this is early on in the creative process, you're going through these

259
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,861
cycles where you want to add value and not try new things, but you need to be able to identify

260
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:41,062
what's valuable and cull away all the all the things you are trying that don't actually

261
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,763
ultimately add value to the players of your game.

262
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:50,256
For the prototyping, the core cycle that we looked into that we wanted to do with each one of the prototypes is

263
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:56,397
gather ideas and research, design the gameplay mechanics that we wanted to implement into the test,

264
00:16:57,277 --> 00:17:03,239
then build and really do the testing, and evaluate the results to see if this was something that we wanted to put into the game itself.

265
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,980
And I think we ended up doing something like dozens and dozens of iterations ultimately on different features.

266
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:13,993
I started basically just using paper. Paper is really fast.

267
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:21,240
I recommend actually using like wooden tokens, whatever it takes, to figure out the initial ideas, because this is really cheap.

268
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:24,722
But we pretty quickly got into the actual questions.

269
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:31,908
First being with the core loop, is there something like constraints that the on-location gameplay puts into how you do gameplay in the game?

270
00:17:33,077 --> 00:17:35,098
So the first prototype basically looks really simple.

271
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:38,139
We took assets from the previous Walking Dead game that we had done.

272
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:41,200
So the workers actually looked really weird because the perspective was different.

273
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,082
You could just tap on them to kill them, like mega simple first-person mechanics.

274
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,083
We figured that this might be a good fit.

275
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:53,085
Put some missions on the map where you just could collect more weapons and get some bullets.

276
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,817
And we already got like from this really simple set of super interesting findings.

277
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:03,298
Where firstly the first person shooter looked promising so we decided okay let's keep on iterating on this.

278
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,720
But what really fascinated me was that there we again proved that there's no magic circle the location-based game.

279
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:13,747
So when I was playing the missions and like while I was brewing coffee for myself,

280
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:17,309
waiting for the kids to break off from bed for me to take them to school,

281
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:21,591
the gameplay experience was fundamentally different from when I was playing the same missions,

282
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:27,194
walking toward lunch with my friends, where if anything like on the road took longer than

283
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:31,356
something like 10 to 15 seconds, everybody else needed to actually stop and wait for me.

284
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:32,777
And that was socially really awkward.

285
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,529
So we kind of figured that like anything that we put onto the map itself,

286
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:39,051
the interaction speed needs to be really, really fast.

287
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:42,654
You need to be able to complete those missions and interactions like in seconds.

288
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:47,237
So the very good kind of like, OK, like this looks promising,

289
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:48,798
but we can continue on this.

290
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:51,119
But let's aim to keep things simple.

291
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,082
With the missions, we did actually a couple of different iterations.

292
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:58,484
Again, we thought that maybe we can add depth to the individual missions

293
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:00,466
if the gameplay here is really...

294
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:06,501
It's simple by like allowing people to see perfect information about what's inside the

295
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:10,606
mission versus imperfect information and make different type of decisions over like what's

296
00:19:10,646 --> 00:19:13,750
the gear that you're going to be taking into the mission like do you need to come up with

297
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,091
a plan.

298
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:29,266
And turns out actually the mission version where you got the perfect information made people optimize their gear so much to the point where they actually kind of like this analysis paralysis of like overthinking what they need to do, which turned out to be a really bad idea.

299
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:32,987
So we kind of figured that like, okay, less thinking is actually better.

300
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:38,469
Like, let's make sure that the interaction again is really fast and people don't need to think about things when they go into the missions.

301
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:45,988
The other, like one of the actually really big ones is the players immediately started asking for a shared reality.

302
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:52,393
So the first prototypes just randomly put stuff onto the map and you couldn't actually play with your friends

303
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:58,857
because when you went walking with your buddies onto the world, both of you saw random points on the map.

304
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:05,702
So I saw something really desirable and like told, okay, let's go to that direction to pick up that mission because I really want to play it.

305
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:12,151
My friend would say, actually, that, like, no, like, I'm seeing the same, like, whole mission the other direction, and that was really awkward.

306
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:20,363
So we need to realize that we actually have to create the system to make sure that all the players share the same content, shared reality on the map itself.

307
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:26,655
And which brought us to starting to iterate on a deterministic procedural content generator

308
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:29,976
that produces the same results across the board for each one of the players.

309
00:20:30,836 --> 00:20:36,698
And we're taking the Google POI data with prominence information that's really important

310
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:42,299
that we're using to spawn the map to the players in a way that actually where the players see the

311
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,560
exact same things. It took many, many iterations to actually get this right and produce the

312
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,900
desired gameplay patterns.

313
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:54,969
The way we're using the prominence is Google actually tells us what are the most important points in the world

314
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:59,172
and we can place some of the more important content that players are most likely to want to play

315
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:02,795
in points that they're the most likely to visit during their commute during the day.

316
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:09,699
Continuing on to the next question, so with the core loop we wanted to know about the area-placed gameplay mechanics.

317
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,543
So I figured that Travelling Salesman is a really nice NP-hard problem that you can probably gamify in this context.

318
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:22,631
And so we added this, like, with the missions, we figured out, okay, like, the heroes, you can take them, they have movement points,

319
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:27,432
so you go through multiple missions to come up with these chains that became progressively harder,

320
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:32,374
but you got better loot, and, like, this was a disaster.

321
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:38,676
So players immediately lost immersion when they saw the 2D map versus actually the, like, the map they projected you.

322
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:44,900
And mixing on location play and the 2D map turned out to be incredibly confusing.

323
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,602
So vast majority of people kind of like not only lost immersion,

324
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:50,705
they couldn't quite figure out where they were, where the heroes were,

325
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:53,908
and like they just like lost, like they just couldn't cope with them

326
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:55,069
with the information they were seeing.

327
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,932
So we figured, okay, like this is going to be way too complicated for a loop

328
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:00,593
and we just decided to kill this.

329
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:12,238
The other prototype we did with this is we split the world into a Voronoi graph, a very fancy way of actually taking any area and splitting it into places or smaller areas.

330
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:19,384
You could capture the areas by playing a couple of missions and you got better loot if you progressively played more in the same areas.

331
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:24,939
And again, like completely disastrous results were way too complicated to be the core loop activity.

332
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,064
And also secondly, like this felt psychologically wrong where we have this mental model of the

333
00:22:30,104 --> 00:22:35,588
world where we kind of think where the natural boundaries of areas lie. And the people are like

334
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:41,874
really objected to us splitting the world into areas that didn't really correlate with anything

335
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,615
that they had used to actually see in the world.

336
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:48,821
Or we chose to kill this partially because this was kind of an unsolvable problem.

337
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:53,525
Or if your players have a certain way of thinking about the world,

338
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:59,810
it's very unlikely that you can actually solve something like that in a games project.

339
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,494
So I'm sure a mapping company might be able to do something with areas and natural boundaries

340
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:06,636
that conflicts with how people see the world.

341
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:11,580
But in the scope of the project, we just could not have been able to solve this.

342
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:26,098
With the player-generated content of the map, the first prototype we did here is a lot just very simply put treasure generators on the map, get resources, do appointments, super super simple.

343
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:41,665
And building stuff on the map felt really good. Being able to see stuff like next to my home was very powerful, but not being able to access the buildings where I weren't there felt really really bad, like super bad.

344
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:49,210
So the overall player sentiment was that needing to figure out where to place stuff in the world,

345
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,833
especially when you were potentially like, should it be next to your home or next to your office?

346
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:59,475
And maybe you were commuting through a daycare to drop off your kid,

347
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:03,257
and figuring out what the optimal pattern for place in the buildings would be,

348
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:09,381
took some of the bad aspects of people needing to think about their daily routines in the context of the game

349
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:11,922
in a way that made the decision process way too complicated.

350
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,272
The verdict was that we wanted to retry the building,

351
00:24:15,532 --> 00:24:18,874
but in some completely different form that didn't have the boundary,

352
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:21,015
like the limitations of how you access this.

353
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:27,879
So for the social gameplay, we actually decided to take the idea of the buildings

354
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,342
and build a collaborative gameplay on location mechanic out of it.

355
00:24:32,382 --> 00:24:37,304
The concept was safe havens, so I did mission types for like admissions

356
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:39,606
where you can rescue survivors from the walkers.

357
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:45,462
And build buildings like safe havens for these people to take into to get loot.

358
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:50,646
And they actually like this, firstly the rescuing felt really good,

359
00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:55,350
very much aligning with the brand. So you can be the hero of rescue people from the walkers.

360
00:24:56,291 --> 00:25:00,494
But also the fact that you can now get the sea buildings from other players

361
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:02,236
really like made the world feel alive.

362
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:06,593
And the fact that we turned it into a collaborative play

363
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,415
where you were leveling buildings together

364
00:25:08,435 --> 00:25:11,460
and it didn't really matter where you dropped the survivors

365
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,524
into suddenly turned the entire feature around

366
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:15,725
and made it feel really good.

367
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:18,830
So we actually figured that we need to turn this into,

368
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,213
it continued to writing and turn it into a real feature.

369
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:25,754
We also thought that we would do cooperative missions on the map,

370
00:25:25,794 --> 00:25:30,157
where players would be able to drop stuff on the map and play things together.

371
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:33,799
So we made a simple prototype on this lure thing,

372
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:36,321
where you could jump in and play missions.

373
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:40,204
And this turned out to be pretty disastrous as well,

374
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:45,607
where the density of players at any given point in the world

375
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:48,590
is actually something that's incredibly difficult to predict.

376
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:55,603
And these missions that we built were fantastically fun when you had five of your friends participating in when you play in them.

377
00:25:55,823 --> 00:26:06,510
But immediately when you got more, we actually turned this into accidental arrival good where players started to feel that the other people, like too many people playing the missions, took the nice easy missions away from them.

378
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,912
And it became a race on who gets to complete the missions first so that you could play.

379
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:20,634
And we kind of understood that if we want to do anything that you do cooperatively with the other players,

380
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:27,016
we would have needed to go to the drawing table and figure out a completely new way of approaching this problem.

381
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:28,677
So we decided to kill this for now.

382
00:26:29,277 --> 00:26:31,498
We might do something with this later, but not now.

383
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:38,761
So social. So lastly, the collaborative metagame gameplay with the location-based.

384
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:45,387
So we got this idea that let's add show locations from the show into the game,

385
00:26:45,427 --> 00:26:53,995
where like say Terminus and so you'd get some couch play missions if you unlock these by completing missions on the map.

386
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:58,139
Say kill 100 walkers in one of the missions and the place opens,

387
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,241
so you can play some missions like no matter where you are.

388
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,288
And do this collaboratively with your guild.

389
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:06,028
And the result here was actually like we...

390
00:27:06,148 --> 00:27:08,269
This was unexpectedly fun.

391
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:12,090
So suddenly the progress bars that you got at the end of each one of the missions

392
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,150
turned to be the most fun thing in the entire game.

393
00:27:15,411 --> 00:27:17,971
Much more fun than like any of the collecting mechanics,

394
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,252
like any of the other like finding new things.

395
00:27:20,892 --> 00:27:25,213
So we kind of felt that like this has to be something that we expand very significantly

396
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:27,693
in the like and make something much much better out of it.

397
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:32,183
And at this point we kind of felt that we had our five answers.

398
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,946
For the on-location gameplay we were happy with the first person shooter and figured that we need

399
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:41,209
to keep this incredibly simple for the core loop on the map to actually be something that people

400
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:45,992
want to engage with. The area-based gameplay was deemed to be not the fit for the product

401
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:52,177
and the player generated content was turned into a social feature rather than something that

402
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,498
people would be doing as part of the core loop by themselves.

403
00:27:55,692 --> 00:28:01,436
The on-location social gameplay was deemed to be something that we should work on eventually,

404
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:05,800
but it was too complicated for us to figure given the scheduled project.

405
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:13,145
And the social metagame driven by location was deemed to be so beautifully nice,

406
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:19,530
and people loved it, that we decided that this has to become a really good, large feature in the game.

407
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:24,394
And Markus is going to now talk about a bit more of what we actually did.

408
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:30,509
So as Sulke described, we figured all these things that

409
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:31,129
don't work.

410
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:34,053
And that's when our pre-production ended and we

411
00:28:34,193 --> 00:28:36,456
shifted into the production, trying to figure out like,

412
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:38,799
OK, we're going to do a game now.

413
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:41,983
And the game has to stay together and be engaging and

414
00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:43,765
nice and fun and fulfill all the goals.

415
00:28:43,985 --> 00:28:45,647
So let's see what we did.

416
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,848
We did what we like to call a bite-sized FPS.

417
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:55,172
So every session is pretty simple.

418
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,634
First, you log in and you have a look around.

419
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,337
You maybe collect some stuff around you.

420
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:04,262
You look around at the fights around you, and you pick a

421
00:29:04,302 --> 00:29:04,542
fight.

422
00:29:05,835 --> 00:29:07,596
You shoot walkers for 15 seconds.

423
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:10,818
In this video, the player is rescuing a

424
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:12,239
survivor from walkers.

425
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,302
And when I say you shoot zombies for 15 seconds, I

426
00:29:15,322 --> 00:29:16,643
really mean like 15 seconds.

427
00:29:16,983 --> 00:29:18,704
And that often includes the loading times.

428
00:29:19,044 --> 00:29:21,386
We really wanted this to be short and

429
00:29:21,466 --> 00:29:22,647
snappy and bite-sized.

430
00:29:23,948 --> 00:29:26,410
You get some stuff, and then you use that stuff to upgrade.

431
00:29:28,464 --> 00:29:32,347
You log in, you have a look around, you collect stuff, you

432
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:35,550
pick a fight, you shoot for 15 seconds, you upgrade.

433
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,031
That's really simple.

434
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:40,273
We wanted to make sure that you could do this everywhere.

435
00:29:41,374 --> 00:29:43,936
We wanted to make sure that you would see nice things

436
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:45,077
around you while you do this.

437
00:29:46,238 --> 00:29:48,480
We wanted to make sure that every time you did this, there

438
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,321
would be stuff to play, stuff to collect.

439
00:29:50,742 --> 00:29:54,264
We didn't want to ever have any failure sessions when there

440
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,405
would be nothing to collect.

441
00:29:56,391 --> 00:30:00,173
And our collaboration with the Google Maps has guaranteed

442
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:01,294
that we can actually do this.

443
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:04,235
They give us really nice points of interest everywhere,

444
00:30:04,856 --> 00:30:08,277
except for some designated no-play areas, like air

445
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:10,238
strips, where we don't want players running around.

446
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:13,846
Upgrading is quite simple.

447
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,307
We were doing so many novel things in this process

448
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:19,148
that we wanted to make sure that at least something

449
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:20,668
would be tried and true,

450
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:22,408
and we wouldn't need to figure it all out.

451
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:25,609
So basically, you collect weapons, you collect heroes,

452
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:28,030
and you collect some other items from the series,

453
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,350
and then you level them up,

454
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:32,611
just as if you were playing Clash Royale.

455
00:30:35,092 --> 00:30:37,232
We want the players to unite with other players.

456
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:39,073
So in the end of the tutorial,

457
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,093
you will be offered one guild to join.

458
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:46,600
And the choice is basically, join this guild or search more.

459
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,202
In The Walking Dead No Man's Land, we have learned already at Next Games

460
00:30:51,622 --> 00:30:55,103
that this is the best way we can sort of encourage you to join a guild.

461
00:30:55,363 --> 00:31:00,245
Give you one recommendation, zero decision making anxiety, and join or don't.

462
00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:03,626
We actually intend to be even more aggressive about it in future.

463
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:06,187
We're actually thinking about forcing players into guild.

464
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:07,547
Consequently...

465
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,188
90% of our daily active users are in guilds.

466
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:14,769
And we've learned that the business value in retention

467
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:18,650
monetization in all respects, that the guilded players are so

468
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,551
much more valuable for us than the other players, that we

469
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:25,772
don't really lose anything if players who don't want to join

470
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,273
a guild leave our game.

471
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:33,635
Scavenging is also a big part of The Walking Dead.

472
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:36,336
And we wanted it to be a big part of our core loop as well.

473
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:37,336
So.

474
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:43,450
Every time you log in, you can see some resource crates around you where you can collect things

475
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,597
like energy, you can collect grenades, and first aid kits.

476
00:31:47,817 --> 00:31:52,581
Some free-to-play games decided to make these kind of resources extremely scarce.

477
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:57,445
They want you to have that one, I don't know, lollipop hammer that you will treasure looking

478
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:58,566
for the impossible mission.

479
00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:01,869
We wanted to do this in a completely opposite fashion.

480
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:05,772
In our game, you get consumables all the time.

481
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:10,997
However, the caps are very low, so you need to also spend them or you end up wasting them.

482
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:18,039
This creates a loop where you're actually constantly spending consumables, constantly getting consumables,

483
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,360
and sometimes you actually do run out, and that's the monetization point.

484
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,881
But if you want to just, like, if you just walk 100 meters, you will get some more.

485
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:32,042
So even though it's a pinch, it's not that kind of pinch as we usually think of it in free-to-play games.

486
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,263
So let's look at our core loop.

487
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:40,765
You log in somewhere. You look around. You will scavenge.

488
00:32:42,314 --> 00:32:42,994
The consumables.

489
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,816
You will take the consumables and spend them

490
00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:46,877
in different kinds of fights.

491
00:32:47,538 --> 00:32:50,280
You will gain cards and coins and survivors.

492
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:54,163
You take the survivors into safe houses

493
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:55,725
to get even more cards.

494
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,508
And then you use the cards and coins to upgrade your things.

495
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:03,011
Rinse and repeat as many times as you like.

496
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:10,574
So we were not entirely satisfied with this core loop at this point.

497
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:11,934
It felt a little bit dull.

498
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:16,076
The players kept requesting all kinds of discovery.

499
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:18,756
They wanted to really go to that gas station and get some gas.

500
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,258
And we were like, we're a little bit short of resources

501
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:26,299
and we don't want to do that big an investment in that kind of gameplay.

502
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:29,060
So we introduced rare and epic missions,

503
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,620
where you would get guaranteed rare and epic cards.

504
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,321
And suddenly players were seeing

505
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:37,868
a purple glow in the horizon and they would be walking there to see what's in there.

506
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:40,453
They would be talking in the guild channels like

507
00:33:40,874 --> 00:33:44,440
there's a thing in the market street, if you're near market street you should go there and get it.

508
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:50,411
We were also introducing both dynamic and static difficulty missions.

509
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:54,975
We wanted to make sure that there would be always nice content for you to play,

510
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:58,477
so we had to resort to dynamic difficulty most of the time.

511
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:02,500
However, if you design a game that only has dynamic difficulty,

512
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,782
you end up in a situation where progress doesn't feel like progress

513
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:07,623
because the difficulty always increases.

514
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:14,189
So many of the rare and epic missions we spawn are on the static difficulty, so they communicate to the player like,

515
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,453
if you were a tougher guy, you could also be playing this mission.

516
00:34:19,534 --> 00:34:24,960
So, the core loop is now a little bit more complicated.

517
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,244
There's different rarities of missions, there are different rarities of raids,

518
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:32,347
and there are a lot more options what you can do while you...

519
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:38,163
move around. Of course, these are very contextual opportunities, so if you happen to be in a nice location,

520
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:42,385
then you will have nice opportunities, and if you're not in a nice location, then you have to figure out

521
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:47,248
whether you conserve your energy and your grenades, or whether you will use them on the bad opportunities

522
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:48,068
right here, right now.

523
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,171
Sulca mentioned the safe havens. Nowadays, they're called safe houses.

524
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,273
Players can build buildings in our world.

525
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,221
After you've built a building, you can leave survivors there.

526
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:07,184
You get rewards, and you also improve your rating

527
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:08,645
in the safe house leaderboard.

528
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:11,847
If you leave enough rescuees there,

529
00:35:12,187 --> 00:35:14,068
then the safe house will be upgraded.

530
00:35:14,508 --> 00:35:16,790
If you don't upgrade your safe house in a while,

531
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,272
then it will be destroyed by raiders.

532
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:23,674
We also have different kinds of safe houses

533
00:35:23,714 --> 00:35:25,836
that give you different kinds of cards as rewards.

534
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:30,387
So suddenly we are facing a surprisingly complex decision space.

535
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:35,090
You have to figure out whether I want guns or heroes this time, whether it's important

536
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,994
for me to upgrade this safe house, whether it's important for me to beat the other guys

537
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:44,378
on the leaderboard to become the leader of the safe house and get improved rewards, or

538
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:48,221
whether it's important for me to save a safe house from destruction.

539
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:52,374
The leaderboards also have a really nice quality of showing

540
00:35:52,414 --> 00:35:54,596
that other people are also playing around you.

541
00:35:54,957 --> 00:35:58,060
And they create this kind of neighborhood-friendly co-op

542
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,343
competitions where someone is a leader in this house and

543
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:03,185
someone else is a leader in that house.

544
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,547
And if you try to be too greedy about too many safe

545
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:08,190
houses, then you actually can't be a leader in any of them.

546
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:11,493
This is kind of like.

547
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:15,885
We wanted to make the location a social opportunity for you.

548
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:19,167
And this kind of simple, kind of complex game

549
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:21,129
allows for that.

550
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:27,332
Sulka mentioned that we are a single shard game.

551
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:28,553
So we are.

552
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:33,889
Everything in the world is mostly similar to all the players.

553
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:38,393
So when I can see something cool, I will tell you that it's on the market street and go there.

554
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:45,439
However, we wanted to also introduce a feature to facilitate that, and that's why we created a feature called Flare.

555
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:53,126
Flare is a consumable that I can deploy here, and if I deploy a Flare here, all my friends in my guild can teleport here for free.

556
00:36:55,265 --> 00:37:02,071
This helps us a lot in creating kind of a social dynamic where it's somewhat patronage.

557
00:37:02,771 --> 00:37:07,816
It is couch play because I can invite you here while you're, I don't know, ill at home or whatever.

558
00:37:08,557 --> 00:37:14,842
It allows virtual tourism. I have been sharing Moscone Center several times this week because I want to tell everyone that I'm here.

559
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:21,168
And when we get to the deeper social tasks, the flair allows for added coordination.

560
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:28,767
So the core loop, let's add some exploration.

561
00:37:30,268 --> 00:37:31,949
So you have different kinds of safe houses.

562
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,352
Now it's starting to become a little bit of a resource

563
00:37:34,392 --> 00:37:35,132
management game.

564
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,195
You have this one survivor, and you have five safe houses

565
00:37:38,295 --> 00:37:40,677
around you, and then you're trying to figure what to do

566
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,178
with this guy.

567
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:45,593
And the way we built this thing is that it's mostly

568
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:49,078
cooperative, so everyone is benefiting from this friendly

569
00:37:49,118 --> 00:37:49,639
competition.

570
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,524
But the guys who are playing most actively and making

571
00:37:53,585 --> 00:37:55,628
smartest choices are benefiting even more.

572
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,746
It's also not a very serious game.

573
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:02,289
The benefits that you get from leaving your survivors

574
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,511
into better safe houses are actually quite small,

575
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:05,692
but they are nice.

576
00:38:06,313 --> 00:38:08,975
So we wanted to make sure that you can't make mistakes,

577
00:38:09,636 --> 00:38:12,118
but if you're smart, you can be a little bit better

578
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:12,498
in the game.

579
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:18,260
Also, we wanted to give an alternative to the walking and

580
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,821
discovering, which is the teleportation.

581
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:24,063
So now you can ask your guildmates to flare you

582
00:38:24,103 --> 00:38:26,804
somewhere, or you can share something that you find and

583
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:27,725
flare others to there.

584
00:38:28,185 --> 00:38:31,187
You can share the location opportunities to other players.

585
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:35,789
It looks nicer now, the core loop, but not nice

586
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:36,610
enough just yet.

587
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:42,042
Remember this, Sulke showed this and said that nothing felt

588
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:44,844
as good as seeing the bars progress after a battle, and

589
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,105
this is very much true.

590
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:52,251
This was a very good prototype for us, and based on this

591
00:38:52,671 --> 00:38:55,954
simple progress bar system, we wanted to develop something a

592
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:59,197
little bit more sophisticated and, let's be honest, a little

593
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:00,058
bit more complicated.

594
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:02,595
So this is a guild board.

595
00:39:03,356 --> 00:39:07,000
It consists of about 25 missions that you complete.

596
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:09,763
There are also three chests on the board.

597
00:39:10,023 --> 00:39:13,868
And if you complete a row and a column, then you can collect

598
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:16,771
the chest in the intersection of that row and column.

599
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,415
But the thing is this.

600
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:25,291
Everyone in your guild is collaboratively completing these quests, and all the rewards are social.

601
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:32,158
There is no way for you as an individual to benefit any more than everyone in your guild benefits.

602
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:34,821
When you unlock the chest, everyone unlocks the chest.

603
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:46,137
The only thing that you can gain in the guild board for yourself is that if you're a top contributor to a task, you get your face on the wall, like the four yellow portraits in the top row.

604
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:50,479
This has turned out to be a surprisingly strong motivator for players.

605
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:55,501
Some people want to, I want my face on the wall so that I can prove that I play a lot.

606
00:39:55,782 --> 00:39:59,143
I want my face on the wall so that I won't be kicked away from the guild.

607
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:03,746
I want my face on the wall because I already have seven and I want more faces on the wall than Sulko has.

608
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:08,282
This is how the tasks look like.

609
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:09,723
Win 40 battles.

610
00:40:10,203 --> 00:40:11,384
This is an easy task.

611
00:40:14,006 --> 00:40:16,527
This is actually so easy task that when you start playing

612
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,629
the game and you're in the guild, you start kind of

613
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,270
accidentally completing the quests.

614
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,412
And this is what hooks you into this somewhat complicated

615
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:24,232
guild board system.

616
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:29,483
Actually there's a funny story about this screen on the right hand side.

617
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:33,349
A programmer was implementing this feature and they came to me and they complained like

618
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,416
I just played this mission and I completed seven tasks or incremented seven tasks.

619
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:44,520
So isn't it a little bit weird to complete seven tasks at one

620
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:44,741
go?

621
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:47,662
And I was like, if you choose the optimal hero

622
00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:49,683
and the optimal gun and the optimal mission,

623
00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:51,543
and then you go there with optimal, I don't know,

624
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,344
grenades or something, and you manage

625
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,145
to progress seven missions at the same time,

626
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,045
isn't that cool?

627
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:59,227
So actually, we ended up designing the easier guild

628
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:02,428
boards in a way where this is very likely and constantly

629
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:02,728
happens.

630
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,707
On the later guild boards, on the harder tasks,

631
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:08,668
you will get these kind of missions.

632
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:13,251
Lone Wolf, one group member must win 80 level 20 battles

633
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:14,812
with a reclaimer shotgun.

634
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:18,034
So suddenly you need to parse together

635
00:41:18,134 --> 00:41:19,355
quite a bit of information

636
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:21,016
and you need to start sharing tasks.

637
00:41:21,096 --> 00:41:22,517
Who's gonna do the reclaimer task

638
00:41:22,557 --> 00:41:24,118
because someone else is doing something else?

639
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:30,192
This 25 square board is, in a sense,

640
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:31,553
it's a simple representation.

641
00:41:31,693 --> 00:41:32,994
In a sense, it's complicated.

642
00:41:33,454 --> 00:41:36,196
But the interesting thing is that it has surprising depth

643
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:38,377
when you're trying to track the progress of everyone

644
00:41:38,717 --> 00:41:40,658
in your guild and trying to figure out what they are

645
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,580
actually doing and what is your best way of contributing

646
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,861
to the common task.

647
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:50,005
It's also a great collectible motivator, because if no one

648
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:52,526
has the reclaimer shotgun, no one's able to

649
00:41:52,586 --> 00:41:53,367
complete that quest.

650
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:57,369
So this is a way we can shuffle players' collections

651
00:41:57,469 --> 00:41:58,930
around and make sure that even the

652
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,150
weakest weapons are used.

653
00:42:03,452 --> 00:42:06,673
We organized these guild boards into 20 different tiers.

654
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:11,456
On every tier you have three identical boards.

655
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:16,659
So the boards are identical except for the target counts of the missions.

656
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:22,663
So on the first board of the first tier you might need to complete 10 battles, then 20

657
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:22,943
and then 40.

658
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:27,807
And we designed this in this way in part because we want the

659
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:29,468
first board to be a practice board.

660
00:42:29,788 --> 00:42:32,510
Usually the first board takes a good guild about one day.

661
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,693
And that is the one day during which you learn to allocate

662
00:42:36,713 --> 00:42:39,115
your resources and coordinate your efforts so that when you

663
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:41,456
are tackling the real challenge of the third board,

664
00:42:41,736 --> 00:42:44,438
you will be educated and understanding the

665
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:45,419
task you have to do.

666
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,381
You have one week to complete every tier.

667
00:42:50,022 --> 00:42:51,964
So this is a time pressured challenge.

668
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:54,748
And this works really nicely for us in a weekly cycle.

669
00:42:55,228 --> 00:42:57,892
Every Thursday when the boards open,

670
00:42:58,212 --> 00:42:59,974
we can see a peak in the player activity

671
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,576
when everyone is enjoying the fact

672
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:03,559
that they can progress seven missions at one time

673
00:43:03,899 --> 00:43:05,922
and when they are charging through the easy board.

674
00:43:07,144 --> 00:43:10,906
However, if you don't complete the tier in the week,

675
00:43:11,146 --> 00:43:13,667
then you will be starting that tier over the next week.

676
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:18,088
So it's also a challenge that becomes harder and harder

677
00:43:18,168 --> 00:43:18,549
every week.

678
00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:22,110
And finally, we have eight weeks in every season.

679
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,091
And we have a leaderboard where we track

680
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:25,131
the best guilds in the world.

681
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:27,532
And after the eight-week season, you

682
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:29,293
will get a massive reward and start over.

683
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:37,364
We spent a lot of time iterating these guild boards, trying to figure out how we can make

684
00:43:37,424 --> 00:43:37,924
them work.

685
00:43:38,905 --> 00:43:44,666
One important thing we did was that we specifically decided that none of the tasks require you

686
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:45,806
to be co-located.

687
00:43:46,186 --> 00:43:51,807
So basically, you can play with friends from anywhere in the world and succeed in the guild

688
00:43:51,867 --> 00:43:52,107
boards.

689
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:57,108
It was far too complicated for us to even plan about the missions that would require

690
00:43:57,188 --> 00:44:00,769
everyone to go to, I don't know, Moscone West to do something.

691
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:01,329
That would have been...

692
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:02,990
Super complicated.

693
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,953
One of the important features in the boards is that it's 25

694
00:44:09,554 --> 00:44:13,056
squares, so the learning, it is super hard.

695
00:44:13,376 --> 00:44:16,518
So one thing we did was that we decided that one of the

696
00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:19,920
chests is easy chest, another chest is a medium chest, and

697
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,341
the third one is the hard chest.

698
00:44:22,342 --> 00:44:25,483
And every mission that leads to the easy chest is actually

699
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:26,144
super easy.

700
00:44:27,138 --> 00:44:29,259
So that when you're semi-randomly doing

701
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,540
things on the map, you actually see that these quests are

702
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,460
starting to complete.

703
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,322
And then you're actually figuring out that there's an

704
00:44:36,402 --> 00:44:38,923
opportunity of grabbing the easy chest if you just

705
00:44:38,983 --> 00:44:40,203
coordinate the efforts a little bit.

706
00:44:40,663 --> 00:44:43,044
And then, of course, when you have done that, you've done

707
00:44:43,164 --> 00:44:45,245
quite a bit of work towards the medium chest as well.

708
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,226
So that will be half complete when you're

709
00:44:48,246 --> 00:44:49,147
done with the easy chest.

710
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:51,388
And the same goes on with the hard chest.

711
00:44:53,348 --> 00:44:57,571
One thing we also did here is that some of the missions are, as the previous example,

712
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:02,334
they are lone wolf quests so that one player needs to focus their efforts on one task.

713
00:45:02,895 --> 00:45:05,376
This has been a really interesting, dramatic tool for us.

714
00:45:06,357 --> 00:45:11,080
One thing we can do, for instance, is that we take the best player away from some difficult

715
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,103
mission so that the others need to shine because the best player is focusing on the lone wolf

716
00:45:15,143 --> 00:45:15,343
mission.

717
00:45:16,024 --> 00:45:20,432
The lone wolf missions also become competitions between players when both want their face on the

718
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:25,842
wall and then they are effectively wasting their efforts in this glory hunt, which is really nice.

719
00:45:28,655 --> 00:45:33,377
We worked even further with trying to make sure that these guild wars would always be...

720
00:45:35,118 --> 00:45:38,539
So that the players would also have hope in completing the guild wars.

721
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:41,700
So here you can see the difficulty curve of the guild wars.

722
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:46,663
Basically on the left side you can see the tier 1 and on the right hand side you can see tier 20.

723
00:45:47,563 --> 00:45:50,484
And you can see the small numbers, but I can tell you

724
00:45:50,524 --> 00:45:54,727
that the highest, most difficult guild board has

725
00:45:55,147 --> 00:45:58,529
difficulty multiplier of about 300, compared to the

726
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:01,630
difficulty multiplier of about one of the easiest board.

727
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,132
So on the first board, you have to win 10 battles.

728
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:09,194
On the last board, you will have to win 3,000 battles.

729
00:46:10,195 --> 00:46:12,035
So they get extremely difficult towards

730
00:46:12,075 --> 00:46:12,856
the end of the stack.

731
00:46:15,087 --> 00:46:17,569
It was hard for us because players were getting stuck on

732
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:21,411
the boards, and then your social dynamics start to go

733
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:24,193
awry, because when you lose hope, then there's nothing fun

734
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:24,934
in the game anymore.

735
00:46:25,194 --> 00:46:27,536
And then some people stop playing, and then it gets even

736
00:46:27,596 --> 00:46:28,436
harder to progress.

737
00:46:28,937 --> 00:46:31,778
So one of the important things we did was that, as you can

738
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:35,501
see here, the difficulty curve of the first board of every

739
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:37,762
tier is actually quite lenient.

740
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:40,885
So no matter where you are, you can always complete the

741
00:46:40,925 --> 00:46:41,425
first board.

742
00:46:42,185 --> 00:46:45,866
The second board, which is the medium board, is a little bit of a challenging,

743
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:48,067
and then the real push is the third one.

744
00:46:48,987 --> 00:46:53,188
But then there's another aesthetic that is really nice here, besides the aesthetic of hope,

745
00:46:53,568 --> 00:46:57,109
which is that the first board is always a really nice reward for you.

746
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:02,951
Like in Clash of Clans, the reward for upgrading your Town Hall level is not really the better Town Hall,

747
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:06,992
the reward in Clash of Clans is that you get to upgrade all your stuff really fast,

748
00:47:07,072 --> 00:47:09,253
and so the game becomes very fun to play.

749
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:11,896
And here the same thing happens with the first board

750
00:47:11,936 --> 00:47:14,100
being fun to play and super quick and super fast.

751
00:47:16,363 --> 00:47:19,408
We found this math of hope really important part of the

752
00:47:19,448 --> 00:47:20,770
dramatics of the Guild Board system.

753
00:47:22,993 --> 00:47:24,936
So let's look at the core loop.

754
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,083
It was a little bit complicated already, but then there are different kinds of missions

755
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:30,824
that you have to do.

756
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:35,727
And you have to start optimizing not only between the rare missions and the safe house

757
00:47:35,747 --> 00:47:40,351
that you want to save, you have to also start to coordinate with your friends and you have

758
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:44,734
to start to figure out which are the best ways for me to contribute in these guild

759
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:45,035
quests.

760
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:52,359
And it gets pretty complicated because there are now multiple social systems that are interacting in unpredictable ways.

761
00:47:52,740 --> 00:48:00,043
You have both the local social system of safe houses, and then you have the guild-based social system of the guild boards.

762
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:08,548
And both of them are dynamic, both of them are unpredictable, both of them are gamed by not only you but also your guild.

763
00:48:08,868 --> 00:48:10,829
And that makes the game quite deep, actually.

764
00:48:12,163 --> 00:48:15,265
Of course, every game gets stale over time, so we also

765
00:48:15,345 --> 00:48:16,406
added some token events.

766
00:48:16,446 --> 00:48:19,108
So sometimes you want to go somewhere even to get this

767
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:20,549
week's special mission tokens.

768
00:48:22,891 --> 00:48:27,574
I think I heard of the term smart depth first time about

769
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:29,356
10 years ago in a WUGA presentation.

770
00:48:29,816 --> 00:48:33,459
And their point was that you want to enrich your core loop

771
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:36,101
while you want to keep your core loop just as it is.

772
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:38,482
So you want to add smart depth.

773
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:40,244
while keeping it simple.

774
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:44,087
And I think we succeed in our world in this task, because

775
00:48:44,107 --> 00:48:46,129
this is still a really simple decision space.

776
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:47,830
You can't do anything wrong.

777
00:48:48,411 --> 00:48:49,472
You can just fail.

778
00:48:50,232 --> 00:48:52,914
You can just introduce waste in your process.

779
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,736
There is no failure.

780
00:48:55,396 --> 00:48:56,257
Every time you log in.

781
00:48:57,198 --> 00:49:01,359
You pick a fight, you shoot something for 15 seconds, you progress in the game.

782
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:04,740
But if you're really smart, you can progress a little bit more.

783
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,941
And even for advanced players such as myself, sometimes I'm, I don't know,

784
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:13,143
walking on the street and I don't want to think that much, while at other times I want to be

785
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:17,464
super careful of my resource management. Like I have one energy, what is the best

786
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:19,905
way for me to use this one energy here right now?

787
00:49:22,737 --> 00:49:26,462
Of course, from design perspective, this is kind of difficult to handle because there

788
00:49:26,482 --> 00:49:27,283
are so many options.

789
00:49:28,004 --> 00:49:30,687
So we were thinking, like, how can we simplify this?

790
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:35,714
And then we figured out, like, let's just assume that players are scavenging quite optimally

791
00:49:35,774 --> 00:49:36,454
at all times.

792
00:49:36,895 --> 00:49:41,561
Let's just do all our Excel math, assuming that they get really good grades at all times.

793
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:43,503
And that helped us a lot.

794
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:46,565
And then we figured out, let's just assume that they put

795
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:49,287
their stuff in really good safe houses at all times.

796
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:51,949
And if they don't put their stuff in the really good safe

797
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,051
houses at all times, then they're introducing waste, and

798
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:54,911
that is their problem.

799
00:49:55,772 --> 00:49:58,114
And then we figured, let's assume they win all the

800
00:49:58,194 --> 00:49:59,394
battles, so we don't need to.

801
00:50:00,494 --> 00:50:02,696
Think about the difficulty in terms of economy design.

802
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:04,178
Of course, we think about difficulty a lot.

803
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:06,841
But in terms of economy design, you always win.

804
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:09,524
And since location is just an opportunity,

805
00:50:09,904 --> 00:50:12,066
even the teleport flare feature is just like,

806
00:50:12,366 --> 00:50:14,349
we just assume that you have really good opportunities

807
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:14,869
at all times.

808
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,870
So from economy design perspective,

809
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,291
this is how our game looks like.

810
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,392
Time equals progress.

811
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:24,573
And it's modulated by skill and effort

812
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:27,614
so the player can introduce some waste if they are not ideal.

813
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:28,894
And of course, no one is ideal.

814
00:50:29,534 --> 00:50:32,535
But at the same time, it's still the social fantasy

815
00:50:32,915 --> 00:50:36,817
of the walking dead surviving by pulling together and not apart.

816
00:50:41,398 --> 00:50:44,459
So time to start getting into actual takeaways.

817
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:48,511
So looking at the core pillars that we set early on in the project,

818
00:50:48,551 --> 00:50:51,712
we wanted to achieve, we feel that we pretty much nailed all of these.

819
00:50:51,732 --> 00:50:53,893
You can play the game pretty much everywhere.

820
00:50:53,913 --> 00:50:56,494
It's always worth opening the game when you've moved.

821
00:50:57,614 --> 00:51:00,095
The game is quite couch play friendly,

822
00:51:00,915 --> 00:51:02,995
given the location-based aspect of it.

823
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:07,397
Social mechanics, we wanted to make something that was really strong.

824
00:51:07,437 --> 00:51:08,197
We actually did it.

825
00:51:09,137 --> 00:51:11,138
And the game really does feel like The Walking Dead,

826
00:51:11,198 --> 00:51:13,298
where you absolutely have to coordinate your efforts

827
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:15,219
with the other players in order to actually succeed.

828
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:19,415
So even though the shape of the game that we ended up making was quite different

829
00:51:19,435 --> 00:51:22,100
from what we imagined at first, we're very happy with.

830
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:28,400
A key takeaway is that when you do novel design,

831
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,602
you have to do a lot of prototyping and validation.

832
00:51:31,982 --> 00:51:34,664
And the important thing in the prototyping and validation

833
00:51:34,764 --> 00:51:37,186
is that you have to accept that it takes time

834
00:51:37,606 --> 00:51:39,187
and it requires many failures.

835
00:51:39,607 --> 00:51:41,709
And of course, paper prototypes are the cheapest

836
00:51:41,789 --> 00:51:44,471
and quickest way to fail, which is very good.

837
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:46,212
But ultimately, you will have to,

838
00:51:46,252 --> 00:51:47,573
especially with the social systems,

839
00:51:47,613 --> 00:51:50,094
you have to actually build good, proper prototypes.

840
00:51:50,314 --> 00:51:51,735
And we spent a lot of time doing that.

841
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:59,009
So having said that, yes, you need to be able to and prepared to kill all the darlings, even if they're really cool.

842
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:07,474
I personally like the, we as humans, very easily fall with the sunk cost fallacy,

843
00:52:07,574 --> 00:52:11,336
where we think that we put so much time and effort and love into a prototype,

844
00:52:11,456 --> 00:52:17,059
and it must succeed simply because we like it so much, or we invested so much energy into it.

845
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:20,560
But let's all, as game designers and game developers,

846
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,440
try to fight that and make sure that if something doesn't

847
00:52:23,521 --> 00:52:25,801
actually fit your game, just kill the feature away

848
00:52:25,961 --> 00:52:27,481
and your game's going to be so much better for it.

849
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:32,623
Even though there are no references for novel design,

850
00:52:33,103 --> 00:52:34,503
you can always have references.

851
00:52:34,563 --> 00:52:36,804
And you should look outside the box for references

852
00:52:36,924 --> 00:52:37,624
if you don't have them.

853
00:52:38,824 --> 00:52:45,168
Our guild board system is basically a marriage of Disney Tsum Tsum's bingo boards combined

854
00:52:45,188 --> 00:52:51,231
with Everwing's guild quests and our shooting mechanics combine Operation Wolf with Whack-A-Mole.

855
00:52:51,852 --> 00:52:57,555
So the language of games is still very important when you don't have anything direct to look

856
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:57,615
at.

857
00:53:00,707 --> 00:53:05,211
With the core loop, once you actually figure out something that really works,

858
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:11,656
continue iterating and adding more features, but really do try to keep it simple and have the same

859
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:17,681
way of people approaching how they play the game throughout the process. So you'll end up with a

860
00:53:17,701 --> 00:53:22,806
loop that is still easy to play, but has so much depth if the players actually really want to look

861
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:23,046
for it.

862
00:53:25,123 --> 00:53:29,506
And finally, you need to iterate your own game until you're hooked to it.

863
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:39,432
On the right hand side you can see a guild board on tier 3, which I completed alone because all my guildmates were slacking that week because I wanted to progress and they didn't.

864
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:52,460
So, thank you, hope you enjoyed and really good to see so many people here despite the, I assume the party starting at 6 o'clock. So, I'm Sulka.

865
00:53:53,381 --> 00:53:54,061
My name is Markus.

866
00:53:55,059 --> 00:53:58,721
And please remember to fill up the feedback forms if you like the presentation.

867
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:12,011
I assume we might have time for like maybe one question.

868
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:24,340
I'm just curious about how long did you guys spend just in pre-production?

869
00:54:26,071 --> 00:54:32,519
So the core prototyping, I think we spent maybe 10 months on it.

870
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:36,523
Actually doing things that ultimately mostly got chucked away.

871
00:54:37,605 --> 00:54:39,567
And the team was at some point...

872
00:54:40,658 --> 00:54:43,539
I remember the programmers asking,

873
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,681
do we really want to spend all this time

874
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:47,261
doing things that we're going to throw away?

875
00:54:47,341 --> 00:54:48,382
So we did, but we did.

876
00:54:48,402 --> 00:54:52,864
We did a huge refactoring pass of actually rewriting a lot of

877
00:54:52,884 --> 00:54:54,405
the code from the prototypes to be

878
00:54:54,445 --> 00:54:55,566
something that we could actually put

879
00:54:55,606 --> 00:54:56,666
into the final shipping product.

880
00:54:56,686 --> 00:54:58,667
Cool. Thank you.

881
00:55:04,971 --> 00:55:06,512
Cool. I guess that's it. Thank you.

882
00:55:10,706 --> 00:55:15,047
Thanks again. I never work on a location-based game, so maybe my question will be dumb, but

883
00:55:15,528 --> 00:55:22,771
did you see some changes in players' behavior based on climate, or like warm countries,

884
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:27,133
or during the season? And did you make some adjustments with events or stuff like that,

885
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:29,614
or rules based on level design to accommodate that?

886
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:38,239
We are internally debating on how much those effects influence our game.

887
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:41,100
Personally, I know that when my hands freeze, I stop playing.

888
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,981
So in order to accommodate players like me, we have done some increase in the couch play

889
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:53,143
lately to accommodate for the winter, but we don't really know conclusively.

890
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:00,343
The other thing to keep in mind is the geography of the world is fundamentally different depending where you go.

891
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:05,126
So one of the features of Helsinki is that the city blocks are huge.

892
00:56:06,086 --> 00:56:11,129
So the number of buildings that you actually see at any given point is actually not that big, because the buildings aren't so big.

893
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:18,934
But if you open the game in India, like in typical Indian cities, the game has to load about 5,000 buildings, because they're all very small.

894
00:56:20,014 --> 00:56:22,615
So the way we've built, as humans have built,

895
00:56:23,575 --> 00:56:26,916
the systems in which we're living

896
00:56:26,936 --> 00:56:29,797
is so fundamentally different that if you

897
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:33,398
want to design a game that actually works across the globe,

898
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,779
it's not only how warm it is somewhere,

899
00:56:36,819 --> 00:56:39,320
but there's so many aspects that you actually need to look into

900
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,701
and you need to play and teleport around the world,

901
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:44,541
look at how the game works across the globe.

902
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:48,242
So it's very complicated to actually isolate any one thing

903
00:56:48,262 --> 00:56:48,863
that would, um...

904
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:52,733
make a difference to the players depending on where they are.

905
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,401
Thank you.
