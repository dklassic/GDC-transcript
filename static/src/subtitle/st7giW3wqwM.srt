1
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:13,100
Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to this session about the art of Child of Light.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,928
So, to make sure that everybody knows what the game looks like,

3
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:23,053
let me take two minutes to play to you our reveal trailer.

4
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:40,134
Child, tuck yourself in bed.

5
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:52,797
Let me tell a story of Lemuria, a kingdom past, and a girl born for glory.

6
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:55,537
Lost from our world came she.

7
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:58,358
Treachery gave close chase.

8
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:03,899
She raised her sword and flew, for she feared not the race.

9
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,644
Three long lost lights to save.

10
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:17,805
A mad queen to defeat.

11
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:21,729
The journey we transform her.

12
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:32,959
Her destiny to meet.

13
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:39,304
The path home tragic and faint.

14
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,869
Beware the night, child of light.

15
00:01:47,869 --> 00:02:00,055
So in this talk, I'm going to talk about first what inspired

16
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:02,237
me at the start of the project.

17
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:05,618
So I spent a couple of months just looking at pretty pictures

18
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:06,299
to get inspired.

19
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,300
So we're going to talk about what were those

20
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,942
and why did they inspire me.

21
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:17,187
Then after that, the various iteration that we add

22
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:20,888
on the R direction to reach the final product.

23
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:24,550
So it's been a bumpy road a little bit

24
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,371
to be able to find the R identity.

25
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:34,254
And finally, we'll talk about how we did the tribulation

26
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,655
or the trial and tribulation to create a main character that

27
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:40,657
is not a badass space marine.

28
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:44,515
So yeah.

29
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:49,997
OK, so in terms of inspiration, in 2007,

30
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:54,198
personally, I like to visit museums when I'm on vacation.

31
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:55,579
That's what I like to do.

32
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:59,200
And especially every time I could

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,561
travel on different cities for maybe press stores or stuff

34
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:08,683
like that, I love to drop by some museum and watch some art.

35
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:20,193
And in 2007, in Montreal, there was a show, an exposition on Walt Disney as the source of his inspiration.

36
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:27,700
And that's where I, you know, because Disney in the 1920s went across Europe,

37
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,945
and he collected art and books to build the Disney library.

38
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:42,296
And in those art pieces, there's a lot of illustration from the period called the Golden Age of Illustration.

39
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:47,477
So that's like a 40-year period at the end of the 19th century, beginning of the 20th,

40
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:56,880
where books were really popular, and the quality of books, of printing, really increased.

41
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,722
And for children's books especially, there was a need to do a lot of drawings,

42
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:03,583
because it's a little bit like books today.

43
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:09,269
for children, there's like an image per two pages or an image per page.

44
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:11,832
So the quality bar really raised and some

45
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:15,897
of those artists really brought the art of

46
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:19,641
illustration and watercolour to really high level.

47
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,741
You know, we can think about Arthur Rackham, for example.

48
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:30,123
He did illustration for Alice in Wonderland,

49
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:33,105
or he illustrated the Wagner Opera

50
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:36,126
on the cycle of the ring.

51
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:41,029
Edmond Dulac, he really had that sense of romantism

52
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:41,329
in his art.

53
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:45,711
The one with the cape, for me, there's a sense of,

54
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:47,572
there's a promise of adventure.

55
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:50,033
I was really allured to...

56
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:51,553
on that style.

57
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:55,695
Kane Nielsen, interesting fact on him,

58
00:04:55,695 --> 00:05:00,696
he actually worked at Disney on the concept

59
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:03,257
for the backgrounds on the movie Sleeping Beauty.

60
00:05:03,257 --> 00:05:04,838
So if you look at Sleeping Beauty,

61
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,859
you're going to see that art being on display.

62
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:15,482
And of course, Disney, what he did is he collected those pieces and he created its own, like, Disney genre with it.

63
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,243
And for me, that was, you know, really something inspiring.

64
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:24,986
John Bauer, an artist from Sweden, and for me, that was my, you know, the one that I liked the most.

65
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:27,227
I really liked this little creature.

66
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,969
Here you see, you know, dwarves and trolls.

67
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:37,431
It's really different than what you see from the traditional Tolkien-esque dwarves and trolls.

68
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:46,162
So for me that was kind of like a reinvention, well it's returning to an older era to rediscover

69
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:51,789
those, that type of fantasy. Especially if you look at the main character, we're going to talk

70
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:57,015
about it a little bit later, but you can already see some of the things I'm going to talk later.

71
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:06,108
And finally, it's a more contemporary artist, but Yoshitaka Zamano, especially his fairy book.

72
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:12,915
So he made a book where he illustrated fairy tales, one painting per fairy tale.

73
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:20,522
And for me, I really loved being able to be drawn to those universes.

74
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:23,044
In one image, and reading the text, the poems.

75
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:28,768
you would be completely enveloped by that universe.

76
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:31,589
And that's basically what we're making when we're making games.

77
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:36,492
We're creating a universe and we're inviting players in.

78
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:39,594
And for me, that's exactly the vibe I wanted to touch.

79
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:54,898
And at the back of the fairies book, there's a quote that for me was like it really crystallized my decision to make this game, which is, you cannot paint fairies without entering their world and believing in them.

80
00:06:54,898 --> 00:07:06,682
And that's really what I wanted to do. I wanted to create something that would be a little bit like a flower, precious, delicate. And to do that, I wanted to do that without any irony.

81
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:13,050
because you know at the end of the day you can be the little fairy game and

82
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,451
people you know everywhere can dismiss as the fairy game

83
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:22,756
and if it's not done with like uh... something where it's really sincere

84
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,617
yes I think it's open for criticism

85
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:27,559
but I think you can feel it when

86
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:28,560
you're

87
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,242
at least for me I really wanted to believe in it, believe in magic

88
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:37,315
believe that this world is real so that it creates something of value.

89
00:07:37,315 --> 00:07:40,423
So this quote really for me was something where it's like, yes...

90
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:50,162
I believe in fairies, and let's make it happen on screen and let people see that world that exists.

91
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:58,186
And the thing is, for fairy tales, what I like about them is the use of symbols.

92
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:03,750
There's a lot of symbols in fairy tales, and that's why those stories really...

93
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,223
capture the emanation, well, went through the age. Nobody knows who, you know, who came

94
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:19,127
up with Cinderella, for example. It's a hundreds-year-old tale that has been told from generation to

95
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:24,870
generation. And most of them are symbols about the passage from being a child to an adult.

96
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,594
I'm telling you how it is going to be a little bit later.

97
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:32,275
You're going to go through a dark forest.

98
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:33,815
And at the end, it's going to be OK or not.

99
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:37,936
Because sometimes the world is really cruel.

100
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:42,557
And you can be eaten by that big, bad wolf.

101
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:46,378
So be careful of those big, bagged wolf.

102
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:48,258
And at the same time, RPGs.

103
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:53,943
And I'm a huge, huge, huge fan of the console type or Japanese type RPG.

104
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,303
And they're about growing stats.

105
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:59,664
So you're small, and you're weak, and you become strong.

106
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,985
And in a fairy tale, you would start as a child and finish as an adult.

107
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:08,386
So for me, I was really interested into the parallel between both.

108
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:11,887
So I knew I could make a game that would make sense narratively

109
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:14,327
and with gameplay.

110
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:15,828
So for me, it made a lot of sense.

111
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:22,753
And in a vibe where, for me, the importance was to create a playable poem.

112
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:27,420
So maybe, you know, it sounds ambitious or...

113
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,426
But the idea is to make something that would be delicate.

114
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:33,948
That's the goal.

115
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,068
So, you know, let's go there.

116
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:37,869
I want to make...

117
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,609
And that angle really forged everything

118
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:43,990
about the choice of music, the art style,

119
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,851
and even the story, which in the end,

120
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:50,312
we had the whole game written in verse, even.

121
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:53,193
And I knew I would be able to use the UB art framework.

122
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,573
So I had some friends in Montpellier,

123
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:57,694
like, send them a couple of email, send me the...

124
00:09:58,493 --> 00:10:02,905
the engine and it's like okay this is what I'm going to use

125
00:10:02,905 --> 00:10:05,291
and the thing that's interesting with the engine is that

126
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,995
we could finally...

127
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:12,706
instead of going with a pixelized version of concept art,

128
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:15,947
we could actually display the concept art straight in-game.

129
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:20,168
So, one of the first things that I pitched to people is like,

130
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:24,969
what if we make Final Fantasy VI but with Amano's concept art

131
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:27,050
instead of the pixel version?

132
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:32,491
So then people could really start to create a sense of what that game could be.

133
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:43,676
And I even made a little creative director concept using John Bower's painting.

134
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,977
It's like, okay, you know what? It's going to look like a side scroller.

135
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:49,479
It's going to feel a little bit like this.

136
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:51,000
And that's like the initial...

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,702
At that point, basically, I was alone with my little PowerPoint pitch

138
00:10:54,702 --> 00:10:57,283
and trying to lure people to come join my project.

139
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,344
So then, you know, we went to Conception. That's when we started to have some people joining in,

140
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:12,109
especially one guy that is extremely talented. He's right now in Montreal. We're finishing,

141
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:19,075
we're in the final days of the production. Thomas Relous, our art director. Just to tell you

142
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:24,959
like the skill level before that, he's the guy that created the art style for Just Dance.

143
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,061
We went from Just Dance to Child of Light, so his palette is really wide.

144
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:32,742
He's a maestro.

145
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:37,664
So he joined the project and he started to build the pillars of the art direction.

146
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:42,226
So the first one, fluidity, a sense of illustration.

147
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:44,887
He wanted to make something that is contemporary

148
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:51,949
and to use the inversion of convention to create the feeling of a magical world.

149
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:57,456
Fluidity is for something really important because,

150
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:00,857
and one of the example here is by using

151
00:12:00,857 --> 00:12:03,338
kind of the logic of your, the sense of caustic

152
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:04,899
that you had underwater,

153
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:07,440
and you recreate that using the trees.

154
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,781
So then you're not underwater,

155
00:12:08,781 --> 00:12:09,941
but you have that sense that,

156
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,682
you know what, this place is ethereal.

157
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,072
Same thing with fluid.

158
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:20,235
So then early on, we really talked

159
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:25,959
about how could we create a sense of fluidity in the game?

160
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,181
Once again, feeling like we're underwater

161
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,303
to create that sense of a magical place.

162
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:34,605
And so we started to do some concept art.

163
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:37,027
And the idea was to use those concept art directly in game.

164
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:40,890
So that's one of the first one, an altar in a forest.

165
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:49,059
Then, you know, giant trees we could go inside.

166
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:49,759
Interior of a cavern.

167
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,022
Another part of the forest.

168
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,724
So, and finally, I wanted to have, like,

169
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:58,606
that thing where it's, like, a giant where,

170
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:02,029
in level design, I'd be able to walk on him.

171
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:04,951
So that idea for me was really interesting.

172
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,814
So we used those to create our target render.

173
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:13,956
So to show to upper management what the game, the final game, would look like really early.

174
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:18,797
So it gives us a good milestone for moving in production and test it.

175
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:23,038
So I'm going to show it to you, what we've shown to...

176
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:27,100
That's in February 2013, so a little bit more than a year ago.

177
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:46,619
Way, way, way back when I was very young, long before you were born, there was a magical

178
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,241
kingdom called Lemuria.

179
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:52,294
Thanks for watching.

180
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:40,615
So, I was really proud of that video.

181
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:43,259
And so we went to Paris to talk about the...

182
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:46,003
We received some feedback.

183
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:48,386
And the feedback we received is,

184
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,990
the game is, you know, it's going to be beautiful.

185
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:55,662
But at this point, it would need a clearer sense

186
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:56,703
of visual identity.

187
00:15:56,703 --> 00:15:59,745
Right now, the feedback was, we can only say,

188
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:01,146
oh, it's beautiful.

189
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:06,190
And the example was, in Limbo, it's clear.

190
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,871
It's black and white.

191
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:08,792
So if you have two people that, you know.

192
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:15,335
talk about, hey, I played a beautiful game yesterday, what is it? Oh, it's the black and white game.

193
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:25,017
And you know, it's Limbo. So they wanted us to continue, push, and to find a style that would be unique

194
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,758
and be able to be told in, like, one word.

195
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:33,759
And I said, Limbo is black and white, it's three words. But anyway.

196
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:40,672
And the second feedback is there's a sense of the need

197
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:44,295
to create a stronger main character.

198
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,717
And I think especially because we're

199
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:50,539
far away from having the badass space marine,

200
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:53,921
then it's like, OK, so yes, it's not

201
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:56,523
going to be a badass space marine, but can you find?

202
00:16:57,381 --> 00:17:00,283
a main character that could be an icon for the game.

203
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:01,124
I think for...

204
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:04,026
So that's the feedback we took.

205
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:10,251
And really, like for me, it's time to return back to research and to just dig,

206
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:13,353
to see where we can go with it.

207
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:15,875
Worst case, we're just going to continue with our art style.

208
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:21,119
But can we push, can we use that as a challenge to push ourselves

209
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,603
to reach a higher quality for the art in the game?

210
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:31,925
So we returned for the art research. That was like a tense period because you don't want to arrive and go like,

211
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,887
okay, we start from the beginning, everybody.

212
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:40,369
Because, you know, everybody would start panicking. It's like, no, let's do some research for a couple of weeks.

213
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:47,992
So we took like, you know, a month, and we just went into any direction possible to make sure we would be able to capture the...

214
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:54,822
the right mood. So that's one of the examples using trees that would look a little bit more like

215
00:17:54,822 --> 00:18:01,648
you know, Chinese ink. Another one, that's one from our director. So his personal style is a

216
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:07,793
little bit more graphic. So he wanted to like, let me try something a little bit more graphic

217
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:13,978
with it. And Ae-Joon Ji, one of our artists, she drew this. And I was like,

218
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:19,450
I liked it, except that I felt like it was, you know, lacking a little bit of drama.

219
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:25,491
So I asked her and Thomas, they sat down and then they iterated on it.

220
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:29,712
And also I wanted to make sure that we had a character in it so that we felt,

221
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:33,613
I could feel that the character would belong in that world.

222
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:40,294
So this is what they come up with, and this is where I, you know, instantly fell in love with the art style.

223
00:18:40,294 --> 00:18:43,855
And we integrated one character from John Bauer illustration in.

224
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:54,120
And that's when I really knew that going with a watercolor art style, you know, would be the style we need to push.

225
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,042
And then the thing was just to make sure

226
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:02,865
that we could reproduce that art style multiple times

227
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:04,767
on multiple environments.

228
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:07,028
So that's what we did the next month.

229
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:09,730
So that's the example for a village

230
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,212
that we'll meet in the game.

231
00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:19,498
After that, a bridge with a strange creature behind.

232
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:21,479
A forest.

233
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,561
Another bridge.

234
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:29,182
And finally, I don't know why, but I love hot air balloons.

235
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:31,103
For me, they're kind of magical.

236
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:35,984
So we had hot air balloons floating over the forest.

237
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:39,225
So with that, I knew we could reproduce that style

238
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:44,927
and use it, use those assets in-game for Child of Light.

239
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:46,747
And that would be our identity.

240
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:48,648
The water will be the watercolor game.

241
00:19:51,234 --> 00:20:03,212
So I'm going to take a couple of minutes to talk about what's the process between when I say we use the concept art directly in game, what's the process in terms of production to achieve that result.

242
00:20:03,212 --> 00:20:04,655
So basically...

243
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,448
Thomas, what he did is he just did mood boards.

244
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:11,010
So basically, at that point, the story was already written.

245
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,611
So we knew everything that we, all the environments

246
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:15,031
we needed to produce.

247
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,773
So for example, that's the forest at the beginning.

248
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:22,075
So he creates those mood boards and a little doodle

249
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:25,396
of what the forest could be, or some assets.

250
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:29,638
And then he let the artist create the concept art.

251
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:33,940
So we would spend some time, make some beautiful paintings.

252
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,422
And that would actually inspire level design in their work.

253
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:44,102
And that's a screenshot from the editor.

254
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:47,743
So the level designers would just basically make their level.

255
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:52,545
And they could use the key art, the concept art behind

256
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:57,426
to help give a sense of where we are, where that place is.

257
00:20:57,836 --> 00:21:01,861
use that to inspire themselves in devil design.

258
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:07,927
So for example, the altar, the bridge, the tree,

259
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:11,591
and where we would pick up the sword inside the magical tree.

260
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:18,945
And after that, what Thomas did is he took that screenshot,

261
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,687
put it in Photoshop, and he directly painted it over

262
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:26,249
to make a quick paint over to give to the artists

263
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:29,591
so that they will be able to fill the whole environment

264
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:30,951
and to get the final result.

265
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:33,733
And he would integrate the concept art

266
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:38,295
so you could see the tree with light, the tree bridge.

267
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:47,316
So you could get a sense that suddenly all those concept art would be well integrated and create a cohesive environment.

268
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:52,042
So once again, I'm going to give you another example from our second region, the plains.

269
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:58,309
So that's the point of reference that we have in terms of visual, that the art is the color palette you want it to have.

270
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:02,578
Then in terms of concept art, we painted some ant ailes,

271
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:07,744
and we could see a giant in the distance, some wind wheels,

272
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,427
that we could do some level design in it.

273
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:15,131
Then level designers would sketch out a rough map and us,

274
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:17,574
and we could get.

275
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,737
That one especially, the first time I saw it in-game, I was like,

276
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:24,178
okay, where is it going? I don't know.

277
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:29,079
You're playing in it and it's really abstract, but then as soon as Toma did this paint-over,

278
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:34,600
it's like, ah, this is going to be a really awesome place to play in.

279
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,722
And finally, that's the look in-game that we achieved for this region.

280
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,244
So that's the process that we went through for production.

281
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:48,351
And basically, we could use the concept art even

282
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:50,935
to inspire level design.

283
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:54,521
But also, you could use those assets directly in game.

284
00:22:57,082 --> 00:23:00,665
So that's for the art style, the watercolor art style.

285
00:23:00,665 --> 00:23:03,767
That one was relatively easy to nail down,

286
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:05,869
especially in terms of it was following

287
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:08,331
the original inspiration.

288
00:23:08,331 --> 00:23:13,275
For the main character, it was way difficult

289
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:16,337
for us, at least for me and Thomas.

290
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:20,220
So in terms of first iteration, you saw her in

291
00:23:21,421 --> 00:23:24,445
the fake footage or the target footage.

292
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:27,710
So at the beginning, you know, we had that name, Aurora,

293
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,833
because, you know, it's the beginning of the day,

294
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,978
the sun comes, and for me, in terms of...

295
00:23:36,494 --> 00:23:38,796
Sorry, I'm not English, it's my first language.

296
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:42,479
But, you know, in terms of meaning, it's, you know,

297
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:45,621
she will bring hope, you know, from the darkest of night,

298
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:50,005
then the little girl would bring hope to a magical world.

299
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:52,406
So that's where the name comes from.

300
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:56,109
And we looked up, and then Aurora is also a butterfly.

301
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,871
It's the beginning of the day.

302
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:03,575
For me, there was a sense of the redhead, red hair girl,

303
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,616
who's soft and delicate.

304
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:07,057
For me, that was somebody that would

305
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:09,078
be appropriate for the game.

306
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:12,281
So we started to sketch out some characters.

307
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:14,562
At the same time, you could see that it's

308
00:24:14,562 --> 00:24:16,343
difficult to create.

309
00:24:18,336 --> 00:24:22,138
kind of like a clear image of who those characters are.

310
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:24,880
But we still managed to make, like, one key art

311
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,042
that would be our main character.

312
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:28,163
I really, I liked her.

313
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:33,567
You know, she was soft, dreamy, hopeful.

314
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:36,649
So, you know, for me, that, you know, she was great.

315
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:41,372
Except for one thing, where we couldn't have long hair.

316
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:43,492
with the 2D character.

317
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:45,013
And we were talking about fluidity

318
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:48,275
and the fact that it would float and be magical.

319
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:52,057
But in 2D, they really look like little cardboard air.

320
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,078
So it didn't work.

321
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:58,161
So we went with, OK, let's make some first sacrifice.

322
00:24:58,161 --> 00:24:59,681
Let's go with a shorter air version.

323
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:09,875
And we really looked at various, how can we bring that character, what's the right type of haircut.

324
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:20,524
And the one at the bottom, my lead programmer is not going to like it because one artist drew her for inspiration, but she looks great.

325
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:26,530
So that's the design we proposed for the target footage.

326
00:25:29,142 --> 00:25:37,384
So I still think it's a great character, but the feedback was to go a bit further, to create

327
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:40,305
something that would be even more iconic.

328
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:45,086
So we went with it and started to look for a second iteration.

329
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:49,107
And that second iteration, it was difficult because one of the feedback is like, ah, she's

330
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:50,348
not badass.

331
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,468
So then suddenly you have that thing in your head.

332
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:54,301
she needs to be badass.

333
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:56,922
And then you have the people that goes like, oh,

334
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,723
but look at all those female characters.

335
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,463
They're all badass.

336
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:00,203
It's all great.

337
00:26:00,203 --> 00:26:01,964
And then you're like, oh, badass, badass.

338
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:02,644
But it's like, no, no, no.

339
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,184
I don't want.

340
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:07,185
So that was that thing where it was difficult to balance

341
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:08,706
between.

342
00:26:08,706 --> 00:26:13,587
So then we looked at something a little bit more

343
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:17,968
with a little bit of attitude and then even with some armor.

344
00:26:17,968 --> 00:26:20,709
But then it was really difficult to balance

345
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,550
between a little doll.

346
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:25,238
and Jeanne d'Arc.

347
00:26:25,238 --> 00:26:30,040
So at least either she was a warrior or she was that princess.

348
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,462
That's one of the latest ones in terms of those faces that I like,

349
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,143
but in game it didn't work.

350
00:26:36,143 --> 00:26:39,204
She was just looking like a little Barbie with a sword,

351
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:41,645
and it wasn't necessarily what I liked.

352
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:44,327
Even though in those pictures I really liked the attitude and...

353
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:51,019
And if you noticed here, Selenish has long hair in those concepts.

354
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:54,901
Because there's a point where it's like, I don't care how we're going to make it.

355
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:56,441
I want long hair.

356
00:26:56,441 --> 00:27:01,163
And especially because we started to look at Disney's Princess, and it's like I had

357
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,123
some Ariel envy.

358
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:10,547
It's like, I want the hair from Little Mermaid, it's so beautiful!

359
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,148
You don't hear that probably when you make Call of Duty.

360
00:27:15,762 --> 00:27:16,883
But so you get the idea.

361
00:27:16,883 --> 00:27:18,545
They're super well animated.

362
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:20,006
And it's like, it's magical.

363
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,587
It's like, can we make this?

364
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:25,230
And it's like, I don't care if we'll find a way.

365
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,054
But first, let's go back with long hair,

366
00:27:29,054 --> 00:27:32,537
aurora, that's the direction I want.

367
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:33,818
And then we'll find a solution.

368
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:41,363
So at the same time, Jeffrey O'Hallem, the writer on the project, he came back from Japan

369
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:46,066
and he brought, I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, so he brought me some little figurines.

370
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:52,229
And I was like, oh man, how come the, you know, Square, they can make like, like tens

371
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:54,870
of iconic characters, I can't make one.

372
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,052
So I start to be very obsessed about those little box.

373
00:27:59,283 --> 00:28:02,445
And there's like one thing that started to pop with me,

374
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:04,906
especially those, because they're not even close to what

375
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:05,527
they look in game.

376
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:07,408
They're really small, like one inch figurine,

377
00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:08,889
and they're really abstract.

378
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:13,952
And I kind of start thinking about, you know what?

379
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,334
What they're doing great is that they can define iconic trait

380
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:21,537
so that whatever how the figurine would look,

381
00:28:21,537 --> 00:28:23,578
it would be the same character.

382
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:25,960
So for example, Zidane from Final Nine.

383
00:28:27,154 --> 00:28:33,636
He has, you know, every character in those little box, they all have a different haircut.

384
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:36,337
Every one of them has a different haircut.

385
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:37,717
And so it's well defined.

386
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:43,119
And he has a puffy shirt, the long tail, and a dual sword.

387
00:28:44,464 --> 00:28:49,830
So even on those two figurines, there are completely two styles, but then you can recognize,

388
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,094
oh, you know what, this is Zidane from Final 9, and in-game it doesn't even look like him.

389
00:28:54,094 --> 00:29:00,922
So it's like, okay, so we need to define what are the iconic things that our character has.

390
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:04,506
And at the same time, I return to John Bauer.

391
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:09,384
Like, it's returning to the roots.

392
00:29:09,384 --> 00:29:12,146
And there was one story where, in that story,

393
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:16,089
the little princess grew from being a child to an adult.

394
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,952
So I just created this collage, in fact, of pictures.

395
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:21,393
And it jumped to me.

396
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,355
I can see that it's the same character, because

397
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:28,177
throughout the adventure, she has the same crown.

398
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:31,460
Well, she has a crown, she has the long, blond hair,

399
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,060
and a white dress.

400
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,160
So.

401
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:40,507
What I did is that I went to Thomas and said,

402
00:29:40,507 --> 00:29:45,370
hey Thomas, check this little character from John Bauer.

403
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,433
Can you just do me a little doodle about somebody

404
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:52,135
that would have a crown, long hair, little dress,

405
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:53,256
and a sword.

406
00:29:53,256 --> 00:29:54,317
Took him like five minutes.

407
00:29:54,317 --> 00:29:55,898
And he drew me this.

408
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:57,719
And I was like, OK, I love this.

409
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:00,082
Boom.

410
00:30:00,082 --> 00:30:02,865
So we did actually like many drawings of different things,

411
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:06,588
and it took five minutes to fall in love with the character.

412
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,930
So the next step would be, how would she

413
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:09,911
look in the environment?

414
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:13,234
So we asked Serge Merino to draw her in color

415
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:14,876
and with the final result.

416
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:24,550
So here you can see she had the crown, the long flowing hair, the dress and the sword and then she had a little spunky attitude.

417
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:30,456
And even though it's not necessarily badass, then already you see this and you love that character.

418
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:36,222
And at that point, nobody asked why I'm not playing a little boy.

419
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:37,984
Once you have a cool character...

420
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:44,530
that people can identify with and love, or it's strong,

421
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:48,471
then the gender or whoever that person is, it's irrelevant.

422
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:54,793
So original image with the second character, Nicholas,

423
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:58,114
in, I mean, it's just perfect.

424
00:30:58,114 --> 00:30:59,314
For me, it was perfect.

425
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:03,215
Same thing here on the bridge.

426
00:31:03,215 --> 00:31:07,816
So and the other thing is.

427
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:14,716
I was like, before we had that version of Aurora that would be already close to be a

428
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:15,357
woman.

429
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:22,220
So what if we just go instead and actually make her grow physically in a game, so the

430
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,241
metaphor is going to be stronger.

431
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:27,643
So that's the design that we have.

432
00:31:27,643 --> 00:31:31,044
And in the game, she is actually going

433
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:32,704
through her various phase.

434
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:36,405
And then at the end, she is the white queen of Lemuria.

435
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:40,186
And you can see also it's reflected in the dialogue.

436
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:43,966
So we drew that and go, this is going to be perfect.

437
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:48,728
And it's, once again, reminiscent of the John Bower

438
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:50,748
illustrated story, the fairy tales.

439
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:54,669
I was really happy with this direction.

440
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:55,009
And.

441
00:31:56,427 --> 00:32:00,151
But so basically, OK, so once again,

442
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:05,657
how are we going to achieve that Ariel feeling in the game?

443
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:12,324
And so we start talking about that with programmers.

444
00:32:12,324 --> 00:32:14,446
We're like, OK, what can we do with the engine

445
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:15,367
or push technology?

446
00:32:16,697 --> 00:32:23,059
And one Monday morning, our architect, 3D architect Jeff

447
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:26,140
Breschin, he said, oh, Pat, I coded a little something

448
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,580
yesterday.

449
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,461
So I'm not encouraging overtime, but he really

450
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:32,181
wanted to work on a Sunday morning to code that.

451
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:37,263
So he said, I have a little something playable to show you.

452
00:32:37,263 --> 00:32:39,223
You want to see it?

453
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,304
And this is the prototype that he showed me

454
00:32:42,304 --> 00:32:43,985
that Monday morning.

455
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,472
I saw this and I said, yes, finally.

456
00:32:56,472 --> 00:33:02,536
You need to make that leap of faith.

457
00:33:02,536 --> 00:33:07,599
But you could see that the fluid interacting with the air.

458
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,820
And you go like, oh, yeah, I can project that eventually they're

459
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,521
not going to look like spaghettis.

460
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,763
Are you sure, Jeff, it's not going to look like spaghettis?

461
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:16,364
Oh, yeah, I think so.

462
00:33:16,364 --> 00:33:16,804
OK, great.

463
00:33:19,322 --> 00:33:24,785
So basically, this is what we're going to do.

464
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:28,286
So instead of going, like, it's impossible,

465
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:32,248
then by letting people come with solution,

466
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:34,008
when we are talking about a vision,

467
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:37,790
then magic happen in this case.

468
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,491
We're really lucky to have an amazing team to work with.

469
00:33:44,014 --> 00:33:48,077
It would require to move the character to be 3D, however.

470
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:49,518
So that was a risk.

471
00:33:49,518 --> 00:33:53,581
And also a risk in terms of production,

472
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:55,962
because it would actually take three months for him

473
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:57,744
to code to work.

474
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,225
It's not three months.

475
00:33:59,225 --> 00:34:01,446
In three months, it's going to be fully polished.

476
00:34:01,446 --> 00:34:04,308
And we were on a year-long production.

477
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,809
So we would take the best programmer

478
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:09,271
that we have for three months to see

479
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:11,253
if it's going to work in-game.

480
00:34:11,253 --> 00:34:11,513
But.

481
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:17,638
It was totally worth the investment so we went with it and yes, Ariel happened.

482
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:22,728
So the final result, so we went from the two characters,

483
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:26,610
the first iteration, still like her,

484
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,272
but I think that the second one is a more iconic character.

485
00:34:31,272 --> 00:34:36,114
I'm really, really happy with that evolution in design.

486
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:39,275
I think that the way we were challenged

487
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,716
was the right challenge to give us.

488
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:47,258
And I was really happy to have decided to answer the call.

489
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:55,608
And one of the things that happened is, so we released the first trailer and since then

490
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:57,490
we got a lot of fan art.

491
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,612
I'm really happy about that.

492
00:34:59,612 --> 00:35:04,877
And you can see it, that whatever the style that the artist decided to depict Aurora,

493
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:08,521
you can see that it's still the same, you know, it's the same character, because people

494
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:09,142
understand.

495
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:14,459
Even the last one, this one is my favorite.

496
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:17,560
It's been the one from the little child.

497
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,021
That's Salome Strapazone, one of our artists, little daughter.

498
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:22,962
She's like a four-year-old.

499
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:27,424
And she decided to make a little drawing of Aura fighting monsters.

500
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,672
And at that point, you're like, yes, that's the character.

501
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:36,596
So on that side, I think, at least for me, it's great.

502
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:41,540
It's just great to be able to see that people want

503
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,164
to participate or push them to paint or draw that character.

504
00:35:46,164 --> 00:35:50,287
So it's really humbling on our side.

505
00:35:50,287 --> 00:35:50,708
So to conclude.

506
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:02,912
The thing is, that talk for me was difficult at first to write because I didn't draw a

507
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:04,732
single art piece in the game.

508
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:07,933
So I'm going to talk about the art.

509
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:15,835
I really want to thank the artists of Child of Light, Thomas Rollus, John B. Garn, Ajunji,

510
00:36:15,835 --> 00:36:23,937
Young Jin Theo, Serge Merino, Nicolas Roque, Elie Recre, Vivant Recre, and Salomé Strapazon.

511
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:30,036
It's their work that is going to make Shadow of Light so unique, so vibrant.

512
00:36:30,036 --> 00:36:37,448
And every time that somebody is telling me how it's going to be, the game is going to be great,

513
00:36:37,448 --> 00:36:39,250
I just hope that the game is going to be.

514
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:49,213
as fun as it is beautiful because they really brought like artistry in this game.

515
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:54,537
I just went with that little vision of like, let's make a game that would be a playable painting

516
00:36:54,537 --> 00:37:03,565
and they just created the art that is, at least for me, it's really touching.

517
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:08,509
I just want to finish with some IRS screenshot that we took straight from the engine last week

518
00:37:08,509 --> 00:37:09,730
sitting with Thomas.

519
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,102
And I really think that that vibe of creating a painting

520
00:37:16,102 --> 00:37:20,084
was really achieved by our artist.

521
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:39,672
So that's it for the Art of Childhood Light.

522
00:37:39,672 --> 00:37:40,453
Thank you very much.

523
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:56,385
So we have time, sir, for some questions.

524
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:58,386
And you can go get the microphone.

525
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:03,128
And please state your name if you want to,

526
00:38:03,128 --> 00:38:06,949
so that it's there for posterity because it's filmed.

527
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:07,109
Yes.

528
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:09,030
Hello.

529
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,850
I'm Sonja van Vuren.

530
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,291
I've got a terrible cold, sorry.

531
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,292
I was wondering if, like, everything

532
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,653
is made with real watercolor.

533
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:20,700
If what?

534
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,081
OK, if it's made with watercolor?

535
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:23,322
Yeah.

536
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,804
No, it's made with Photoshop.

537
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,986
But no, what we actually did is Nicola Roque,

538
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:34,611
one of our artists, he actually did some watercolor spots.

539
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:37,012
So he painted a bunch of spots.

540
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:40,215
We scanned them, and we could use that for our brush.

541
00:38:40,215 --> 00:38:43,277
OK, like texture brushes and stuff.

542
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:44,918
OK, awesome stuff.

543
00:38:44,918 --> 00:38:45,279
Thanks.

544
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:48,778
Yes.

545
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:49,018
Hello.

546
00:38:49,018 --> 00:38:56,366
I just wanted to ask you, since you're probably all fans of Final Fantasy, and like when I

547
00:38:56,366 --> 00:39:01,232
saw the little child with the really big sword, so that was part of the inspiration to see

548
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:03,634
Cloud with a really huge sword.

549
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:03,815
Yes.

550
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:08,743
Well, the inspiration with the big sword, one of it is, yes,

551
00:39:08,743 --> 00:39:10,503
clouds, but then there's also that thing

552
00:39:10,503 --> 00:39:12,824
where, since the character grow, you

553
00:39:12,824 --> 00:39:15,545
have that thing where the sword and the crown

554
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:17,025
would be too big at the beginning,

555
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:19,646
because they kind of like symbolically,

556
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:23,928
but it's too big because she's not ready for that quest.

557
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,508
So the sword would be, she would drop it,

558
00:39:26,508 --> 00:39:28,649
and then the sword would be too big.

559
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:31,210
And then when she would be an adult,

560
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,771
then it would be the right size, and the crown would fit.

561
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:43,455
So, that was one of the main reasons why I love the big sword, especially at the start of the game.

562
00:39:43,455 --> 00:39:55,061
To convey that feeling that she's not yet ready, and she needs to go to that journey to be ready for being the queen of that world.

563
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:58,283
Thank you. Absolutely beautiful game.

564
00:39:58,283 --> 00:39:58,543
Thank you.

565
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:06,217
Hi, could you talk a little bit about the challenges of integrating the 3D character

566
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:09,639
into the 2D world and making it match with all the 2D creatures?

567
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:14,682
Yeah, okay, so to be technical, at first we integrated the characters straight in the

568
00:40:14,682 --> 00:40:16,984
environment, but because the assets were flat...

569
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:19,165
she would clip in it.

570
00:40:19,165 --> 00:40:21,768
So what Jeff did is he,

571
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:24,810
the character is running elsewhere,

572
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:27,752
like far away in the world,

573
00:40:27,752 --> 00:40:30,174
and we're displaying a 2D film

574
00:40:30,174 --> 00:40:31,976
of the character interacting with it.

575
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:33,577
So I don't know how he managed to do it,

576
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:34,838
but that's how he does.

577
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:37,320
So basically the character is flat in the game,

578
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,662
and has some cel shading,

579
00:40:39,662 --> 00:40:43,445
but the 3D character is not in the environment.

580
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:45,847
It's a movie of that picture.

581
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:51,693
that we're seeing. So that way she's fully integrated, she's not clipping with anything.

582
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:54,436
So that's how we managed to have that 3D character in 2D.

583
00:40:54,436 --> 00:40:59,281
Cool, so it's like an orthographic camera that's projecting it?

584
00:40:59,281 --> 00:41:00,462
Yep.

585
00:41:00,462 --> 00:41:01,063
Thank you.

586
00:41:01,063 --> 00:41:01,423
Thanks.

587
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,981
Hi, my name is Jialing.

588
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:08,204
I was interested in, because in recent modern times

589
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:09,625
we were talking about Western gaming,

590
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,466
especially the integration, as you said,

591
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:14,909
the concept of a badass female character.

592
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,670
Like, what actually solidified,

593
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,412
I feel like your character is very

594
00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:26,314
feminine and I really like that because it's not as if we have to push the girl into being like a strong tomboy

595
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:30,696
while being strong and it seems like it from the screenshots that you kept that you keep

596
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:35,097
that sense of femininity all the way up to the points when she grows through

597
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:40,178
Like what was the choice of that to fight convention in some way in comparison to what other games expect?

598
00:41:41,824 --> 00:41:50,610
Well, all the art from like Kay Nilsson and John Bower especially and Yoshitaka Zemano,

599
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:54,512
there's a sense of femininity that I really loved.

600
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,753
It captured what I wanted to do.

601
00:41:55,753 --> 00:41:58,835
So for me, that was important to keep it.

602
00:41:58,835 --> 00:42:02,037
I didn't want to have anything too badass.

603
00:42:02,037 --> 00:42:05,059
That's the initial creative inspiration was that.

604
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:10,162
And then Jeffrey wrote, Jeffrey Reilly, my writer, he started to write the story.

605
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,025
And I loved that character.

606
00:42:13,025 --> 00:42:13,826
I just loved her.

607
00:42:13,826 --> 00:42:16,048
So then at that point,

608
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:19,051
I wanted to have the character that was on paper.

609
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:23,364
represented on screen.

610
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:29,266
So it made no sense to turn her into a badass.

611
00:42:29,266 --> 00:42:35,448
So that's the principal reason why it didn't work for me.

612
00:42:35,448 --> 00:42:38,108
Of course, somebody can make a female badass character.

613
00:42:38,108 --> 00:42:39,269
It's OK.

614
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:41,469
But for this project, where we were,

615
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:45,991
what was interesting for me, it just wasn't connecting.

616
00:42:45,991 --> 00:42:48,732
So we kept going with something more delicate.

617
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:53,748
Out of curiosity, did you receive a lot of contention?

618
00:42:53,748 --> 00:42:56,269
Not contention, maybe I'm not using the right word.

619
00:42:56,269 --> 00:43:00,171
Did you receive a lot of, no, we should go for the badass

620
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:02,732
instead of actually accepting the way you went

621
00:43:02,732 --> 00:43:04,812
with the art direction?

622
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:07,173
From co-workers, not on a project, yes.

623
00:43:07,173 --> 00:43:09,974
I got some guy at a bar that says,

624
00:43:09,974 --> 00:43:13,556
never going to play your game because it's a little girl.

625
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:15,577
I said, I don't care.

626
00:43:17,616 --> 00:43:19,817
So that's the point. It's not important.

627
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:23,258
The important thing is, you know what, this is what I want to create.

628
00:43:23,258 --> 00:43:26,179
I think there's going to be some value there.

629
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:29,140
And not everybody in their room plays Madden,

630
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,342
and they're not going to make the Madden player more feminine to attract another crowd.

631
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:36,843
Every project has its own direction.

632
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:43,966
And for me, I was sure in my heart that that was the game it needed to be.

633
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:44,166
Thank you.

634
00:43:45,987 --> 00:43:53,994
I was wondering if the idea for the game was inspired by the UB art framework or if you

635
00:43:53,994 --> 00:43:58,978
had this idea for a 2D game already?

636
00:43:58,978 --> 00:44:02,421
So the thing is, what I play on is JRPGs.

637
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:05,063
That's what I play.

638
00:44:05,063 --> 00:44:07,605
So I made open world games and shooters.

639
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,814
And there's a point where you may, especially when you start making those open world games,

640
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:15,498
when you make Assassin's Creed, you don't want to start playing Batman, because

641
00:44:15,498 --> 00:44:20,884
you're not enjoying Batman, you're deconstructing how they made stuff.

642
00:44:20,884 --> 00:44:26,029
So to have some pleasure, or to stop working when you go home, then I would

643
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:27,911
return to the Japanese-style game.

644
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:34,677
If there would be one, and personally, I've been in the industry for 10 years,

645
00:44:34,677 --> 00:44:41,702
so 11 years ago, if you would have told me that you had the chance to make a turn-based RPG,

646
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:46,246
I would have believed it. So for me, that's kind of a dream project.

647
00:44:46,246 --> 00:44:52,151
And the fact that the UbiArt engine would be there, then I kind of see it as, you know,

648
00:44:52,151 --> 00:44:57,435
I wanted to go with, try that engine. I could see it as an opportunity to realize

649
00:44:58,255 --> 00:44:59,576
thing in my bucket list.

650
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:02,878
To be able to, you know, what I can make a JRPG,

651
00:45:02,878 --> 00:45:06,679
console type or J type RPG,

652
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:08,340
I can, after that, I can die happy.

653
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,142
I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Yoshitaka Mano

654
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:16,364
and he did one art piece for us

655
00:45:16,364 --> 00:45:19,045
and that's another part of the, you know,

656
00:45:19,045 --> 00:45:20,266
bucket list that's been scratched.

657
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:27,343
And it's like, so yeah, so for me, that's like, it's an amazing project, an amazing year.

658
00:45:27,343 --> 00:45:33,506
So I hope that for everybody that you're going to love playing the game after, but you know,

659
00:45:33,506 --> 00:45:36,747
for at least for me, it's a kind of a dream, a dream project.

660
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:39,088
Thanks, I'm looking forward to it.

661
00:45:39,088 --> 00:45:39,268
Thanks.

662
00:45:39,268 --> 00:45:46,991
So that's it, no more questions.

663
00:45:46,991 --> 00:45:49,632
So thank you very much.
