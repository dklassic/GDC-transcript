1
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:14,061
All right. Cool. People came to my talk.

2
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:14,942
It's cool.

3
00:00:14,942 --> 00:00:22,608
All right. Cool. So hi guys. My name's Andrew

4
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:25,631
Silver. I lead the illustration team over at Riot

5
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:26,171
Games.

6
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:31,356
What's up, dude.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,021
One of the things that we do over at Riot Games

8
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,821
is a thing that we call splash art,

9
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,342
which is, in short, the illustrations of our champions

10
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:41,563
and skins in League of Legends.

11
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:43,723
We spent a lot of years working on developing this team

12
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:45,584
that we feel like offers a lot of benefit

13
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:47,865
to help players deepen their understanding

14
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:50,805
of the League of Legends IP.

15
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:52,786
Over time, we paid particular attention

16
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,786
to leveling up our painting ability,

17
00:00:54,786 --> 00:00:55,887
bringing on new people,

18
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:57,507
training the ones we had,

19
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:59,588
and developing the style we wanted our art to live in.

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,072
But I'd argue that the team's biggest level up

21
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:05,833
throughout the years was actually in something

22
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:06,873
a bit outside the realm of craft.

23
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:12,876
There we go.

24
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:15,618
Just as a heads up before we jump into this,

25
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:18,159
I wanted to point out that the work featured here

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,800
is actually the result of all of these guys.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,421
We have a mentality on the team that every splash

28
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:24,142
comes from every individual on the team.

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,351
So a bit of context around our game real quick.

30
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:32,992
League of Legends is a massive multiplayer online battle

31
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:33,993
arena for hardcore gamers.

32
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,313
So what the hell does that even mean?

33
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:40,536
Two teams of five set out to kill enemy champions and

34
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:43,557
minions, mow down defensive towers, and ultimately destroy

35
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:45,118
the enemy's base.

36
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,399
Now after this, they jump into a new session and try to do

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,800
it all over again.

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,381
It feels like 5v5 chess, where each one of the pieces is a

39
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:54,343
fighting game character that have many of their own unique

40
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:54,783
abilities.

41
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,258
Splash Art is essentially the player's first experience with that champion.

42
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:03,959
Now, taking a look back at how we used to think about splashes,

43
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,560
Splash Art started back in our super freaking humble beginnings

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,961
with this incredibly derpy version of Sion.

45
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:16,183
Now, these were meant to serve the primary purpose

46
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:17,623
of being a character select screen,

47
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:19,604
similar to those of the classic fighting games of the 90s.

48
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:22,765
They're meant to show players exactly what champion or skin

49
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:24,125
they were about to unlock or play.

50
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:29,743
Now very quickly we realized that Splash Art really determined whether a player was going

51
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:31,445
to pick up and play this champion.

52
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:36,311
So because of this, we developed a certain subset of rules in order to maximize Splash's

53
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:40,617
impact on the champion's performance and create a cohesive feel for League of Legends Splash

54
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:40,757
Art.

55
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:44,382
So today I don't want to give you guys a tutorial on how to paint.

56
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,088
What I'd rather do is show how our old way of thinking

57
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:51,630
was extremely limiting to our champion's emotional impact

58
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,032
on players, and the League community recognized it.

59
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:57,614
Check out this evolution.

60
00:02:57,614 --> 00:02:58,195
Hey, not so derpy, Sion.

61
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:03,639
I want to talk about how we evolved our philosophy behind

62
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,441
why we create splash art, and share some of the lessons

63
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,802
that we learned along the way in our pursuit to make art that

64
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:10,083
really resonates with players.

65
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:16,801
As a team, we had to understand exactly how players experience Splash Art.

66
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:18,882
So let's walk through what a player sees when they log into the game.

67
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:24,287
Let's say you're a Jinx player. You start at the login screen, which generally

68
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:29,671
features one of the newest animated splashes. You check out the champion details page where

69
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:33,854
you can see your splash and maybe read up on the champion.

70
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:38,618
When you click play, you'll see the champion select screen where you pick your champion.

71
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,821
And then you load into the game while checking out what the two teams consist of.

72
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:44,768
And finally, your in-game.

73
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,109
Now, for a long time, this is what we used to think of as a champion.

74
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:50,390
The in-game model.

75
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:56,591
And for a lot of our content, including our splash art, we aim to best represent the model

76
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,771
as the identity for the champion.

77
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:03,453
And over time, we started to realize, well, yes, you know, the model is an important part

78
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:06,153
of a player's perception of who this champion is.

79
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:11,595
The real perception of a champion is comprised of an amalgamation of all the content that

80
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:12,115
we create.

81
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:16,656
Things like illustration, 3D model, music, music videos,

82
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,359
promotional teasers, web experiences, toys, and so on.

83
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,943
You know, all of these things give a clear understanding

84
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:25,484
of who a champion is.

85
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:27,746
But over time, our mentality evolved even further.

86
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:31,189
This character doesn't really exist in the real world.

87
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:33,751
Players can't go to a real place and meet Jinx.

88
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:35,693
The way that we're starting to think

89
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,136
is that a true champion ultimately lives in players' minds.

90
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:44,606
Our job as game developers is to do our best to accurately represent the character we want

91
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:49,927
players to see in their imagination. We can only influence our players' perceptions

92
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:53,348
of who a champion is. And we have to do this well with every piece

93
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:58,010
of content that we create for champions. When the illustration team realized this, we

94
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,991
set out a new goal. Use Splash to tell strong, fantasy-driven

95
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:06,032
stories for players and create windows into the League of Legends IP.

96
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:11,396
The team saw Splash not as a way of just showing champions doing cool things,

97
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:14,137
but to show their personalities and give players an identity to relate to.

98
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:18,659
I love this. If you check out the bottom left of the image,

99
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:22,580
you can actually see where Jason used bird shit as like a storytelling element.

100
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:29,282
So let's rewind again and look at some of our older work.

101
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:33,044
You'll notice that these splashes share many similarities.

102
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:36,005
Champions are either in what we would call heroic or action poses.

103
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:40,007
Their source of power is prominently being displayed in the image,

104
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,307
and most often times being used.

105
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:46,088
We always seem to be looking up at the champion,

106
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:49,189
and their face is unobstructed.

107
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:52,410
I mean, why the hell can we see this dude's face if he's wearing a hood?

108
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:59,251
And all of their abilities look more or less exactly like what they do in-game.

109
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:02,152
Now we made these rules because we thought this was what players wanted.

110
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:05,689
We figured players wanted to pick up and play a champion character model

111
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,730
because it was cool and what we would call aspirational.

112
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,831
Which, by the way, was like our biggest freaking buzzword.

113
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:11,831
Nobody knew what it meant.

114
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:15,852
So let's take a look at Fizz here.

115
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:18,613
Seems like a cool enough looking dude.

116
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:21,934
He's this blue fish thing, all around happy guy.

117
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,794
He's gonna poke you with his magic trident.

118
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:24,974
He's got a pet shark. I want a pet shark.

119
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:28,475
He's looking all heroic in the sunlight,

120
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,436
where he's got water splashes everywhere, you know.

121
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,642
Now Fizz is one of my favorite champions in the game.

122
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:38,264
But what this doesn't show you is exactly the thing that I fell in love with.

123
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,906
As a Fizz player, I fell in love with his playful nature.

124
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:45,548
In the hands of a great player, and no, this is not me saying I'm a great player,

125
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:46,849
Fizz is slippery.

126
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,030
He's gonna taunt you while he uses his crazy skills

127
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,112
to dance around all of your abilities and attacks.

128
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:55,854
He's that little tiny underdog that's got the attitude of a whimsical ten-year-old

129
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:57,835
who has fun in everything that he does.

130
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,076
And what he's generally doing is kicking everybody's ass.

131
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,228
Now, before I started at Riot, I really admired this splash,

132
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:07,229
and in many ways I still do.

133
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:10,752
The shapes of the drawing, the control of the warms and cools

134
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:11,973
to direct your eye to the character,

135
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,736
the general rhythm of how the water splash is interacted

136
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,698
with the pose of the character that really create

137
00:07:16,698 --> 00:07:17,919
this sense of great motion.

138
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:22,658
The fact that the artist did all of these things without realizing it, you know, just

139
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:28,323
naturally, you know, still irks me to this day. But my question is, looking back at this,

140
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:33,207
why did I have to play the character in order to understand that magic personality? Couldn't

141
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:39,092
I have gotten that just from looking at an image of him? You see, the rules did a great

142
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:43,535
job of helping us, you know, make the art look consistent. But ultimately, it homogenized

143
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:47,338
it. The rules were too restrictive, and our players recognized it.

144
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,222
Let's compare splashes for a minute.

145
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:53,065
This splash art of Elise's Deathblossom skin

146
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:56,368
and her base champion splash were released on the exact same day.

147
00:07:56,368 --> 00:08:00,452
You know, from all of our metrics on what made good splash art,

148
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:04,416
this skin should have rocked the worlds of every one of our players.

149
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,697
Look at this.

150
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:06,858
Crazy freaking action pose.

151
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:08,460
She's rappelling from the ceiling.

152
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,381
She's got spider webs flying at her faces.

153
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:14,034
Flower petals, which are the theme of this skin, are everywhere.

154
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:16,876
She's hissing at us, and there's magic on pretty much everything,

155
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:20,819
including coming out of the asses of these spiders.

156
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,522
So long story short, when we checked the forums, players didn't love it.

157
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:29,005
Now, the reason they didn't love it wasn't because of the art execution of the piece.

158
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:32,548
It was because players were getting tired of the same thing over and over again.

159
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:34,770
I mean, we did a billion of these things,

160
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,572
and for the small purpose of being a character select screen,

161
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:38,612
they'd serve their purpose.

162
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:43,788
But the funny thing is, is that looking back, players saw a potential in our splashes that

163
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:48,392
we, until that point, just weren't seeing. What players wanted was a fantasy to role

164
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:53,896
play, and what we were giving them were glorified pieces of box art.

165
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:59,001
Now here's Elise's base champion splash. Now, it may feel similar in a lot of ways,

166
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:02,824
but there was one key difference that we really felt was important to get across.

167
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:03,965
You'll notice that she's sitting down.

168
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,426
Now, this may seem really small, but in actuality,

169
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:09,247
it was a fundamental shift in our philosophy.

170
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:12,028
There were actual debates asking questions like,

171
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:15,270
if she's sitting down, can she really be aspirational to players?

172
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,190
There's our favorite word again.

173
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,952
And also, why are we hiding her main gameplay hook,

174
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:21,212
her giant spider behind her?

175
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:24,474
Even into our final days of production,

176
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:26,375
we're getting feedback like this,

177
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,796
but ultimately, we decided to give it a chance and try it.

178
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:31,657
If it didn't work, we could always go back to our old rules.

179
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:33,358
So what did our players think?

180
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:36,729
They actually freaking loved it.

181
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:39,972
Now what this showed us was that what we thought of as a guide to player resonance,

182
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:42,954
these arbitrary rules could be broken and still work.

183
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,515
We realized that we had to dig deeper into what our goals should be.

184
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:48,838
Let's analyze the story here.

185
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,659
Elise is a spider queen.

186
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:54,041
Why the heck does a queen have to get her hands dirty in killing us?

187
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,222
I mean, sure, she attacks in game,

188
00:09:55,222 --> 00:09:57,383
but that's not what's important to her as a character.

189
00:09:57,383 --> 00:10:00,526
As a queen, Elise should just be able to sit and wait.

190
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:03,608
We're already dead, we just don't know it yet.

191
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:06,524
At this point, we're beyond saving. Check it out.

192
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,446
You can see, if you look in the background,

193
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,868
you can see evidence of her victims where the

194
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,470
spiderlings had gotten a hold of them.

195
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,154
The thing that made her a champion that players

196
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:20,697
wanted to roleplay was that regal feeling. That sense

197
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:23,039
of assumed power and ability to command her minions

198
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,401
at will.

199
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:27,522
So fresh off this idea, we figured that we'd

200
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:30,065
crack the code. And to some degree, we were

201
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:31,466
right. We figured the trick was, hey,

202
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,370
Let's show what's cool about a champion's personality.

203
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,731
We can show the things about champions

204
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:37,972
that we couldn't show in-game,

205
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,073
so we were like halfway there.

206
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:42,976
One of our artists, Josh, helped to level this idea up

207
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,597
with this next splash of Kha'Zix,

208
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:46,178
where he focused on the viewer's perspective.

209
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:50,401
What's the scariest thing about being hunted?

210
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,302
How about the moment where you just got paralyzed

211
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:55,204
by flying stingers and have to wait helplessly

212
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:57,105
while he tracks you down and finishes off the job?

213
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:02,397
What a cool way of telling the story about what it's like to play against Kha'Zix, we thought.

214
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:08,101
We didn't get a really clear understanding of what the purpose of Splash Arts should be until this guy.

215
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:12,724
Malphite's a rock golem in our game that, when this was being painted,

216
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,806
sparked many passionate debates in regard to his scale.

217
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:20,269
Now, funny enough, he's one of the smaller models in our game.

218
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,651
So, what the hell are we doing painting him like he's eight stories tall?

219
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:28,939
This debate forced us to reflect on what a champion's fantasy actually is.

220
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,720
We were still focusing on who a player would play as or against,

221
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,981
but does the fantasy go even deeper than the game?

222
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:37,682
This led us to our current idea.

223
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:39,403
Models are not champions.

224
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:40,903
They're abstractions of our champions.

225
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:45,364
Players play League like a competitive sport,

226
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:47,465
and in a competitive sport, clarity matters.

227
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:52,143
So the in-game assets are low-poly models, always seen from above,

228
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:55,485
made to represent the idea of a character in a gameplay setting

229
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:58,627
where they can be modified to fit the medium of competitive 5v5 gameplay.

230
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:00,848
The real fantasy is external.

231
00:12:00,848 --> 00:12:04,990
An implied world of stories and interaction between these characters,

232
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,632
free from the constraints of balanced and readable gameplay.

233
00:12:07,632 --> 00:12:13,675
And while we create Malphite in-game to fit inside that gameplay space,

234
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:16,937
Malphite's core thematic is being an unstoppable force.

235
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:20,905
We need to be able to understand the reason for him being unstoppable.

236
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:23,346
When we see him, we need to immediately understand

237
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:27,628
by looking at those ragdoll helmet bros that are getting dragged along,

238
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:30,349
that any attempt to harness or constrain this force

239
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,610
is an exercise in futility.

240
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,571
That's the true fantasy and the core concept

241
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:35,892
that players will seek to role-play.

242
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:42,524
Now in order to understand the fantasy, the team feels it's incredibly important to know

243
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:46,185
the champions as well as players do. We're constantly playing the game, reading up on

244
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:51,666
the backstory of champions, scouring the internet for guides on what players create. We're up

245
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,947
to date on all the league memes and player-made content, and many of us watch programs on

246
00:12:55,947 --> 00:13:00,268
a regular basis. Some of us have logged literally thousands of hours of the game.

247
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:03,190
And it's not abnormal for us to play multiple games at work.

248
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,231
I don't know if you guys can see clearly, but literally everybody.

249
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:09,233
This is about one o'clock in the office and everybody's playing.

250
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:13,075
This type of passion is what helped the team develop trust,

251
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,337
not only internally but on a company scale as well.

252
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:19,939
We try to assign splashes to the artists that are most passionate about those champions.

253
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:24,762
This gives everybody the confidence that the right decisions are being made for splashes,

254
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,403
and the ideas are coming from the imagination of an authentic player.

255
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:30,623
Now, every week, the team does collaborative reviews

256
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:32,204
where we all jump into a room and feedback

257
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:33,984
the absolute crap out of each other's work.

258
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:38,445
And during these reviews for this champion, Cassiopeia,

259
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:41,005
we had some serious reservations about her story.

260
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:43,746
We used to assume that the champion's face

261
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:45,726
was the most important part of the splash.

262
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:48,607
But what if that inhibits the story?

263
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:51,488
Cassiopeia is a half-snake, half-human champion in League

264
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:54,288
that can manipulate poison and freeze any enemy

265
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:55,868
into stone in her cone of vision.

266
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,582
And we were working to create a new splash to replace the old one

267
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:04,265
that was no longer meeting our style or quality bars.

268
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:07,988
Our first inclination was to show her doing her death stare.

269
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:09,630
That's her biggest gameplay thematic,

270
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,492
and we figured that players that would want to be able to see that

271
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:13,373
to understand her better.

272
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:15,535
We felt like this was a no-brainer,

273
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:18,237
but Evan, the artist on this, wasn't sold on that idea.

274
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:21,300
When we got to review and he showed us this,

275
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,222
we had a few concerns about the lighting

276
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:24,643
basically cutting her face in half.

277
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,722
Now, even as a, Eben is a Cassiopeia main.

278
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:31,363
Which is to say, he's played hundreds of games of Cassiopeia.

279
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:36,786
He talked to us about how the magic moment for Cassiopeia,

280
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:40,128
for a player, actually is in the act of killing herself, itself.

281
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:43,550
It's in the exhilaration that you get that moment right before.

282
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,031
It's the moment when the entire enemy team is walking toward you,

283
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:50,813
completely unaware of the absolute hell that's about to rain down upon them,

284
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:52,955
as you hide in a bush or concealed terrain in our game.

285
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,641
Like a snake, you wait for the perfect moment to strike

286
00:14:56,641 --> 00:14:58,683
and unload every ability you have on them.

287
00:14:58,683 --> 00:15:03,606
The story had to be about that moment right before.

288
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:07,488
Now, having the shadow across her face creates the feeling of a doorway half open

289
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:10,150
just before the moment where Cassiopeia would freeze whoever this is

290
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,052
with her infamous death stare.

291
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:17,054
Here's an instance where player perception actually helped us shape the fantasy.

292
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:21,176
Shaco was originally released about six years ago with this splash.

293
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,842
He's a demon jester in our game that basically fills the fantasy of scary-ass clown dude.

294
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:31,705
Now, originally, we looked at him as this creepy assassin who terrorizes his enemies

295
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:33,806
and drives them insane before he kills them.

296
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:37,849
And while he still does that, over the years, players' understanding of this guy changed.

297
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:43,813
He became known as one of the hardest champions to catch, and his guerrilla-style hit-and-run

298
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:47,955
tactics have basically become a signature by which players both love and or hate him.

299
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:52,506
But how can we create a splash where we show a champion,

300
00:15:52,506 --> 00:15:53,947
this thing that's supposed to be badass,

301
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:56,509
an aspirational entity to players,

302
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:57,689
running away from a fight?

303
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:02,512
We worried players would perceive him as a coward.

304
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:04,373
In reality, though, Shaco's core concept

305
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:06,134
is like that orange smoke that he leaves behind.

306
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:09,917
It's all too apparent and antagonizing as hell,

307
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,718
but ultimately it's still just smoke.

308
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:13,459
The goal here was to target the feeling

309
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:15,020
of being led down the rabbit hole

310
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,161
while being indirectly hunted by the very thing

311
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:18,162
that we're trying to hunt.

312
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,332
So for a while, Splash was thought to be a premier image of a champion.

313
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:27,554
A one-stop shop for one single champion to avoid player confusion

314
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:31,896
and the opportunity to show champions in a moment that makes them more powerful

315
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:33,597
than anything else in the IP.

316
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:36,178
So players could aspire to that power.

317
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:38,819
From a developer standpoint, we assume the player value

318
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:41,901
was derived from the Splash assets themselves, the actual illustrations.

319
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:47,292
We figured players wanted their own singular splash per champion,

320
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:52,416
and the idea of sharing a splash space would lessen their value.

321
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,117
As our mentality around splash shifted,

322
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:56,499
we realized that instead of being a detriment to the splash,

323
00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:00,442
sometimes the whole could be greater than the sum of its parts.

324
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,624
As a cool thematic hook for a skin line,

325
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:05,947
the skins team created a heavy metal rock star line of skins for five champions,

326
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:07,268
and we called them Pentakill.

327
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:11,667
When our music team set out to release a heavy metal album

328
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,287
for players inspired by these skins,

329
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:16,549
the Splash team also set out to create an album cover,

330
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:20,250
as well as update the outdated Splashes for these five skins.

331
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,431
As we looked to tell their stories,

332
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,772
we realized there wasn't any cool enough stories

333
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:25,792
individually that represented the fantasy of these guys.

334
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,634
I mean, these guys are a band.

335
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:30,514
We can't pull them apart and show how they're awesome

336
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:31,195
at the same time.

337
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:36,010
So we showed them taking the stage of this epic demon theater

338
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,491
with particular attention to how players would react to this new combined story.

339
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:43,093
It turns out players didn't mind at all.

340
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,634
In fact, the idea of characters existing with the same space

341
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:47,094
was something that many actually liked.

342
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:51,856
And this was all the more evidence that we were looking at this all wrong.

343
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:54,097
Players didn't care about having a unique art asset.

344
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,338
They wanted a story they could role-play and think about

345
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,359
when they were listening to the music or playing the game.

346
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:04,260
Gameplay restrictions often limit what we're capable of doing with our in-game VFX.

347
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,903
In a game where there's often dozens of spell effects on screen at any given time,

348
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:12,745
it's important for players to understand what those effects are and who they're being cast on.

349
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:16,327
For competitive gameplay, clarity is key.

350
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:19,990
Take a look at this Kayle model here.

351
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,871
In-game, her ultimate ability, Intervention,

352
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:27,854
creates an impenetrable force field around any ally that makes them invulnerable.

353
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:30,216
Now, what are the only abilities in-game that does this?

354
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:34,862
So in-game, we made this ability translucent

355
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:37,505
to show who was being protected.

356
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:39,608
Now in the past, we took care to represent abilities

357
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:40,869
exactly as they were in-game.

358
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,671
because we didn't want to confuse players.

359
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:45,651
And while making the force field translucent

360
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,732
would have been an easy solve to the problem,

361
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:50,454
Suke, the artist on this, felt that we weren't going

362
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:53,555
far enough to convey such a unique ability.

363
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:55,796
Suke's argument was that a translucent force field

364
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:58,277
has been done many times in many forms of media.

365
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:01,118
And while there's many shields in League of Legends

366
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:03,399
that soak up damage, we needed some way

367
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:05,981
to communicate the scope of this particular ability's power.

368
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:09,022
When Suke brought this image to review,

369
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,943
the whole team went freaking nuts.

370
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:15,197
The idea of having a dense liquid gold shroud her in a protective bubble

371
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:19,181
was a great solution that was both unique and also felt impenetrable.

372
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:25,325
So taking a look back at Talon, it's pretty easy to see some of the level ups from old to new.

373
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:30,389
But even now we're doing our best to continue to evolve.

374
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:34,012
When we think about the idea of a vicious but stone-cold killer,

375
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:37,708
an assassin who Talon is supposed to be.

376
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,190
We imagine this would say it.

377
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,090
Look at this guy.

378
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,693
Super mysterious with his hood covering his face.

379
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:44,254
He's leaping off the top of a building

380
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:46,996
in a larger-than-life action pose.

381
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:49,338
His blade's coming out of every part of his costume.

382
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:52,421
This crazy circular rhythm where his cape is flaring out.

383
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:54,463
That's all alluding to the fact that this guy

384
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:55,664
is about to get freaking owned.

385
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:58,286
You know, great assassin story, right?

386
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:00,868
So let me pose a different question.

387
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:05,885
Why are we showing the most feared assassin from the scariest place on earth,

388
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:08,907
right hand to one of the scariest rulers in all of Runeterra,

389
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,568
about to kill helmet bro number 5403?

390
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:18,333
Why are we the viewer, these average dudes, able to even witness this event?

391
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,915
How is this showing us why he's a cooler assassin than any other?

392
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:25,697
It doesn't show us the depth of his tradecraft or the difficulty rating

393
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:29,060
of the types of jobs that he actually takes.

394
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,361
Ultimately, this could be any assassin in any story.

395
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:34,529
We feel like we missed the mark here. We like

396
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:36,450
the image, but it's not the best story that

397
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,632
could have been told. Sure, it's an assassin story,

398
00:20:39,632 --> 00:20:42,793
but it's not one that's unique to Talon.

399
00:20:42,793 --> 00:20:45,074
The new Katarina splash is an example of a

400
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:48,216
better way to tell a unique assassin story. Katarina's

401
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:51,437
thematic hook revolves around repeatedly teleporting to her targets

402
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:53,978
and dispatching them with precision and ease.

403
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:58,036
In her splash, she's featured in a throne room above a red carpet.

404
00:20:58,036 --> 00:21:01,257
Gravity still hasn't even taken effect on these dead guards behind her.

405
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:05,258
And she's already coming out of her next portal at lightning speed,

406
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:07,739
about to deliver the final blow to the viewer.

407
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:08,900
A leader or a king.

408
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,080
Somebody who's worth her time.

409
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,182
As we've evolved, we've realized the idea shouldn't be

410
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:17,023
to regulate the stories that we're trying to tell

411
00:21:17,023 --> 00:21:18,743
in order to create consistency.

412
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:20,664
We should create consistency in other ways,

413
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:23,965
like finding the right aspects of our visual style that to constrain.

414
00:21:25,842 --> 00:21:28,443
Things like color with vibrant but limited palettes.

415
00:21:28,443 --> 00:21:30,543
These call back to the limited palettes in game.

416
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:36,445
Lighting scenes with colorful lights that bounce all over the place

417
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:40,526
with particular attention to color temperature.

418
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:42,286
High polish but handcrafted rendering.

419
00:21:42,286 --> 00:21:46,747
And strong graphic shapes to our VFX

420
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:48,728
similar to the way that we depict them in game,

421
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:50,908
but not constrained by the exact execution.

422
00:21:52,073 --> 00:21:57,037
All of these are fantasy agnostic, but they've done a much better job to allow for the individuality

423
00:21:57,037 --> 00:22:02,261
required to create a breadth of over 120 unique champions in the game.

424
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:06,764
Like our first image of Sion here, who's such a behemoth that his axe, something that we

425
00:22:06,764 --> 00:22:10,907
used to think of as a source of power, has basically become an afterthought.

426
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:14,529
All he needs to do is step on us, as we get to sit and stare through our helmet as we

427
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:14,950
get crushed.

428
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:19,113
While we spent a lot of time working to level up on craft,

429
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:21,234
I'd argue that that was only a small part

430
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:23,135
of what the team attributes its success to today.

431
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:26,197
It was far more important for us to understand

432
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:27,797
why we create splashes for players.

433
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:32,320
If I could give advice to any and all who make art for games,

434
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,881
and especially those who create characters,

435
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:37,903
I'd say really get to know and love the game that you work on,

436
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:39,183
and the audience that you work for.

437
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:42,539
Know and love the characters like your players do

438
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,281
before you start telling their stories,

439
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,623
and understand what purpose those stories will serve.

440
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:49,625
It's impossible to tell their stories effectively

441
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,647
without first understanding the emotional impact

442
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:53,269
they're supposed to have on your players.

443
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:56,992
And lastly, empower any artist to break any rule

444
00:22:56,992 --> 00:23:00,135
in favor of creating unique fantasy for players to role play.

445
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:02,997
More often than not, they're gonna thank you for it.

446
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:03,378
Thanks.

447
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:19,538
Alright, so I think we got, do we have time for questions?

448
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:19,999
Yeah?

449
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:20,199
Cool.

450
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:26,069
I guess we'll jump up to the microphone.

451
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:26,950
Hi.

452
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,613
Where am I looking?

453
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:28,713
Oh, hey.

454
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:31,542
I'm just curious, did you ever, through the process,

455
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,663
consider drastically different art styles,

456
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:36,204
like watercolor or any other,

457
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:38,225
just to mix up the look of the characters,

458
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:39,786
the impression you give the viewer?

459
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:42,267
Yeah, I mean, so back in the day,

460
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:44,649
we kind of did have a whole bunch of art styles.

461
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:45,949
With the resources that we had,

462
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:48,130
we were kind of looking for any way

463
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,771
to depict the champion or skin that we could.

464
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:53,293
Ultimately, we wanted to create a consistency

465
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:55,254
so that when people looked at the art,

466
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:57,155
they knew what game they were gonna be looking at.

467
00:23:57,695 --> 00:24:01,379
Especially when we're going to start trying to tell different stories and create different viewpoints,

468
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:04,483
and we're not constraining them by the stories that we're telling.

469
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:10,690
We need some way of keeping it consistent so that people don't get confused about what they're looking at.

470
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:10,930
Thanks.

471
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,292
Sure.

472
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:16,645
Let me just stand on my tippy toes here.

473
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:20,987
So, one of the things that's very key for a lot of champions is rivals.

474
00:24:20,987 --> 00:24:24,028
Like Vi is a rival of Jinx and Rengar is a rival of Kha'Zix.

475
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:26,689
And there's a lot of interplay between these two champions.

476
00:24:26,689 --> 00:24:30,030
And in a way it makes players quote-unquote hate each other.

477
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,771
Not really hate-hate, but like it gives you a sense of like,

478
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:36,352
okay, I'm playing Vi, they're playing Jinx, I'm gonna beat her head in.

479
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:41,737
So, have you ever thought about doing a splash art where there's a champion that is fighting another champion?

480
00:24:41,737 --> 00:24:47,802
Not so much, you know, I'm beating down the champion, but more so, we're two equals fighting.

481
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:50,284
So, we have considered that, right.

482
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:54,788
With champion splashes, we do want to be super clear about which champion that you're picking.

483
00:24:54,788 --> 00:25:02,175
With skin splashes, we tend to be a little bit more liberal with the stories that we tell and put multiple champions in the splashes.

484
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:05,892
You know, we have splashes where they kind of harken back to each other.

485
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:08,055
If you look at the Jinx versus the Vi, right,

486
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:09,536
they both have the same exact background.

487
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:12,600
The idea is that Jinx kind of busted in later that night

488
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,023
where she, you know, like got into the bank and blew everything up.

489
00:25:15,023 --> 00:25:16,004
But yeah.

490
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:20,288
Anything else?

491
00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:20,369
Hi.

492
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:20,409
Hi.

493
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:20,449
Hi.

494
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:20,489
Hi.

495
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:20,569
Hi.

496
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:20,609
Hi.

497
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:20,969
Hi.

498
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:21,270
Hi.

499
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:21,330
Hi.

500
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,590
Hi.

501
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,630
Hi.

502
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:21,670
Hi.

503
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:21,770
Hi.

504
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:21,810
Hi.

505
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:21,850
Hi.

506
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:21,930
Hi.

507
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:26,423
You were talking about how there was a team of, I think,

508
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:30,187
10 or 12 that you showed, where the splash art is

509
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:33,851
a result of all of you working on it.

510
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:38,195
Within that process, if someone does one thing,

511
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:40,858
and someone works on the face, and it passes off

512
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:42,520
to someone else, or it passes off to someone else,

513
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,402
is that the case, or is it more of a?

514
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:48,266
while it is still a result of the whole team,

515
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:50,809
is it where maybe only three to five people

516
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:53,272
out of that whole team work on certain splashes,

517
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:54,473
or is it a mix of that?

518
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:56,335
Okay, so the question was basically

519
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,338
if we're labeling every splash

520
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:01,021
as part of every person on the team,

521
00:26:01,021 --> 00:26:02,683
how is that actually done, right?

522
00:26:02,683 --> 00:26:04,785
Yeah, how is the work divvied up?

523
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:10,825
So the way that we look at it is that because we're giving feedback so regular to each other,

524
00:26:10,825 --> 00:26:15,447
it really becomes like greater than what that one person can do.

525
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:19,849
You know, we're constantly just like, you know, giving ideas, paint overs, all these things.

526
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:24,331
There was a couple splashes up here that you saw, like the Elise base skin splash.

527
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:26,992
We had five people working on that at the same exact time.

528
00:26:26,992 --> 00:26:29,093
It came together in like four days.

529
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:29,773
But the

530
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:35,174
You know, we've kind of developed a layer style thing where we, you know, we'll send

531
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:38,878
certain layers to one person, certain layers to another person, and then we kind of check

532
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:41,200
back in and merge the files into like a master file.

533
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,943
That's, you know, we work differently generally.

534
00:26:44,943 --> 00:26:48,086
Generally there's one person working on each splash, but they're getting feedback from

535
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:50,468
the whole team on a regular basis, but we do collaborate a lot.

536
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:56,200
Hey, uh, what elements would you change about the fizz splash

537
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,763
to better portray his kind of playful trickster nature?

538
00:26:58,763 --> 00:27:00,525
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

539
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:03,549
So the question is, what would we change about the fizz splash?

540
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:07,814
We're probably gonna do it relatively soon, TM.

541
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:08,254
Um, but...

542
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:14,647
the you know I mean my my fantasy for that that's flash like my my dream is to

543
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:19,189
have him like freaking on a on a beach right this giant tidal wave behind him

544
00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:21,949
like imagine if he was like on his like troll pole where he's kind of doing his

545
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:25,131
like backflip and giving you like the peace sign but like in the background

546
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:29,172
you can see like the the shark underneath the wave like in the

547
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:32,773
subsurface you know it's just massive shark coming at you right and there's

548
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:36,054
like a little tiny fish that he throws at you like to mark where the shark is

549
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,735
gonna go like flapping around in front of you

550
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:41,205
Like, that's, that's my dream, but it might come out completely different.

551
00:27:41,205 --> 00:27:42,346
Thanks.

552
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:43,746
Hi.

553
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:44,126
Hey.

554
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:49,169
Can we expect, like, any splash art regarding the hidden passives of the characters?

555
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,529
Hidden passives of characters.

556
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:53,390
Those, I'm not actually sure.

557
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:58,032
Like, we, those have kind of become, like, little, little tiny inside jokes for players,

558
00:27:58,032 --> 00:28:02,534
you know, like with Leona and the, the, are you talking about Leona and the, the sunglasses

559
00:28:02,534 --> 00:28:03,214
and stuff like that?

560
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,835
Yeah, like Rumble and Tristana, that type of thing.

561
00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:06,176
Gotcha.

562
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,465
So with the Rumble Splash, right,

563
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:13,926
we actually, for a little while,

564
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:15,946
on the inside of the cockpit,

565
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:18,247
we had like Tristan, or Tristy,

566
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:20,888
like scratched into the name, you know.

567
00:28:20,888 --> 00:28:22,028
We ultimately took it out

568
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:23,889
because we didn't want it to be like super distracting,

569
00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:25,249
and it was also really hard to read

570
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:27,330
with the values and stuff.

571
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,170
We wanna do that stuff,

572
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,531
but it can't be in every Splash, you know.

573
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:32,331
A good job, though.

574
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:34,332
Oh, thanks, man.

575
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:45,009
Hi. My question is, when creating a champion, there are many possibilities of the personality

576
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:50,790
and the style of the champion. That champion can be overly cute or can be overly gross.

577
00:28:50,790 --> 00:29:00,032
And I noticed that the splash arts are tending to be somehow a lot more darker or with colors

578
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,132
that are not that strong.

579
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:08,962
How will you foresee challenges of dealing with a character with very strong colors and style

580
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:13,588
when creating these new splash arts for them? I'm sorry, so you're asking about like how we

581
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:18,816
deal with different maybe not so like badass in your face I'm gonna kill you champions?

582
00:29:18,993 --> 00:29:27,001
Yeah, exactly. Especially with the colors and the textures, those characters will prepare to look simple,

583
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:34,368
while the current art styles are very heavy on textures and realism and the lighting and such.

584
00:29:34,368 --> 00:29:35,489
Gotcha.

585
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:40,111
So the way that I would kind of look at that is if you look at it,

586
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,594
do you guys, are you guys familiar with the Gnar splash?

587
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:46,438
We have kind of the little dude, you know, his, his, he's got two forms.

588
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:49,521
His big form where he's, you know, big Gnar and then the little form where he's

589
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,104
like this little like baby yordle thing.

590
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:55,027
And the ways that we're trying to show them are, are kind of in their,

591
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:56,548
their base form and, and.

592
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:01,947
kind of show them as players would see them from the beginning, right?

593
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:05,570
But still kind of allude to a lot of the other things that do make them badass.

594
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,472
So because of him and him not being super cognizant of what he's doing,

595
00:30:09,472 --> 00:30:12,314
he's kind of the more primal version of them.

596
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:15,256
You know, the only way that we can really show that

597
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:19,458
is to show him kind of like just totally distracted by like a little firefly,

598
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,781
but still sitting in like his footprint from when he's like big gnar

599
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,362
and have the scratches everywhere and like...

600
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:27,023
the shadow with the little, like, lightning bug

601
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:28,604
that alludes to, you know, his big form.

602
00:30:28,604 --> 00:30:30,806
So we generally tend to focus on,

603
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:33,087
on kind of the close-ups for those dudes

604
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:36,409
and try to figure out the ways that we can sell

605
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:37,690
both ends of their personality

606
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,011
through, like, abstract methods, you know.

607
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:41,953
Thank you. Cool.

608
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:43,554
Sweet.

609
00:30:43,554 --> 00:30:44,454
All right.

610
00:30:44,454 --> 00:30:45,435
Well, I'll be out and around,

611
00:30:45,435 --> 00:30:46,916
so if anybody has any more questions...
