00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:13,102
Hi everyone. My name is Hank Howey and I'm the Director of Partnerships for Modulate.

2
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:20,327
I've been in the game industry for, well, quite some time now in various companies and roles. I

3
00:00:20,327 --> 00:00:27,792
was one of the co-founders of Blue Fang Games and we made Zoo Tycoon back in the day. But today I'm

4
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:34,256
here to talk to you about the ever-increasing impact of voice chat in games. I don't...

5
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:41,815
We don't think that's a terribly controversial notion, but one of the interesting things is how

6
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:48,397
much research there is around voice chat in games, you know, both the good and the bad,

7
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:56,300
and there's plenty of both, and thought it would be useful to share that data with a lot of you,

8
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:02,903
some of the studies and so forth, and just, you know, again, talk about voice chat in games.

9
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:12,630
So the nature of gaming obviously has been shifting for some time now. Ever since 2008,

10
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:22,476
the largest selling games are invariably the big online multiplayer games. You know,

11
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:29,960
game usage, gameplay has been growing, you know, really since I've been in the industry and it's,

12
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,023
you know, and it's really, it seems like growth has gotten even more precipitous.

13
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,805
in more recent times and let's say in the last decade, you know, even pre-COVID, 63% of game

14
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:50,010
players, adult game players, were playing five hours or more a week. COVID obviously did a lot to

15
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:59,878
increase that, you know, as we shall see. And again, less for I want to play games more than,

16
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:04,841
you know, I want to go hang out online with my friends because, well, that's where they are.

17
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:11,760
it's a pandemic, I can't go see them right now. So again, pretty obvious, but you know, bears

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:20,124
mentioning. And then really it didn't just affect gamers per se, but really, you know, having

19
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:29,929
sort of sharing one's life and social life online has affected everyone from, you know,

20
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:35,232
kids to grandparents and everyone in between. People, you know, I think understand

21
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:43,758
now, you know, post-pandemic, kind of what it is to live and socialize online and how it really is,

22
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:53,863
you know, a thing. You know, and something that I alluded to earlier, which is the games are not

23
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:54,523
just, you know,

24
00:02:56,155 --> 00:03:02,077
people aren't just going online to play the games per se. I mean, sure, a lot of folks do that, but

25
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:12,501
again, during the pandemic in particular, people would go to various online places, online

26
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:20,224
communities, in order to basically interact with anyone socially.

27
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:28,515
You know, again, it's this phenomenon of folks going online to play a game, per se,

28
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:34,462
and the game is really just on in the background. You know, I mean,

29
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:36,865
players aren't communicating about the game.

30
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:43,596
and what's going on in it and you know if there's a threat and you know but he runs or hides or

31
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:50,279
shoots back but but um but really then it's in the sort of the in the down times of the game which is

32
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:55,663
you know when not much is going on people are basically just you know sharing what's going on

33
00:03:55,663 --> 00:04:01,606
in their lives um you know uh sharing with their friends and basically

34
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:07,455
hanging out. I mean, look at the PUBG numbers of, you know, immune players,

35
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:14,339
using it as a social platform. You know, it's kind of the bowling with friends kind of philosophy,

36
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:20,704
or golf with your friends. It's that same notion where, sure, everyone's going online to this

37
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:26,608
destination, which happens to be a game. But really what's going on is not only gameplay, but

38
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:30,631
socialization. You know, talking with your friends.

39
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:43,927
voice chat. And I think somewhat obviously to voice chat clearly it leads to a more

40
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:53,733
stronger bonds in the game, deeper empathy for other players in the game than mere text chat.

41
00:04:54,705 --> 00:05:02,189
And then here is where we kind of get to that two-edged, we first touch on the real two-edged

42
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:08,372
sort of voice chat in gaming, the pros and the cons. And, you know, like for example,

43
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:16,017
you know, in the Women in Gaming study, 80% of women reported being empowered

44
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:22,980
by access to online voice chat to interact with folks, you know, in kind of new and compelling

45
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,521
ways.

46
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:30,436
you know, they really, they really, really, they like that. And then at the same time,

47
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:39,783
you know, just about all of them reported facing toxicity, and in particular, through voice

48
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:44,607
and voice chat. And, you know, it's this, it's the sad truth.

49
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:53,614
Voice chat's obviously, you know, and the impact of voice chat in games,

50
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:59,939
it's obviously very important for various aspects of gaming.

51
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,323
Clearly, with voice chat, players can feel greater immersion

52
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:09,487
within the game and within the world that they're playing in.

53
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:14,431
You know, in order to role play and feel,

54
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:18,335
you know, closer identity, say, to their avatar within the game.

55
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:25,576
They can express that through voice.

56
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:30,900
Obviously, for any kind of competitive online game,

57
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,862
voice chat is a must.

58
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:35,183
There's just no good replacement right now.

59
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:38,866
In order to get the information to your teammates

60
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:46,172
and communicate and function effectively as a team,

61
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,533
players have to be talking to one another.

62
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:52,632
And then, for example, just even, you know, not that long ago,

63
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:57,134
talking about, you know, proximity voice chat stuff was kind of unheard of.

64
00:06:57,134 --> 00:07:01,777
All kinds of issues, you know, technology, bandwidth and so forth.

65
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:08,801
And now, you see any number of games and environments that are starting to implement those features.

66
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:12,903
And, you know, it just, it adds to the, it adds to the experience, you know,

67
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:15,425
and the player's experience within the game.

68
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:29,291
Yeah, but then, you know, now we get to maybe even deeper into the dark side of games. And,

69
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:37,176
you know, I just, you know, called out for the articles here. I'm sure all of us who are almost

70
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:46,601
invariably in the game community have read or seen or almost certainly experienced toxicity within

71
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,913
you know, online gaming environments via voice chat.

72
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:56,695
You know, and the thing is, you know, the thing is when people talk about toxicity,

73
00:07:56,695 --> 00:08:01,417
yeah, oh yeah, there's swear words and all that, sure.

74
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:04,758
But I think we also know that it's way worse than that.

75
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:11,541
It's way worse than that. You know, players are experiencing

76
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,803
racism, doxing, misogyny,

77
00:08:17,114 --> 00:08:26,960
child grooming, even, believe it or not, even terrorist recruitment, believe it or not,

78
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:36,185
goes on in game environments. And again, it's all through the use of voice chat.

79
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:39,226
It's again, it's the downside for sure.

80
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:42,628
Voice.

81
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:48,937
You know, voice in general is an intimate form of communication, right?

82
00:08:48,937 --> 00:08:57,602
And despite the earlier figures about, you know, women in gaming and so forth,

83
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:05,787
you know, these studies show about 60% of women generally seek to mask their gender online,

84
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:11,069
you know, in the obvious ways, right? They're either using, they're either, you know, they're in a

85
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:19,318
a male avatar or in some other ways or perhaps not even using voice chat

86
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:23,960
because invariably when they do reveal their gender

87
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:31,044
many times toxic behavior occurs from their fellow players. It's just a

88
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,925
sad truth, right?

89
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:47,589
68% of players experience severe abuse through voice chat, physical threats, stalking, sustained

90
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:54,374
harassment, stalking both online and in real life.

91
00:09:54,374 --> 00:10:02,541
So again, it's the real cutting edge of voice chat in games and not the good kind.

92
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:09,297
This is an interesting notion, at least I think it's interesting.

93
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:17,379
There's a phenomena in, this has been studied, you know,

94
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:25,880
in the past to a great degree, you know, crowd behavior, when people are

95
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:33,001
in a crowd and they start to become just part of the crowd

96
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:35,302
and, you know, they feel somewhat anonymous.

97
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:39,623
they as a person don't stand out as much

98
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:43,024
and they can kind of start to be absorbed

99
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:45,945
and enmeshed into the crowd.

100
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,805
It's a condition called de-individuation,

101
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:51,166
where basically, excuse me,

102
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:54,687
people basically lose their external

103
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,767
and individual constraints, right?

104
00:10:56,767 --> 00:11:00,848
So where they might act perfectly normally

105
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:02,488
in a normal social situation.

106
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:11,695
you put them in this different environment with these different factors and their behavior changes,

107
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:18,161
right? And not for the better, not for the better. You know, I think all, one only need to have

108
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:24,667
watched the news over the past year to see, and certainly in real life, how these behaviors can

109
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:29,751
play out and how people can kind of lose, lose what are their normal, you know,

110
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:40,017
and not behave in good positive ways.

111
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:46,066
And the other factor at play here is which

112
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:51,700
which environment begets which when it comes to these behaviors, right?

113
00:11:51,700 --> 00:12:00,645
Are people learning this at younger ages and in a more acute fashion because they're online,

114
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:04,646
because they're seeing all this toxic behavior take place,

115
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:10,109
because perhaps they're experiencing it and starting to do it themselves?

116
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:14,051
Do people bring these behaviors online because

117
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:19,372
you know, and then clearly this happens, right? People have tough days and then they go online

118
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:25,454
and maybe they're, maybe they act in ways that, that they normally would, you know,

119
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:33,156
even in an online situation. But it's just, it's the, the behaviors we need to, it's better if we

120
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:40,038
can tamp down these behaviors and these toxic behaviors that make them, you know, create

121
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:42,678
environments where they're not tolerant.

122
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:49,888
right? And they're not set as a norm of behavior. And that's, I think, what we really have to start

123
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:57,411
to strive for when it comes to, you know, moderating online social behavior and online voice chat.

124
00:12:57,411 --> 00:13:05,315
And then let's talk about children, right? You know, as we can see,

125
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:11,117
for we, and I don't think these stats are going to surprise anybody. I mean, 40 to 75% of kids

126
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:11,797
are using.

127
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:18,106
platforms that they're technically, you know, not supposed to be on, too young to be on, right?

128
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:22,269
They're younger than 13 and they're going online and they're playing these games and have headsets

129
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:27,613
on and they're in voice chat and what are they learning? What are they seeing? What kind of

130
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:34,198
behaviors, you know, are there for them to model, right? Other interesting factors, kids are twice

131
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:40,303
as likely to just use platform blocking and reporting tools versus, you know, telling someone,

132
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:41,684
telling a grown-up, telling their parents.

133
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:46,661
what might have happened to them, you know, within a game, within an online environment.

134
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:55,546
And bad things can happen. Majority of kids who block a report say the people they blocked and

135
00:13:55,546 --> 00:14:01,309
reported, they find them again. You know, they come in with a different identity, a different

136
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:06,992
account, boom. And they kind of know where they are, where they were, and they find them again.

137
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:11,074
Clearly, you know, now these are behaviors that are just, well.

138
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:13,104
They're heinous.

139
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:19,967
And some, like child grooming in particular,

140
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:22,429
these are heinous behaviors.

141
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,610
And it's clear to me,

142
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,951
and I think it should be to everyone,

143
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,613
that we have a moral responsibility

144
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:34,074
to do something about it, particularly in games,

145
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:37,176
because it's going on in online multiplayer games.

146
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,978
Kids who identify as LGBTQ,

147
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:51,711
This is shocking, right? They experience harm at even higher rates than non-LGBTQ players do.

148
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:59,274
And yet, and again, here's the great side of online games, online environments,

149
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:07,637
that LGBTQ kids and players, they find joy and strength in video games, right? Going online and

150
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:08,377
playing games.

151
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:11,948
you know, because they can be good at it. They can excel at it.

152
00:15:11,948 --> 00:15:17,431
And goodness knows, heck, they might even find kindred spirits online

153
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:22,553
who they can share both their enjoyment to gain,

154
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:27,996
you know, but also what they might be going through as,

155
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:32,638
you know, as kids growing up, you know, trying to find their identity and so

156
00:15:32,638 --> 00:15:34,219
forth. So I think

157
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:43,592
It's important. It's important. It's important.

158
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:50,175
Let's talk about, all right, so far we've talked about

159
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:55,577
the existence of how important voice chat is

160
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:58,358
both to games and just to us as persons.

161
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:02,640
We've talked about some of the pros

162
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,621
and certainly many of the cons, right?

163
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:08,923
But let's talk about money, right?

164
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:15,067
Because money, money is, tends to get people's attention, right?

165
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:17,208
It tends to get everyone's attention.

166
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,551
At the very top levels of management in companies,

167
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:26,374
and right down to, you know, the base layer.

168
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:31,197
The Anti-Defamation League does tremendous work,

169
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:34,940
studies and reporting on.

170
00:16:35,713 --> 00:16:45,436
any kind of toxic, disruptive behavior in society in general and online as well.

171
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:53,279
The 2020 report is a very good one. It's very informative. I urge everyone to go check it out

172
00:16:53,279 --> 00:17:00,541
if and when you have an opportunity. But for example, 68% of players,

173
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:05,282
68 to 80 actually, are facing serious toxicity.

174
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:12,134
in their game and nearly 50% of players experience that via voice chat.

175
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:22,596
And the big news, almost 30% of players leave games because of it, right? They just leave.

176
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:30,178
They leave your game because they don't need it and they just don't want it. So let's take a

177
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:39,821
just an example game and talk about maybe some of the numbers. So if you take a 50 million player

178
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:46,383
game, sure, that's a big game, but there are way bigger games out there as we know. 50 million,

179
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:53,225
we'll do easy math, right? 50 million players, you have, say, 68% of the players facing toxicity

180
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:59,106
divided again by the 48% who experienced it in voice chat. And then

181
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:08,187
a third of those players leave, 28%. That's 4.5 million on a 50 million player game.

182
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:14,172
Again, my apologies to my friends who are UA specialists out there. There are way more

183
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:22,760
complex and interesting ways to do this. I welcome anyone who wants to really take a look at it, but

184
00:18:24,072 --> 00:18:30,976
This is directionally correct. I don't think we're off by an order of magnitude by any stretch of

185
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:39,201
the imagination. On the low side, we might be approaching being off on the high side.

186
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:47,586
Even with this quick and dirty math, at $10 per player revenue and big games,

187
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:51,468
it can be at least twice that. You're talking $50 million a year.

188
00:18:52,127 --> 00:19:00,052
$50 million a year. Again, that's for a 50 million player game, but that's a lot of money.

189
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:04,094
That's a lot of money. At least I think so. And I think it behooves. And then,

190
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:12,099
well, and then leave that aside for a minute. Think about the human side, right?

191
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:19,784
Four and a half million players experienced, had a very, very negative experience in potentially

192
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:20,965
in your game.

193
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:26,384
right? Because there's nothing being done about the toxic environment.

194
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:32,028
If you know for those players who aren't toxic. You know you had four and a half million players

195
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:42,354
you know they had a they had a crappy time and because of that there's a human side.

196
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:49,599
Just to just add to that again this is these you know this is a VBOX study that was just done in 2019.

197
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,252
Veevok's obviously very involved in voice chat, as we know.

198
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:58,534
Voice chat players spend twice the time in game as non-voice chat players.

199
00:19:58,534 --> 00:20:01,695
Boom. Right? How does that translate to revenue?

200
00:20:01,695 --> 00:20:05,776
I'm certain it does. It has to. And then voice chat players,

201
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:11,799
players who use voice chat, five times as likely to be playing

202
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,840
in week number five versus non-voice chat players.

203
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,781
So again, retention, right? Voice chat.

204
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:27,113
contributes remarkably to for those games that you know that uh utilize voice chat it contributes

205
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:34,618
remarkably to to game retention uh so it's it's you know it really behooves us not just

206
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:42,744
ethically again but financially to do something about voice chat in our games and the toxicity

207
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:46,387
they're in um

208
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:54,808
Just to sort of finish up here, you know, voice chat technology, it's evolving, it's changing,

209
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:59,650
it's growing, it's getting, you know, it's getting better and better enabled all the time.

210
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:05,414
And, you know, some of the big streaming platforms are giving players more control over,

211
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:13,899
you know, kind of the voice interactions between them, streamers and so forth.

212
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,640
There's technology where folks can, you know,

213
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:23,618
recognize and adjust for dialogue, even, you know, even language difference between speakers,

214
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:29,361
which is, you know, more on the cohesive, bring people together side. There's dynamic,

215
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:38,207
dynamic volume-based proximity chat, you know, as far as, you know, even telling where other

216
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:43,090
players and even where enemies are, you know, online. So that's all great stuff.

217
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:51,478
But there is, you know, as far as voice chat and toxicity and moderation there, there are today

218
00:21:51,478 --> 00:22:02,063
autonomous moderation addressing technologies that can be used in games by game runners,

219
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:10,346
by platforms to moderate and cut way down on toxic chat.

220
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:13,492
in our games, right?

221
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:16,974
You know, we at Modulate, we, you know,

222
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:19,975
I have my Talks Mod webpage signal there,

223
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:23,397
but if you're interested in this, by all means,

224
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:25,718
go to modulate.ai.

225
00:22:25,718 --> 00:22:28,419
You can check out the kind of things we're doing.

226
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:32,321
There are other companies doing it as well.

227
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:36,943
And I think it uses all to recognize the issue,

228
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:39,385
acknowledge it.

229
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:44,188
and do something about it.

230
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:48,271
And with that, I'm going to let you all go.

231
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:53,734
I hope you found this at least somewhat informative

232
00:22:53,734 --> 00:23:00,199
and interesting and I want you all to have a

233
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:05,862
have a great day. Stay well. I hope you enjoyed my

234
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:09,385
my Wu-Fang swag. There's not much of this left.

235
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:10,365
Anymore anyway.

236
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:18,425
You all stay safe out there, be well, and enjoy game playing online.

237
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:19,946
It's fun.

238
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:22,229
Thank you very much.

239
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:22,609
Take care.
