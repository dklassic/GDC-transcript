1
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:07,368
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:07,368 --> 00:00:09,552
Welcome to the most boring talk here at GDC.

3
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:12,877
You've all made a mistake coming here.

4
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:14,579
But seriously, thank you for coming.

5
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:16,783
There's a lot of good talks going on right now, so thank

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:17,644
you for choosing this one.

7
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:20,986
So what is this presentation about?

8
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:24,549
It's about Atreus, a companion AI in God of War.

9
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:25,469
For those who don't know,

10
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:27,831
God of War is a third-person action melee game

11
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:29,972
with light RPG elements.

12
00:00:29,972 --> 00:00:32,194
And this talk will focus mostly

13
00:00:32,194 --> 00:00:34,636
on the combat aspects of Atreus,

14
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:36,357
go over the hows and whys,

15
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:40,260
and take you through the journey of creating Atreus.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,341
So before we start, who am I?

17
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:43,162
My name is Hayato.

18
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:45,625
I'm a senior combat tech designer.

19
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:49,608
I've been working at Santa Monica Studios for over eight years.

20
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:52,249
And these are the titles I've worked on in the past.

21
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:55,111
And before I start, let me tell you how I ended up

22
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:55,692
working on Atreus.

23
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,153
It's a little bit of story time.

24
00:00:57,153 --> 00:01:00,836
So one day, I was tasked to implement and design

25
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:01,816
Atreus from scratch.

26
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:03,397
I was like, what?

27
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:03,457
Why?

28
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:06,800
I have no desire or experience making companion AI.

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,302
So since I wanted to keep my job,

30
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,783
I went on the internet and searched

31
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,324
how to make good companion AI.

32
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:15,453
I know.

33
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:18,737
I know.

34
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:20,980
Yeah.

35
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,983
I like...

36
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,965
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:25,406
Please.

38
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:25,746
Oh, God.

39
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:31,520
I like to copy and paste a lot of code, so that's my workflow usually.

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,263
So anyways, what I found was, I saw a talk by Max Dyckhoff.

41
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:39,245
He did a talk about Ellie in The Last of Us, and he said he treated Ellie like his own

42
00:01:39,245 --> 00:01:39,765
child.

43
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:44,088
So I was like, okay, if that's what it takes to make a good companion AI, so be it.

44
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:46,589
So next day, I got a picture frame of Atreus.

45
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:48,623
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:52,466
But the problem here is that I don't want kids, or even have kids.

47
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:55,809
I'm like, what am I doing with my life right now?

48
00:01:55,809 --> 00:02:00,653
So fortunately, though, I treated Trace like a friend that plays games with you,

49
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,595
a friend that knows what you're going to do and vice versa.

50
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:06,678
You can just play games, and you know what you're going to do,

51
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:08,219
and he knows what, or they know what you're going to do.

52
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:10,341
So it was like some kind of teamwork.

53
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:14,204
And that change in perception ultimately influenced some of the decision made

54
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:14,964
when building on Trace.

55
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,006
So, enough about me.

56
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:17,587
Who is Atreus?

57
00:02:17,587 --> 00:02:21,389
He's the son of Kratos, a small child,

58
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:25,972
born in a harsh Norse mythological setting,

59
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:28,794
uses a bow primarily, and has no formal training.

60
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:31,456
And this clip I'm going to show you

61
00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:33,778
is just showcasing what Atreus does in combat.

62
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:33,818
Ah!

63
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:33,858
Ah!

64
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:33,918
Uh!

65
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:35,559
Uh!

66
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't get up!

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,842
Yeah, he's like dodging attacks, attacking stuff.

68
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:44,205
I'm not gonna go into too much detail right now, bye.

69
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:49,234
He's doing a mixture of both autonomous behaviors and directed actions.

70
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:51,276
And the main thing here is that you don't even know, if you look at this and you don't

71
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:58,021
know what the game is all about or whatever, but you can see Atreus helping you like a

72
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:02,984
teammate and you're like, yeah, he looks pretty useful I guess.

73
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:03,965
That's what we were going for.

74
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:06,527
So as long as you get that, that's all that matters.

75
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,575
Yeah, and that's it.

76
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:19,576
Unfortunately, it wasn't always like that.

77
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:22,097
And this is how it all started.

78
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:24,999
So like any respectable designer, I guess,

79
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,119
I started with core pillars.

80
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:28,880
The first pillar being supporting the player.

81
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,002
Kratos is the main actor in the game,

82
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,723
so Atreus needed to be supporting Kratos.

83
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:38,844
Second pillar is he should not hinder the player.

84
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,925
He should never get in the way of the player.

85
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:42,006
That's just a big no-no.

86
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,961
Third thing is, if he ever does something,

87
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:46,862
it should always be helpful.

88
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:49,003
It should never make the player feel bad

89
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:50,864
whenever it's a performance in action.

90
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,386
And lastly, and maybe most importantly,

91
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:55,927
you should not have to babysit him.

92
00:03:55,927 --> 00:04:00,290
And if any of the last three points actually just goes bad,

93
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,512
the game will immediately feel like a bad escort mission,

94
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:06,233
and we tried really hard not breaking any of these rules.

95
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:08,574
So, these core pillars are pretty good,

96
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:11,056
but the real question is, who are we supporting, right?

97
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:15,509
We're supporting Kratos, a one-man army.

98
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,672
He's killed titans, gods, he's went to hell and back,

99
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:21,514
killed more gods, and then he killed a lot of guys.

100
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,515
And nobody was saying, oh, you know what?

101
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,136
You know what Kravis needs?

102
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,998
A child to fight with him in battle.

103
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:31,340
I'm a genius, right?

104
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,404
Nobody was saying that, maybe except for one director.

105
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:36,806
But that, yeah.

106
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:41,170
So the real question is, how do we support a literal god of war,

107
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,410
a child?

108
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,192
How is he going to support him?

109
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:45,854
So it's all about the framing, like how

110
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:46,835
do we approach this problem?

111
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,240
You know, when you look at movies like Marvel, you know,

112
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,564
the Marvel movies, you see Thor,

113
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:54,407
he's just destroying enemies left and right,

114
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:55,288
kind of like Kratos, right?

115
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:57,372
And then you see guys like Hawkeye,

116
00:04:57,372 --> 00:05:00,076
maybe not as, you know, impressive as Thor,

117
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:01,078
but he's doing work.

118
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:06,349
But the main thing here is that they're working as a cohesive unit.

119
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,031
They're a team, right?

120
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:14,095
And then whenever they work as a team, they can finish their goal quicker.

121
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:17,398
And this framing was a good step in approaching Atreus' role.

122
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:20,440
So knowing this framing, what were the next steps?

123
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,181
To prototype.

124
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:24,123
Prototype a bunch of things.

125
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:28,905
And we drew a lot of inspiration from a lot of single-player games with good companion AIs.

126
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:34,067
And also we looked at multiplayer games where your teammates will help you out.

127
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,108
So cooperative and also team-based games.

128
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:42,190
So looking at all these archetypes, we're like, what's the first thing we want to try out?

129
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,671
So we tried Atreus being an initiator.

130
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:50,377
An initiator is a character who will start a team fight

131
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:54,758
and will give you or give their teammates a huge advantage

132
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:58,299
when the fight starts, or usually.

133
00:05:58,299 --> 00:05:59,739
And that's what we did.

134
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,700
So in the next clip I'm going to show you,

135
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,340
Atreus does exactly that.

136
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,221
Find your angle, boy.

137
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:05,541
Yes, sir.

138
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,682
So he does a couple of things.

139
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:10,403
First, this first clip, he's gonna just

140
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,923
hail down some arrows.

141
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:24,192
Maybe that's too much, but that's what he did.

142
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:29,996
Other things, removing enemy weapons, kind of useful, not bad.

143
00:06:29,996 --> 00:06:34,559
Or even rooting enemies using the tree, that's kind of useful, I guess.

144
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:37,705
And then, you know, summoning crows.

145
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:40,185
I wonder where we got that inspiration from, you know?

146
00:06:40,185 --> 00:06:42,545
Like, well, yeah.

147
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:46,566
So all these look good on paper, but there were

148
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:47,746
two main issues with this.

149
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:50,747
Number one, the players exhibited a play pattern

150
00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:52,227
that we did not want to promote.

151
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:54,168
The players were kind of like sneaking around

152
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:55,068
in the battlefield.

153
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:56,848
They were like, oh, what can Atreus use?

154
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,228
And it almost felt like a stealth game,

155
00:06:58,228 --> 00:06:59,869
and that's not something we want to promote.

156
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:01,229
So already, that was a big problem.

157
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:05,432
Number two was when players actually use Atreus,

158
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,634
it was really mindless because you would just say,

159
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:09,135
oh, just interact with that, and then you're done.

160
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:11,297
So the first point I made, you know,

161
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,180
making the game feel like a stealth game,

162
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,981
that was a problem, so we didn't address that.

163
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:19,744
But we were like, okay, if he's kind of mindless to use,

164
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:22,827
what if he was more involved in combat, you know?

165
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:23,487
What if he...

166
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,787
you know, what if we can change his behavior

167
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:28,688
to be offensive or defensive?

168
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:30,109
So in the next clip I'm going to show you,

169
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:32,950
the first half, Atreus is kind of offensive.

170
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,692
He's going to be, you know,

171
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:36,132
distracting guys in front of you.

172
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,234
In the latter half, he's going to be

173
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:39,635
helping you out when you get hit.

174
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:41,516
And sorry for a debug, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

175
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:46,439
Yeah, so right here, he's gonna distract the guy on the right,

176
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,579
he's gonna shoot him.

177
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:47,840
Oh!

178
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,000
Ah!

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,100
Ah!

180
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,160
Ah!

181
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,043
Don't let them buy it!

182
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:53,223
Ah!

183
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:58,284
And then he's gonna distract the guy kinda in the outskirts.

184
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:00,764
And he does this every interval,

185
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:02,345
so he kinda keeps a healthy,

186
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:04,105
like he's cycling through all the enemies,

187
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,745
who he thinks is the best target

188
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:08,926
to kinda throw their attention away.

189
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:11,966
This was kinda useful, it was interesting.

190
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:15,747
Next thing we tried is, this is a defensive move.

191
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,287
You see here, Kratos got hit,

192
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,528
and Atreus will try to help you.

193
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:20,088
Yeah.

194
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:23,108
Yeah, that's interesting, yeah.

195
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:27,338
So note that Atreus is going behind the player.

196
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:30,042
He can only help out when he's actually behind you.

197
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:34,388
You know, this action is kind of helpful, I guess.

198
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,751
You can do all these interesting things.

199
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:40,457
But, there was a couple of problems with this, too.

200
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,010
You had too much control over Atreus.

201
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,691
Like in the heat of the battle,

202
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,273
people didn't even try to like change his behavior.

203
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:48,774
Like, oh, I'm attacking this guy.

204
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,315
I have no time to think about

205
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:51,596
what the behavior of Atreus should be.

206
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:53,317
So that's problem number one.

207
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:56,880
Number two was during this time,

208
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,622
enemies were dying like three hits, you know.

209
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,144
We were fighting humanoid, like human bandits.

210
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:04,586
So as a god, you should be able to kill them relatively easily

211
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,787
so they were dying in three hits.

212
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:08,909
So Atreus couldn't even shine in this kind of environment.

213
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,572
But the silver lining was, when he was actually

214
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:13,833
distracting enemies in front of him,

215
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,594
it was actually pretty useful.

216
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:17,535
So I'll talk about that a little bit later.

217
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:21,538
But first, I want to point out that around this time,

218
00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:23,439
we actually took Atreus and we split him

219
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,040
into two core traits.

220
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,442
One defining his autonomous behavior,

221
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,563
and the other defining his directed actions.

222
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:32,865
Directed actions is when the player tells Atreus what to do.

223
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:36,366
So when we actually split these apart,

224
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,667
it was actually easier to work in isolation,

225
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,527
and that was the right call.

226
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:41,688
So back to what I was saying,

227
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:43,489
where when he was distracting enemies on his own,

228
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:45,709
like autonomously, that was really useful.

229
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,910
So I want to kind of dig deeper into this autonomous behavior.

230
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:52,225
So the next thing we tried was, okay, you know,

231
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:56,288
what if he actually behaved like a real player?

232
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:58,189
When you're playing like an FPS game,

233
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:00,591
your teammates will hopefully try to like,

234
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:02,272
handle a threat from the other side of the map

235
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:04,493
and you'll handle another side of the fight or map.

236
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:06,795
You're kind of essentially splitting up the battlefield

237
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:09,277
and Atreus did exactly that.

238
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,158
So in the next video I'm going to show you,

239
00:10:11,158 --> 00:10:14,000
Atreus is dividing the field in his own way.

240
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:21,908
Sorry for debug again, but all the circles around the enemy, that's who Atreus is focusing on.

241
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:25,751
And in this RTS-esque camera, you can see what's happening.

242
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:30,954
Great. Atreus is kind of, you know, dividing the battlefield. Great.

243
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:36,297
And in, you know, this view, in the actual game view, if you're just looking at Atreus passively,

244
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:39,799
like, yeah, you can see a couple of enemies going after Atreus.

245
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,660
I guess that's kind of helpful.

246
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,021
But...

247
00:10:43,537 --> 00:10:45,678
You know, people don't play a game like this.

248
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,178
They play like this.

249
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,959
They translate a lot, move the camera like crazy,

250
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,740
change their focus, you know,

251
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,461
and you briefly maybe see a trace,

252
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:55,202
like what is he doing there?

253
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:58,163
I have no idea, what was he doing?

254
00:10:58,163 --> 00:10:58,704
Who knows?

255
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:01,305
I'm just gonna go back to fighting this troll,

256
00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:01,645
I mean ogre.

257
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,906
So that was a huge issue.

258
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:07,957
And honestly, at this point, I was like,

259
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:09,098
oh man, I suck.

260
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:10,298
I should probably update my resume.

261
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:11,939
I'm gonna, you know, like honestly.

262
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,520
But, you know, there was key nuggets of goodness

263
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,301
when I was doing all these things.

264
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,542
So I was like, you know what?

265
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:18,802
I'm gonna do a little deep dive

266
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:20,843
and kind of list out all the core issues

267
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:22,464
that I'm seeing right now.

268
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,725
And yeah, when I actually did that,

269
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,626
I actually identified three issues.

270
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:28,755
First one being presence.

271
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,815
People didn't even see where he was.

272
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,216
Number two was perceived impact.

273
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:34,196
Even if he did something,

274
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:36,857
you don't know what the impact that is for combat.

275
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:38,977
Number three was weak enemies.

276
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:41,398
Not necessarily Atreus' problem,

277
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:44,439
but it was adding to a problem.

278
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:46,859
So, let's address these three issues.

279
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:47,839
Presence.

280
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,380
This is a reality.

281
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,221
Can any of you guys see where Atreus is?

282
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:54,721
I'll give you guys a second, I guess.

283
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:59,879
Yeah, nobody, right? Probably. Yeah, because he's not in the picture.

284
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,022
I'm just kidding, he's actually right there.

285
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:07,725
He's laying on the ground like that. And this was a reality.

286
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,067
Even if he's on screen, you can't even see him.

287
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:14,951
And the fact that we can't have, you know, the camera cuts and stuff, so, you know, we had to adapt to that.

288
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,453
And, you know, that exasperated the issue.

289
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:19,875
But, there were three things that actually helped his presence.

290
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:24,331
Now, first thing was, make him use a bow as a melee weapon.

291
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:26,555
Number two is dynamic poses.

292
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:29,280
Number three is changing his position behavior.

293
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:34,105
So first thing, him using a bow as a melee weapon,

294
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:37,166
completely un-intuit, why would an archer use

295
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,166
a bow as a melee weapon?

296
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,566
Well it turns out, when archers are shooting,

297
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:41,907
they're doing this still pose, right?

298
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:44,868
And so when you're scanning the battlefield,

299
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:47,249
you'll see, oh yeah, Atreus has that pose,

300
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:48,429
but the arrow went somewhere,

301
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,490
I can't make the connection who he shot.

302
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,791
But the moment he uses a bow as a melee weapon,

303
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,672
he's using a more fluid animation,

304
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:57,572
and then he's next to an enemy,

305
00:12:57,572 --> 00:13:00,253
so you can make the, you can add one and one together.

306
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,034
just by scanning the battlefield,

307
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:04,296
and that helped his presence immensely.

308
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:05,817
You saw a lot more interesting things

309
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:07,479
happening in the battlefield.

310
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:11,642
And number two was, my favorite, dynamic poses.

311
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:13,743
And people, you guys might be thinking,

312
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:16,065
duh, why didn't you guys do that at the beginning?

313
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:18,107
Do you even design, bro?

314
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:20,208
Like, I know, you guys might be thinking that,

315
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,131
but there's a thing called us wanting to be grounded.

316
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:25,892
The game was grounded at the beginning.

317
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:28,274
We couldn't do these jumping moves and stuff like that,

318
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:28,655
but.

319
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:31,506
we had a great tonal shift,

320
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,146
and that restriction kind of came off a bit,

321
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,167
so we were able to have a trace jump up in the air.

322
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,848
We essentially kind of dialed up the anime knob

323
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:40,029
by like 30%, we're like, all right,

324
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,549
this is the right amount.

325
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:43,830
So you can see this pose in combat.

326
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,092
You can see here, he's like occupying like the second half

327
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:51,033
or just the top of the screen, that's fantastic.

328
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:53,374
There's a lot more noise and you see what's happening.

329
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,714
When he's trying to stab enemies,

330
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,775
he'll kind of arc his back and kind of hold his pose.

331
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:01,158
It's fantastic.

332
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:05,220
And even his profile, he would actually go sideways.

333
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,101
And when you actually see a small child

334
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:08,362
become sideways in battle,

335
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:11,664
you actually notice that really immediately.

336
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:14,486
And when he's grabbing enemies,

337
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,287
he would tower over enemies.

338
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,228
He's a small child, so he's trying to look

339
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:20,490
bigger than who he is.

340
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,951
So he would hold that pose, grab enemies.

341
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:24,692
And it worked out pretty well.

342
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,691
And again, when he's doing melee attacks,

343
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,833
he's putting his entire weight into it.

344
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,194
And when he does that kind of motion,

345
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:32,635
you really notice it.

346
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:34,677
So even if you're doing all these interesting combos

347
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:37,759
or whatnot, you notice Atreus kind of coming in with you,

348
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,580
and it's fantastic.

349
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,683
And my favorite pose of all is this one.

350
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:46,126
Him kind of kneeling down-ish to do like a dash attack.

351
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,847
And whenever he did that,

352
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:50,089
you knew he was gonna go into position

353
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,491
like as fast as possible.

354
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,213
And speaking of position, that's my next topic.

355
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:59,382
Intuitive does not mean it's going to be interesting.

356
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:03,383
So initially we wanted Treyus to be safe.

357
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:04,663
He's a small boy after all,

358
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:07,624
and he's using the bow as a ranged weapon,

359
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:10,245
so he's kind of moving away from threats.

360
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:11,685
We even gave him a strafe set

361
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:14,366
so he can actually change his position really quickly.

362
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:17,837
But what ended up happening was he looked really erratic

363
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:19,898
because he was trying to find a safe spot.

364
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:22,480
And not only that, since he's evading all the enemies,

365
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,121
nothing interesting will happen on its own.

366
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:26,903
He's just carefully avoiding enemies.

367
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:30,465
So we were like, OK, let's make it slightly more interesting.

368
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:32,326
Let's make him stand his ground a bit.

369
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:35,348
Let enemies actually bump into him and see what can happen.

370
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:39,471
So when that happens, we decided that if Atreus swings his bow

371
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,912
or does some offensive action that

372
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:44,414
leads to some kind of positive outcome, it felt great.

373
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,774
Now, with this, when we tell Atreus to go somewhere,

374
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:49,075
he's gonna actually stand his ground,

375
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:50,496
and with that, we're like,

376
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,397
well, what's the best place to put him?

377
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:54,499
And it's behind the player's target.

378
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:56,680
You know, when the player's focusing on the enemy,

379
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,221
like, he has a field of view,

380
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,283
and right behind the enemy is also somewhere

381
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:02,084
where players can actually notice him.

382
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:03,745
So, when we actually moved,

383
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:07,889
or tried to position Atreus behind the enemy target,

384
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:08,989
or the player's target,

385
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:10,951
that's where the magic happened, actually.

386
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,351
His movement actually now had intentionality.

387
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:15,812
He was moving there for a purpose,

388
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:17,733
the purpose being double team the target

389
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:19,314
you're fighting against.

390
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:22,295
And when he did that, it didn't look contrived.

391
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,136
He came on screen with a reason.

392
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:25,957
When he was actually dividing the battlefield earlier,

393
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:27,438
like when he actually came on screen,

394
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:28,659
you're like, what is he doing?

395
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,819
He's just charging into battle.

396
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:31,060
I have no idea what he's doing.

397
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,121
So when he did this, it was fantastic.

398
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:34,682
And like proper teammates.

399
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:40,484
when they go into position to set up an alley-oop or a bump-set spike.

400
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:44,645
In Atreus' case, it's just being a crap out of your target.

401
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:48,746
They all had a good reason to move to a position.

402
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:49,546
So that's fantastic.

403
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:53,948
So this is a small clip of Atreus posting up to the player's target.

404
00:16:53,948 --> 00:17:00,810
I gave myself a 3-4 second rule where it takes around that time for Atreus to come up on

405
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,150
screen and try to post up next to your target.

406
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:18,340
Yeah. So all this was possible because of my favorite tool in game development.

407
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:20,774
Warping.

408
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:21,814
Thanks, John.

409
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:24,236
I am not above using warping.

410
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:25,436
I use it everywhere.

411
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:27,257
Like the moment I can warp, I just do it.

412
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:29,478
Like I even have a script that allows me to like,

413
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:31,359
you know, just copy-paste something, you know,

414
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,600
the warp will just happen.

415
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,001
And the main thing was, you know,

416
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:37,082
I want to make sure Atreus was a reliable teammate,

417
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:38,243
not a realistic teammate.

418
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:40,264
And that was the most important aspect I focused on

419
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:43,126
because whenever Atreus needs to come in

420
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,246
and help the hero,

421
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:47,028
I want to make sure it happens at a timely manner.

422
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,232
So the logic of teleporting is pretty straightforward.

423
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:55,395
If he wants to go to a target, he takes the edge of the

424
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:58,938
fresnum of the camera, and then he picks a point closest to

425
00:17:58,938 --> 00:17:59,658
the target.

426
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:01,540
I'm kind of overly simplifying it, but that's how he

427
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,541
teleports when he's off screen.

428
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,063
And I'm going to show you a video clip of him just

429
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:07,224
teleporting everywhere.

430
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:12,268
And he just popped in there and just, yeah, he's going to

431
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:12,928
attack that guy.

432
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:18,704
And obviously when he teleports, you usually cannot, I mean, you can, but most of them

433
00:18:18,704 --> 00:18:20,986
you cannot see him teleporting.

434
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:28,091
And what's funny about this teleporting behavior is that he's actually a lot more reliable

435
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,772
when he's off screen, because he's teleporting constantly.

436
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:33,714
If he's actually far away, he needs to run towards your target.

437
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,255
So that was an interesting thing.

438
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:39,828
So, with all this fantastic teleporting,

439
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,428
all these things we did,

440
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:43,589
we felt that his presence was actually improving.

441
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,170
And we're like, okay, let's focus on the other things now.

442
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,690
So, perceived impact.

443
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,471
When he was actually dividing a battlefield,

444
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:53,312
people might have seen it, but they're like,

445
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:54,572
what am I gonna do after this?

446
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:57,413
After he divided a field, what am I supposed to do?

447
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,033
They didn't know what to do.

448
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:04,055
Atreus focusing on the macro aspects of the battlefield,

449
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:06,595
we were like, what if he actually focuses

450
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:09,336
on the micro aspects of the battlefield?

451
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:12,177
What I mean by that is he's going to be now,

452
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:15,418
oops, sorry, focusing on the player's target.

453
00:19:15,418 --> 00:19:18,759
So whenever the player does something to the target,

454
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,900
Atreus will be extremely reactive.

455
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,002
He's constantly looking at what the player is doing.

456
00:19:25,002 --> 00:19:28,783
So, knowing that, what kind of actions did Atreus take?

457
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:30,809
These are some of them.

458
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:34,873
So if you launch an enemy, Atreus will keep him juggled.

459
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:38,858
And if you ground an enemy, trip an enemy, he'll keep him grounded.

460
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:45,746
If you kick an enemy into a wall, Atreus will keep him pinned to the wall.

461
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:50,631
If you're hitting an enemy, Atreus will just grab him so he can't move.

462
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:56,016
and if the enemy is just constantly blocking your attacks,

463
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:57,538
you'll just break his block by tripping him.

464
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:00,502
And these are just a couple of them, there's a lot more.

465
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:02,384
The main thing here was that he extends

466
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:05,228
the enemy's vulnerable state and allows players

467
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:08,533
to attack the enemy and kill the enemy quickly.

468
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:14,831
And every time Atreus did this, this was when the intentionality of the player and Atreus

469
00:20:14,831 --> 00:20:15,752
kind of aligned.

470
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:19,274
The player just wanted to kill the guy quicker, and then Atreus just helped him out.

471
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:23,177
So when he did that, Atreus felt like a better teammate as a whole.

472
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,256
So, perceived impact, people are now feeling his impact,

473
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:30,799
and they're like, all right, he's kind of useful now.

474
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,921
But the weak enemies, not Atreus' problem,

475
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:35,523
but we resolved it by increasing

476
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:37,284
the health of enemies, obviously.

477
00:20:37,284 --> 00:20:40,547
But if the enemy actually gets stronger,

478
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:42,829
it doesn't mean Atreus should do more damage

479
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:44,490
so he helps the player out.

480
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,432
The main thing he should be focusing on

481
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:50,015
is creating more shortcuts for players to dispatch the enemy.

482
00:20:51,273 --> 00:21:00,718
This was really important because you don't want Atreus to take the spotlight of the player.

483
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:06,380
So the next video I'm going to show you, I'll show you a clip of a player killing a Draugr

484
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,381
without Atreus's help.

485
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:14,905
In the latter half, he's going to kill Draugrs with the help of Atreus.

486
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:18,466
So all this is taking about 14 seconds, which is pretty bad, I guess.

487
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:25,000
But if you use Atreus, he gives you shortcuts,

488
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,341
you can kill them pretty quickly.

489
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:33,126
The main thing here is, not only does he provide shortcuts,

490
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:42,193
he actually provides you other options in combat as well.

491
00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:45,275
So if he's grabbing an enemy and you decide to launch him,

492
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:48,578
Atreus will kind of slam the enemy down

493
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:51,480
and create a huge concussion.

494
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:53,844
That was how he actually helped the player.

495
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:57,588
Even though the enemy got beefier,

496
00:21:57,588 --> 00:22:00,271
Atreus constantly provided these shortcuts,

497
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:02,253
so it was actually fantastic.

498
00:22:02,253 --> 00:22:05,917
And while we were working on these mechanics,

499
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:10,862
there were some key findings that weren't very obvious.

500
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:13,677
Timing is everything.

501
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:15,698
Not every time is a good time to follow up.

502
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:20,440
So if the player is aiming with his axe on a reticle and Atreus happens to knock the

503
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,020
guy away, that's terrible.

504
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,622
So you have to be mindful when he can attack.

505
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:31,204
Other times, when the player is actually wailing on a guy, it's okay for Atreus to actually

506
00:22:31,204 --> 00:22:32,185
come in and help you out.

507
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:37,786
And the key thing here is that, you know, the best, actually the best time for Atreus

508
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:42,511
to help the player is when the player actually does like a really strong move or whatever

509
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:46,795
where there is a long recovery time because during the recovery time usually the players

510
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:48,076
can't like move and stuff like that.

511
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:54,422
And that small beat, that window, they can actually register what Atreus is doing so

512
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:57,445
when Atreus is jumping off the player's back, that's when people really notice.

513
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,205
And so just because you found a great time to attack,

514
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:05,151
doesn't mean the actions are going to be helpful.

515
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:07,695
Not all support actions are useful actions.

516
00:23:09,532 --> 00:23:12,153
If the attacks are extremely disruptive,

517
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:14,195
we have to be mindful when we're gonna do it.

518
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:17,457
For example, if players are knocking enemies off the ledge

519
00:23:17,457 --> 00:23:19,958
and stuff like that, and Atreus happens to kind of

520
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,680
interrupt it by hitting them out of the air,

521
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,820
that's disruptive, that's really bad.

522
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,263
And also, conversely, like if, not conversely,

523
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:31,006
if the player is causing a stumble reaction on the enemy,

524
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:33,928
and Atreus comes in and just causes a basic reaction,

525
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:36,189
he effectively negated the recovery time of the enemy.

526
00:23:36,189 --> 00:23:37,290
So, he needs to.

527
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:41,034
we need to respect their reaction hierarchy of the game.

528
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:43,877
This is a really simplified reaction hierarchy.

529
00:23:43,877 --> 00:23:46,619
There's a lot more reactions, but I just simplified it.

530
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:48,000
But that's the idea.

531
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,883
And the main thing here is that we

532
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:57,008
have to predict the player's intentions, essentially.

533
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:58,829
So if the player is doing some kind of actions,

534
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:00,771
make sure whatever Atreus does is

535
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:03,133
going to enhance what the player wants to do.

536
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,755
And that's kind of how we design his attacks.

537
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,889
And this is kind of seeing everything in action.

538
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:12,330
This is kind of early, but this is when I was like,

539
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,072
all right, maybe I get to keep my job.

540
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:15,793
Maybe I'm doing something smart.

541
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:19,395
He's actually doing, helping you out autonomously.

542
00:24:19,395 --> 00:24:26,861
Yeah, I mean, there was more tuning that needed to happen,

543
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:29,462
but this had all elements of Atreus kind of helping you out.

544
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:30,823
This is just purely autonomous.

545
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:32,585
You're not telling Atreus to do anything.

546
00:24:34,663 --> 00:24:52,398
So, this all looked good, and we were like, okay, maybe the playtesters can now play with

547
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:52,858
Atreus.

548
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,400
But, it looked good, but...

549
00:24:56,507 --> 00:24:59,649
It was only helpful when players were actually offensive.

550
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:02,032
Remember I said Atreus is going to be reactive to your actions?

551
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:05,795
So it turns out when players are low on health,

552
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,637
they start to become very defensive.

553
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:10,599
And since you're defensive, Atreus

554
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,680
can't do anything after that.

555
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,383
So we're like, OK, we need to come up

556
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:16,725
with a couple of helpful behaviors

557
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:19,327
to allow players to become more offensive.

558
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:21,029
So some of the helpful behaviors were.

559
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:25,496
Calling out threats, especially attacks for coming out of offscreen,

560
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:29,177
you can't look behind you, so it was a perfect way for Trace to call them out.

561
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:33,138
Another thing is he sometimes protects you from offscreen attacks.

562
00:25:33,138 --> 00:25:36,198
Most people didn't notice this, but it actually happens quite often.

563
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:38,939
Other thing is reviving the player.

564
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:43,440
This is not really a behavior per se, but it's another resource mechanic

565
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,680
that allows players to become more offensive when they're kind of low on health.

566
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:50,930
And finally, my favorite, detecting danger.

567
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,730
Thank you, Sam.

568
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,691
So there's this danger meter where

569
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:58,052
Atreus is just detecting if the player's in danger or not.

570
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:01,714
And if this meter hits a certain threshold,

571
00:26:01,714 --> 00:26:05,595
Atreus does a spread shot and pulls enemies away.

572
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:06,795
So here's a video of that.

573
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:12,092
So he's going to do right about now,

574
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:14,152
and he just pulls a bunch of enemies towards him,

575
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:16,993
and you can just only fight one enemy.

576
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,674
And the danger meter was based off

577
00:26:19,674 --> 00:26:23,955
of the number of enemies around the player, his health,

578
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:27,376
and also the types of actions Kratos was doing.

579
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:29,476
Like if he's blocking or defending or dodging,

580
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:30,817
that meter went up.

581
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:33,217
And the moment you actually perform an offensive action,

582
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:36,118
the meter actually just reset

583
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:37,618
and just continue on your merry way.

584
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,613
And honestly, this thing wasn't to promote defensive play style.

585
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:45,056
We were just making sure that there's some brief moments where

586
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:48,299
players can actually take on the offense when they're in trouble.

587
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:52,323
And this extended the intense fights a lot longer, which was good.

588
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:57,427
So with all the autonomous behavior kind of in place,

589
00:26:57,427 --> 00:27:01,591
you know, it was pretty much done and we were at a good place.

590
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:04,033
So now I want to talk about the directed actions.

591
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:11,488
So the directed actions, a.k.a. the sun button.

592
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,771
We always wanted a dedicated sun button,

593
00:27:15,771 --> 00:27:18,572
and we examined these on-demand actions, actually.

594
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:21,834
And before we actually dove into those ideas,

595
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,295
we had to ensure a couple of things.

596
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:26,435
Number one, they have to be reliable.

597
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,816
And when I say reliable, it doesn't mean it needs

598
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:29,757
to like destroy the enemy.

599
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:33,659
What I mean by reliable is, if you press that button,

600
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:37,181
whatever action Trace is gonna do, it needs to happen.

601
00:27:37,181 --> 00:27:39,102
What if, you know, Trace like jumping up in the air

602
00:27:39,102 --> 00:27:41,243
or whatever, we have to author all the actions

603
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,504
in a way where it can be interrupted.

604
00:27:42,504 --> 00:27:44,965
And that also meant that his update loop

605
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:47,666
can't be round robin because all the actions

606
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,967
will be delayed.

607
00:27:50,474 --> 00:27:52,476
Other thing is, it shouldn't disrupt the player.

608
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:54,658
You know, when Atreus is gonna perform an action,

609
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:57,581
he can come from all sides of the battlefield,

610
00:27:57,581 --> 00:28:00,224
so you don't know where he's gonna be shooting at.

611
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:01,985
So whatever he does, it should not cause

612
00:28:01,985 --> 00:28:03,867
any grief to the player.

613
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:07,010
And if Atreus does something, you have to make sure

614
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,714
that players will know what's gonna happen to the enemy.

615
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:13,977
The player is actually, sorry.

616
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:18,378
The players are actually operating on a moment-to-moment basis,

617
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:21,359
so if something random happens, it's going to throw off their game.

618
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,241
And lastly, the actions need to be super helpful.

619
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:29,842
If you use the action and it causes some harm to the player or whatever,

620
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,223
nobody will be interested in using it.

621
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:36,445
So knowing all these, we're like, OK, these are pretty solid.

622
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:40,827
Let's try making ice arrows, focused on crowd control.

623
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:47,593
So when this went int, I was like, alright, this is pretty good.

624
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:48,394
What can go wrong?

625
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,194
Ice arrows.

626
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,075
You know, he's slowing down enemies.

627
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:52,656
Nobody's slowing down enemies right now.

628
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:57,999
But obviously, as you guys may know, you know, Kratos has a Leviathan Axe.

629
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:02,702
It used to be the Blood Axe, but it turned into the Leviathan Axe, so the moment I put

630
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:09,806
in the ice arrow, I had to just remove it because I was competing with the Leviathan

631
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:09,886
Axe.

632
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:10,226
Yeah.

633
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:10,426
Yeah.

634
00:29:11,454 --> 00:29:15,376
figuring out what Kratos is going to do was first and foremost the most important thing,

635
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:16,796
so I had to concede.

636
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:21,478
So the next thing I did was, alright, maybe crowd control isn't the right answer.

637
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:23,059
What if we just try out damage?

638
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:24,919
Let's just try it out.

639
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,720
And that's exactly what we did.

640
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,441
His arrows actually did damage.

641
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:32,202
He can use his knife to regenerate his arrows.

642
00:29:32,202 --> 00:29:37,004
We also added some kind of risk factor to see if it's interesting to use it.

643
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,431
And this video is Atreus just using his knife as a melee weapon.

644
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:46,892
And it's not showing his arrows being regenerated,

645
00:29:46,892 --> 00:29:49,253
but the arrows and the knife kind of operate the same way.

646
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:52,554
You shoot or you stab somebody, and then something will happen.

647
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:56,955
So you see right there, he actually killed the guy on the ground there.

648
00:29:56,955 --> 00:30:00,216
And then when he does an action, he just knocked the guy on the right.

649
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:03,697
But then he killed the guy on the left.

650
00:30:03,697 --> 00:30:05,458
So we're like, what? What's going on?

651
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:13,037
So the issue at hand were, you know, the results were very random looking, you know.

652
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:18,700
If the enemy had like, you know, full HP and then you use a Trace, he'll probably knock

653
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,560
him down.

654
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,601
But if the enemy's low on health and you use a Trace, he'll immediately kill him.

655
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:24,062
So it looked very random.

656
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:28,408
Second of all, when you're actually trying to use Atreus,

657
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:31,511
that risk layer we added was just not engaging at all.

658
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:33,333
When you're fighting multiple enemies

659
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,114
and your focus is constantly changing,

660
00:30:35,114 --> 00:30:37,616
if you happen to press the sun button

661
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:39,718
and he actually gets knocked down or something like that,

662
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:41,800
you no longer want to use the sun.

663
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,502
So that risk layer was already a bad idea.

664
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:45,943
And lastly, there was no synergy.

665
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:49,365
These two systems, like the regenerating of the arrows

666
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:53,627
and killing enemies and the hero actually doing damage,

667
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:56,108
they kind of live separately on their own.

668
00:30:56,108 --> 00:30:58,349
So they weren't even talking to each other.

669
00:30:58,349 --> 00:30:59,690
So that was all bad.

670
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:05,197
So the first two points of it being looking random

671
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,759
and the risk layer being bad,

672
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:08,481
we're like, okay, we can't do anything with that,

673
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:10,263
but let's remove that.

674
00:31:10,263 --> 00:31:12,645
But let's try to focus on maybe promoting

675
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:14,547
some kind of teamwork with this mechanic.

676
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:16,769
So we came up with a tagging mechanic

677
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:18,491
where you shoot an arrow at an enemy,

678
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:21,935
they get tagged, and then you could detonate it

679
00:31:21,935 --> 00:31:22,936
using your shield.

680
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:28,426
And to do that, you have to press L2 twice, or L1 twice,

681
00:31:28,426 --> 00:31:31,147
to actually detonate the charge.

682
00:31:31,147 --> 00:31:34,469
And when you detonate it, the enemies actually fly back.

683
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:36,050
It's no longer going to do a lot of damage.

684
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,772
It causes a really good reaction.

685
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:41,274
So it looks good, but the mechanic

686
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,435
was hidden behind the L1 button.

687
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,997
And most people didn't even engage in it.

688
00:31:45,997 --> 00:31:49,719
So we're like, OK, so what if any hit causes this explosion?

689
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,760
Let it detonate, right?

690
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:54,721
Well, if you do that, like in this clip right now,

691
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:56,622
he throws the axe and the enemy gets thrown back.

692
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:57,383
That's really disruptive.

693
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:59,465
You know, if you tag an enemy

694
00:31:59,465 --> 00:32:01,786
and you wanna launch an enemy in the air,

695
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:02,647
you know, what's gonna happen?

696
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:03,988
Is he gonna go up in the air

697
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,549
or if he's gonna fly back, who knows?

698
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,130
Like now we're like destroying the hierarchy

699
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,992
of the reaction, it's just all bad news.

700
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:13,955
Plus, this also discouraged me from using Atreus

701
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:14,856
when comboing enemies.

702
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:15,957
So if I'm like hitting guys

703
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:18,819
and I wanna keep arrows being pelted on the enemy,

704
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:20,500
the next hit's gonna send him flying.

705
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,881
So this was a terrible idea.

706
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,705
So it was really back to a drawing board.

707
00:32:25,705 --> 00:32:27,366
And honestly, at this point, I was like,

708
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:28,347
I don't know what I'm doing.

709
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,589
I'm just gonna just keep the thing how it is

710
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:32,270
and let the system kind of stew for a bit.

711
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,772
And we just kind of waited it out and see what happened.

712
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:38,214
And key things happened that made me want to work

713
00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:39,494
on the directed actions.

714
00:32:39,494 --> 00:32:44,438
And they are, player mechanics were finalized.

715
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:45,699
The player didn't change as much.

716
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:47,560
There were a lot more constants to work with.

717
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,882
So it was a lot easier to frame how to support Kratos.

718
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:56,883
Second, UI came on board about one year before ship.

719
00:32:56,883 --> 00:33:00,247
So finally saw health, we finally saw status meters.

720
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:02,690
Our creators can now feed into those meters,

721
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,210
which was great.

722
00:33:04,687 --> 00:33:06,508
and we got the stun system on board.

723
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:08,549
This was like the best thing ever

724
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:11,371
because now Atreus can apply stun

725
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:14,053
and allow players to just rip enemies in half.

726
00:33:14,053 --> 00:33:17,975
He wasn't really competing with Kratos

727
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:20,597
because the stun system just allows players

728
00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:22,758
to live Kratos' power fantasy.

729
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:25,500
So just because Atreus can apply more stun was okay.

730
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,263
And finally, while we were working on autonomous behaviors,

731
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:32,704
we found out that distracting enemies

732
00:33:32,704 --> 00:33:33,405
wasn't really...

733
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:37,292
It was really helpful.

734
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,933
So, you know, I got all the ideas

735
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:42,694
and just kind of like mashed it together

736
00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:44,894
and I kind of created the Runic Arrows.

737
00:33:44,894 --> 00:33:48,815
So the first reason why you want to use Runic Arrows

738
00:33:48,815 --> 00:33:52,956
is because it applies stun and it pulls enemies aggro away,

739
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:53,917
which was very helpful.

740
00:33:56,332 --> 00:34:01,214
The secondary reason is to apply damage and also apply status effects.

741
00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:04,116
So if you want to shock enemies and hold them in place, you would do that.

742
00:34:04,116 --> 00:34:08,398
And the more nuanced reason why you would want to use it is so that you can extend your

743
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:08,978
combo.

744
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:12,380
So if you launch an enemy, you can kind of keep shooting at them, extending them, the

745
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,321
combo and whatever.

746
00:34:14,229 --> 00:34:16,512
And also, when you actually did that,

747
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,814
the enemy's backside will be turned

748
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:21,080
because remember how Trace will now be behind your target?

749
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,103
If you actually pull the enemy's attention,

750
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,926
their backside will be turned against you.

751
00:34:24,926 --> 00:34:27,491
So now, hitting them in their back

752
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:28,632
was very, very beneficial.

753
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,783
So these mechanics were actually very good,

754
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:33,285
and then we had to also make sure

755
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:36,029
that using this was really intuitive.

756
00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:38,212
So when you actually pulled aim using the L2,

757
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:40,916
the arrows needed to hit the reticle.

758
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:43,239
We ensure that it goes through environments,

759
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,663
make sure that the arrows actually hit the reticle.

760
00:34:47,557 --> 00:34:49,718
And if you aren't using the reticle,

761
00:34:49,718 --> 00:34:52,681
we just guess who we think the best target is.

762
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:55,684
Some targets have higher priority

763
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:59,847
because enemies like the revenants or the nightmares,

764
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,710
most people tend to use the arrows to defeat them,

765
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,871
so we prioritize them higher.

766
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:10,646
And this was good, but balancing these arrows

767
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:12,127
was actually a big issue.

768
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:15,130
People didn't realize that you can actually

769
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,753
be performing an action, and Atreus can also

770
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:19,815
be performing an action together with you.

771
00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:22,297
So you can be attacking, just mash your square button,

772
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:23,879
and Atreus can also attack.

773
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:26,582
Even when you're getting hit, you can also mash that button.

774
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,383
It'd interrupt the enemy.

775
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:31,466
And not only that, these arrows would constantly

776
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:32,207
interrupt enemies.

777
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,791
And top it off, Corey, our director,

778
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:41,032
wanted to spam Trader's Arrows as fast as possible.

779
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:42,692
So that just exasperated the issue.

780
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:44,513
So how we dealt with that?

781
00:35:44,513 --> 00:35:47,714
We limited the rate of fire of the arrows

782
00:35:47,714 --> 00:35:50,654
and limited the ammo count, which is pretty easy, I guess.

783
00:35:50,654 --> 00:35:53,135
But the other thing I also did was

784
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:55,496
I actually slowed down the rate of fire

785
00:35:55,496 --> 00:35:58,377
like one frame every week without it getting noticed.

786
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:02,358
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

787
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:03,478
I'm a jerk, what can I say?

788
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:05,538
Yeah, and Corey would ask me,

789
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,339
did you slow down the rate of fire?

790
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,359
I'll just chalk it up to a bad frame rate,

791
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,999
who knows, like I can't tell.

792
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:12,440
So he probably knew, but whatever.

793
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,800
But the main thing was that,

794
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,160
you know, it was about adding

795
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,061
these key invulnerabilities to enemies.

796
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:20,181
So if the enemy is about to do

797
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:22,061
like a really, you know, signature attack,

798
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:23,362
we made sure that can't be interrupted.

799
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:24,302
Otherwise, we would just

800
00:36:24,302 --> 00:36:26,402
completely trivialize the enemies.

801
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,901
and my favorite thing, the runic summons.

802
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:35,222
And just like Kratos, Trades can perform

803
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:37,263
these special runic attacks.

804
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:41,024
And this was actually added probably towards

805
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:43,365
the end of alpha and beginning of beta

806
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:45,326
when we were feature complete.

807
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:48,027
So me and a couple of people that didn't care

808
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:49,107
about job security, we were like,

809
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,388
all right, let's just check this in

810
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:52,328
because it's really cool.

811
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:53,749
And it turned out pretty good.

812
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:54,749
It actually fit into

813
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:02,448
Tracer's fantasy, summoning animals, talking to animals, and it was great.

814
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:03,989
It was a production problem after that.

815
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:10,711
So putting it all together, the main thing is player commands, the square button, it

816
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:12,371
needs to just interrupt everything.

817
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:15,252
That is the main thing we have to keep in mind.

818
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:19,734
Number two is making sure his autonomous behavior, like when you trip an enemy or you launch

819
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:21,454
an enemy, he can follow up reliably.

820
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:22,955
That makes him feel like a good teammate.

821
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,371
And lastly, this behavior where he's actually just doing

822
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,131
something on his own, like bumping into enemies.

823
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:32,512
He will apply, you know, he'll swing his bow,

824
00:37:32,512 --> 00:37:34,952
apply some stun, he'll cause some happy accidents.

825
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,873
Those were actually important because every fight

826
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:41,274
will now no longer feel like the same.

827
00:37:41,274 --> 00:37:43,234
So that was actually very useful.

828
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:46,495
And I wanted to just kind of dive a little bit

829
00:37:46,495 --> 00:37:49,496
into some of the additional systems

830
00:37:49,496 --> 00:37:50,416
Atreus kind of dealt with.

831
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:51,076
So death.

832
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:59,475
no death. We wanted to follow the core pillars of Atreus. We didn't want to babysit Atreus

833
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:06,700
so we made sure he can't die. And if you were a bad parent, I mean if you were a bad player,

834
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,043
you might just leave Atreus on the ground. You're like, okay, I don't care. I don't care

835
00:38:10,043 --> 00:38:14,546
if he's incapacitated. That was okay. If you didn't want to help Atreus, that was fine.

836
00:38:14,546 --> 00:38:15,546
So we were okay with that.

837
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:20,767
Second thing was player customization.

838
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:23,748
Early concept, people wanted to teach Atreus

839
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:26,509
through actions, like, oh, I'm gonna teach my boy

840
00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:29,450
not to attack, or be, whatever, right?

841
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,111
That was a really bad concept, but we just made sure

842
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:36,072
that you're allowed to customize Atreus

843
00:38:36,072 --> 00:38:38,273
through gear and skill tree.

844
00:38:38,273 --> 00:38:40,854
So if you wanted Atreus to become a heal bot,

845
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:42,794
or if you wanted to be a nice sharpshooter,

846
00:38:42,794 --> 00:38:44,655
or he's good at applying stun,

847
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,915
you can all do that through gear.

848
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:52,103
And the skill tree, we, or I worked backwards on that.

849
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:54,988
So after Trace was done, I just took what was cool

850
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:56,991
about Trace and just shoved it into the skill tree.

851
00:38:56,991 --> 00:38:58,894
I'm like, ah, this looks kind of good.

852
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:00,236
That was how I worked.

853
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:01,759
And honestly,

854
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,047
The resources used to upgrade the skill tree and the gear, I made sure that there's an

855
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:12,713
aspect of sacrificing your own improvement for your child, you know?

856
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:16,918
So your resources, you have to sacrifice to see your child grow up, you know?

857
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:19,381
It's like a reoccurring theme in parenthood or something.

858
00:39:19,381 --> 00:39:19,701
I don't know.

859
00:39:19,701 --> 00:39:19,961
That's...

860
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:21,442
That's what I heard.

861
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,522
So we actually put that in.

862
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:24,803
And then the last thing is, you know,

863
00:39:24,803 --> 00:39:28,685
these behavior nodes that were really strong,

864
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:31,145
so all the autonomous behavior he did,

865
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,086
we made it so that it's easy unlocked.

866
00:39:33,086 --> 00:39:35,547
So the moment you spend a little bit of points

867
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:38,108
or some points into a trace, you saw a massive gain.

868
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,429
And we have to make sure that the moment, you know,

869
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:42,269
you invest in a trace, you feel like it was worth it.

870
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:43,229
So there are a couple of key takeaways here.

871
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:53,896
Number one, Atreus is really like an AI mechanic,

872
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:56,377
and we had to make sure that using him

873
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,878
was really easy to perform.

874
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:02,320
You just mash the square button, and he does the shots.

875
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,201
And also, for people that are advanced,

876
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:07,343
I talked about earlier where you can combo your attacks in,

877
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:08,783
stuff like that, we had to make sure

878
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:09,744
that was actually in there.

879
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,903
But the true skill is teamwork.

880
00:40:14,903 --> 00:40:18,045
If you actually pay attention to Atreus,

881
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:19,366
you know, Atreus is always paying attention

882
00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:21,787
to your actions, but if you actually pay attention

883
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:24,549
to Atreus, what he's doing, and you become

884
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:26,150
a better teammate for Atreus,

885
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,691
that's when the true teamwork happens.

886
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,012
So, if Atreus is running towards an enemy,

887
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:31,553
and you know he's gonna trip him,

888
00:40:31,553 --> 00:40:33,554
you can land a cleave with the greatest of ease.

889
00:40:33,554 --> 00:40:35,475
You're like, oh, that was so easy.

890
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:39,178
When both you and Atreus kind of play off of each other,

891
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:39,818
that's when.

892
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:44,181
the true teamwork shines, and that's when I get to cry

893
00:40:44,181 --> 00:40:46,202
because it's so beautiful.

894
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:48,224
And the main thing is the intentionality

895
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:49,805
of both players are aligned.

896
00:40:49,805 --> 00:40:52,387
And this was interesting, narrative.

897
00:40:52,387 --> 00:40:56,189
So this was kind of hard for me to do something

898
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:58,511
because at the beginning of the game,

899
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:00,932
Atreus can't be this crazy killer, right?

900
00:41:00,932 --> 00:41:04,295
He needs to be kind of a little bit weaker.

901
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,817
So all of his autonomous behaviors were kind of,

902
00:41:08,497 --> 00:41:09,318
it was kind of stopped.

903
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:11,079
So the only useful thing about Trace

904
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,140
was using the square button.

905
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,121
So at the risk of making a trace feel kind of weak

906
00:41:15,121 --> 00:41:18,503
and kind of useless, we have to do that to fit narratively.

907
00:41:18,503 --> 00:41:20,144
And towards the end of the game,

908
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,067
we have to make sure that Trace kind of just becomes a jerk

909
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:25,908
and he doesn't follow your directions anymore.

910
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:28,549
So if you press square button, he doesn't do it.

911
00:41:28,549 --> 00:41:31,311
It feels like a really bad companion AI.

912
00:41:31,311 --> 00:41:33,752
But narratively, it all made sense.

913
00:41:34,554 --> 00:41:39,055
And this was a really big takeaway for me.

914
00:41:39,055 --> 00:41:43,116
I like to go on YouTube and watch reaction videos

915
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:45,357
of things happening, because I'm like that.

916
00:41:45,357 --> 00:41:49,257
And then I would see people fight the last fight

917
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,858
with the stranger.

918
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:53,298
And you would see Atreus do all these crazy things.

919
00:41:53,298 --> 00:41:54,839
He's doing these backflips.

920
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,299
He's shooting arrows in the air.

921
00:41:56,299 --> 00:41:59,160
And he's summoning snakes and stuff like that.

922
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,920
And people were like, yes, that's

923
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,300
my boy doing all that stuff.

924
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,281
And the people were actually proud of Atreus.

925
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:05,402
You know?

926
00:42:05,402 --> 00:42:11,186
So like, all the investments they made, it culminated into this cinematic moment where

927
00:42:11,186 --> 00:42:15,290
they're like, oh yeah, that's so cool, I invested so much into him, he's doing all these things.

928
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,151
And when people saw...

929
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:21,465
when people saw the growth narratively

930
00:42:21,465 --> 00:42:23,746
and in actual gameplay.

931
00:42:23,746 --> 00:42:26,047
And when Atreus did all those things in the cinematic,

932
00:42:26,047 --> 00:42:27,608
people weren't like, oh, what is he doing?

933
00:42:27,608 --> 00:42:28,288
Why is he doing that?

934
00:42:28,288 --> 00:42:30,750
People were actually like, yes, he's doing that

935
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,911
because I taught him to do all those things.

936
00:42:32,911 --> 00:42:35,432
And when he did that, the game actually felt

937
00:42:35,432 --> 00:42:38,353
more cohesive, and it was really good.

938
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:42,875
And obviously, we were reimagining the game,

939
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:45,516
combat changed frequently, so we have to be pretty agile.

940
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:51,153
Old ideas became relevant really often, and vice versa.

941
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:53,455
And we had to make sure that all the scripts and all the

942
00:42:53,455 --> 00:42:54,836
ideas were very modular.

943
00:42:54,836 --> 00:42:57,578
You can actually copy and paste and just remove all

944
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:59,599
these ideas so that you can actually

945
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,461
iterate a lot quicker.

946
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:06,532
And final thing, combating doubt,

947
00:43:06,532 --> 00:43:10,594
the pretty much the final boss of every game development,

948
00:43:10,594 --> 00:43:10,794
I think.

949
00:43:10,794 --> 00:43:14,356
It's getting the right people to believe in your systems

950
00:43:14,356 --> 00:43:16,957
really, really crucial.

951
00:43:16,957 --> 00:43:20,638
Because during development, a lot of people

952
00:43:20,638 --> 00:43:23,039
ask me, so when is Atreus going to be cut?

953
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:23,360
Ha, ha, ha.

954
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,560
I'm like, oh, that's really funny.

955
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,161
And that's like a constant, constant thing

956
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:27,842
I have to deal with.

957
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,077
And I even had some people in higher positions say,

958
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:35,460
oh, if Atreus gets kind of cut, here's the exit plan

959
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,282
and stuff like that.

960
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:37,444
I'm like, okay, thanks.

961
00:43:37,444 --> 00:43:39,827
So much confidence in me, thanks.

962
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:42,672
But honestly, rallying the right people to garner support

963
00:43:42,672 --> 00:43:43,994
is the most important thing.

964
00:43:44,114 --> 00:43:47,856
Because when you do that, people start to stay late with me

965
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:50,137
and play tests and give me feedback.

966
00:43:50,137 --> 00:43:53,358
They will create assets for me to prove out an idea.

967
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:56,920
And this is true for all game systems, obviously.

968
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,142
But when there's so much doubt in the future,

969
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:02,303
having these key people to help you out

970
00:44:02,303 --> 00:44:05,124
was really, really helpful.

971
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:08,966
So doing all that, how well did Atreus do?

972
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:15,756
IGN said, yeah, Atreus's impact cannot be understated.

973
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:18,838
He's both an asset to the story and in battle, thanks.

974
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:22,041
GQ was like, yeah, my biggest takeaway

975
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:25,163
from the New God Award is that a developer

976
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,025
has finally cracked how an AI companion

977
00:44:27,025 --> 00:44:29,246
can be the best part of a video game.

978
00:44:29,246 --> 00:44:31,188
It only took 20 odd years to do it.

979
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:32,269
Thanks GQ, thanks.

980
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,651
But my, oh no, stop, no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait.

981
00:44:35,651 --> 00:44:37,112
No, that's not the punchline, no.

982
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:43,431
Now, the best quote is from Rice, Bean, and Cheese from a Reddit thread.

983
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,773
And he says, the boy is one of the better AI companions in video games.

984
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:48,113
Thanks, Rice, Bean, and Cheese.

985
00:44:48,113 --> 00:44:50,895
And really, this was a team effort.

986
00:44:50,895 --> 00:44:54,337
Everything from cinematics and behaviors outside of combat

987
00:44:54,337 --> 00:44:57,178
helped realize who Atreus is.

988
00:44:57,178 --> 00:44:58,519
And, you know, that was it.

989
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:00,720
So thank you. That's it.

990
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,703
Thank you for coming to this talk.

991
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:05,443
No, no, please.

992
00:45:05,443 --> 00:45:06,444
Ah, yeah, yeah.

993
00:45:06,444 --> 00:45:07,584
Ah, yeah, yeah.

994
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:11,630
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

995
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,230
Sorry, yeah, yeah, sorry.

996
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,192
Sorry, there's a little bit more, sorry.

997
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:18,333
The slides are terrible, I'm sorry.

998
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:23,656
So tomorrow, you can check out Mihir's talk about evolving God of War combat.

999
00:45:23,656 --> 00:45:31,480
If you want to take a closer look at what we did in combat, go check that out.

1000
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,682
And now I will distract you guys with this video as I take a Q&A session,

1001
00:45:34,682 --> 00:45:35,342
so no questions will be asked.

1002
00:45:35,342 --> 00:45:37,123
All right.

1003
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:45,570
Please.

1004
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,133
I can't see him.

1005
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:49,438
No one's going to ask me a question?

1006
00:45:49,438 --> 00:45:49,578
Sweet.

1007
00:45:49,578 --> 00:45:51,923
These are all prototype videos.

1008
00:45:55,992 --> 00:45:57,634
Yes.

1009
00:45:57,634 --> 00:46:03,440
So you mentioned that Atreus responds to what hit reaction you cause on an opponent.

1010
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:11,348
I was just wondering under the hood if Atreus looks at which attack the player uses or if

1011
00:46:11,348 --> 00:46:16,333
it looks at the targeted opponent, which state they're in.

1012
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:16,773
Sorry, sorry.

1013
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,835
Can you repeat that again?

1014
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:26,864
So I was curious, you mentioned that Atreus looks at, behaves differently based on which hit reaction the targeted opponent's using.

1015
00:46:26,864 --> 00:46:27,244
Yes.

1016
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:38,071
I was wondering if it looks at which attack the player's currently using, and whether or not it hit, or if it takes a look at the opponent's state.

1017
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:45,196
Right, so the question is, when Atreus decides to attack, does Atreus look at the enemy's state or what the player's doing?

1018
00:46:45,196 --> 00:46:48,918
We actually look at the enemy's state, because depending on what the player does...

1019
00:46:49,814 --> 00:46:53,558
His power level and whatever could be completely different.

1020
00:46:53,558 --> 00:46:54,980
So calculating that we couldn't do.

1021
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,983
So we based it off of the reactions.

1022
00:46:57,983 --> 00:47:00,806
So if an enemy were to play a reaction

1023
00:47:00,806 --> 00:47:03,609
that might be, you know, we don't want to disrupt it,

1024
00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:05,431
Atreus will still perform an attack,

1025
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:06,912
but it wouldn't cause any reaction.

1026
00:47:06,912 --> 00:47:09,435
So we would preserve that reaction.

1027
00:47:09,435 --> 00:47:10,056
Oh, okay, okay, thanks.

1028
00:47:10,056 --> 00:47:10,136
Yeah.

1029
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:21,644
Hey, you mentioned a few times how important it was for you guys to have that feeling that whenever you press square something happens and your companion is doing things.

1030
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:26,546
How did you deal with all the aspects where it was impossible for the gameplay reasons?

1031
00:47:26,546 --> 00:47:32,429
So either he was out of ammo or he was visibly occluded towards the target so he couldn't take a shot.

1032
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:38,872
Did you have situations like that and how did you feedback that to the player that he knows that something is going on but it's wrong?

1033
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:45,897
Right, so the question is, we wanted to retain the square button to be very reactive, but

1034
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:49,819
sometimes it's not reactive because Atreus is in trouble and stuff like that.

1035
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:50,879
How do we deal with that?

1036
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:53,700
Yeah, that's a very good question.

1037
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:59,422
So when he can't shoot the arrows, there were actually very limited reasons why he couldn't.

1038
00:47:59,422 --> 00:48:04,844
Number one is if he's actually incapacitated, that was actually the player's fault for making

1039
00:48:04,844 --> 00:48:07,345
that happen, so we were okay with the arrows not responding to that.

1040
00:48:08,326 --> 00:48:11,307
With the arrows, him actually running out of arrows, he just says,

1041
00:48:11,307 --> 00:48:18,211
I'm out of arrows constantly. Maybe it's not the best way, but he just vocally tells you that he's out of arrows.

1042
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:21,593
Yeah, aside from that it wasn't really...

1043
00:48:21,593 --> 00:48:22,954
Yeah, I think that's about it actually.

1044
00:48:22,954 --> 00:48:27,256
So you didn't run into trouble of him not seeing the target that you're pressing the square if?

1045
00:48:27,256 --> 00:48:32,739
Because I can easily imagine him being behind a tree visibly and being able to reach the target that you're trying to attack.

1046
00:48:32,879 --> 00:48:36,805
Yeah, so the question is, you know, what if Atreus can't physically shoot at the target?

1047
00:48:36,805 --> 00:48:37,766
We just allowed it.

1048
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:41,392
Yeah, we just made sure the arrows actually goes through everything and hits the target.

1049
00:48:41,392 --> 00:48:41,913
Makes total sense.

1050
00:48:41,913 --> 00:48:41,993
Yep.

1051
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,081
I can't see, I'm so sorry.

1052
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:46,621
That's fine.

1053
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:47,602
So thank you again for doing this.

1054
00:48:47,602 --> 00:48:52,646
And I just had a quick question that I obviously know game

1055
00:48:52,646 --> 00:48:55,688
development is a very fluid process.

1056
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:59,071
But you mentioned a couple of times that you sort of started

1057
00:48:59,071 --> 00:49:02,654
out knowing that you wanted Atreus in the game.

1058
00:49:02,654 --> 00:49:05,536
And you mentioned a couple of times of people joking about

1059
00:49:05,536 --> 00:49:07,998
taking him out or things like that.

1060
00:49:07,998 --> 00:49:10,500
But that would have affected both the

1061
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,182
storyline and the combat.

1062
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,423
So sort of, it sort of.

1063
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,386
Maybe this is the wrong question, but what was,

1064
00:49:17,386 --> 00:49:21,209
how did Atreus fit into the initial vision of the game,

1065
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:23,031
and how much, can you tell us how much

1066
00:49:23,031 --> 00:49:25,693
it sort of evolved over time?

1067
00:49:25,693 --> 00:49:29,436
Well, I'm here to talk about the combat aspects.

1068
00:49:29,436 --> 00:49:31,678
You can talk to Corey about that, but yeah,

1069
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:33,940
I mean, from the onset of the game,

1070
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,322
we always wanted Atreus to kind of grow with his father

1071
00:49:37,322 --> 00:49:38,303
and kind of help you in a fight,

1072
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,805
so there was always an aspect of that.

1073
00:49:40,805 --> 00:49:43,007
But like you said, oh sorry, the question was,

1074
00:49:44,268 --> 00:49:46,269
What was the vision of Atreus?

1075
00:49:46,269 --> 00:49:48,750
And we were always talking about cutting Atreus,

1076
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,630
so how do we deal with that?

1077
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:53,552
Yeah, so the vision, we always want Atreus

1078
00:49:53,552 --> 00:49:55,313
to kind of grow with you and stuff,

1079
00:49:55,313 --> 00:49:58,035
so that was always there, but the combat aspect,

1080
00:49:58,035 --> 00:49:59,776
we were like, okay, maybe it's okay

1081
00:49:59,776 --> 00:50:02,077
to actually remove the combat aspect

1082
00:50:02,077 --> 00:50:05,558
and let Atreus kind of be like a set narrative piece

1083
00:50:05,558 --> 00:50:07,339
to fulfill the father and son relationship.

1084
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:10,621
So we had a backup plan, which I never wanted to do,

1085
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:12,362
but we had backup plans, yeah.

1086
00:50:12,362 --> 00:50:13,162
Thank you.

1087
00:50:15,003 --> 00:50:20,008
Guess me. Uh, hey, so when you were dealing with the warping of

1088
00:50:20,008 --> 00:50:23,991
The child around did you ever have to worry about the time it took for him to warp?

1089
00:50:23,991 --> 00:50:25,953
Like oh, I saw him really far to my right

1090
00:50:25,953 --> 00:50:31,578
I'm gonna fight enemy left and then he just all sudden appeared instantly and you wanted did more to take like yeah

1091
00:50:31,578 --> 00:50:37,964
I think or two instead of instant. Yeah. So the question is do we care about the realism of teleporting from far away to close?

1092
00:50:37,964 --> 00:50:38,725
Yeah, I didn't care

1093
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:41,006
Like I was like, I'm just gonna, I'm teleporting immediately.

1094
00:50:41,006 --> 00:50:42,586
Because first and foremost,

1095
00:50:42,586 --> 00:50:44,327
if a trace becomes really unreliable,

1096
00:50:44,327 --> 00:50:48,429
you kind of don't want to use a trace as much.

1097
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:50,790
So make sure the reliability is key

1098
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,530
and realism is kind of just down there.

1099
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:52,871
Okay.

1100
00:50:52,871 --> 00:50:53,031
Yeah.

1101
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:53,851
Thanks.

1102
00:50:55,622 --> 00:50:59,584
Hello, yeah, so thank you for the chat, it was pretty good.

1103
00:50:59,584 --> 00:51:03,767
So I was wondering, how was the,

1104
00:51:03,767 --> 00:51:05,589
how did you use a scripting language

1105
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:07,770
or something to do all this, or?

1106
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,232
Yes, the question is, do we use a scripting language?

1107
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:12,914
Interesting enough, we actually got a real scripting

1108
00:51:12,914 --> 00:51:17,457
language, Lua, probably, hmm, maybe a year and a half

1109
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:18,618
into development, yeah.

1110
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:20,679
So before that, we didn't have anything like that.

1111
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:20,939
Cool.

1112
00:51:20,939 --> 00:51:21,239
Thanks. Yeah.

1113
00:51:26,438 --> 00:51:30,499
Hi. My question's about how in a lot of the cinematic moments,

1114
00:51:30,499 --> 00:51:34,260
particularly near the end, the camera plays over and swaps

1115
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,340
between Kratos and Atreus as they're swapping through,

1116
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,601
particularly fighting the stranger on,

1117
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:41,121
I can't pronounce it, the big snake at the end.

1118
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:45,642
But were there thoughts as it was developing through combat

1119
00:51:45,642 --> 00:51:48,383
of having the camera emphasize Atreus' actions and kind

1120
00:51:48,383 --> 00:51:50,463
of moving over the shoulder with him?

1121
00:51:50,463 --> 00:51:53,183
Or was it always locked behind in this third-person perspective?

1122
00:51:53,513 --> 00:51:57,895
Well speaking of camera, I mean here we'll talk all about camera stuff, but

1123
00:51:57,895 --> 00:52:01,355
you know, if you're actually playing the game and the camera just takes over

1124
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:05,817
like without kind of like you knowing, it's very disruptive as well. So

1125
00:52:05,817 --> 00:52:09,878
yeah, we never, I mean we entertained the idea early on but we were like, no this is

1126
00:52:09,878 --> 00:52:14,279
terrible idea, we don't want to, you know, focus on what Atreus is doing during combat because

1127
00:52:14,279 --> 00:52:17,940
you know, if we did that, you know, player can be hit out of it and stuff like that. So there's a

1128
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,220
lot of issues with that, so we didn't go with it. Okay, thank you. Yep.

1129
00:52:21,985 --> 00:52:27,066
Hi, my question is I'm curious about the design process

1130
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:29,927
of individual resolution.

1131
00:52:29,927 --> 00:52:34,968
Since I've noticed that most of your design pillars,

1132
00:52:34,968 --> 00:52:38,629
core pillars are more like constraints,

1133
00:52:38,629 --> 00:52:41,229
like no death and no babysitting.

1134
00:52:41,229 --> 00:52:46,191
So how do you find a idea to start a prototype

1135
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:46,871
and play test?

1136
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:53,272
Right, so the question was, how do we prototype things when the core pillars seem like more

1137
00:52:53,272 --> 00:52:53,992
like restrictions?

1138
00:52:53,992 --> 00:52:58,274
I mean, there are like guidelines of how we want...

1139
00:52:58,274 --> 00:53:02,575
So honestly, when we're prototyping, we had restrictions of, you know, Atreus can't do

1140
00:53:02,575 --> 00:53:03,856
these crazy things, right?

1141
00:53:03,856 --> 00:53:09,858
But the main thing was, when we're prototyping, we wanted to make sure Atreus is a good teammate.

1142
00:53:09,858 --> 00:53:14,020
And as long as he's a good teammate and follows core pillars, we were okay with any type of

1143
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:14,500
prototype.

1144
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,701
So that was kind of like the basis of how we went with...

1145
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:19,143
you know, all the testing and stuff.

1146
00:53:19,143 --> 00:53:21,305
So I'm not sure if that answers your question.

1147
00:53:21,305 --> 00:53:23,447
Is the picture still on your desk?

1148
00:53:23,447 --> 00:53:24,588
Yes.

1149
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:31,635
I don't even have a picture of my wife.

1150
00:53:31,635 --> 00:53:34,197
Yeah.

1151
00:53:34,197 --> 00:53:34,798
I suck.

1152
00:53:38,657 --> 00:53:43,187
All right, so how do you make sure that Atreus is helpful

1153
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:46,054
at the beginning of the game before you get all the upgrades

1154
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:47,056
versus towards the end?

1155
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:51,085
Yeah, so the question is, how do we make sure Trace is useful at the beginning of the game

1156
00:53:51,085 --> 00:53:52,527
without getting all the upgrades?

1157
00:53:52,527 --> 00:54:00,274
So you know how at the hierarchy I listed initially about him, the commanded actions

1158
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:01,736
being very useful?

1159
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:02,777
We just did that.

1160
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:08,322
So even as a base level, if you just spam square, there's a level of use that's actually

1161
00:54:08,322 --> 00:54:08,802
helpful.

1162
00:54:08,802 --> 00:54:12,406
So he applied stuns, you can now grab the enemy, pulls the enemy away.

1163
00:54:12,406 --> 00:54:12,766
So yeah.

1164
00:54:13,207 --> 00:54:19,994
you know, we just pretty much banked on that mechanic and it worked out pretty well.

1165
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:27,522
Hi, so this video reminds me of one thing which used to be talked about among Chinese players.

1166
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:34,690
Do you know the game actually among our players have another name as the god of war and his old father?

1167
00:54:35,532 --> 00:54:39,314
So the reason why is when, for as a player,

1168
00:54:39,314 --> 00:54:41,595
when they play the game, they will feel,

1169
00:54:41,595 --> 00:54:44,597
okay, so archers will die and they can,

1170
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:46,738
and he can cause high damage.

1171
00:54:46,738 --> 00:54:50,240
So my question is, have you considered about

1172
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,961
keep the, to balance the damage caused

1173
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:54,442
between the critters and the archers?

1174
00:54:55,638 --> 00:54:57,300
So you're saying, sorry, the question is,

1175
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,125
how we considered balance and damage

1176
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,026
based off of what, sorry?

1177
00:55:02,026 --> 00:55:04,449
Yeah, so the balance, the damage caused

1178
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:05,891
between these two characters.

1179
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:10,712
Oh yeah, so the question is how do we balance the damage of induced characters?

1180
00:55:10,712 --> 00:55:13,213
Yeah, Atreus actually doesn't do much damage.

1181
00:55:13,213 --> 00:55:15,614
His arrows actually do very little damage.

1182
00:55:15,614 --> 00:55:20,595
The only time he actually does damage is if you actually gear him to actually do that.

1183
00:55:20,595 --> 00:55:26,017
Atreus never should have taken away the player's spotlight, the power fantasy.

1184
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:30,818
We just ensure that Atreus will always support the player in killing the enemy quicker.

1185
00:55:30,818 --> 00:55:31,378
So that was it.

1186
00:55:31,987 --> 00:55:40,572
Oh, yeah. So in the boss fighting, so when I was playing the boss fight with Valkyries,

1187
00:55:40,572 --> 00:55:48,157
and I will keep pressing the sound button until the boss died, to maximize the damage of that.

1188
00:55:48,157 --> 00:55:58,624
So what you see is just to limit the sounds, limit the actual damage into the lower than the

1189
00:55:58,624 --> 00:55:59,345
creatures, right?

1190
00:56:00,627 --> 00:56:04,327
Yeah, so I guess the question is, do we lower the damage of Atreus' damage?

1191
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:04,988
Yeah.

1192
00:56:04,988 --> 00:56:07,808
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

1193
00:56:07,808 --> 00:56:12,729
Atreus, like, you know, even if you upgrade him a lot, he'll never surpass Kratos' damage.

1194
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:13,830
That's like the rule we set.

1195
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:17,431
So, you know, when we're balancing these things and you're fighting these Valkyries, we're

1196
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:23,152
like, okay, Atreus can do, you know, maybe six shots within this kind of time frame and

1197
00:56:23,152 --> 00:56:27,493
we know what his damage per second is, and we kind of balance his health and the toughness

1198
00:56:27,493 --> 00:56:28,093
and stuff like that.

1199
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,713
So that's kind of like the process we took.

1200
00:56:29,713 --> 00:56:29,773
So...

I don't know if that answers your question.

1202
00:56:32,853 --> 00:56:34,897
I'm sorry.

1203
00:56:34,897 --> 00:56:36,359
All right.

1204
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:36,880
I guess that's it.

1205
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,381
All right.

1206
00:56:37,381 --> 00:56:39,485
Thank you all for coming.
