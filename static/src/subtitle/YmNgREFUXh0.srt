1
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:12,831
How's everybody's GDC going so far? I'm having an awesome time. First time, so ridiculous.

2
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:24,076
Fun amount of buzz too. So I am here from Electronic Arts Burnaby campus where we developed FIFA

3
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:27,837
and basically talk about how we deliver content to users really fast.

4
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:30,278
Try to see if we can get rid of that buzz.

5
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:32,959
So let's go, yeah.

6
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:36,789
So live content is better.

7
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,330
It doesn't matter if you're going to monetize your game or not.

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,651
It doesn't matter if you've got plans right now to monetize or plans down the future to

9
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:46,771
monetize or no plans whatsoever.

10
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:52,692
Creating live content basically allows you to create an engagement to the users.

11
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,553
You create compelling content that actually draws the user in and they, like, want to

12
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:58,073
play your game.

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,161
What do I mean by live content? I'm not talking about game patches.

14
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:07,763
Game patches are things that will go out and make code changes and whatnot.

15
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:12,125
I'm possibly DLCs, but to me that's not really live.

16
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:16,147
That's basically in chunks. You're still having to go through the certification

17
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:19,849
flow on console and whatnot. What really I'm talking about is

18
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:24,191
in-game downloadable content that's released on a regular, continual basis.

19
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:27,792
Basically, it creates a compelling reason for the user to

20
00:01:27,852 --> 00:01:28,593
constantly come back.

21
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:34,403
Examples in the industry. So when I was looking, I was mainly looking for console

22
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:38,564
examples and there really aren't a lot of console examples for live content. There's tons of

23
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:44,546
stuff for PC. There's a ton of stuff for mobile. But for console, Call of Duty, again, DLC,

24
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:53,690
basically map packs, weapons. Forza, you can do car packs and also add-ons. Harmonix is

25
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,471
probably one of the best ones for actually doing live content because they're constantly

26
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,131
releasing new...

27
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:03,664
audio tracks from different band members and basically song

28
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:08,128
packs and whatnot. So all of this creates a reason for, again,

29
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:17,195
the user to kind of come back to the game. So how do we do it? Or

30
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:21,658
how do we as an industry want to do it? Basically first thing is

31
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:24,700
your game has to support it. Your game has to have a

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,402
framework or be a framework to actually be able to bring that

33
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,404
live content and display it to the user.

34
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:32,688
The live content has to be special.

35
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:35,613
It can't be just mundane little add-ons here and there.

36
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,679
It has to be something that the user actually wants to play,

37
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,562
something the user wants to engage with.

38
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:45,585
Content delivery is not equal to the game or server updates.

39
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:48,767
Basically, do not couple your content delivery system

40
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,369
to any sort of game updates or server updates.

41
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,512
If you do, you will slow your pace down

42
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:56,613
and you will not create a reason for the user

43
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,255
to come back on a regular basis,

44
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,376
because they'll be waiting weeks, months,

45
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:01,998
for that content to appear.

46
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,700
Use tools, not engineers.

47
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,063
Leave the engineers to solve the complex problems

48
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:10,284
that we all have to face.

49
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:15,641
Use tools. They can be set up to validate. They can be used to clean the data and make sure it's

50
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:22,647
correct. So FIFA live content. I'm going to quickly just show a video now just so you guys have an

51
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:30,353
idea. Some people probably know what we do on FIFA. Others might not. So I'm just going to...

52
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:38,458
Possible...

53
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,740
Possible is open!

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,521
Where is the door?

55
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:42,181
We need to play 4-4-2.

56
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:44,223
Attack is the best defense!

57
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:45,924
I love the team going non-stop!

58
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:10,307
Pass. Shoot. Score. Rule it. Lose it. Win big. Or win...something.

59
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,347
Make dreams come true.

60
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:14,388
Okay, not that dream.

61
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:16,228
This dream.

62
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:17,729
Sometimes be like...

63
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,789
Other times be all...

64
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,330
Show the world you have the ultimate team.

65
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:32,694
Build your ultimate team today. Put your game where your mouth is.

66
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:40,079
So that's basically what I'm talking about when I'm talking about FIFA Ultimate Team.

67
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:45,743
It's essentially an items based game where you basically purchase packs, build a team,

68
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:50,946
and compete against other people to get coins and that loop.

69
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:52,927
You're essentially...

70
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,055
Wanting people to be engaged in that loop and to basically constantly be buying it.

71
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,997
Wow. It's extended.

72
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:13,246
I'm just going to try something here.

73
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:15,507
Just give me a second.

74
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:38,613
Ah, there we go.

75
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:41,243
So what kind of content do we actually update?

76
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:46,395
So in a year, we're basically putting out 1,200 in-form players.

77
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:49,997
Those are basically players that have increased their stats,

78
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,601
have been in-form for that week or that month or year.

79
00:05:54,621 --> 00:06:01,026
2,000-plus player transfers, 100-plus tournaments, 40 seasons.

80
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:03,568
And seasons basically are made up of different divisions,

81
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:06,790
and you move up in the divisions as you compete and get points and wins.

82
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,333
100-plus pack offer promotions.

83
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,154
those are all tied in with the challenges, 150 different

84
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:18,577
challenges, 300 plus games of the week, 52 different match day

85
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:23,021
update drops, so basically transfers and other database

86
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:27,485
drops on match day. And then that is all kind of message to

87
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:31,209
the users, approximately 1,000 messaging banners and 21,000

88
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:31,409
lines of...

89
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:38,054
Localized text. So we're producing a lot of content in a year.

90
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:40,835
And we're pushing that out to users on a continual basis.

91
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:42,955
Pretty quick as well.

92
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:45,436
So player updates. We actually have Team of the Week,

93
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:48,377
which is players who have played really well that week.

94
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:52,658
Typically, Team of the Week, the producers will choose which players from the week.

95
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:02,344
They'll also give the community a chance to actually pick players as well, and typically one or two of the community picks will actually go into that team of the week for that week.

96
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:10,068
So the players will basically have different versions of their items, much like baseball cards will have different versions for really good plays and whatnot.

97
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:18,592
Team of the year and season, again at the end of the season or at the end of the year we also put out a whole batch of stuff.

98
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:25,134
So, team of the season, we release 18 to 36 new versions per week.

99
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:29,956
And then for the team of the year, we're releasing 11 players over the course of a week.

100
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,797
So every week, every day, we're releasing one or two players.

101
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:35,618
Just creates a lot of excitement in the game.

102
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,059
Basically high profile players and whatnot.

103
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,781
Man of the match, if someone did really well, they'll basically get selected.

104
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:45,682
Special versions are interesting.

105
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:47,363
Basically, it's...

106
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:53,064
versions of players that are like career high messi if he's made a special scores or what not.

107
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,965
We also have special items. Special items are interesting because they are actually

108
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:12,387
versions of the player that are not released to the market but are granted directly to

109
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:17,330
players that actually play our game. So professional players will show up and you can

110
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,572
match up against them and you will see that special version in the game and be like you're

111
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:25,814
actually matching up against that particular professional footballer. And then fut squad

112
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:31,577
updates. An example is Ronaldo here. Started out as a gold version. Basically had two team

113
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:32,837
of the week's released as well.

114
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:40,029
We had two Team of the Weeks released, we have a Team of the Year as well, so that was mid-year.

115
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,329
These are from 2014.

116
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:45,791
And then we've got a Man of the Match, so he had a spectacular game.

117
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,692
He basically just killed it, so we had an extra Man of the Match.

118
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:53,233
And at the end we actually had a World Cup, so during World Cup we were releasing special content.

119
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:58,675
The interesting thing about the World Cup one is that if you got that, it actually live updated.

120
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,857
So if he played really well, our stats changed on the actual item live.

121
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:05,258
So we were constantly updating that item.

122
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:10,096
And then basically you're getting a lot of people, the

123
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,138
community, buying into it. So this is an example of team of

124
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:16,081
the year messy. Team of the year Rinaldo basically getting

125
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:19,443
released. Someone was like yes, yes, just another version of

126
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:23,566
Rinaldo, never be able to afford. Team of the year

127
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:23,726
Rinaldo.

128
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:31,264
but don't know what chemistry style to use. So people are communicating and talking in the

129
00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:35,866
forums as to like how to actually use that particular item. The day when Ronaldo scores a hat

130
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:43,429
trick is one of the most horrible days for Sweden. But for Ronaldo, it was Tuesday. And then also

131
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:47,371
like haircut upgrade. This is for our World Cup. If you notice, he's got a different haircut

132
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:47,631
style.

133
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:53,116
So, yeah, we updated the hairstyle and the item and whatnot too.

134
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:57,220
Basically what we're trying to do is create massive community engagement.

135
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,342
We basically have the forums, Twitter.

136
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:02,666
We have third-party sites that actually link into our database

137
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,328
and show the various items and whatnot as well.

138
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:06,529
There's a lot of forums on that.

139
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,174
And people will actually engage and really get that excitement going for the actual week.

140
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:12,736
And they'll have a lot of communication.

141
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:15,597
Thousands and thousands of posts on those websites.

142
00:10:15,978 --> 00:10:18,259
Our own forum will have like tens of thousands of posts.

143
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,220
And if you ever want to like...

144
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,562
If a PAC promotion is happening and you go into Twitter and go to

145
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:28,084
at EA Sports FIFA, it's just a constant stream.

146
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:31,986
Like it's just crazy how much communication there is.

147
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:37,609
Speaking of PAC promotions, we don't discount. Ever.

148
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,831
So what we do is instead of discounting,

149
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:42,552
we actually...

150
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:49,177
create special versions of packs that have a higher probability of getting rare players

151
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:52,639
that have more value.

152
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,882
So we don't want to get into that whole we're discounting and then people only purchase

153
00:10:58,042 --> 00:10:59,043
at discount times.

154
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:03,906
We're really trying to just drive that economy and making sure that people purchase and see

155
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:07,327
value in what they're purchasing and it's not the Walmart sort of I'm only going to

156
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:08,888
buy it on blue light special sort of days.

157
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:16,335
You need to tell users what's new. Messaging is key. If the users don't know what is actually

158
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,076
being released and what's new and exciting, they're not going to engage because they have

159
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:27,719
no idea. And we, because we are a football game, we tie back to real world events. For example,

160
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:34,278
We've got transfers, Chinese New Year, team of the year when basically at the end of the

161
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:39,721
year we're releasing stuff and the best of MLS. So at the end of the MLS season we'll be

162
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:44,843
releasing these items as well. So basically trying to tie it in with real world stuff,

163
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:51,786
things that are like, you know, particularly important to users or to gamers. One of the

164
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:57,128
additional modes we have is challenges. These are actually really cool. Essentially they

165
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:57,448
are...

166
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,552
replay the game shortly after the game has been played.

167
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:05,332
So we basically will take a game that's played,

168
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:07,413
we'll set up a situation where you may be

169
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:10,994
20 minutes into the first, two points down,

170
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:14,755
and your job is to score three and change history.

171
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,556
And it would be some major match that's happened that week.

172
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:21,597
This basically involves artwork, localization,

173
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:24,958
tons of data coming in from our data teams

174
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:26,278
to basically set up that match.

175
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,134
we can actually set this particular one was set up in 45 minutes. So 45 minutes after the

176
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:37,839
actual game ended, we had it up, people were able to replay it, we had Chelsea, actually we

177
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:42,483
had a deal on with the games, with the clubs, whoever won, I think it was Chelsea that

178
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:51,791
actually won, actually was, whoever won basically tweeted out to their supporters to play the

179
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:52,031
match.

180
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:55,858
And then we were tweeting out within like minutes of the game

181
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,122
ending that it was going to be up. So again, drives a lot of

182
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:07,113
people into the game. So 45 minutes, promoted at halftime

183
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:09,396
and winning team promoted the challenge as well.

184
00:13:10,202 --> 00:13:14,026
And we actually, because of that, because of the promotions and the quick turnaround time,

185
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:17,029
we actually saw an 8% increase in users for challenges.

186
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:21,713
It was the first time we'd done a challenge in that quick of a time and gotten that much buy-in from

187
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:25,136
both the club and also engaging at half-time.

188
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:26,457
So it was kind of interesting.

189
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,560
Messaging.

190
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:33,560
So basically, again, our key thing, messaging,

191
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,901
telling the user what's new, what's important,

192
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,701
why they should actually be engaged.

193
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:39,862
Top left-hand panel there,

194
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:41,563
or I guess top right for you guys,

195
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:43,224
is the team of the week.

196
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:45,164
That's basically where we message.

197
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:47,786
It actually has, so that's the area.

198
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:51,127
It's prominently displayed right in the FIFA Ultimate team.

199
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:53,068
We actually have message panels throughout the game,

200
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:54,869
including right in the main menu.

201
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,550
So as soon as you launch FIFA, there's messaging.

202
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,218
And then we also have deep linking and actioning.

203
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:06,422
So it gives the player a chance to engage right away,

204
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:08,964
again, driving people into that content.

205
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:15,409
And we're actually, because we're a global team,

206
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:17,651
we have to support a global game played

207
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:19,132
in pretty much every country in the world.

208
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:21,213
We have to support a fair number of languages.

209
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:24,276
So this is an example of one of our.

210
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:32,522
One of our messages, score 5 with Messi. This is for a challenge. We're basically supporting

211
00:14:32,562 --> 00:14:38,845
18 to 23 languages across 11 SKUs. So 18 languages on console and PC, 23 languages on

212
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:44,668
mobile. And that accounts for 11 different platforms that we're actually messaging on. And

213
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:50,971
we can get that accomplished within one hour. That's fully localized, all the art. And if

214
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:53,792
you look, for example, the Arabic.

215
00:14:55,168 --> 00:15:00,209
It's completely different. You have to line up stuff special. Some other languages, Cyrillic, for

216
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:05,831
example, the line up is not always fun. Basically we're able to get that in less than an hour and

217
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:12,912
it crossed to everyone. We also have the ability to target users and basically say, you know, we

218
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:17,233
can target users themselves. And then what we also found is

219
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:26,238
It actually is a huge deal to actually create messages that are regionally specific or regionally relevant.

220
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:32,412
We're finding that, for example, we have three times more engagement on this particular message

221
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,374
compared to just a generic message or no message.

222
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:40,478
And it's weird, having no message and having a generic message didn't have a huge difference.

223
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:42,199
People are still able to get there.

224
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:45,762
They're regularly coming back and looking at the challenges and seeing what's up.

225
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:51,807
But if you actually did a regionally specific message, this one, this is Spanish-Mexican.

226
00:15:53,588 --> 00:16:00,034
and we actually had a special match that was played in Mexico. You're actually looking at

227
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:05,919
three times the amount of engagement. Because now, again, it's relevant to the users that are

228
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:15,688
there. They want to engage in it. So this is basically a quick view of how our stuff works.

229
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,349
and the reason why content delivery needs to be disconnected from or decoupled from game and server updates.

230
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,516
So, normal developer goes into the CM, as we all know.

231
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:30,100
That'll get pushed out to our test server.

232
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:34,274
Essentially you get, let me see if I can do this, here we go.

233
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:36,475
So this is basically our test cycle,

234
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,757
QA testing on the machine.

235
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:41,038
We have legacy testing because we're actually supporting

236
00:16:41,378 --> 00:16:43,239
multiple versions, multiple years,

237
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,080
and across multiple platforms.

238
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:46,621
So that'll get cycled through.

239
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,843
Once it's done, it'll get pushed to the stage server.

240
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:53,703
goes cycles through there, goes to the production server, cycles through there and then goes

241
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:58,885
live essentially. That can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks depending on how

242
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:03,766
much code changes there are and how much testing is required. Obviously if you're trying to

243
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:10,188
tie to real world events, a week of waiting for the server changes to go through is, you

244
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:15,450
can't. You can't react to anything. So we actually have content production using tools

245
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,130
that go directly on stage environment.

246
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:22,564
A lot of validation, a lot of code, making sure everything is correct. That gets tested by

247
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:28,346
internal QA team. That can be done within, like, minutes. And then it's basically pushed out to

248
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:35,308
the production team, retested, live. And it just, we can basically cycle and change stuff on a

249
00:17:35,348 --> 00:17:41,590
continual basis with some changes going live in seconds, other changes taking hours or

250
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,970
minutes. So...

251
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:48,065
allows us the flexibility to really react to whatever

252
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,608
happens. There was a transfer last year and I'm sorry I can't

253
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:54,631
remember the name of the player but it was a sudden transfer. He

254
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:57,974
announced it and nobody knew he was going to actually transfer.

255
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:01,557
We were able to make the change in the game, push out a new

256
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:04,399
version of the player within minutes of the actual

257
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,345
announcement that was the press release. So decouple this from

258
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:10,645
server.

259
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:15,752
Deploys fast content generation in minutes not hours or days.

260
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:19,897
That's hugely important. The main thing that lets us do that

261
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:23,441
is tools. Now we've had a little bit of a weird history with

262
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:26,765
tools. We first started we basically did client

263
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,049
applications. It's a C sharp app that ran on a client server.

264
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:35,739
Sorry, a producer's machine or QA machine, local machine.

265
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:39,823
Direct database access, a lot of APIs weren't set up, didn't have that ability,

266
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:42,125
so the tools were directly interacting with the database.

267
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:45,507
Some content was managed through SQL scripts and data files.

268
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:48,390
And then we were coupled to the schema.

269
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:52,053
If schema changes happen, you're basically reworking the tool.

270
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:57,927
It's difficult to manage permissions mainly because we didn't have a centralized

271
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:02,291
permissions management system for this. It could be built out. It just adds complexity.

272
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:09,077
And again, you can bootstrap your application and have it check for updates. We didn't do

273
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:13,741
that, unfortunately. So it was difficult to manage versions. And you know, you basically

274
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:18,405
have the QA teams, the production teams, everybody using the tools and you push out an

275
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,286
update for a bug fix.

276
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,703
And you have to track down everybody to figure out who's got the old version and who doesn't. And

277
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:31,986
it required a local setup. You need to set up perforce and everything on the actual user's

278
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:38,609
machine. And some content was still coupled to deploy because we're using SQL scripts. So this

279
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:43,432
was our dark days. We weren't pushing out a lot of content. We just didn't have the ability to

280
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:47,334
push out live content very quickly. This is probably similar to what a lot of companies are

281
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,355
at right now even. And are kind of working through that.

282
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:55,610
What we do now is totally different. We actually have a

283
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,951
single sign on portal. Basically we only support chrome because

284
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,112
it just makes life easier than having to support multiple

285
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:05,153
browsers. But single sign on portal, producers can sign in.

286
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:09,295
We have basically angular front end, C sharp back end. Really

287
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:13,657
nice to develop in and we can iterate really quickly. We're

288
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:17,478
using rest APIs only on the back end servers. We do not couple

289
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:18,438
to our database ever.

290
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:25,187
All content uses a tool now. There is not a single piece of content that goes live, that

291
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:30,131
uses scripts. It all goes through the tool. It's all validated through the tool and producers

292
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:35,234
and QA actually uses it during development as well. So now you're decoupled from the

293
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:40,818
database schema. We have a centralized permission service so we can control exactly who

294
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:46,122
has access to what tool and what environment. And it can be read access or read write access.

295
00:20:48,184 --> 00:20:52,928
And it's always up to date. It's a website. You go to the website, if we push a new update out,

296
00:20:53,489 --> 00:21:00,775
just a website. So only need a browser. No more setup. You don't have to try to convince a

297
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:03,718
producer or a manager to try to set up.

298
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:09,312
.NET 4.5 framework on their machine in order to run it and

299
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:13,314
also possibly perforce and other things which they kind of

300
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:18,296
sometimes run away from. Or you end up supporting them by

301
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:22,638
actually setting up for them. So again, coming back to this, so

302
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:25,039
tons of updates, everything through tools, by using the

303
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,640
tools, we can actually get a lot of things done. So we can

304
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:32,131
We're actually able to do that all with basically three content producers and one artist.

305
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:39,017
So a team of four basically puts out all of that content across 11 SKUs in a year.

306
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:44,761
And we're actually increasing the amount of content we're producing on a regular basis.

307
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,744
These numbers from last year, we've actually increased that this year.

308
00:21:48,784 --> 00:21:50,906
We're actually producing even more and more updates.

309
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,729
And that's all optimization on the tools, creating better flows.

310
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:01,963
Here's some data. We're a publicly traded company so I can't share tons of data but I will share

311
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:09,865
some. Plants vs. Zombies, DAU. So Plants vs. Zombies is an example. It's an EA game that is

312
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:13,945
actually developed at Burnaby as well. They don't have a content plan. They basically just

313
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:20,847
release updates. They have in game packs with stickers and whatnot but really they don't

314
00:22:20,927 --> 00:22:24,668
release new content on a regular basis. So what you're basically looking at here is...

315
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:32,991
The regular spike drops, spike, little bit drops, there's another content update, big content

316
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:38,092
update, drop, another content update, and then a giant content update, drop. This is for the full

317
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:45,875
year. Now, compare that to FIFA. So the very bottom line is actually PVZ, the DAU.

318
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:53,116
FIFA 13 was the yellow line. As you can see we kind of have the same sort of pattern as PVZ for

319
00:22:53,156 --> 00:22:58,001
FUT 13. It's basically because we weren't producing a lot of content. A lot of the spikes are on

320
00:22:58,141 --> 00:23:00,865
actual patches and DLCs or patches.

321
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,023
If you look though at 14, beginning starts out low and then we actually start wrapping up our

322
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:13,146
content plan, our content schedule. And it's kind of, it is peaky but it peaks and kind of stays

323
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:18,269
steady, peaks, stays steady. We're actually now in an interesting place. Every year we're

324
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:23,532
increasing our numbers. This is weird, I think we just had a lot of issues with our servers

325
00:23:23,932 --> 00:23:27,114
but we've gotten stabilized now and it's basically steady.

326
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:34,371
What we're finding is throughout the entire year, we are not having that slow decline to nothing.

327
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:38,113
We get a decline at the end, just over...

328
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:39,794
I've lost my mouse.

329
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:47,257
We get a decline at the end here on pretty much every year, but that's in anticipation for next year's game.

330
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:51,479
So that's usually at like the middle of summer and it just kind of dies, starts dying down

331
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:54,080
because everyone wants to buy the new one and not spend money in the old one.

332
00:23:55,113 --> 00:23:59,415
One other thing is, in our game, your stuff doesn't transfer over to the next year.

333
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:02,177
You're basically new stuff every year.

334
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:03,758
And our users love it.

335
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:05,118
Weep.

336
00:24:10,141 --> 00:24:11,262
Um, so...

337
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:14,893
This is basically an example of our stickiness.

338
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:19,596
Now we've got an increase in DAU, which basically means if you don't have good users coming

339
00:24:19,636 --> 00:24:23,978
back and you're basically just having people who aren't really playing the game, our stickiness

340
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:24,658
would have dropped.

341
00:24:25,018 --> 00:24:29,420
The nice thing is our stickiness is actually almost exactly the same as last year.

342
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:33,863
Even with the giant increase in number of users, we're actually getting good, decent

343
00:24:33,943 --> 00:24:36,644
players in the game, engaging and staying in the game.

344
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:41,706
So what's the benefit to the gamers?

345
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,471
Compelling always updated experience. They're constantly wanting to come back.

346
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:55,655
Added variety. Basically, it keeps the game fresh. It gives the user a reason to increase engagement.

347
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,657
What's the benefits for the developer and the publisher?

348
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,238
You basically have increased gamer engagement. What does that mean?

349
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,859
Increased acquisition.

350
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:12,085
Increased satisfaction in the game, people are happy to play it because they're constantly

351
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:15,748
getting new things and constantly getting excited. It means that they're willing to

352
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:20,471
stay in the game longer. And it also means you've got an increased monetization potential.

353
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:24,514
If you keep the players in the game and they're happy, they're more willing to actually spend

354
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:33,140
money if you choose to monetize. So, takeaways. Compelling content to gamers fast.

355
00:25:33,618 --> 00:25:37,301
You need compelling content. You want to get it to gamers as quickly as possible.

356
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,763
It means you can also iterate on content if you need to.

357
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:44,127
You want to separate the content from patches and deployments,

358
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:47,750
because if you tie it to your patches and deployments, you cannot react.

359
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,091
You will slow yourself down.

360
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:54,876
Use tools, not engineers. And this is massively important.

361
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:58,919
Engineers should be solving complex problems, not deploying data.

362
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:04,465
Data should be deployed through tools and producers can create their own tools and they can

363
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:07,986
play and they can actually have fun and create stuff that gamers will actually be

364
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:14,389
compelling, will find compelling and they can iterate on it a lot faster. And make the

365
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:23,812
content special. Give the gamer a reason to actually come back. So... And that's us now.

366
00:26:24,512 --> 00:26:24,813
Happy.

367
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:28,516
Again, my name is Novy Dylan.

368
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:30,078
This is my contact information.

369
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,580
Please fill out the evaluation forms.

370
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,963
It will basically help me and everyone else know how I did.

371
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:37,424
Hopefully I did well.

372
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:42,328
Yeah, and if you guys have any questions, just come up to the mic

373
00:26:42,388 --> 00:26:44,550
and I can try to answer them as best as I can.

374
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:14,077
I've got a question. Have you ever had to roll back one of your updates that you pushed out?

375
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:18,541
So the question was, have we ever had to roll back one of the updates we pushed out?

376
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,001
Yes.

377
00:27:19,922 --> 00:27:26,589
We have made mistakes. We, last year, we actually released a piece of content that

378
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:30,913
basically killed FIFA. You couldn't even log in. It just, like, done.

379
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:34,517
So we had to really quickly make that change and roll back that change.

380
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:39,582
The nice thing is because we have the tools, we can quickly disable it and get everybody back in the game

381
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:41,804
and then figure out why on a different environment.

382
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:45,087
Have you played with any kind of multivariant testing?

383
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:49,470
multivariate testing? Yeah, so like A-B testing? Yes. So our

384
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,992
messaging system is actually set up to do that. And we're

385
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:55,095
actually expanding that hopefully this year. So we do

386
00:27:55,135 --> 00:27:58,658
do that. Unfortunately, the rest of the content isn't yet set up

387
00:27:58,698 --> 00:28:01,341
to actually do multivariate testing. It is something we're

388
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:05,304
planning on doing. But yeah, it's a technical problem on the

389
00:28:05,365 --> 00:28:07,647
back end. Everybody wants to do it. It's just a matter of

390
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:08,788
finding time to get it done.

391
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:16,517
Have you ever had your community base decompile your archives and actually get information

392
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,238
that's patched ahead of your actual release?

393
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:21,419
And if so, what's the impact that you guys...

394
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:24,479
Yeah, so, luckily we haven't.

395
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:31,101
So the question was, have we ever had our community basically decompile our archives and our patches.

396
00:28:32,122 --> 00:28:34,823
Luckily we haven't. We've actually been really lucky on that.

397
00:28:35,243 --> 00:28:37,423
Most of our games are not.

398
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:38,664
Like, we have a PC title.

399
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:43,072
But it's got fairly good protection around it. So it

400
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:45,933
actually still hasn't been hacked. And it was released in

401
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:49,454
September. Which is kind of amazing. And then the rest of

402
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:54,095
them are very closed platforms. So being able to decompile your

403
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:58,356
Xbox game is going to be nearly impossible. So we luckily

404
00:28:58,396 --> 00:28:59,157
haven't had that problem.

405
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:06,578
Hi. With the content delivery that you're doing so quickly, how do you manage that with the

406
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:11,022
leaks? Do you have any restrictions? Do they have any rules? What's their process for you?

407
00:29:11,202 --> 00:29:14,785
Yeah, so we actually have, so let me just

408
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:21,249
Was it just managing content, basically making sure that we don't have content coming out earlier than it should?

409
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:28,353
Or just, you know, marks, players, anything. Just the sort of approval process and how much lead time do you need to give them.

410
00:29:28,814 --> 00:29:36,278
Like if, for instance, they say the Premier League and another team doesn't want you to do North London Derby because they're like, well what about my team?

411
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:37,579
So that kind of thing.

412
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:44,965
So we have a very, very good licensing agreement where we have a lot of leeway and we kind of can make those choices ourselves.

413
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:50,469
We can basically choose to say we're going to put out North London Derby and there's really no choice.

414
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,391
We've got really good lawyers.

415
00:29:54,952 --> 00:30:04,980
But ultimately we want to support all the leagues and all the teams and kind of give them good visibility in our game because it's just good for everyone.

416
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:09,799
It's a very impressive system, I've got to say.

417
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,700
But one thing regarding, you said three content producers,

418
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,940
one artist.

419
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,181
What about the localization?

420
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:17,981
You said 23 languages in under an hour.

421
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:19,562
How do you do that?

422
00:30:19,642 --> 00:30:21,702
You have the localized team on site as well?

423
00:30:21,842 --> 00:30:24,003
So we have a localized team that's distributed across the

424
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:27,124
world, and it's actually shared by all our EA teams,

425
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:27,844
not just us.

426
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:31,685
So we have a system where we can drop it in, and it gets

427
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:32,826
sent out to everyone.

428
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:40,200
Basically gets localized pretty quick like within an hour within half an hour to an hour on regular times now

429
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,422
We have generic text as well if we need to get out stuff really quickly that we already have pre-generated

430
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:48,224
we're going to drop in team names and

431
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:54,487
Certain things if we have some more lead what leeway like we know that something's gonna happen in a week

432
00:30:54,847 --> 00:31:00,090
We can actually go and get some really specific like very detailed information that takes a little longer

433
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,684
So it kind of, we're trying, because we're trying to iterate really quickly, we're keeping those

434
00:31:05,724 --> 00:31:09,847
descriptions down a little bit smaller so that they can get iterated really quickly too.

435
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,003
I would love to have that automated with an actual

436
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:19,105
automated system but I think one of the other talks, the very

437
00:31:19,165 --> 00:31:22,648
first talk on Monday at 10, I cannot remember the gentleman's

438
00:31:22,688 --> 00:31:25,850
name, but he basically said right now machine learning and

439
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:29,913
basically machine translation isn't good enough. Especially

440
00:31:29,953 --> 00:31:33,936
with context. And that's where you get real problems is the

441
00:31:33,956 --> 00:31:40,341
context. Cool. Awesome. Thanks, guys.

442
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:43,068
Have a great GEC.

443
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:44,738
Thank you very much.
