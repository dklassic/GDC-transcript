1
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,481
Well, thank you all for coming to one of the GDC 25th

2
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:08,902
anniversary post-mortems.

3
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:14,524
We're here today, of course, to talk about Marble Madness.

4
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:16,665
It's not going to be a whole hour talk.

5
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:20,147
I was told to leave 20 minutes for questions, so I'm

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,487
targeting 40 minutes with it.

7
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:24,609
One request from the GDC is please fill out the

8
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:25,369
evaluations.

9
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,510
They're very important to the overall process.

10
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:29,671
Thank you.

11
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:31,952
Tough crowd.

12
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:32,893
So.

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,101
I've been making games for about 30 years now.

14
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:40,502
And way back at the beginning of my career, I made three games,

15
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:42,783
worked on three games, I should say,

16
00:00:43,363 --> 00:00:47,524
during sort of the final years of the golden age

17
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:48,485
of the arcade.

18
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,886
And the third of those games was Marble Madness.

19
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:57,568
Now, I hadn't really played arcade games much at all

20
00:00:57,988 --> 00:00:58,528
to begin with.

21
00:00:58,568 --> 00:01:00,989
In fact, Pong, I don't know, it seemed kind of limited.

22
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,369
And plus, you could play it at home.

23
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,392
But a friend of mine came to me in high school and he said,

24
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:06,873
Mark, you have to try out this game.

25
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:08,014
It's the coolest thing.

26
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:12,517
You're shooting at soldiers who are advancing at you and

27
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:13,297
shooting back.

28
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:15,859
And you're dodging behind bunkers and things.

29
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,781
And he's actually talking about space invaders.

30
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:20,543
I don't quite see the soldiers there.

31
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:21,523
But anyway, I did play it.

32
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:24,025
And it was, indeed, the coolest thing ever.

33
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:26,327
And so I started to play a lot of arcade games.

34
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:29,409
And I loved, more than anything else, the variety of

35
00:01:29,449 --> 00:01:29,889
these games.

36
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:31,751
Because these are games from 1980.

37
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:39,680
and 1981. Eight games, but also eight completely different genres. That's the way it was in

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,045
the arcades those days. You'd go in every week and you'd find something totally new

39
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:52,813
that you'd never seen before. Now, in those days I was also a pretty big paper RPG fan.

40
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:55,215
I used to play them with my brother and his friends.

41
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,225
And you know, paper RPGs, you draw a map,

42
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:01,106
and then you have to make a copy of part of that map

43
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,087
and show it to somebody to show them where they are,

44
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,948
and you have to roll a lot of dice.

45
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:07,169
And my brother and I thought that, hey,

46
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:09,530
wouldn't this be simpler on a computer?

47
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,612
And so we found a couple hundred thousand dollars

48
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:15,372
of equipment at the nearby university

49
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:16,513
that was underutilized.

50
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:24,876
And we sat down to make a 3D real-time action RPG.

51
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:32,416
in 1977. And the idea was that, as you were wandering around the dungeon, above ground,

52
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:37,038
below ground, that the graphics would be like Battlezone, but better, because they'd have

53
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:43,241
a solidity to them. We were actually going to do, we're trying to do, hidden line vector,

54
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:48,283
which is a very tricky kind of graphics. And we could do about, on our scope, it wasn't

55
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:53,705
even a monitor, on our scope, about one image every few seconds. And then for...

56
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:58,747
for the action sequences, we were going to shift to sort of a

57
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:03,110
Cinematronics warrior style overhead real-time combat

58
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:03,870
simulator.

59
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:07,713
Now my brother and I had about as much chance of finishing

60
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:10,694
this project as two six-year-old kids in the backyard trying to

61
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:11,875
dig a hole to China.

62
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:15,197
But I did learn a lot about programming.

63
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,019
And oh, and we did see the game we were trying to make, by the

64
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:18,179
way.

65
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:22,742
It was called Final Fantasy VII many years later.

66
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:24,508
So I had two hobbies.

67
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:27,090
One was programming, and yes, it was on punched cards.

68
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,751
And the other one was playing arcade games.

69
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:33,914
And I used to dream about turning my two hobbies

70
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:37,837
into a job and getting fame and fortune.

71
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:40,679
Fame, because I could see it.

72
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,800
I'd release that game in the arcades,

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,362
and then I'd be on Johnny Carson talking to him

74
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:47,203
about my latest creation.

75
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:50,585
And as for the fortune, I figured, wow, that quarter.

76
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:53,636
I could just get five cents out of that quarter.

77
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:56,937
If I could just get one penny out of that quarter, you could do the math.

78
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:59,138
That would be like millions of dollars.

79
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:01,298
And I got very lucky.

80
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:07,099
While I was in college, I ran into a man who was writing a book on arcade strategy.

81
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,160
We're talking an era where you got your information from TV, radio, newspaper, or magazine.

82
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,740
That was it.

83
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,161
We're talking pre-web.

84
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,241
We're talking before the release of the CD here.

85
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:21,749
If you were going to get information on an arcade game and how to play better,

86
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,910
you were going to read a book.

87
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,910
And so I ran into this guy,

88
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,232
and he interviewed me because I was a very good arcade player.

89
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:31,973
And after that, he offered to set me up with an interview

90
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,894
with the head of product development at Atari.

91
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,635
And January 1982, I became employee 16,000 of Atari.

92
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,717
More properly speaking, I was in a much smaller part of Atari.

93
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,758
Atari was three different companies.

94
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,498
There was a company making home computers,

95
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:52,779
a company making consumer game machines and consumer games,

96
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,820
and then a very small company making arcade games.

97
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,861
Only about 150 people in this group.

98
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:01,502
And that's what I joined at the age of 17 years and four

99
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:01,782
months.

100
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,404
And I quickly learned that, wow, oh, here's

101
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:07,664
me at the time, by the way.

102
00:05:09,297 --> 00:05:14,201
I quickly learned that the thing about fame, it wasn't going to work that way. We were

103
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:19,024
forbidden to tell people that we had created these games. The stance was that it was a

104
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:25,949
corporate creation. So my good friend Dave Toyer released Tempest. It sold 30,000 units

105
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:30,432
all across North America and he couldn't tell us all that he created that game basically

106
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:35,216
by himself. Now the consolation you got for this was that you could put your initials

107
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,277
in the high score table.

108
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,478
And so you can see the creators of Centipede here, Don Bailey

109
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:42,119
and Ed Logg, and their initials there.

110
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:42,820
That's the fame.

111
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,862
And then for the fortune, well, turns out

112
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:49,824
the economics of the arcade business weren't that great.

113
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:53,287
So we made the game, but we didn't get those quarters.

114
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:55,228
What we did was we'd add a couple hundred dollars in

115
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:58,310
margin and sell it to a distributor who would sell it

116
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,312
to an operator who would perhaps have an arcade like

117
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:03,693
Time Zone, and that operator would get 100% of those

118
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:03,894
quarters.

119
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:09,174
but would have to pay for rent and salaries and maintenance,

120
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:10,135
which was huge, actually.

121
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,915
Those joysticks would break down all the time.

122
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:16,537
Alternatively, the operator could put the game in a 7-Eleven,

123
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:18,257
in which case no salaries, no rent,

124
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:19,477
but only half of the quarters.

125
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,998
And either way, the economics were not great.

126
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:24,119
The operator needed 10,000 plays at $0.25

127
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,319
to purchase a $2,500 machine.

128
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:32,230
Except that math assumes there's no overheads at all.

129
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,991
Realistically speaking, the operator needed 20,000 or 30,000

130
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:37,092
plays to break even.

131
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:39,654
So nobody was making very much money.

132
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:47,118
Now, the final thing was, I kind of knew this intellectually,

133
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:48,639
but I didn't think it through, was

134
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:53,781
I wanted to make 10 or 20-hour cinematic story-based games.

135
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:57,543
And I was in a world, right, one quarter got you three minutes.

136
00:06:57,603 --> 00:06:59,685
It doesn't get you this, whatever it is.

137
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:06,590
And I guess the only consolation I had was that we were totally empowered at Atari.

138
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,490
There was one job.

139
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,391
It was the programmer slash designer slash artist.

140
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:16,333
So you made the design doc, got it approved, did the artwork, put it in the game, coded

141
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:16,633
it up.

142
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,294
Even as a rookie, you do this.

143
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:25,695
And consequently, there was a 100% failure rate for first titles.

144
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:30,998
uh... even a famous guy like Dave Toyer his first title was a soccer game that

145
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,000
was unsalably low in income when he put it

146
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,841
in the arcades

147
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:38,523
trivia uh... true trivia here it was a soccer game

148
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:42,746
based on a track ball and the track ball was actually a bowling ball

149
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,350
and this uh... by the way this uh...

150
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:52,574
failure rate was finally broken in nineteen eighty three by Franz Lanzinger

151
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:54,175
who I hope is here today are you here Franz?

152
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:55,896
stand up this man

153
00:07:56,327 --> 00:08:01,629
The first man whose rookie title was published, and it was,

154
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:02,970
of course, Crystal Castle.

155
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,191
So 20 or 30 before couldn't do it, France could do it.

156
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:11,613
I never knew this.

157
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:14,414
There was also something going on here in that you

158
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:15,775
controlled your own destiny.

159
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,416
You had a very direct link to the consumers.

160
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,697
These titles were not marketed at all.

161
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:21,637
They couldn't be marketed.

162
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:24,398
All you did was put them in the arcade and see how much

163
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,138
money that they'd earn.

164
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:29,466
And the players, you know, they could see it for free, they could play it for a quarter.

165
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:32,448
If it was fun, they'd play it again. If it wasn't fun, that was it.

166
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:36,170
Or maybe they played it ten times, and the tenth time wasn't fun, and that was it.

167
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,991
So it was very, very tough business.

168
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:42,473
Talk about monetization hell.

169
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:45,835
And to see if a game could be published,

170
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:49,738
what we would do is we'd make the game about up to the 80% point,

171
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:52,439
so it looked indistinguishable from a finished game.

172
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:55,962
And we put one of them in an arcade and just see what the

173
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:56,782
coin drop was.

174
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:59,663
And at this point, two out of every three games

175
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:00,343
would be canceled.

176
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:03,244
It was a brutal environment to be in.

177
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:07,446
So here's my first game, which is one of those two out of the

178
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:09,407
three that did not get published.

179
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:09,947
Thank you.

180
00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:12,088
You can play it on main.

181
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:14,888
You'd slide tiles and try to.

182
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,002
get the ducks to safety on the right-hand screen or the bottom of the screen.

183
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:26,945
True to form, I did every piece of artwork in this game except for the ducks.

184
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:33,309
And believe it or not, this thing was viewed as great artwork for its day, but very poor

185
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:34,209
gameplay.

186
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,593
So after this failure, I sat down in early 1983, now that I had a little bit of experience

187
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,935
in the games business, and tried to figure out what sort of game I wanted to make.

188
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:43,075
And

189
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:43,155
I

190
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:43,295
guess

191
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:43,375
it

192
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:43,475
was

193
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:43,935
time

194
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:43,995
to

195
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:44,055
go

196
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:44,155
back

197
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:44,215
to

198
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:44,296
the

199
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:44,376
old

200
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:44,476
days.

201
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:44,536
So

202
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:44,596
I

203
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:44,716
did

204
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:44,816
this

205
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:44,976
piece

206
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:45,296
of artwork

207
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:45,356
in

208
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:45,756
early 1983,

209
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:45,937
and

210
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:45,997
it

211
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:46,077
was

212
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:46,117
a

213
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:46,297
really

214
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:46,377
bad

215
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:47,918
game

216
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:51,095
there were a few design targets that you had.

217
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,136
You needed to make something unique.

218
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:55,617
Sequels did not sell, believe it or not.

219
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:59,639
Atari was particularly serious about making unique titles.

220
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:04,100
If there was ever a top-down driving game

221
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,781
that had been released in the history of games,

222
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:06,621
you couldn't make one.

223
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:08,702
If there was a head-on-head fighting game

224
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:10,103
that had been released, you couldn't make one

225
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,664
because that would be insufficiently original.

226
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:15,245
So it was a very high bar to hit with these games.

227
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:21,969
The other target was unique controls, because Centipede and Asteroids and Tempest, of course,

228
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:23,411
all of these had different controls.

229
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:27,794
We believed it was an important part of keeping the concept fresh.

230
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:34,000
The final thing, which started coming out in 1983, was that the game should have at

231
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,064
least two players, because the economics were getting worse and worse, and two players at

232
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:40,726
once meant two coins.

233
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,111
So I thought about this.

234
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:45,611
I loved 3D graphics.

235
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:49,313
And there was Battlezone and that kind of hardware

236
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:49,893
that could do it.

237
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,174
But it was so floaty.

238
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:52,935
I mean, these objects are transparent.

239
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:55,956
And there was this other hardware in development

240
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:58,598
at the time, since actually before I came to Atari,

241
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,298
called iRobot.

242
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,620
And iRobot was raster 3D.

243
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,261
So it's solid, these images, in 3D.

244
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,423
Now, very low polygon count.

245
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:13,033
about 5,000 polygons a second.

246
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,036
And so the poor designer here was

247
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:20,720
trying to make an entire frame of the game with 200 polygons.

248
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:22,941
And the other thing about this is

249
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:25,023
when you really looked at it, all

250
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,425
of the edges of the polygons would crawl.

251
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:30,628
You'd get very distracted by the aliasing in the game.

252
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:35,532
And I wanted to be the first person to do solid 3D.

253
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:39,175
So maybe not a lot of moving camera, but really clean 3D.

254
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:44,667
uh... and i sat down to figure out what that game would be and uh...

255
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:47,249
uh... how i would go about making it

256
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,331
and uh... actually uh...

257
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:51,693
frantz beat me to it with crystal castles but

258
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:53,214
we won't talk about that today

259
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:54,415
uh...

260
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:58,019
i would sit around late at night on our pixel processing system

261
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:01,722
so this is our art system we had two of them in the office uh... it was

262
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:03,023
built on a

263
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:03,824
mini computer

264
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,465
about the size of a refrigerator

265
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:08,628
and i'd sit there and i'd fiddle and i thought okay theme

266
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:10,388
How about miniature golf?

267
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:11,168
People like that.

268
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,170
And then what do you do in the game?

269
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,550
Well, what are the controls?

270
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:19,452
Before that, sorry, I had to work out

271
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,474
how I was going to do the contours of the play field.

272
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:25,015
I worked out that two lines in different directions

273
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:25,995
could give me the contours.

274
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:29,437
And holes, I don't know if that would work,

275
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:30,778
so I put pipes in there.

276
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:31,818
And this is a

277
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:36,962
Actually, a copy of our old design document.

278
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:40,184
I could not take anything with me when I left Atari.

279
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:43,586
They were not really all that creator-friendly.

280
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:47,528
And when Atari finally closed in 2004, a man named Scott

281
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:51,670
Evans went there that day as they threw out everything from

282
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,972
the 30 years of the company's history, picked it up, and then

283
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:56,753
all of the stuff is on his website, atarigames.com.

284
00:12:57,013 --> 00:13:00,075
I'm very grateful he did this, because the only copy of my

285
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:02,857
own design document I have is from the website.

286
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:12,023
So for controls, we'd actually done for Quack, one of the versions, we'd done an industrial

287
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:13,523
strength touchscreen.

288
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:20,805
And the idea was this was a frame embedded in the cabinet, shooting rays of light horizontally

289
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:23,406
and vertically across the face of the monitor.

290
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,427
So if you put your fat finger through to the face of the monitor, it could detect where

291
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:28,828
it was.

292
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:34,089
And I thought, okay, we'll use that touchscreen and you'll somehow hit the ball and...

293
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:35,633
You've got to go around corners.

294
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:37,853
Maybe you'll place bumpers or something

295
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:39,694
to help yourself around the corners.

296
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:43,014
And I don't know, what does the second player do?

297
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:44,135
Not really clear.

298
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:47,415
I walked this around the office, and everyone hated it.

299
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:51,196
So then I thought, what about a race?

300
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,316
People like to do that.

301
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:56,917
And what about we use a track ball as the controls?

302
00:13:56,997 --> 00:14:00,098
So you'd see a ball on the screen and have a ball to roll.

303
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:05,831
But what about a motorized trackball, where we'd actually have the ability to spin the

304
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:06,792
ball programmatically?

305
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:11,934
So for example, as if the ball went down a slope faster and faster, you could just stand

306
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:13,755
there and watch that ball roll.

307
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:16,216
And if you wanted to break it, just put your hand on it.

308
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:21,638
If you put your hand on it and it's on a slope, you can tell what the slope is just by the

309
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:22,979
way it's fighting your grip.

310
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:27,943
And then for actual gameplay, a race.

311
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:30,385
If you get to the finish first, you continue.

312
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,826
If you don't, game over.

313
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:35,588
And for two-player play, I thought,

314
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:39,331
how about two players versus two AI opponents?

315
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:43,894
And I thought, how about the players are glass marbles

316
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:47,857
and the AI opponents are steel marbles or steelies?

317
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:50,058
And this plan was.

318
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:58,177
But first, you had to make the hardware, because every game

319
00:14:58,217 --> 00:15:01,840
hardware in those days was unique to the game for which it

320
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,520
was created.

321
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:06,123
So clearly, you needed to do that for something like Star

322
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:07,945
Wars versus for something like Centipede.

323
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:11,047
But the truth is that no matter how similar the Atari games

324
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:14,290
look to you as a player, actually, it was all custom

325
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,651
work inside the cabinet.

326
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,534
So it takes a while to make hardware.

327
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:21,996
And while they were doing that, I went off and helped my

328
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:23,557
friend Owen Rubin.

329
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:28,874
on his game, Major Havoc. And the hardware engineers started on the Marble Madness hardware.

330
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:35,295
Now I had to specify that as well. And I had, again, two choices, vector or raster, pretty

331
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:41,696
much everything those days was one or the other. Vector was simply colored lines on

332
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:46,637
a black background. But the plus was they were under complete programmatic control.

333
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:50,378
So you had a command buffer like a modern graphics hardware, and the program would just

334
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:53,278
put the list of lines in it, anything you wanted to draw.

335
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:54,095
You can draw.

336
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:57,998
And if you wanted 3D, they could put what they called a

337
00:15:58,118 --> 00:15:59,079
math box on it.

338
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,140
And all of a sudden, the images would look like that.

339
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:06,184
With raster hardwares, though, they were based on ROMs.

340
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:09,366
And they were incredibly finicky.

341
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:13,089
You were not able to do any freeform graphics whatsoever.

342
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:14,170
You had a ROM.

343
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:16,792
Back up there.

344
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:19,854
You had a background that was made out of 8 by 8 pixel

345
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:20,154
stamps.

346
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:23,167
That was the basic unit that you populated with.

347
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:26,728
And then you had a very few sprites, maybe 16 or 32,

348
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:30,169
which were small, movable objects on top of that

349
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:31,750
that also came out of the ROMs.

350
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,991
And every single graphic you were going to display

351
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,112
had to be in a ROM, in a custom chip, basically.

352
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:41,413
And so these are stamps from Centipede.

353
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:43,773
The images you could display in Centipede,

354
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:45,474
that was it times about 10.

355
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,595
And what you did was you passed the hardware,

356
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,095
the code for that stamp.

357
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:52,498
you did not have the ability to say,

358
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,659
I want to put a dot on the screen and put it here.

359
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,261
Now, during development, we couldn't

360
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:01,462
afford the six-week turnaround time to make custom ROMs.

361
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:04,283
So we used erasable programmable ROMs, EP ROMs.

362
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:08,784
Just an example, so that's Centipede's background.

363
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,465
It's all made from two types of stamps.

364
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:12,606
If you want the mushroom to disappear,

365
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,367
you have to just substitute things

366
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:16,127
that look smaller and smaller until it's gone.

367
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:20,154
And then something like the spider is one of those sprites

368
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:22,855
on top that you have maybe 16 or 32 of.

369
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:26,557
And the only thing you can do runtime programmatically is

370
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:27,178
change the color.

371
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:27,818
That's it.

372
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:29,139
Everything else is canned.

373
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,303
So this created a situation where Ed Log, if he wanted to

374
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:39,065
put a asteroid that looked like a mushroom in his game on

375
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:40,866
a vector hardware, that was a couple minutes.

376
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:42,587
Type it in, download it, done.

377
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,211
Whereas if Ed Log thought that the legs on the centipede

378
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,292
should be one pixel longer, he had

379
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:53,193
to go lengthen them on the pixel processing system,

380
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,494
transfer the data to the main mini computer that we used,

381
00:17:56,594 --> 00:18:00,055
run a utility, put the results on an eight-inch floppy,

382
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:04,337
take that to the EEPROM burning room, enter a code,

383
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,658
burn a set of ROMs, go back to the lab, lever them out,

384
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,559
put in the new ROMs, and then find out

385
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,240
that probably he screwed up one step along the way.

386
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:15,850
So ours, very inflexible.

387
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,650
So there was a third choice.

388
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,331
It was a very unique choice.

389
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:23,491
The iRobot hardware.

390
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:28,633
It's the very clever hardware engineer, liked my game design.

391
00:18:29,413 --> 00:18:32,994
And he said, you know, Mark, these procedural play fields

392
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,414
that you want to make are really easy to do in hardware.

393
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:38,555
Why don't we make a cheap version

394
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:39,835
of the iRobot hardware?

395
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:42,136
You'll just give it the heights you want to display.

396
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:44,364
and it'll do it live.

397
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:46,906
And at that point I got really excited

398
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:50,027
because now the play field can be sort of a living creature

399
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,068
that's a part of the gameplay.

400
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,308
It can chase the player around.

401
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,950
And that was so cool, I put this in the game design.

402
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,791
So the core game design concept then became

403
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:04,074
a race against an AI opponent on this dynamic play field.

404
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:06,916
And what happened next is that,

405
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:08,457
of course this didn't happen,

406
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:11,958
the economics of the arcade business got still worse.

407
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,723
We were having a crash in 82 and 83 and 84.

408
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:20,306
We lost 90% of our sales.

409
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:21,807
It was very tough.

410
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:23,548
We'd saturated the market.

411
00:19:23,588 --> 00:19:26,851
There were 1 and 1 half million arcade games in North

412
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:28,091
America in 1982.

413
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:30,313
And we just couldn't sell anymore.

414
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,654
The old ones weren't dead yet.

415
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:38,038
So our strategy for improving the economics of the arcade

416
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,580
business was we were going to do system hardware.

417
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:43,918
System hardware meant that the operator would buy a $2,500

418
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:50,863
game machine one time, and it would have what we called a

419
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:51,964
system board in it.

420
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:54,686
And after that, the operator would buy new games just by

421
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:57,708
getting a giant cartridge, like I have a photo of here.

422
00:19:58,369 --> 00:19:59,710
Doesn't really look like a cartridge, I know.

423
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:03,793
And a control panel specific to that game, and plexiglass,

424
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:06,495
giving the game's title, and maybe some artwork for the

425
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:07,176
side of the cabinet.

426
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:09,117
And we figured that that would be about.

427
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:16,979
$800 rather than $2,500. So we would help out the business by not having custom hardware

428
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,643
every time. Now, we were in luck because there had been

429
00:20:21,683 --> 00:20:27,548
a skunk works project, again, going on from before I joined Atari, where a poor engineer

430
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:34,793
locked in a room was embedding all of the conventional stamp graphics in a single custom

431
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:38,996
chip. And so he'd come into work every day and manipulate diagrams that looked like this.

432
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,801
That's apparently how you made chips in those days.

433
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,341
It certainly isn't how you do it now.

434
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:48,483
And so we would have our ROM stamps and our ROM sprites,

435
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:52,205
and in addition to that, we would have RAM sprites.

436
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:56,627
And that meant that I would have a programmable area,

437
00:20:56,807 --> 00:21:00,408
maybe not large, 32 by 32 pixels, 64 by 64 pixels,

438
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,809
and inside of that, I could draw any graphic

439
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,850
I wanted to programmably.

440
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:06,351
And that meant...

441
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:10,312
marbles that could refract the playfield behind them,

442
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:13,773
and steelies that could reflect the playfield around them.

443
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,814
And this totally did not happen as well.

444
00:21:17,295 --> 00:21:19,135
It did not happen because we'd locked

445
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,676
the guy in the room too long.

446
00:21:21,056 --> 00:21:23,217
And he couldn't take it.

447
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:23,797
He quit.

448
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:24,997
He took another job.

449
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:27,838
He told us it was one month left, just one month

450
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:28,698
to finish the chip.

451
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:29,719
It'll be fine.

452
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:30,859
Well, we looked at it.

453
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:31,659
It wasn't a month.

454
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,940
It was six months through a year to finish that thing.

455
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:36,513
And it wasn't just me that was waiting for hardware

456
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:37,174
by this point.

457
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:41,275
We, as a whole company, were going to go to system hardware.

458
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:43,035
So all the teams were waiting.

459
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:46,056
So very reluctantly, the engineers settled down,

460
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:48,497
and they did what they called the budget system.

461
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:53,278
The budget system was a utterly conventional ROM-based

462
00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:53,898
hardware.

463
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:56,179
And you can see here the motherboard on the left.

464
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,899
That's the Marble Madness cartridge on the right.

465
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,240
Only about two things notable about this hardware.

466
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:08,726
56 sprites, so a few more. And if you wanted 32 or 64 colors rather than 16, you could

467
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:12,028
have that many. You just needed to put more ROMs into the cartridge.

468
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:19,392
The motorized trackball had also been in development. Now, before I get into a motorized trackball,

469
00:22:19,432 --> 00:22:26,276
let me show you the inside of a basic trackball. It's supported on three shafts. So there is

470
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:28,477
a shaft with an optical sensor to

471
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,031
detect the vertical motion.

472
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:32,534
There's another one to detect the horizontal motion.

473
00:22:32,974 --> 00:22:35,756
There's a third shaft, just the track ball,

474
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:37,718
which is actually a cue ball from billiards,

475
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,901
can make good contact with the mechanisms.

476
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:44,264
So these guys had made a prototype with four shafts.

477
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:52,511
They had two for detection and two for driving

478
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:53,552
the ball with motors.

479
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:56,074
And they found out that with four shafts,

480
00:22:56,434 --> 00:23:01,057
cue ball couldn't make good contact with all of them simultaneously. And for anybody who's

481
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:05,340
ever bought a kitchen table, dining room table, you know this, right? If it sits on three

482
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,163
legs, it's stable. If it sits on four, you need shims or something. And they could not

483
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:14,887
machine this to enough precision that it would survive in the arcades. And so this, too,

484
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:22,832
was scrapped. Right here is the actual Marble Madness control panel, and it is two utterly

485
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:24,333
conventional trackballs.

486
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,104
So 1984, the hardware finally arrives.

487
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,126
And let me tell you a little bit about our development

488
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:31,806
environment here.

489
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:35,108
We were using a VAX mini computer, the 11780.

490
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,731
It was a true one MIP machine.

491
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:41,833
That means 1 million instructions per second.

492
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:43,474
This does, I think, 10 billion.

493
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:44,074
I'm not sure.

494
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,936
Not a whole lot of horsepower.

495
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:47,517
That might have been OK.

496
00:23:47,537 --> 00:23:49,818
But the thing is, 50 of us shared this

497
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:51,079
machine on terminals.

498
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:56,419
Whatever you wanted to do, you were going to do very slowly.

499
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,142
On the good side, wow, the 68,000 CPU.

500
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:04,984
I got to be the first person at Atari to use it.

501
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:09,527
And all I can say is it was posh.

502
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:12,589
32-bit registers, eight of them, eight address registers.

503
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:15,551
And it ran at an amazing 7 megahertz.

504
00:24:16,051 --> 00:24:17,192
It was great.

505
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:21,475
We were also the first team to use C as a programming

506
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:21,755
language.

507
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:25,613
And I was a little excited and a little suspicious, you know,

508
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:28,154
what's going to happen if I don't have direct control

509
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:30,015
over the assembly language instructions.

510
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:34,117
And that was actually justified suspicion,

511
00:24:34,418 --> 00:24:37,919
is sure, during the beginning part of the project,

512
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:40,481
you could type something in and it would compile quickly

513
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:42,742
and you could see the result. But after a while,

514
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:46,644
it was taking 15 minutes to get through the compiler, linker,

515
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:49,425
and download process to see even a single character

516
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:51,266
change in the game.

517
00:24:51,745 --> 00:24:57,807
And there was also this hidden time sync in that I had to go back in and hand optimize

518
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:00,168
a lot of the code that the C compiler created.

519
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:04,590
Net-net, we ran at 30 hertz because we used C, not 60.

520
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:09,552
And I suspect that it actually took longer to make the game because of that.

521
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:16,855
Now I've been saying we, and I just said that the, you know, this was the error of the one

522
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:17,696
person, one project.

523
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:18,576
Well, by 1984, that had changed.

524
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:21,802
It was a three-person project.

525
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:25,144
The second of those people was Bob Flanagan,

526
00:25:25,744 --> 00:25:28,226
who had been helping out John Solowitz on Paperboy

527
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:31,548
programming, and then came on to be my partner programming

528
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:32,568
on Marble Madness.

529
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:35,950
And so we settled down to code the game in C together.

530
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:39,512
And our first milestone, remember the pitch,

531
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:45,376
player versus AI opponent on a dynamically changing terrain.

532
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:49,659
And so we had to somehow show that.

533
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:56,949
we could use a ROM hardware, very flexible ROM hardware,

534
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,231
to do this kind of smooth graphics.

535
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:00,972
You know, iRobot, no problem.

536
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:05,435
But if it has to be a canned graphic in a stamp,

537
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:06,495
big problem.

538
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:11,318
So I looked at the play field, and this is a bump.

539
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:13,620
And it's made out of stamps.

540
00:26:15,101 --> 00:26:17,062
There's a lot of duplication here.

541
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,324
All of the flat areas are just those two stamps.

542
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:21,556
There's all the flat areas.

543
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:26,059
And then those stamps are actually the same stamp.

544
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,800
And if we look at the front of the bump,

545
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,121
it's the same stamps repeated.

546
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:32,703
There's not that many unique stamps

547
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:35,465
needed to do a bump like this.

548
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,967
But what stamps do you need is next to the question.

549
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:40,328
And so just looking at one stamp here,

550
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:43,770
that stamp I realized is trying to represent three

551
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,812
planes of the bump behind it.

552
00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:48,473
So zooming in on it.

553
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:49,832
There's the three planes.

554
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,974
You can represent, really, the stamp as that zigzag line.

555
00:26:54,275 --> 00:26:55,415
And you can give it a number, too.

556
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:57,077
You can say it starts on the left,

557
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,879
and it starts 10 pixels up above the stamp,

558
00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:02,440
and goes to the right 6 pixels up, comes down,

559
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,961
it's 4 pixels in, and so on.

560
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,604
You can turn any stamp into a couple numbers.

561
00:27:08,064 --> 00:27:09,345
So here's another stamp.

562
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:12,147
And so I thought, OK, I will.

563
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:16,335
Sit down, I'll figure out what the static aspects of the play

564
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:16,995
field will be.

565
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:19,575
I'll derive the library of stamps.

566
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:20,975
I need to represent that.

567
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:24,256
I'll take four hours to burn that into ROMs.

568
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:25,876
I'll put them in the game.

569
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:26,916
I'll play the game.

570
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:29,977
And it won't have all the stamps it needs for that living

571
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:31,717
bump as it chases the player around.

572
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:33,918
It'll use the closest one it can find.

573
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:37,058
But it'll keep track of the ones it doesn't have.

574
00:27:37,718 --> 00:27:41,479
Then offline, I'll incorporate those additional stamps into

575
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,059
my library.

576
00:27:42,397 --> 00:27:43,338
and reburn the ROM.

577
00:27:43,518 --> 00:27:45,159
And after a couple cycles, the idea

578
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:48,021
is everything you need for a dynamic play field

579
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:49,121
will be in that ROM.

580
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,965
And we did, on this basis, a simple proof of concept,

581
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,505
and it appeared to work.

582
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,828
Now, the second milestone was the player

583
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,170
versus the AI opponent race.

584
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:07,153
And wow, the design document had all

585
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:09,734
been about the competitive and the cooperative aspects

586
00:28:09,774 --> 00:28:10,175
of racing.

587
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:16,137
Competitive is things like the first ball breaks the glass supports for the trap and

588
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:17,919
the second ball is trapped by it.

589
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:22,462
Or there's a cliff that you can't jump down, your marble would shatter.

590
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:28,067
And so the first ball can use the teeter-totter to get down, but the second ball has to wait

591
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:28,808
and so on.

592
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:33,251
And here is the actual playfield from the design document.

593
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:39,336
You can see it's a symmetrical track for the player and the AI opponent until you get to

594
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:39,717
the end.

595
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:43,089
a wedge sitting on glass supports.

596
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:46,491
And the first person to hit those glass supports

597
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:51,614
breaks them, takes the shortcut, and forces the other player

598
00:28:51,674 --> 00:28:52,654
to take the long way around.

599
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:54,195
So that was competitive.

600
00:28:55,096 --> 00:28:58,118
Then for cooperative, the idea was you and I play

601
00:28:58,158 --> 00:28:59,939
against two computer opponents.

602
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:02,460
But maybe there's an elastic barricade

603
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,361
where you and I have to hit it simultaneously.

604
00:29:04,822 --> 00:29:05,922
If we do, we get through.

605
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:07,743
But if I get there before you do,

606
00:29:07,803 --> 00:29:08,984
I just have to wait for you to get there.

607
00:29:10,353 --> 00:29:14,574
So we got the race in against the AI opponents.

608
00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:16,815
We got the dynamic play field in.

609
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:17,695
We put it all together.

610
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:18,296
We played it.

611
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:21,437
And it was a enormous disappointment.

612
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:26,758
The bump that chased you around, it just felt creepy.

613
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,621
It had a weird rat under the rug kind of feel to it.

614
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:36,262
And it didn't really affect the gameplay very much.

615
00:29:36,803 --> 00:29:39,804
And as far as racing against an AI opponent went,

616
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:42,025
the thing was you'd be going as hard as you could,

617
00:29:42,045 --> 00:29:43,486
but we couldn't let you go too fast.

618
00:29:43,506 --> 00:29:45,186
I mean, these play fields couldn't be very long.

619
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:50,348
And minute variations in how you went down trenches

620
00:29:50,408 --> 00:29:52,789
and around corners would be all that

621
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,149
determined who won the race.

622
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:56,410
It was a pretty complete disaster.

623
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:02,051
Now, luckily, my second partner on this, Sam Comstock,

624
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:04,012
our artist, we had a full-time artist.

625
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:04,432
It was great.

626
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:08,836
he'd been doing the critters for the game and he looked at this and he said no no no

627
00:30:09,436 --> 00:30:11,517
static is actually good

628
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:17,359
you get rid of the dynamic concept and you make the play field static you can do

629
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:20,300
shadows which will make it pop

630
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,201
you can do ornamentation which will make it prettier

631
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:28,323
and a programmer friend of mine said and if you ray trace it you can anti-alias it

632
00:30:28,363 --> 00:30:31,064
which will get rid of the jaggies on the edges of everything

633
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:34,579
So to start with the last of those things,

634
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,741
the concept here was I would define a height field.

635
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:41,183
I would then write a program that

636
00:30:41,203 --> 00:30:43,744
would ray trace it on our shared mini computer,

637
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:47,786
16 rays for every pixel that we would then average.

638
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:53,189
And then I would hand it off to the artist to touch up by hand.

639
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,071
And as far as ray tracing, I don't mean anything

640
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:57,352
particularly complex.

641
00:30:57,392 --> 00:30:59,053
This is a play field scene from above.

642
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:01,514
I meant take a ray in from the front.

643
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:10,073
see if it hits a white center of a square or a black line and figure out the color there.

644
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:13,374
Then go from the point of collision out to the light source.

645
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:15,555
If you can get to it, you're in sunlight.

646
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:17,096
If you can't, you're in shadow.

647
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:23,659
And as far as more rays, 16 rays is definitely better than one ray.

648
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,580
You know, you got one ray, it's going to be light or dark.

649
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,182
And you'll see, like in this ramp area, some significant jaggies.

650
00:31:31,617 --> 00:31:36,259
If you can have a lot of rays and average them, we used a pyramidal filter for that,

651
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:42,662
you can get these very, I don't know, delicate looking graphics, quite unique in the day.

652
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:44,383
So that worked very well.

653
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:51,926
As far as shadows went, I went in and I doctored last week one of our screenshots to remove

654
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,247
the shadows to show you what they look like without shadows.

655
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:57,568
So the left is Marble Madness as if it had no shadows.

656
00:31:57,628 --> 00:31:58,909
And it actually is quite hard.

657
00:31:58,989 --> 00:31:59,409
I'll zoom in.

658
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:04,220
quite hard to see the relationship spatially between the objects here. If

659
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,164
you look at the pillars on the right, it's a little hard to tell what the

660
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:13,770
height of each of those is. But as soon as we add shadows, you instantly know the

661
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:19,396
spatial relationships there. So yes, Sam Comstock was correct. And then of course

662
00:32:19,476 --> 00:32:23,560
ornamentation, sure. You get your artist in there and he freehands, I don't know,

663
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:29,953
rails and their shadows and arrows and adds color and of course it's going to look better.

664
00:32:32,274 --> 00:32:39,937
The problem we ran into was I needed to trace eight, seven, excuse me, just seven, seven

665
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:48,760
million rays a level on our shared computer. That was 12 hours of full-time usage on a

666
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,680
computer shared by 50 people.

667
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,112
So I did it nights, I did it weekends.

668
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:54,954
Francis forgotten this when I mentioned it yesterday to him.

669
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,776
He burst into my office some Saturday morning

670
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,658
wanting to know what the hell I was doing.

671
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,440
Because what we didn't know is the sharing algorithm

672
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,061
on the computer.

673
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,123
If you use the whole mini computer for too long,

674
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:06,644
you'd own it.

675
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:08,505
And nobody else could get in.

676
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:13,709
It took him 15 minutes to type in his name and password

677
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:14,270
to log in.

678
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:18,714
At any rate, I did finesse that problem.

679
00:33:18,754 --> 00:33:20,075
I did become the largest user.

680
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:25,137
nights and weekends of this computer. And we did, by this whole transition from dynamic

681
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:28,078
to static, we did lose a month, but we gained a look.

682
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:35,142
As far as the race versus AI opponents went, that turned into a race versus time. I just

683
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:40,544
loved pole position to death, so I simply used the pole position time algorithm. It's

684
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:44,867
very simple. You race. If you have seconds left over at the finish line, you keep them,

685
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:46,668
and you get more seconds.

686
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:48,168
So, we're going to go ahead and get started.

687
00:33:48,717 --> 00:33:53,400
If we look at the transition between early 83, when I did the paper design doc, and June

688
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:59,205
of 84, when we'd actually gotten the game up and found its problems, it was a completely

689
00:33:59,245 --> 00:33:59,745
different game.

690
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,566
However, that was a plus.

691
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:08,212
We had this killer look, and we also had pretty good gameplay here with the race versus time.

692
00:34:08,232 --> 00:34:10,774
That turned out to work very nicely and intuitively.

693
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:15,517
And finally, I haven't talked about this much, but we had this really nice approach with

694
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:17,979
the enemies that I and Sam had worked out, where they were all...

695
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,142
bits and pieces of things, like the slink, sorry, the marble muncher is just a foot,

696
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:28,805
or the ooze is just a blob, no eyes or anything, or the birds are just things with wings.

697
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:37,469
I should also say we had a great audio team who, they'd come by occasionally and download

698
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,591
stuff on it, and it was great stuff invariably.

699
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:41,892
I had nothing to do with that creatively, Brad and Hal.

700
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:47,214
They got Yamaha FM sound synthesis.

701
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:48,965
It was from a color organ.

702
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:51,947
This was, I believe, the first time that chip had ever

703
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:53,488
been used in an arcade game.

704
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:54,849
It had just beautiful audio.

705
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,450
And they did their excellent sound effects

706
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,352
and sort of pseudo-classical compositions with it.

707
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:07,776
So it was actually, from that point, I know this is boring,

708
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:09,417
but it's pretty smooth sailing.

709
00:35:11,018 --> 00:35:14,019
Less than six months from that time to release,

710
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,780
we made three levels.

711
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,392
And we did a in-house focus test where we just had players

712
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:20,413
come in and play.

713
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:21,173
They loved it.

714
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:23,034
We made two more levels.

715
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:27,498
And we put a game machine, a prototype, in an arcade near

716
00:35:27,518 --> 00:35:27,978
my house.

717
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:31,941
And a lot of coin dropped, a lot of income.

718
00:35:33,062 --> 00:35:34,002
We added one more level.

719
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:34,823
And we shipped it.

720
00:35:37,705 --> 00:35:41,868
Just four brief stories from game development.

721
00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:48,272
uh... i had in the original design sort of a black hole style gravitational funnel where

722
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:52,716
the force would suck you down into it and wow i couldn't get that to work

723
00:35:53,857 --> 00:35:58,381
so and it was very hard to iterate on the ROMs it's not like i i could try uh...

724
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:02,084
any more than one shot at this a day because i had to rerun the levels

725
00:36:02,164 --> 00:36:02,705
overnight

726
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:06,068
and after four or five tries i just gave up and the dimple

727
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:07,609
you see in the second level

728
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,070
is what we ended up with

729
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:19,301
I ran out of sprites. So we had marbles. The marbles had dots in them to indicate their

730
00:36:19,341 --> 00:36:27,043
motion. And I needed 11 sprites to make one marble, because I needed the left half, the

731
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:32,504
right half, eight dots, just to do a dot, you needed to use a sprite. And then I needed

732
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:37,805
a highlight that would be in front of the dots. Two marbles, 22 sprites, we had 56 total.

733
00:36:39,452 --> 00:36:44,373
thought about this, I ended up making every single possible combination of two dots.

734
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:50,714
And by using that library, I could then do it with four sprites that each had two dots

735
00:36:51,354 --> 00:36:58,256
and save eight sprites. And that got us through our sprite crisis.

736
00:36:58,356 --> 00:37:03,917
The ooze, we really wanted to do a translucent effect, and we did not have hardware that

737
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:08,718
supported translucency. So Sam drew the grid into the ooze.

738
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:13,447
It was very well done.

739
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:18,189
We had a bit of a kerfuffle with our graphic designers.

740
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,331
This was the age of the character, Pac-Man, right?

741
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:22,751
Biggest game of the day, Pac-Man.

742
00:37:23,512 --> 00:37:24,392
And I didn't want to do that.

743
00:37:24,412 --> 00:37:27,233
I wanted to do this abstract, Escher-esque game

744
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:29,294
where nothing had eyes.

745
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:31,295
And they looked at the marble and they said, no,

746
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:32,076
that's not a marble.

747
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:33,016
That's a happy face.

748
00:37:34,037 --> 00:37:37,318
And they did the plexiglass top with happy face marbles,

749
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:39,459
and they did the control panel with happy face

750
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:40,780
marbles for our first test.

751
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:43,968
And I negotiated this one.

752
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:49,092
As you can see, we ended up with a smile, but not a face.

753
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:51,713
So those are happy, what are they?

754
00:37:53,194 --> 00:37:54,555
Yeah, they're happy marbles.

755
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:55,916
But they're not happy faces.

756
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:00,800
So we shipped it in December of 1984.

757
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,321
We sold 4,000 units.

758
00:38:03,702 --> 00:38:05,523
The market had come way down.

759
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,125
In the heyday, it was 100,000 for something like Pac-Man.

760
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,866
Even something that was a.

761
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:13,094
A failure, perceived as a failure, like Battlezone,

762
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:16,096
sold 30,000.

763
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:17,797
1982, Pole Position sold 20,000.

764
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,279
1983, Millipede sold 10,000.

765
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,141
By the time the game this time came out, that was one of the

766
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,202
top sellers of the year at 4,000 units.

767
00:38:26,443 --> 00:38:29,045
What was good about that was we were in such trouble, that

768
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,066
kept our factory open for three months.

769
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:33,868
Otherwise, we would have had to furlough the workers.

770
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:38,451
We were number one in income in the arcades we tracked.

771
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,622
Across the board, we tracked 18 arcades.

772
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:44,264
And after six weeks, simultaneously dropped out

773
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:46,926
at number one, because the game was four minutes long.

774
00:38:49,508 --> 00:38:51,089
Now, I've come back.

775
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:52,190
Why so short?

776
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,452
It really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

777
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:59,255
And Scott Evans, AtariGames.com, sent me my source code.

778
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,476
I did not ask him for it.

779
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:01,397
He sent it to me.

780
00:39:01,577 --> 00:39:02,198
I looked at it.

781
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,058
I should not have.

782
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,141
I felt so small.

783
00:39:06,628 --> 00:39:10,070
The code for the ooze is 300 lines of C.

784
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:15,073
I mean, we're talking not even student project level for this.

785
00:39:15,173 --> 00:39:16,714
And we were professional programmers

786
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:20,456
working at the top game company in America in arcade games.

787
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:22,777
I don't know.

788
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:23,958
It's just mind boggling.

789
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:26,600
I looked at Uncharted last week.

790
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,623
The AI code for a typical enemy in Uncharted is 750 lines.

791
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:36,025
That code is written by a game designer, not a programmer.

792
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:42,052
So all I can figure is that our environment had so many obstacles that threw in front

793
00:39:42,092 --> 00:39:47,459
of us, you know, four hours to see your graphics on the screen and those compiles and the shared

794
00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:54,167
mini computer and the like, that just to get a 64K program was an accomplishment.

795
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:55,689
Anyway, I'm going with that.

796
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:03,412
uh... it wasn't all bad that marble madness had such short income. I mean it was a system

797
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:07,376
hardware and we were the first game so as soon as that dropped out there were more games

798
00:40:07,456 --> 00:40:12,860
ready to sell to the operators like Peter Packrad and Road Runner and Indiana Jones

799
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:22,629
and the like. One final thought. Marble Madness is certainly the most creative title I've

800
00:40:22,649 --> 00:40:26,452
ever worked on. It's probably the most creative title I ever will work on.

801
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:32,585
There's a certain commitment to a concept there that hasn't been in anything else I've ever been on.

802
00:40:33,246 --> 00:40:38,908
And that's really rare. If you look at the games business today, there's not so much of that, a couple exceptions aside.

803
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:42,130
And in the process of putting this together, I was thinking about it.

804
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:51,294
What I think is this is our games were so small in scope that you got one concept.

805
00:40:51,414 --> 00:40:53,895
And one concept was asteroids and spaceship. Go!

806
00:40:55,255 --> 00:40:56,557
mushroom and centipede, go.

807
00:40:56,617 --> 00:40:58,759
And it would either work or it would not work.

808
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,282
But simply, we were in an environment that fostered,

809
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:07,867
that required that kind of commitment to a creative idea.

810
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:10,110
And that's really it for the prepared talk.

811
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:10,790
Thanks so much.

812
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:25,217
And I've been asked if you have a question to use a stand mic.

813
00:41:27,078 --> 00:41:27,799
Hi, great talk.

814
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,741
If you were to iterate on Marble Madness today

815
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:33,083
and take it to the next level, what would you do?

816
00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:37,106
I've joked, I want to do sort of a philosophical quest

817
00:41:37,186 --> 00:41:39,208
where the marble goes out into the real world

818
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:44,632
and has conversations with people about things like,

819
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:45,973
why is there evil in the universe?

820
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:46,974
I'm really not kidding.

821
00:41:47,014 --> 00:41:49,035
I did a design for this a couple of years back.

822
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:49,956
It will never happen.

823
00:41:55,129 --> 00:42:00,112
This one goes back a little while. So understand if you don't have the answer for this. I read in

824
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:09,118
the press 20 plus years ago that you were unexpectedly a detriment to the major havoc project

825
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:14,541
because you were such a good play tester the game was tuned too high in the arcade. I read that in

826
00:42:14,581 --> 00:42:19,124
an article and I don't know if that was someone being, they were talking about you in the context

827
00:42:19,144 --> 00:42:19,924
of Marvel Madness.

828
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:20,445
Really?

829
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:21,105
Yes.

830
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:24,176
At the arcade show last year,

831
00:42:24,236 --> 00:42:27,137
the Gravatar team said I almost took the team down,

832
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:30,717
actually, because yeah, I was the in-house play tester,

833
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:32,158
and I thought it was much too easy.

834
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:35,379
It's a good lesson in usability for everybody involved,

835
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:35,919
let me tell you that.

836
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:37,479
I haven't heard that about Major Havoc, though.

837
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:40,520
We just had to kill the player so darn fast was the thing.

838
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,260
I mean, if the game time play averages

839
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,681
weren't three minutes or less, it was unsaleable,

840
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:48,302
and Major Havoc, because it was sort of a platformer

841
00:42:48,342 --> 00:42:50,402
in some respects, was more like a four-minute game.

842
00:42:53,664 --> 00:42:57,228
Question about all the fall on ports of Marble Madness 7.

843
00:42:57,268 --> 00:42:59,910
Were you involved in any of those, bringing Marble Madness to any of the platforms?

844
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,434
And did it have any kind of a different, was the contrast really notable to you?

845
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:05,236
No, I wasn't involved in any of those.

846
00:43:05,276 --> 00:43:07,838
It's really a shame that they couldn't have used trackballs.

847
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,221
It's not really such the same game as a joystick.

848
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,223
But now that we have the tablets and things,

849
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:15,026
we might be able to use the gyros in there to do something well.

850
00:43:15,649 --> 00:43:20,293
I did have somebody show me their version of Marble Madness on a smartphone one time

851
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:23,576
and ask if I wanted to convert it to other smartphones, and I noticed they'd ripped my

852
00:43:23,616 --> 00:43:24,497
credit out of the game.

853
00:43:25,418 --> 00:43:30,142
And my question was, if I did the project, would I be responsible for ripping out my

854
00:43:30,202 --> 00:43:32,444
credit or would somebody else take care of that for me?

855
00:43:37,162 --> 00:43:43,003
I remember when I'd play the game in the arcade, I was always very convinced by how solid the physics felt.

856
00:43:43,063 --> 00:43:46,945
I was just wondering if you had any comments on how you implemented the physics for the game.

857
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:49,906
Oh wow, it was a hack. Thank you for the kind words though.

858
00:43:50,646 --> 00:43:55,207
Yeah, you kind of roll the ball and if you got to an edge, the edge would push you off usually.

859
00:43:55,507 --> 00:44:00,349
I'm sure you've seen the speedruns where you take advantage of the bad physics to roll off

860
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:03,370
and then pitch into an edge and just pop up to the playfield.

861
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,310
You can do that almost anywhere in the game.

862
00:44:08,006 --> 00:44:14,150
Hi there. So at any point during the design process, did anybody mention that the gap

863
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:19,594
between the track ball and the control panel is just perfect enough for a seven-year-old

864
00:44:20,014 --> 00:44:22,636
to get his middle finger stuck right in there?

865
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:28,600
Now, you should have played Dave Toyer's game where it was a real bowling ball without holes

866
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,582
because you could get the entire side of your hand in there.

867
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:35,885
You owe me some Band-Aid money.

868
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:46,954
Any more questions? No? We might. Yes? I can repeat it.

869
00:44:54,657 --> 00:44:58,739
Yes, so the follow-up game, Marble Man, that was Bob Flanagan, who was the other programmer

870
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:05,241
on Marble Madness, working with, oh, he'll kill me because I'm forgetting his name, Haley,

871
00:45:05,321 --> 00:45:06,561
who worked on, um,

872
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:10,339
Paperboy and a couple other very famous games.

873
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,160
And they, Mike Halley, sorry.

874
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,361
And they took a very different approach.

875
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:17,821
They thought that the sort of abstract look was hurting them.

876
00:45:17,901 --> 00:45:21,282
So they went with enemies like a tomato or a giant fork

877
00:45:21,623 --> 00:45:22,003
and knife.

878
00:45:22,483 --> 00:45:24,983
And trackballs were actually terribly expensive.

879
00:45:25,003 --> 00:45:27,304
Trackballs were $50 a pop.

880
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:29,805
And they break down frequently.

881
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:31,305
So they went with joysticks so they

882
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:33,566
could afford to put three of them on the control panel.

883
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,647
They took it all the way to test.

884
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:39,050
and found that the income was not high enough to release.

885
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:39,130
Yes.

886
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:45,176
I was just wondering, when you, after you rendered the play fields

887
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:48,940
and you broke them up into tiles, did you ever run into the case where you had too many

888
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,681
and how did you resolve that issue?

889
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:51,622
A case where I...

890
00:45:52,363 --> 00:45:54,465
Too many unique tiles for the background?

891
00:45:54,605 --> 00:45:57,347
You know, I kind of just worked and I didn't think too hard about it.

892
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:00,210
I wish I had a better answer than that.

893
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:05,564
I should have done more play fields than that. I have really a mystery looking back why that

894
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:11,648
is all that is in the game. When we could have run, you know, three months longer and

895
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:16,070
had an eight-minute game and maybe not dropped out of first place in the arcades after six

896
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:16,350
weeks.

897
00:46:16,951 --> 00:46:17,151
Thank you.

898
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:25,115
I was going to ask if you, sort of a very un-technical question, if you have any favorite

899
00:46:25,495 --> 00:46:28,657
game from the era back then and a favorite game sort of anymore.

900
00:46:29,517 --> 00:46:31,238
Oh, I was in love with Defender.

901
00:46:31,939 --> 00:46:34,261
And Eugene Jarvis was my childhood hero.

902
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:39,545
And a couple years back I got to give him his Lifetime Achievement Award at the awards ceremony.

903
00:46:39,805 --> 00:46:40,786
It was a great moment.

904
00:46:42,127 --> 00:46:42,387
Thank you.

905
00:46:43,187 --> 00:46:44,188
Well, oh, yes.

906
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:47,811
Just as a, you know, playing it a lot,

907
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:51,474
I always wondered if the reverse level was something that was a happy accident

908
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:53,815
or if it was something you planned from the beginning.

909
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:55,036
It was...

910
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:59,893
It's really see to the pants is we had, we did level two first,

911
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:03,174
and then we did level one, and then we progressed through the

912
00:47:03,214 --> 00:47:05,636
game, and when it got up time to level five, it's like, okay,

913
00:47:06,136 --> 00:47:11,179
they've seen all that stuff, how can we break the rules? And I'd

914
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:15,962
had a very relaxed weekend up in Mendocino or something, and I

915
00:47:16,002 --> 00:47:21,685
thought, hey, you know, go uphill. Not a very sophisticated

916
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:22,585
thought process, no.

917
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:28,054
So, related question.

918
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:32,516
How much tuning did you have to do on the levels

919
00:47:32,656 --> 00:47:35,258
after you made that initial prototype

920
00:47:35,298 --> 00:47:36,138
and put it in the game?

921
00:47:36,298 --> 00:47:38,139
Did you mostly get it right from the start?

922
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:39,940
Or did you find you had to do a lot of tuning

923
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,820
after you played it?

924
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,142
Yeah, it was a really cumbersome process

925
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:45,342
to create the arc word for this.

926
00:47:45,402 --> 00:47:47,663
So if we look at the second level, the blue level,

927
00:47:47,703 --> 00:47:50,545
you can see five rectangles at the top, which

928
00:47:50,585 --> 00:47:52,045
are sort of your opening shot of the level.

929
00:47:53,513 --> 00:47:55,794
pretty much every night for a week I tried some different

930
00:47:55,814 --> 00:47:59,117
graphic to make, try to make that pop better until Bob told

931
00:47:59,157 --> 00:48:01,818
me to just stop it and get on to the next part of the game.

932
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,061
I mean, very, it would have been so much easier if we'd

933
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:08,303
have gone with the original plan of the eyebrow butt style

934
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,704
hardware. We could have just typed it in and seen it live.

935
00:48:11,525 --> 00:48:11,745
Yeah.

936
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:16,949
But, but other things like, you know, the, I don't know,

937
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:19,470
I could imagine like the slope on the, you know, the,

938
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:23,296
you know, lines going down, or, you know,

939
00:48:23,316 --> 00:48:24,556
like the height of some of those bumps

940
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:25,536
that you would have to go over.

941
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:27,357
You know, is that stuff that needed to be tuned,

942
00:48:27,397 --> 00:48:30,237
or was that kind of mostly got it right from the start?

943
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:32,618
In general, there wasn't a whole lot of finesse to it

944
00:48:32,658 --> 00:48:33,878
beyond the width of the play field.

945
00:48:34,138 --> 00:48:35,798
And if you look at it, you got one square,

946
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:36,998
two square, or three squares,

947
00:48:37,078 --> 00:48:39,419
and two squares seemed to be about the right spot.

948
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:42,839
So, no, it wasn't particularly tricky.

949
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:44,900
More of the question was what was the shtick gonna be?

950
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,681
So why is that level going to be artistically different,

951
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:50,441
or what is the obstacle in your way?

952
00:48:50,983 --> 00:48:52,903
And the actual geometry of the play field

953
00:48:53,003 --> 00:48:54,824
doesn't figure into it too much.

954
00:48:58,765 --> 00:48:59,005
Thanks.

955
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:06,387
How long after you finished the arcade version of Marble Madness

956
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,948
did they come out with the version for the Amiga?

957
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:16,490
So we finished the arcade version in December of 1984.

958
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,591
And the Amiga version came out towards the end of 1985.

959
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,502
It took them roughly as long to convert it to the Amiga as it did for us to make it in

960
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:30,765
the first place because they weren't using the mighty power of the 7 megahertz, 68,000

961
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:31,765
and so on.

962
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:37,508
Ironically, EA was heavy duty into their electronic artists program.

963
00:49:37,528 --> 00:49:42,651
So if you open that up, the two guys who did the conversion are the featured artists.

964
00:49:43,852 --> 00:49:45,053
And just one more of these.

965
00:49:45,073 --> 00:49:45,693
I don't want to be bitter.

966
00:49:45,893 --> 00:49:49,715
Next year, Franz, please come and give a postmortem about Crystal Castles and talk about your

967
00:49:49,755 --> 00:49:50,255
experiences.

968
00:49:54,305 --> 00:50:03,269
EA had asked for permission to feature myself and Bob Flanagan and Sam Comstock in Marble Madness for the Amiga.

969
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:05,430
And it sold 500,000 or a million units.

970
00:50:07,011 --> 00:50:14,414
And Atari Management refused, saying that it was a corporate product and that they did not want any of their people featured in that way.

971
00:50:16,355 --> 00:50:17,075
Crazy. Thank you.

972
00:50:17,395 --> 00:50:19,876
All right, well, thank you very much for coming.
