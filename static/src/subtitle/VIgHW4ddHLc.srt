1
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:09,156
All right, let's get this started.

2
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:11,658
So, right after this talk,

3
00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:13,640
it's just gonna steamroll right into,

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,862
steamroll, you like that?

5
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:17,803
Plug, into Jaleel's part two, but.

6
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:19,984
Before that, Tricks of the Trade.

7
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:23,586
Last year, Tricks of the Trade was the number one rated talk

8
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:26,868
of the first two days of the bootcamp summit, everything.

9
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:29,349
It was great, it was amazing.

10
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:31,270
Alex did a great job setting it up.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,552
The baton was passed this year to Christian,

12
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:36,032
and he assembled a new group of people

13
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:38,514
to just rapid fire drop a ton of knowledge

14
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:39,634
and process into your brain.

15
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:41,035
So I'm gonna get out of the way

16
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:42,095
and let them do what they do.

17
00:00:42,095 --> 00:00:43,216
Give it up for the Tricks of the Trade.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,580
Oh my god, okay, alright.

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:51,900
Are you ready?

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,260
Okay.

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,721
Hi everyone, welcome to the second edition

22
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:59,202
of Tricks of the Trade.

23
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:00,802
My name's Christian Jeanjic

24
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:02,743
and I'm an animation director for Ubisoft.

25
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:04,864
And I'm gonna be your host today.

26
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,544
I've been lucky enough to work on various different studios

27
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:09,585
on games such as Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell,

28
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,526
and Watch Dogs 2, but basically I love gameplay animation,

29
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:13,766
which is why we're all here, right?

30
00:01:16,402 --> 00:01:18,242
I haven't got time for that.

31
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:21,643
Sat up here with me is an amazing diverse panel

32
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:23,663
of industry talent with over 70 years

33
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:25,144
of combined animation experience.

34
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:27,284
They're still hungry to learn and eager to share

35
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:28,344
their tips and tricks with you.

36
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:30,925
But first, a quick thank you.

37
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,365
You all clearly appreciated the fantastic content

38
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:35,226
in last year's Tricks of the Trade,

39
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:37,846
making it the number one animation talk at GDC.

40
00:01:37,846 --> 00:01:38,346
But why?

41
00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:42,891
Well, it's full of bite-sized pieces of animation gold,

42
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:44,773
tips from industry veterans that you could take

43
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:46,074
and immediately apply to your work

44
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:48,536
as soon as you leave this hall.

45
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:53,420
And of course, the presenters were pretty great as well.

46
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,222
But of course, and then, so this year,

47
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:58,003
we're returning with even more

48
00:01:58,003 --> 00:01:59,484
in 30 minutes of knowledge sharing

49
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,826
that will hopefully help you level up

50
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:02,987
your animation and industry skill.

51
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:07,523
Okay, the only way we're gonna develop as an industry

52
00:02:07,523 --> 00:02:09,184
is if we share and we pay it forward.

53
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,625
These tips have helped us speed up our daily workflow

54
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,286
that we've learned from our peers.

55
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:15,467
And so in the interest of sharing,

56
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:18,008
we hope this encourages you to share with us too.

57
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:19,709
So the format is pretty simple.

58
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:25,011
Six panelists, three tips each, five minutes a piece,

59
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,573
which means we're gonna be going pretty fast.

60
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:30,934
So don't worry about taking notes.

61
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,595
Everything's gonna be on the GDC Vault.

62
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,893
So buckle up and enjoy.

63
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:37,875
First up is gonna be Mario.

64
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:41,521
This is the Animation Bootcamp.

65
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,764
Tricks of the Trade, let's get started.

66
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:51,348
Oh my god, okay, I'm back, I'm up here again.

67
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:53,890
So, hi, I'm Mariel, I'm lead animator

68
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,811
and art director for Lab Zero Games.

69
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:57,352
We made a game called Skullgirls

70
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,713
and now we're making a game called Invisible.

71
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:03,796
My experience in game animation has been entirely in 2D,

72
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:06,378
but I think my tips today can help

73
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:07,818
all kinds of animators, hopefully.

74
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:10,740
So, since we're starting, this might be an obvious one,

75
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,282
but we could start with something basic.

76
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:17,692
This is a question I've gotten before, so I figure we can kind of cover it.

77
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:22,834
So when I start animating a new game character, the first thing I start with isn't a run,

78
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,955
an attack, or a jump, or anything like that.

79
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,835
It's the idle pose.

80
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:28,556
This is the root of all your animations.

81
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,316
This is where they start and end.

82
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,958
What should your idol pose look like though?

83
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,881
You can use the opportunity to get some personality in there,

84
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:40,025
but also you should keep in mind how the idol will connect to the rest of the character's animations.

85
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:43,468
For example, for our archer Zebe here,

86
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:47,591
we needed to make sure his moves matched the way he was holding the bow and arrow in his idol.

87
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:51,134
A lot of the concepts had him switching hands, so we needed to make sure they all lined up.

88
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:51,435
Did it switch? Okay.

89
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,075
Also important is to remember not just the idle animation itself, but the transition

90
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:01,896
to and from your idles.

91
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:05,460
Game animations are actually interrupting each other all the time because different

92
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,704
things are happening, so making sure that you return to that same base is going to help

93
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:12,466
your animation feel more seamless as they transition.

94
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:16,886
And especially in 2D, it's important to remember

95
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:18,707
that the idol itself is also a motion.

96
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:20,868
I think what can end up happening

97
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:23,409
if you don't pay attention is that you treat the idol

98
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:25,630
as a single pose and animate as if you're easing

99
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,231
into that single pose.

100
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,171
But since the idol itself is a motion,

101
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:31,132
you need to treat the start and ends

102
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:32,873
of all the animations connecting to it

103
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,494
as a continuous motion.

104
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:36,775
So you need to be aware of where you're coming from

105
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,936
and where you're going to as you animate moves

106
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:39,616
stemming from the idol.

107
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,892
So, tip number two.

108
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:46,935
At our studio, we've gone from making a fighting game

109
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:47,876
to a platforming RPG.

110
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:52,019
And they're both like games viewed from the side,

111
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,060
they kinda look the same,

112
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,902
so that means we can animate them the same, right?

113
00:04:55,902 --> 00:04:59,465
But actually, a key thing changed between our two games,

114
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,587
how far away the camera was.

115
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:03,028
In Skullgirls, our fighting game,

116
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:04,489
the characters are large on screen

117
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:07,192
because they essentially are the entire game.

118
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:09,153
Subtle touches came across in the animations

119
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:10,795
because they were just so big.

120
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:15,887
And then we started to animate our second game, Indivisible,

121
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:16,907
which is a platforming RPG.

122
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:20,509
And we actually quickly realized that we couldn't approach it

123
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:22,209
in exactly the same way.

124
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:24,690
We zoomed out the camera, and a lot of the detail

125
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,551
we had put into Skullgirl's characters

126
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:30,312
just became noise when viewed from the zoom in Indivisible.

127
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:31,973
So we had to simplify everything.

128
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:34,373
Our animations, our characters, we just kind of

129
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:36,234
had to re-look at what we were doing.

130
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:39,255
Subtle animations had to be exaggerated a lot more,

131
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,116
just so you could actually see them on the screen.

132
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,323
And this doesn't just apply to us.

133
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:47,004
What kind of game are you making?

134
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:49,485
Are you viewing your character from the side,

135
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,045
the top down, is it first person?

136
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:53,427
If you're working on something like League of Legends

137
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:55,707
or Diablo where your animations are viewed from above,

138
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:56,928
you might not see expressions

139
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:58,909
that you want to animate on the character.

140
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,030
You even need to approach your key poses differently

141
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,091
because your silhouette reads differently from the top.

142
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:07,972
If you're working on a first-person game and you can run right up to an NPC or a monster,

143
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:12,594
you might want to put facial animations or subtle idols in there to create better immersion in that

144
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:17,375
world. Or alternatively, how often are you even going to see the close-ups of the monsters you're

145
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,977
destroying? Do you even need to see that detail if you're always shooting them from 500 feet away?

146
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:26,799
It all depends on what you're making and how you can get your animation to best

147
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:29,299
serve how the player is going to be looking at it. Oops, I went too far.

148
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:36,669
Okay, so try animating something as simple

149
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,731
as turning around in place.

150
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,393
Do you just instinctively know where your feet go

151
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:42,494
and what they do?

152
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,776
Do you know where your shoulders and hips are?

153
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:46,717
Do you know where your head's looking?

154
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:47,458
Are your eyes open?

155
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,619
Are they closed?

156
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,921
If you know all this,

157
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:51,841
that's kind of amazing,

158
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:53,082
cause I don't know.

159
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:54,283
So whenever you can,

160
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:56,425
you need to act things out.

161
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:58,407
You need to get up out of your chair.

162
00:06:58,407 --> 00:06:59,107
I know it's hard.

163
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:02,330
And you need to act out the motion you're trying to make.

164
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:09,326
It helps so much to really feel the motion you're trying to animate in your own body.

165
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:12,910
Act out what you're trying to do and feel where you're putting your weight, which is

166
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,272
so so important in animation.

167
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:19,496
And you can also record yourself or your friends or take photos of poses like this stupid one

168
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:19,977
of me here.

169
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:25,899
For example, for this move in particular,

170
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:28,480
we had an idea of the poses we wanted to hit,

171
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,462
but figuring out how they connected was difficult.

172
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:34,463
And the solution was just to get up and try it ourselves,

173
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:35,944
like you see here.

174
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:38,466
It's things like this that maybe you could figure out

175
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:39,886
if you just kind of sat at your desk

176
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:41,767
and thought about it for a long time.

177
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:44,629
But even then, I still don't think you'd arrive

178
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,209
at a convincing result.

179
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,352
You really need to feel and understand the subtleties of the motion you're trying to recreate on screen,

180
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:54,513
and to do that you have to get up out of your chair and just do it.

181
00:07:54,513 --> 00:07:55,934
And that's it for me! Next we have Zach!

182
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:56,154
APPLAUSE

183
00:07:56,154 --> 00:08:07,760
Sorry, I have to make this slightly bigger because I'm going blind.

184
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:07,820
Uh...

185
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:12,419
Hello, I'm Zach Lowry.

186
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,942
I'm a senior animator and designer at BossKey Productions,

187
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:18,644
working on the competitive first-person shooter LawBreakers.

188
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:21,646
So I've been deemed the guy that's gonna talk

189
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:22,687
about first-person tips,

190
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:25,289
and having me follow Matt Boehm today is kinda cruel,

191
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:27,771
but I'm gonna do my best and probably echo

192
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:29,493
some of the stuff that he talked about.

193
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:33,354
So before joining BossKey, I was at Volition for 10 years

194
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:36,334
and I worked on the entirety of the Saints Row franchise

195
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:38,775
and that was a third person open world game.

196
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:42,415
So for the last two years, I've been working

197
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,476
on the majority of first person stuff

198
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,816
and today I want to focus my tips on things

199
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:48,937
that can help people transitioning from third person

200
00:08:48,937 --> 00:08:52,137
to first person because you definitely have to approach this

201
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:54,118
from a different perspective.

202
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,338
No, no laughs, all right.

203
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:57,198
It's, phew.

204
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:00,643
Yeah, you get it now.

205
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:04,005
All right, so third person animation setup.

206
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:07,126
We've all animated typical third person setup.

207
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:12,328
The root drives the center of mass, the weapon is constrained to the hand, and the hand drives

208
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:12,548
the weapon.

209
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:16,909
In third person, you're animating character first and the weapon is secondary.

210
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:18,310
I'm off already.

211
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,732
You're animating the character first and the weapon is secondary.

212
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:30,048
Okay, so, but when you set this up in first person,

213
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:33,050
you get this interesting center of mass

214
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,371
of the weapon is off screen.

215
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:36,413
So if you're trying to do like, you know,

216
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:40,396
subtle movements or bounces and things like that,

217
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:43,399
your center of mass is off screen.

218
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,380
So it throws off your rotations,

219
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,923
and you start having to do a lot of counter animation

220
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:50,425
to get it to rotate from the correct standpoint.

221
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:53,207
So Matt kind of touched on some of this.

222
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:55,048
What you want to do in first person,

223
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:57,389
is let the weapon drive.

224
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,014
So in a typical first person setup,

225
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:04,259
what I would recommend is the weapon as the character.

226
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:04,800
Treat it that way.

227
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,362
It's what you're gonna see on screen.

228
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,681
The hands set them to weapon space.

229
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:12,162
So when I do my animation,

230
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:14,683
I'm animating from the weapon center of mass

231
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:17,104
and I can set that up to be where I want it

232
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:18,064
relative to the screen.

233
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:21,026
So that way, when I start doing subtle motions,

234
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:23,507
like the one that I showed earlier,

235
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:26,468
you can see that my center of mass is on the screen

236
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:29,049
and I'm not fighting this as I'm doing like settles

237
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:30,030
and things like that.

238
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,810
So when I show these things side by side,

239
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,851
you can see that you get a nice,

240
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:36,706
nice rotation point from the screen.

241
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,027
And then you can play around with this

242
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:41,228
and you can set up your weapons to be however you want,

243
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:44,470
but you're not getting this odd rotation from the hand.

244
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,311
And your rotations start off clean

245
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:49,652
and you don't have your hand angled at some weird thing

246
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,033
and that's your starting pose.

247
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:55,455
It may seem like a dumb moment, but it's pretty helpful.

248
00:10:55,455 --> 00:11:01,518
So my second one, I came across this quote from J.K. Rieke.

249
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:08,357
Your job as an animator is to present things clearly as possible for the audience,

250
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:11,499
so that nothing gets in the way of their entertainment.

251
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:15,982
It might look very visually interesting to have some fancy camera move

252
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:19,364
while the character is dashing down a hallway towards impending doom,

253
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:21,986
but if it loses the audience, the shot will be a failure.

254
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:24,908
So keep it simple and keep it clear. It will still look cool.

255
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:29,212
As I read this, it really hit home to me about first person

256
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:32,454
because as Matt pointed out, we have staging,

257
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:34,496
which is something that's kind of rare in game animation.

258
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:36,417
We know where the camera is and we can act,

259
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,119
do our performance to that.

260
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:41,982
But we need to make sure that we're not making the audience sick

261
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:44,083
or that we're not doing something that distracts

262
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,304
from what's actually happening.

263
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,007
So keep it simple, keep it clear.

264
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:50,889
You don't want that.

265
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,330
Do not over design the action.

266
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:56,378
Don't rush the key information,

267
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:59,100
and do not put style ahead of readability.

268
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,042
It's something that's really difficult to do.

269
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:03,604
When you first jump in to first person,

270
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:05,605
all you wanna do is do the coolest thing possible,

271
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:06,286
and you've got this gun,

272
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:08,247
and you're gonna spin it and flip it.

273
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:09,588
But if you're doing these complex actions

274
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:11,309
and people can't follow what's happening,

275
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:15,612
you're gonna lose out on the audience very quickly.

276
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:16,673
But what you do wanna do

277
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:21,757
is simplify the action into what I call key beats.

278
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:25,549
Use holds for understanding.

279
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:27,732
It typically takes four to six frames

280
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:30,555
for the viewer to absorb information.

281
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:31,956
And then apply style to the beats.

282
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:34,499
And what I mean by style is your character

283
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:35,940
or the weapon's personality.

284
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,198
And then clarity is king.

285
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:39,720
It's the most important thing.

286
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,083
So this is an animation that I did

287
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,367
for this like kind of futuristic gunslinger guy.

288
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:47,668
And I think it kind of represents

289
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,150
everything that I was talking about.

290
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,632
You can see the chamber opening

291
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:53,155
when the gun's energy core depletes.

292
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:56,138
The gun winds up to repower the core

293
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:57,820
and then the chamber closes with a snap.

294
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:01,179
So what I did is I identified these key beats,

295
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:04,341
and then with it being this idea of a futuristic gunslinger

296
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:06,683
and like this techno revolver,

297
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,624
I applied the style to those beats.

298
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:10,465
So instead of the chord just opening up

299
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:12,366
and then going back in, he spins it around,

300
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:16,929
flips it, kind of snaps it back in.

301
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,731
And lastly, layers are for detail.

302
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:24,786
So this is a simple tip that our lead animator at BossKey

303
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:27,269
shared with me when I first came on board.

304
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:29,091
And I was just getting started in first person.

305
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:31,674
And honestly, I think it applies to first person,

306
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:34,777
third person, or just animation in general.

307
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:37,320
It's a simple no-brainer, but sometimes you gloss over

308
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,821
things like this.

309
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:41,184
But use your layers for the details,

310
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:43,587
and the details are what brings your animations to life.

311
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:50,145
So this is an example of a gun that I designed,

312
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:52,346
worked with a concept artist.

313
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:54,147
Same character, he's got two guns,

314
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,669
and he's gotta reload them independently

315
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,490
because while this one's reloading, he can shoot,

316
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,791
so he can't use both of his hands.

317
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,792
So we had to design these guns to be reloaded

318
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,073
without touching them with another hand.

319
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:08,055
So in this animation, it's super simple.

320
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,036
The gun just lifts up, it holds it there

321
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:12,677
so that you can see that it's got a 3D printer

322
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:15,098
that's printing a new ammo brick

323
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:16,419
so that it can continue shooting.

324
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,126
I really dig this, I think it's awesome,

325
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,634
but as far as animation goes, it's really simple.

326
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:23,881
So what I do is.

327
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:28,418
I don't have as many layers as Matt.

328
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:32,199
But this is a super simplified example.

329
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:39,162
So what I use my base layer for is for my foundational movement on my overall timing,

330
00:14:39,162 --> 00:14:42,783
the big motions, and the base of the idea and getting that across.

331
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:47,445
I go through that, I get that in, I put it in game because as you probably heard today,

332
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,646
get it in game as soon as possible.

333
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:52,367
Get it in game, start getting feedback.

334
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:52,487
But

335
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:55,088
going back to the animation, is super simple,

336
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:57,189
but what brought that to life was the details,

337
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,550
how the gun shakes when the ammo prints.

338
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,931
And I knew there was gonna be a lot of iteration

339
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:04,391
on getting that to feel right.

340
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:05,252
Does it need to feel heavy?

341
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,953
Does it need to feel like it's rapidly printing?

342
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,413
I was gonna play around with it a lot.

343
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:14,395
So then, that's my basic, you know,

344
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:16,896
non-exciting curves for my big motion.

345
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:17,996
But it gets the job done.

346
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:21,697
And then I come in with my detail layer,

347
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:26,961
and I add in these tiny curves that show

348
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:28,802
how fast it shakes or whatever.

349
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,085
But what this allows me to do is keep my big curves big,

350
00:15:32,085 --> 00:15:35,127
and my little curves little, and then I can go in there,

351
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:37,108
and I can easily tweak how it's shaking,

352
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:38,429
or rocking, and things like that.

353
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:41,452
And I can play around with the overall weight

354
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:43,033
and feel of the gun without upsetting the timing

355
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:43,753
and things like that.

356
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,480
So those are my three tips.

357
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,643
They're pretty simple, but when you start getting

358
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:52,825
into first person, if you've never done it before,

359
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:56,528
it can be really just overwhelming at times

360
00:15:56,528 --> 00:16:00,131
because as Matt was showing and I learned very quickly,

361
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:02,373
we're stretching and cheating things all over the place,

362
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:04,735
but as an animator that's working in third person,

363
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:07,497
like you don't even know that you can do that.

364
00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:09,899
And then when people are like, oh no, break the arms,

365
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,681
snap the elbow, like do whatever you want,

366
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:12,661
like it becomes really.

367
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:16,079
freeing that I don't have to worry about, you know,

368
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,421
two-thirds of the body.

369
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:28,546
Yeah, that's it, and I'm gonna pass it off to Young.

370
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:29,726
What's up, guys?

371
00:16:29,726 --> 00:16:33,408
All right, so I'm Young Vo, Animation Lead

372
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:36,150
for Sparky Pants, not Spanky Pants.

373
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,492
Currently working on Drop Zone.

374
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:42,273
Check it out, great game.

375
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:46,676
All right, first tip.

376
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,977
Don't start your hit reacts from the idle.

377
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:53,280
I learned this when I was working on Reckoning.

378
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,982
So we all know that video game is different from film.

379
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,423
Video games is linear.

380
00:16:58,423 --> 00:16:59,543
I mean, sorry.

381
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:00,324
Film is linear.

382
00:17:00,324 --> 00:17:02,865
Video game is more like a jigsaw puzzle.

383
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:05,087
All the animations have to fit within each other, right?

384
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:05,667
They have to connect.

385
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:09,990
Now hit reacts are a little unique.

386
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:14,417
that hit reacts have to, they need to feel satisfying

387
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:17,657
and responsive, right?

388
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:21,858
And most new animators will automatically animate

389
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:26,399
the hit react starting from idle to hit frame

390
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:28,700
to recovery, settle, back into idle again.

391
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,680
That's how they think they should animate it.

392
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,741
But when you do that, the result is kind of sluggish.

393
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:36,901
It feels kind of slow, right?

394
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:40,602
Okay.

395
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:40,762
So.

396
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,462
As you can see here, the animation right there,

397
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:47,784
I mean, it's not the fault of the attack

398
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:48,404
that makes it feel slow.

399
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:51,647
Because you look, the attack feels like

400
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:53,128
it's not really making contact.

401
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:55,450
It feels a little sluggish, right?

402
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:03,476
But we start the animation for the attack later

403
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:05,638
at the recovery pose.

404
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:08,801
Instantly, the player will see the attack.

405
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,983
Visually, the attack is gonna be.

406
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:15,127
Sorry, the react will be much bigger.

407
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,911
The pose is bigger, you start from the recovery pose.

408
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:22,593
So it's gonna be a much clearer read, quick and clear.

409
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:28,598
So as you can see there, same attack,

410
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:31,361
but a bigger, but the reaction started later,

411
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,904
so it feels bigger, the impact is huge.

412
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:37,966
The bigger you push the reaction pose,

413
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,588
or the recovery pose, the bigger the action.

414
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:41,229
I mean, the bigger,

415
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,690
the attack will feel.

416
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,271
And I always tell people,

417
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:46,751
push this pose as big as you can,

418
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,552
because if you want it to be impactful, make it big.

419
00:18:49,552 --> 00:18:53,233
That's tip number one, you're welcome.

420
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:57,634
Tip number two.

421
00:18:57,634 --> 00:19:02,995
So this is a typical take that we see all animators do.

422
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:05,116
We have anticipation, we have an overshoot,

423
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:06,376
and then an action.

424
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:09,377
Perfectly normal.

425
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:14,389
The problem is, the majority of the time when you do this,

426
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:17,170
you don't know why the character's doing it, right?

427
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,030
This is what we normally see in games.

428
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,572
Character stands around, player comes in,

429
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:25,132
and he just freaks out.

430
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:25,852
Like, just freaks out.

431
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:27,773
Like, why are you here, ah!

432
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:28,713
Right?

433
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:32,515
We don't know why he's freaking out.

434
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:32,755
So.

435
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:37,447
What I tell young animators is to...

436
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:39,208
Now this is mainly for NPCs,

437
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,110
and it depends on gameplay, of course.

438
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,132
But if you add a decision pose, a recognition pose,

439
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:50,575
a pose where basically tells the viewer

440
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:51,876
why he's reacting this way.

441
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:55,659
A teacher of mine at CalArts told me

442
00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:01,082
that acting is reaction, is not action.

443
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,023
So how your character reacts to something

444
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:04,064
tells you who they are.

445
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:11,304
Now this is very subtle, and depending on gameplay,

446
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:14,125
you can spend more time in the decision post,

447
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,386
give it more character.

448
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:17,927
This is where you wanna add personality

449
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:21,629
and subtext to your character, before the anticipation.

450
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:22,990
People always ask me,

451
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,791
how do I give it more personality and character?

452
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,372
You do it before the anticipation,

453
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:29,433
you do it before he actually does something.

454
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:33,875
All right.

455
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,996
Oh, sorry, you're welcome.

456
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:41,338
Tip number three, use your hand as reference.

457
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,440
Now I learned this the hard way.

458
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,163
When you get a weird, crazy creature

459
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,584
and you spend all this time trying to find

460
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:50,385
the perfect reference, you're like,

461
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:53,868
I need to find an animal with 20 tentacles,

462
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:56,730
a large mouth, eight horns, and it's like,

463
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,232
can't find that, that just doesn't exist.

464
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:03,175
And if you guys seen that, run away.

465
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:06,198
So, use your hand as reference.

466
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:11,530
And how you want to use your hand as reference is basically

467
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,615
you want to figure out the center of gravity.

468
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:16,993
You want to figure out the weight.

469
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:18,734
You want to figure out how it's going to be moving,

470
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:21,494
how the weight is being pushed, pulled,

471
00:21:21,494 --> 00:21:24,035
how the weight is going to shift, how it's going to settle.

472
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:27,016
Once you figure that out as animators,

473
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:28,836
the body mechanics just follows, right?

474
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:31,537
Because that's the core of animation.

475
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:33,898
If we figure out the timing and spacing,

476
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:35,638
we can figure out the rest.

477
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:38,379
And I use my hands just to block things out a lot,

478
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:39,959
just so I can get it out of there.

479
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,600
So I figure that out quick,

480
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,660
and then I can just block out the animation.

481
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:55,500
All right, this is an animation I did for Drop Zone.

482
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,483
And I couldn't find reference for this guy, so yeah.

483
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:02,144
And yes, those hands are mine.

484
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:02,564
You're welcome.

485
00:22:02,564 --> 00:22:04,886
I'm gonna hand it off to John.

486
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,211
All right, I'm gonna try to go pretty quickly here,

487
00:22:15,211 --> 00:22:16,432
so bear with me.

488
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:17,673
My name is Jean-Paul Rheinmiller.

489
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:20,315
I am the lead Cinematics Animator at Vicarious Visions,

490
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:25,058
currently working on Insane Trilogy and,

491
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:26,359
oh, thanks, and Destiny.

492
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:30,542
So my first tip is a technique I learned

493
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:36,526
from a supervisor of mine at Rhythm and Hues Studios,

494
00:22:36,526 --> 00:22:38,808
Tim Pixen, and it's called swing sets.

495
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,211
So I'm gonna go and try to do a condensed version

496
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:44,873
of this process here, so bear with me,

497
00:22:44,873 --> 00:22:47,754
and if you have any questions about it, hit me up later.

498
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:49,295
This was a traditional technique that they used

499
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:51,397
in television shows back in the day

500
00:22:51,397 --> 00:22:55,299
where they had a limited number of mouth shapes.

501
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:58,241
Basic set of 12 shapes here

502
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:00,202
helps you quickly create organic lip sync

503
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:02,964
without having to do a ton of cleanup at the end.

504
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,925
You can use more or less than 12,

505
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,686
but the basic idea is to start with 12.

506
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:11,055
It's important to note here that these are not phonemes.

507
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,075
So they're not individual shapes that are crafted

508
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:13,876
and then plugged in.

509
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,716
These shapes are built together,

510
00:23:15,716 --> 00:23:17,577
so they move in and out of each other organically.

511
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:21,838
They feel like they're swinging from one shape to the next.

512
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:24,278
And with many games not having blend shapes

513
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,779
and a ton of bones in the face,

514
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:27,979
this process, once it's set up,

515
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:28,799
can help save a ton of time

516
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,120
and also keep consistency among your animation team.

517
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,021
So if you look at it, the flow of the mouth

518
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:36,901
from the M to the UR follows the natural arc of the jaw.

519
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:41,104
And as the mouth opens, the jaw goes back in,

520
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:43,786
down and back, and as it closes, it goes up and in.

521
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:45,247
But now's not the time to get cocky.

522
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:47,589
But now's not the time to get cocky.

523
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:49,570
Sorry, I know that's loud.

524
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,472
But now's not the time to get cocky.

525
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,553
Thank you.

526
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:56,455
So the basic idea here is to listen to your dialogue clip,

527
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:58,456
find out where your swing set shapes will be.

528
00:23:58,456 --> 00:24:02,079
When writing it down, you know, and looking at my chart,

529
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,520
those are the shapes that I came up with here.

530
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:06,748
but now's not the time.

531
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:10,210
And these can vary as well and combine T and L,

532
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,970
but again, this is a great starting point.

533
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,012
To get, but now's not the time.

534
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:17,413
Now using my pre-built shapes,

535
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:20,134
go based off of the breakdown sheet that you guys just saw.

536
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:21,934
I take these in and I put them in for blocking.

537
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:23,975
It took me a little bit less than five minutes.

538
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:25,576
Now this is obviously a smaller clip

539
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:27,117
and you can start to see the value of this

540
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:28,937
if you get a much larger dialogue clip.

541
00:24:28,937 --> 00:24:31,558
To break this down just a little bit more here.

542
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:37,264
A quick example would be that I have the O in two

543
00:24:37,264 --> 00:24:40,808
and it goes directly into the TK and to get.

544
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:42,750
So I look at the chart and I say,

545
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,392
I need a breakdown in between here

546
00:24:44,392 --> 00:24:47,075
because these shapes are too far apart from each other.

547
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:48,616
So I have to have a breakdown

548
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:50,679
to make that smooth transition.

549
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:52,621
I look at this way here and...

550
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:57,731
I'm not getting it here because the way the jaw is moving,

551
00:24:57,731 --> 00:24:59,411
it's going in or up and in.

552
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:02,073
And so then I take a look over here,

553
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:03,954
this is gonna get the drop in the jaw

554
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:05,314
that I think that I want.

555
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:07,075
So I'm gonna go with the eye here.

556
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:09,356
But now's not the time to get cocky.

557
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:11,917
But now's not the time to get cocky.

558
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:13,758
Super simple, but again, you can see

559
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:15,078
if this was a much larger dialogue

560
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:18,580
and you're plopping in your shapes,

561
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,421
how much it could actually help.

562
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:23,322
So with and without, I don't have the audio here.

563
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:27,289
Another great thing about this technique here

564
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:29,029
is that the curves tend to flow really nicely

565
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,790
in your graph editor and potential issues

566
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,990
are really easy to identify.

567
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,331
Tip number two, other great, sorry, here we go.

568
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:36,991
Keep your shapes simple.

569
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:39,952
You can communicate wonders with just a few shapes.

570
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:42,013
Many times, characters will only have a few shapes

571
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:43,193
that they move through.

572
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:45,774
Skinner here in Ratatouille really only has three shapes

573
00:25:45,774 --> 00:25:48,154
that he moves through, especially when you pay attention

574
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:49,535
to the corners of the mouth.

575
00:25:49,535 --> 00:25:52,155
He works within those shapes as he talks throughout the film.

576
00:25:54,143 --> 00:25:55,444
Simplify your shapes.

577
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:58,166
You don't want to constantly be moving to extremes

578
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,007
with your lip sync.

579
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:02,170
It should be motivated by an accent

580
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,651
or by an expression change.

581
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:04,711
And this is a great example here

582
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:08,514
with the woman even though you can't hear her,

583
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:10,656
she stays in a certain range

584
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:13,138
and it's not until she accents that her mouth

585
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,639
actually goes outside of that range.

586
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:18,448
The corners of the mouth are the first place

587
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:20,029
that I usually can see it.

588
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:22,931
So if you move through too many shapes

589
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:24,111
and constantly go in and out,

590
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:25,652
it'll look too busy and overcomplicated.

591
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:28,353
So think of it like you do your performance.

592
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,154
You want a rhythm and a flow to your performance

593
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:32,435
and your lip sync is just one layer of that performance.

594
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:33,455
So treat it like that.

595
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:34,536
Track the arcs of the mouth.

596
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:38,458
This example from Leica here has a really great flow

597
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,839
to the corners of the mouth as they go in prototype here

598
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:44,861
and it adds a great level of appeal to your lip sync.

599
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,602
And last tip is change the shape of your blinks

600
00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:51,783
on its way up to help it feel a little bit more fleshed out.

601
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:55,084
This is a blink with the lids very linear, closed and open.

602
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:59,785
You can see here on the way down and up, very linear.

603
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,866
With just a small adjustment, lots of times I start

604
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:04,686
with the center of the lid and I drag that just a little bit.

605
00:27:04,686 --> 00:27:07,847
You can play with that based on the size of your character.

606
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:11,568
With wider, obviously, eyes or narrower eyes,

607
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:13,549
you may have to increase that drag a little bit.

608
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:16,159
Here you can see it with just that subtle change.

609
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,422
It gives the eye region a bit more fleshed out feeling.

610
00:27:18,422 --> 00:27:20,885
It can create a peel effect like you do with your lip sync.

611
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:22,327
It's a great thing to think about in polish

612
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:24,009
and obviously you're seeing this very close up

613
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,593
so as your characters get a bit farther away from camera,

614
00:27:27,593 --> 00:27:29,896
it can start to look better on screen.

615
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:30,737
And next up is Ellie.

616
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:41,485
Hi, my name is Almudena Soria and I'm a lead animator at Naughty Dog.

617
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:45,228
I've been making games since 2001.

618
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:53,356
So my first tip is about how to be more efficient with debugging and problem solving animations in the game.

619
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:56,359
So programmers are often really busy people.

620
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:01,884
So before coming to them with a problem, we should make sure we have checked that nothing is obviously wrong with our animations.

621
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,412
Check that your frame ranges are correct,

622
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:06,873
that you're using the right skeleton,

623
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:08,614
and that the Maya file exists.

624
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:10,116
All the obvious things that could be wrong

625
00:28:10,116 --> 00:28:12,057
in your animation pipeline.

626
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,659
So once you check all your assets,

627
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,062
would you go and look for help?

628
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,103
Not yet.

629
00:28:18,103 --> 00:28:21,526
So don't present problems, offer solutions.

630
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:24,008
It's often more time consuming

631
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:27,170
of presenting a problem with a no solution.

632
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,271
But to offer solutions,

633
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:29,993
you need to understand how things work.

634
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,795
So here are just a few things you can do to narrow problems down.

635
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:38,098
Note what is getting exported into the game.

636
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:40,679
Not always what you see in Maya is what you export.

637
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,362
Some studios use proxy rigs that drive the skeleton that gets into the game.

638
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:47,483
Sometimes you don't see this by default.

639
00:28:47,483 --> 00:28:49,104
So make sure you check this skeleton.

640
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:54,267
Game route, align, route, ground node, trajectory, magic box.

641
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:58,929
It can have many names, but there is always a node that drives the character.

642
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:00,090
It's like its parent.

643
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,632
It's usually used to adjust character to the ground,

644
00:29:03,632 --> 00:29:05,573
drive collision, blends.

645
00:29:05,573 --> 00:29:07,375
Animation in this node is really important,

646
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,896
and it can be the main cause of bugs.

647
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:12,098
Avoid sudden movements with it.

648
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:13,078
Check for smooth rotations.

649
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:16,861
Check how many rotation degrees it has.

650
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:18,562
So most places I've worked on,

651
00:29:18,562 --> 00:29:20,383
I've tried to find an automated solution,

652
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,205
but in my experience, it's always better when it's hand animated.

653
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:29,054
Disable all procedure animation, ground adjust, weapon, feed IK, physics.

654
00:29:29,054 --> 00:29:33,597
By doing so, step by step, you can narrow the course of the problem

655
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:37,420
and understand how these things work on top of your animations.

656
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:43,324
Other things you can do is disable or lower the compression and detach the camera.

657
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,485
My second tip is about layer animations.

658
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:51,535
Games use layer animations for a lot of features like hit reactions, aim.

659
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:57,124
Usually design requires this kind of animations because they are not meant to interrupt locomotion.

660
00:29:57,124 --> 00:30:00,710
These animations are not easiest to make pretty.

661
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:06,769
But I think we should push the use of these animations to help a storytelling and character development.

662
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:10,471
Partial and additives are a great way of bringing character to life.

663
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:15,674
You can modify a whole moveset with just an additive and transmit the feelings of that character at that particular time.

664
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:22,017
You can also give characters their own actions, something they're interesting they would do.

665
00:30:22,017 --> 00:30:25,599
Another great use of partial and additives is to integrate

666
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,361
characters with environment like rain, vegetation,

667
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,341
touching the environment.

668
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:38,009
And finally, another thing you can use layer animations for is contextual outfit animations.

669
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:49,940
Here you can see an example of a fight sequence with and without layer animation.

670
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:56,238
And my last tip is real-time physics.

671
00:30:56,238 --> 00:31:01,801
Considering real-time physics on top of your animations

672
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:03,061
were never suitable.

673
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,442
Use it as a way of enhancing your animations

674
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:06,182
and not to replace it.

675
00:31:06,182 --> 00:31:10,744
Physics give a realistic feel to the animations

676
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:11,845
when they are set up right.

677
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:15,230
It allows for overlapping and secondary motion

678
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,251
when animations have to be interrupted.

679
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,772
It also provides a layer of realism.

680
00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:22,673
Animators should be involved when setting this physics up

681
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,834
to make sure our animations look the best.

682
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,635
And if you wanna know more about this,

683
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,336
check Michal Mack talk on Thursday.

684
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:28,616
Next.

685
00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:31,257
Next.

686
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:31,757
Go, go, go.

687
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:31,797
Go.

688
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:31,857
Go.

689
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:31,897
Go.

690
00:31:31,897 --> 00:31:36,679
I've gotta go really quick.

691
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,511
Hot mic.

692
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:41,433
Okay, so my first tip is something I learned

693
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,355
from my first animation director in Montreal.

694
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:45,216
Comfort.

695
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:47,017
I look for this when reviewing my animator's work.

696
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:48,558
It isn't about how comfortable the chair is

697
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:49,519
or if you need a hug.

698
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,262
It's the understanding of body mechanics and readability.

699
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:54,402
So.

700
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:56,499
There we go.

701
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,921
Dynamic poses can also be comfortable,

702
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:00,542
but it is understanding the limits of a limb

703
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,903
and that everything is connected

704
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:03,565
that determine how far it can be pushed.

705
00:32:03,565 --> 00:32:05,166
What is driving the intention

706
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,027
and the purpose of the movement?

707
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:08,849
Are you crouching, reaching,

708
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:11,111
reaching for something, or is it just a reaction?

709
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:12,952
Unfortunately, this is something

710
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:14,233
that's gotten a little lost

711
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,615
in many animation reels that I've seen.

712
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:18,096
So unless we had tons of constraints

713
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:19,497
on our rigs to automate this,

714
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:20,939
which can remove control,

715
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,080
our rigs will allow this to happen.

716
00:32:24,015 --> 00:32:26,656
But be careful of extensive handle dragging

717
00:32:26,656 --> 00:32:28,357
to get bones into position.

718
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:30,258
All too often I see animations that you can tell

719
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:32,899
have been animated exclusively this way.

720
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:33,959
Break down your thought process.

721
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:38,361
Animate through the bones, moving through the chain.

722
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:39,962
Thinking of what is driving the action.

723
00:32:39,962 --> 00:32:41,523
If you're reaching for something,

724
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:42,944
drive the joints towards the object.

725
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:43,804
Don't just pull them.

726
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:45,765
Use connecting bones such as the shoulder and torso.

727
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:47,806
Be careful of isolating movements.

728
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,212
Both of these poses get the head to the desired position, but the one on the right feels much more natural.

729
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:58,254
Now the reason for this is a comfortable pose will dissipate the position through multiple bones,

730
00:32:58,254 --> 00:33:00,515
even down to the arms and the hips providing balance.

731
00:33:00,515 --> 00:33:03,536
A good sense of weight distribution and balance will help bring a subtle quality

732
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:06,618
that helps make your animation feel much more believable.

733
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:14,061
Notice a slight lean before the first step and a subtle weight shift from back foot to front foot before the push.

734
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:16,952
Check out the slight rotation on the hips

735
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:19,533
and the transfer of weight over to the right foot.

736
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:22,575
That provides the power to continue the push.

737
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:23,656
When the hips move down,

738
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:25,617
the head and shoulders remain stable.

739
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:27,618
Remember, everything is connected.

740
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:30,560
So, understanding these mechanics

741
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,061
allows you to break these rules

742
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:33,221
when something extra is needed,

743
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:35,743
such as hyperextending joints at a point of impact,

744
00:33:35,743 --> 00:33:37,724
but you should only use this for brief periods of time.

745
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,825
This is backed up by Amy Drobek-Jones' tip

746
00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:41,766
from last year's Tricks Talk, so go check it out.

747
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:45,568
So gameplay animation also needs to be readable

748
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:47,151
as the action is supposed to be.

749
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,454
This applies when manipulating mocap

750
00:33:49,454 --> 00:33:50,656
just as much as key framing.

751
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:53,080
The timing on these animations is almost identical

752
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,421
but the animation on the right benefits

753
00:33:54,421 --> 00:33:56,024
from an animator pushing almost every aspect

754
00:33:56,024 --> 00:33:58,648
whilst maintaining the integrity of the motion.

755
00:34:01,847 --> 00:34:04,408
For example, clear lines of action on attacks.

756
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:06,769
The left arm through the shoulders to the right hand

757
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:08,550
highlights the location of where the hit will land.

758
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,752
Combine this with a more aggressive yank

759
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:14,233
back and to the right, enhancing the pose,

760
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:17,795
which adds more emphasis to key areas of the move.

761
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:19,416
Finally, improve contacts,

762
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:23,198
making a move much more dynamic and readable,

763
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:24,619
proving that even with great mocap

764
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:27,720
can be vastly improved by a good animator.

765
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:31,338
So my second tip is use slow motion.

766
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:33,220
Now not just because everything looks cool in slow motion,

767
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,502
it also has its practical uses.

768
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:38,684
I learned this when working on trailers for Assassin's Creed.

769
00:34:38,684 --> 00:34:41,026
The team wanted to capture everything in super slow motion

770
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:43,688
but it highlighted any tiny errors in the animation

771
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:45,249
which might usually be covered.

772
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,231
At that point in my career, I found it hard

773
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:51,374
to see smaller issues during general playback.

774
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:53,876
So scrubbing back and forth would highlight

775
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:55,617
some of these errors but wouldn't give

776
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:57,359
a true representation of what it would look like

777
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:57,859
in the trailers.

778
00:34:59,153 --> 00:35:01,314
So I started playing animation back at a quarter speed

779
00:35:01,314 --> 00:35:03,155
to emphasize the issues,

780
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:05,636
and it actually makes it easier to fix,

781
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,137
allowing me to spin around and see everything

782
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:08,518
much, much clearer.

783
00:35:08,518 --> 00:35:11,780
So for extra clarity, I turn on frames and ticks.

784
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,460
Yeah, I use 3ds Max,

785
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,322
which let you scrub areas in super slow motion.

786
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,583
I'd use this to highlight a point to my team

787
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,004
that was hard to see in real time.

788
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,465
Maybe the arc of a junk locks off,

789
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:24,026
the weight shift maybe is too aggressive.

790
00:35:24,026 --> 00:35:25,487
Play your animation in super slow motion,

791
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:27,008
and you'll be surprised at what you actually see.

792
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,641
but be careful of extensive timing changes.

793
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:34,483
This is a pass I will do more towards polish stage.

794
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:36,504
So my third and final tip is how does it feel?

795
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:39,386
Gameplay animation is not just about looking good.

796
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:41,367
I firmly believe that an animator's job

797
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:43,808
is only half done when you export an animation.

798
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,769
Working gameplay is rarely about

799
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:46,950
the animation you're working on.

800
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,812
More often than not, it's about the animation

801
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:52,833
before and after, and these are just as important,

802
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,995
giving much more context to the current move.

803
00:35:56,137 --> 00:36:00,019
When, with each animation, ask yourself these questions.

804
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,581
How will it be perceived by the player?

805
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:03,022
Does it read well?

806
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:06,664
Does it look and feel good when interacting with it?

807
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,787
Does the look match the purpose?

808
00:36:09,787 --> 00:36:11,628
Should I take control away from the player?

809
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,310
If so, when do I get it back?

810
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:18,012
When can I interrupt the animation and does it feel right?

811
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,333
And what is the most common animation

812
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,035
before and after this one?

813
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:22,596
Is it worth creating a custom transition?

814
00:36:24,072 --> 00:36:26,553
This will vastly improve how your animation feels.

815
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:29,014
Block it out, export it, and get it how you think

816
00:36:29,014 --> 00:36:30,215
it will work in the game.

817
00:36:30,215 --> 00:36:31,736
Play it, play it again.

818
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:34,057
Give the controller to someone else.

819
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:34,777
Watch how they play it.

820
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:38,779
Always ask, how does it feel?

821
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:45,542
Make adjustments, re-export, test, adjust, and repeat.

822
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:47,703
This applies to any animation or system

823
00:36:47,703 --> 00:36:49,163
you can expect a player to interact with.

824
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:52,868
Understand what your game designers actually want.

825
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:53,628
Talk to them.

826
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,750
Gameplay animation is a collaborative process.

827
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,931
Find your natural rhythm and flow

828
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:00,373
and your game will feel much better for it.

829
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:04,216
And as many of us said before, get it in the game.

830
00:37:04,216 --> 00:37:07,899
So that's Tricks of the Trade.

831
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:09,700
Yeah.

832
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,283
We're white.

833
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:16,645
I know we've gone, I know we've gone super over.

834
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:20,006
but we have more awesomeness.

835
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:21,087
And I'm gonna go really quick.

836
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:27,295
Okay, so we're just gonna do a speed round.

837
00:37:27,295 --> 00:37:29,397
We're gonna just give you a bunch of tips.

838
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:30,238
This is my channel.

839
00:37:30,238 --> 00:37:32,240
Gwen talked about it before.

840
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,124
It will give you loads of kind of animation goodness

841
00:37:35,124 --> 00:37:37,066
and everything there, so if you want more information,

842
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:37,987
go check that out.

843
00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:40,723
Also, Pinterest is awesome.

844
00:37:40,723 --> 00:37:43,404
So the great thing about Pinterest,

845
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:47,686
this came from Darren Randall, an animator of mine in Toronto.

846
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:52,328
And he uses this for kind of inspiration

847
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:57,810
and if he's trying to look to find something to do.

848
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:03,052
And it's just a gold mine of reference.

849
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:05,613
Anyway, so I'm going to pass over to JP.

850
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:07,813
I think it's crashed.

851
00:38:11,144 --> 00:38:12,046
It's crashed.

852
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:14,673
The music's playing, but it's crashed.

853
00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:16,298
So I think they're kicking us out.

854
00:38:16,298 --> 00:38:17,020
That's fine.

855
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,346
Anyway, that's Tricks of the Trade.

856
00:38:19,346 --> 00:38:20,288
Thank you very much.
