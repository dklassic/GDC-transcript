1
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:06,707
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,428
Thank you for coming so early.

3
00:00:08,428 --> 00:00:11,031
I'm Yasuda Fumihiko, the director of Team Ninja Nioh.

4
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:16,375
Yes, good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for coming out.

5
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:22,540
I know it's still pretty early considering GDC week.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,802
GDC week is a very long week for everyone.

7
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:27,464
So, thanks so much for coming to our session.

8
00:00:27,464 --> 00:00:29,907
My name is Fumihiko Yasuda,

9
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:33,570
and I'm from Team Ninja, game director for Nioh.

10
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:44,799
We have tried to revive the classic Samurai game in GDC as a modern action game.

11
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,903
I am very happy to be able to talk about it.

12
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:59,817
So I'm really excited today to share with you the stories about how we sort of revived the samurai action RPG game,

13
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:08,842
which turned out to be RPG game, but the samurai action genre and the lessons learned, reintroducing a classic game to a modern audience.

14
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:15,228
It's rare for Team Ninja to talk about the production process here.

15
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:21,316
I'm nervous too, so I hope this will be helpful for everyone.

16
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:23,880
Today, I'd like to talk about Nioh.

17
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:29,986
And it's pretty rare that we, our studio, Team Ninja,

18
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:33,468
share some of these stories in sort of the public forum

19
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,969
or panels and sessions like this.

20
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,671
So I'm a bit nervous, but hopefully I can share some stories

21
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:43,393
that will be of help or informative for all of you here today.

22
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:45,314
First of all, I'd like to talk about the history of the title Nihono.

23
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:56,637
So I'd like to start out with a brief history of Nioh.

24
00:01:56,637 --> 00:02:00,098
Nioh has a very strange history.

25
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:04,820
It was in 2005 when Shibusawa Kou, the founder of Koei,

26
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,401
announced the title.

27
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:12,863
It was made by Koei, but it didn't go well and was discontinued.

28
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:15,184
After that, Koei and Tecmo merged,

29
00:02:15,184 --> 00:02:19,805
and in 2011, Team Ninja was in charge of development.

30
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:24,090
So the development history of NEO is it's a bit complicated

31
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,419
As you may know it was announced in 2005 which is quite some time ago

32
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:36,727
Ko Shibusawa the founder of Koei first announced this title NEO and initially began

33
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:38,209
development on the Koei side

34
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:45,974
But after a few unsatisfactory attempts, it was sort of put back in the closet shelved

35
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:47,354
away for a while.

36
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:52,517
And then soon after Tecmo had merged with Koei, Team Ninja was chosen to take on the

37
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:55,179
Neo project and ultimately began development in 2011.

38
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,823
In 2011, we started with Ninja Gaiden as the base,

39
00:03:00,823 --> 00:03:03,305
an action game like Samurai Gaiden,

40
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:08,590
but we realized that it lacked independence,

41
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,532
so we stopped developing it.

42
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:13,815
In 2014, we started again with Team Ninja,

43
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:16,117
including Hayashi, the studio head.

44
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:22,749
We started with a team of 8, and announced it at TGS in 2015.

45
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:28,861
And in February of this year, we finally released it.

46
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,081
And so in 2011, we started the project.

47
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:37,323
The overarching sort of, I guess, goal or theme

48
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:40,905
was that we would make a Samurai Gaiden action game

49
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:43,967
based on Ninja Gaiden franchise.

50
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:46,268
But even that, it didn't really work out.

51
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,189
So we just continued that direction

52
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:53,091
and then put it on sort of a pause for a second.

53
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,092
In 2014, we restarted the development

54
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:56,053
with a new direction.

55
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,613
with about eight people in the beginning,

56
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:03,175
including Hayashi, Yosuke Hayashi, the head of Team Ninja, and myself.

57
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,696
The game was announced to the public at Tokyo Game Show in 2015,

58
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:07,976
and then it was finally released just last month on the PlayStation 4.

59
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:09,197
In 2014, I participated in the project.

60
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:11,337
In the beginning, I made the concept and target of the title clear.

61
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:35,889
So the first thing I did when taking over or restarting the project was that in 2014,

62
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:44,432
that was to define the target audience and a new approach for this title.

63
00:04:54,612 --> 00:05:01,059
We decided to target core gamers and make a game that's unique.

64
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:06,224
Above all, we, Team Ninja, are the core gamers, so we made that choice.

65
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:13,114
I personally felt that Team Ninja should not attempt to make a user-friendly or accessible

66
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:17,938
to accessible of a, I guess, a game targeting a wide consumer base.

67
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:23,602
I wanted to take an approach that separated us from most traditional AAA titles released

68
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:29,686
in the West to develop a specific type of game targeting hardcore gamers who would enjoy

69
00:05:29,686 --> 00:05:31,968
this very challenging content.

70
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:38,391
Because they, and ourselves, are the most dedicated and die-hard of all gamers.

71
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:01,629
So our target audience in the new approach aimed directly towards what we call in Japanese

72
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:05,819
Shinigae, and a Massacore concept and gamer community.

73
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:12,388
I was involved as a director in Ninja Gaiden 3 and Ninja Gaiden Z,

74
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:18,813
but I failed because the concept and the game I made from there

75
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:23,958
didn't meet the expectations of the core game players.

76
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,900
So, based on that reflection,

77
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,085
I decided to develop the game while always being aware of the concept and the target.

78
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:41,407
So I was also the director in charge of Ninja Gaiden 3 as well as Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z

79
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,407
two different projects which I learned

80
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:48,869
very difficult and valuable lessons from and based on those experiences

81
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:52,550
I really just had to remind myself in the beginning of Nioh's

82
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,651
development that I should never compromise our core audience and the integrity of our work

83
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:07,821
So one thing that we thought about was, as you see in the slide here, we were asking

84
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:17,405
ourselves, okay, what are we going to do to make sure that we keep on track of our core

85
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:21,187
concept and approach?

86
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:29,255
As everyone who is here makes sure that you're aware of the opportunity.

87
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:34,617
That we are constantly limited in terms of budget and technology.

88
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:44,862
It's always an issue where we are not satisfied with the concepts and our current social considerations.

89
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:50,937
We decided to have the player experience the game,

90
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:54,626
so that he could have direct communication with the game.

91
00:07:55,642 --> 00:08:01,944
So I think most of you here are developers yourselves or at least in the development community

92
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:10,007
So I think you would understand or agree with me, but we have to continuously struggle or juggle a lot of elements under various

93
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:12,567
Constraints that may be time budget

94
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,328
technical issues and so on so

95
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,531
I think that we all get to a point where we feel very anxious

96
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:22,972
whether our concepts and direction meets the players' expectations.

97
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:26,334
So we decided to reshape the development process

98
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:29,676
by communicating directly with our target audience

99
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,798
throughout the process with these game demos.

100
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,232
Instead of it being released right away,

101
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:45,155
but beginners want to check out the gameplay

102
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:46,516
anduzzle components in advance.

103
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:49,099
At the time of the development cycle

104
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:50,801
when feedback is received,

105
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,643
we try to release multiple trial and errors boards.

106
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:57,468
Even though the development process may take a few years or even longer than now,

107
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,490
during this period of process we have decided that

108
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:08,116
I wanted to make sure that the players' expectations and the direction of the game were not deviated.

109
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:15,581
As I said earlier, the title Nioh has been expected by many people for more than 10 years.

110
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:20,604
I wanted to hear his voice as soon as possible.

111
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:31,023
So the demos became a development tool to validate and confirm our approach rather than an advertisement or marketing or PR sort of tool.

112
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:42,629
They were to be released several times in this case and ended up being a few times, but during the course of development, mid to late term, where feedback would be utilized or addressed.

113
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:48,410
As this game took quite a few years to develop, I wanted to confirm whether there was a gap between

114
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:55,112
the game direction and the players expectations during that period. And especially with NEO,

115
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:58,053
because it was announced 10 years ago and

116
00:09:58,053 --> 00:10:02,554
there were people who were still hoping or maybe following, looking forward to it,

117
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:05,434
I wanted to make sure that those fans

118
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:10,895
were getting the information and being able to sort of communicate back with us

119
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:12,796
and to look forward to the final product.

120
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:18,300
And this is the actual schedule of the trial version.

121
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,982
In April of 2016, the Alpha trial version was released.

122
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:24,664
In August, the Beta trial version was released.

123
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:30,588
And in January of this year, the final trial version was released.

124
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:50,049
So as you see here, the schedule, it ended up being three times. The first one starting in April of last year. The second one, the beta, being August. And then just before the release, during just one weekend in January, we had the last chance trial demo.

125
00:10:52,328 --> 00:11:02,199
We had a plan to improve the game and gather feedback on the alpha and beta versions.

126
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,901
But we didn't really want to do the final version,

127
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:10,527
but we didn't have a lot of reservations, so we were told to do it.

128
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:18,401
The main goal for the alpha and beta demos were to collect feedback and improve the quality of the game.

129
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:26,905
The last chance trial demo, I actually was sort of hesitant or opposed to doing that.

130
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:31,066
and it was released for just a small amount of time,

131
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,827
just one last weekend.

132
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:39,128
But that was because I was told or informed that

133
00:11:39,128 --> 00:11:41,889
our pre-order numbers were not as high as we had thought.

134
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,769
So I went ahead and committed to doing a last chance trial demo.

135
00:11:56,304 --> 00:12:01,428
So here's a quick snapshot of the results from the alpha demo.

136
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:05,792
We don't have much data on this.

137
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:11,597
This is the data from all over the world, so you may not understand it.

138
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,840
In the US, the response was very positive.

139
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,364
However, the response in Japan and Asia was very poor.

140
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:19,945
This is just...

141
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:27,803
I think the difference between the way of thinking and the way of enjoying the trial version is a big reason.

142
00:12:27,803 --> 00:12:28,884
But it was interesting.

143
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:35,833
The point that the tutorial is not enough and the player's operation is more like this was actually the same content.

144
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:41,968
So this chart that you see here is not divided by region

145
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:44,790
or territory, so it's hard to tell.

146
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,072
However, I'll give you some information on what we saw,

147
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:51,495
is that many players in the West were quite positive,

148
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:54,997
overall, about the demo, but that was actually not the case

149
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:56,978
with our players in Japan and Asia.

150
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:03,600
We sort of concluded or realized that this sort of gap is

151
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,161
probably caused by cultural differences and how they

152
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:11,521
perceive difficulty. And probably some of the

153
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:16,442
contrasting ways that players navigate through or perceive

154
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:20,083
what is an alpha demo and a beta demo. However, interestingly,

155
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,964
there were common opinions such as a lack of tutorial elements

156
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:26,624
and improving user performance or controls.

157
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:31,965
Speaking Japanese

158
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:46,496
So what we did here is based on the feedback that we got, we made these improvements for the alpha phase.

159
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,883
We collected the data from the online survey,

160
00:13:52,883 --> 00:14:01,831
but there were very few players who gave their opinions through the official survey.

161
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:05,594
We had to go and get information ourselves.

162
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:12,600
There were many positive and negative opinions on social media and the bulletin board,

163
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,502
so it was very helpful.

164
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:19,956
So gathering information from players was definitely not an

165
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:23,377
easy task, as you may also have experienced.

166
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:26,458
The data that I showed earlier is a combined result of a

167
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,059
questionnaire together with the demos.

168
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:32,860
But since the players who provided these opinions and

169
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,641
filled out the questionnaire were very few in numbers, we

170
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:42,243
had to kind of proactively go out and seek where everyone was

171
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,363
talking about whether it was through.

172
00:14:44,663 --> 00:14:48,366
the boards, the forums, or social media.

173
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:52,169
We had to really go out and dig further so that we had

174
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:54,651
enough feedback to really look at.

175
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:58,034
And I think people were a lot more honest and open

176
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:01,236
about their feedback and opinions in those areas.

177
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:21,634
And throughout that process, you know, there were new things that we learned or discovered,

178
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:33,844
such as, I don't know, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it correctly,

179
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:40,929
but is it waifu or weeaboo or get good.

180
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:43,691
These are new terms to us.

181
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:47,997
And so once we completed the alpha demo process,

182
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:53,582
collected the feedback, three months later,

183
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:56,044
we went to our next step, which was releasing the beta demo.

184
00:15:56,044 --> 00:16:02,330
This is the result of the beta and alpha online survey.

185
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,753
As a result of the improvements,

186
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:09,977
we can see that the feedback on almost all topics has improved.

187
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,657
And so the top is the alpha demo results, as you can see.

188
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:17,681
And then the lower being the beta.

189
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:22,305
After making these improvements based on the alpha feedback,

190
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:25,749
you can see that pretty much in every single element,

191
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:30,193
the feedback was increased on the positive side.

192
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:44,850
So I'd like to go in deeper with what we ended up doing with that feedback, going from the

193
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:57,581
alpha, implementing and reflecting, and then reflecting the feedback, and then going into

194
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:58,442
the beta demo.

195
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:05,802
The first problem that we encountered had really nothing to do with the feedback that we were actually getting.

196
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:12,003
It was more about that our own staff, our own team members became way too influenced and affected by the opinions of the players.

197
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:33,507
I even gave suggestions like,

198
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:36,970
let's make it A because the player said A,

199
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,172
or let's make it easy because the boss is difficult.

200
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:45,036
So all the suggestions I collected from the players

201
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:48,358
were not answers, but questions.

202
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,759
I made sure to never forget that

203
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,461
we are the ones who answer the questions.

204
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:57,610
So for example, if someone saw feedback that says,

205
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,092
oh, we want this to be changed,

206
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:01,574
just because some of the players said that,

207
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:04,696
or even maybe a few players said that,

208
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:05,837
we didn't want it to be like,

209
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:08,019
okay, that's something that we wanna change.

210
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:11,302
Or some of the feedback that we got was,

211
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:13,704
make this boss battle easier.

212
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:14,745
Do we make it easier?

213
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:15,525
Probably not.

214
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:16,986
We needed to really think about it.

215
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:23,029
Same with the difficulty level, not just with the boss battles, but throughout.

216
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:28,871
Therefore, I tried to remind everyone that we are the developers who are creating the game.

217
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:36,533
And by attempting to consider all these various sort of range of feedback that we were getting,

218
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:40,634
we weren't arriving to a solid solution or an answer.

219
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:44,375
But these were rather more questions that we were supposed to be asking ourselves.

220
00:18:46,154 --> 00:18:48,695
The most specific example is the one at the top.

221
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:52,477
There was a parameter called durability, which was not very well received.

222
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:55,699
Many people suggested that we remove it.

223
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:58,820
But we thought that removing it would be the same as not working.

224
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,102
So we decided to change the parameter to the IOD parameter.

225
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:10,585
We decided to remove the player's burden and the elements that the player disliked,

226
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:12,947
while maintaining the same effect.

227
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:20,375
So, one notable change that we made is the one at the very top to the removing the equipment

228
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,937
durability system.

229
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:26,885
Now, if we had just said, okay, let's do that, we're going to cut that out, then that would

230
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:28,407
not be probably the right answer.

231
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:32,950
or the right solution that we were looking for.

232
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,671
So what we did was we didn't entirely remove it,

233
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:39,812
but rather we changed it to a weapon familiarity system.

234
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:44,214
That way it had the same sort of effect or result

235
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,035
from the player standpoint,

236
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:49,136
but we just made an adjustment or a change

237
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:51,057
so that we still kept something

238
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,538
that we wanted the players to feel

239
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:54,498
as they were playing the game.

240
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,540
I also wanted to make it open world.

241
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:05,744
This game is a game where players can play again and again after the game is over.

242
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:08,566
I wanted to keep the load shorter.

243
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:11,368
I wanted to keep the load of the retry shorter,

244
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:15,711
and I wanted to keep the density and frequency of the battle high.

245
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:18,793
That's why I decided to make it open world.

246
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:25,482
Another opinion was to create an open world system, the third one here.

247
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:29,326
This was also rejected as we wanted to shorten the load time after death

248
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:33,852
and raise the frequency and density of the battles.

249
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:42,737
The other bullet points that you see here are some of the changes we made.

250
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:49,620
We adopted some of the feedback regarding the behavior of the camera lock-on feature,

251
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,381
increasing level of difficulty, and so forth.

252
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:22,149
So it was pretty easy to determine whether to incorporate opinions about the technical issues or disregard some of the negative feedback.

253
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:33,376
But what was really important was to really stay true to the concept and approach that we had from the very beginning of the game.

254
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:42,275
And it might be a small thing, but something that we learned, an important lesson, is that we opened up about the feedback that we received.

255
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:06,230
We made a promise to the fans that we would improve the game and make it a good game.

256
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:35,497
So, in sum, I have the good and the bad, so we'll start out with the good.

257
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:48,478
and if it is correct, you can correct it.

258
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:52,905
This is one of the original purposes of the trial version,

259
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:58,093
and I think it has been realized in a very good way.

260
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:01,598
So the first one being acquiring player feedback,

261
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:03,439
and obviously not just that.

262
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:06,700
But we were able to then take that and proceed

263
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,902
with adjustments, reflect some of the feedback based

264
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:11,562
on the player's response.

265
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:13,063
This was the main objective of the demo,

266
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:15,224
so we were very satisfied with the results.

267
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:17,205
The second one was a great experience for the team.

268
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:27,175
we started to find answers ourselves,

269
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:31,939
and use this sort of information to develop the game.

270
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:44,972
And also it was a really positive learning experience for our development team

271
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:50,014
Not just myself, but everyone who worked on it. We were able to find

272
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:53,056
answers and things that we wanted to still

273
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:58,718
sort of keep on our checklist and what has happened is that we are able to then take that and

274
00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:03,861
whether it's going to be in the form of DLCs or updates we'll be able to

275
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:07,883
follow through with some of these things that we still have remaining and wanting to do

276
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,902
And finally, by taking communication,

277
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:14,525
I think that with new titles like Nioh,

278
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:15,546
we can start from zero,

279
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:18,709
but we were able to create a very good situation

280
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:24,916
where fans can exist even before the game is released.

281
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:28,977
And lastly, establishing new fans.

282
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:32,477
Even though we have been creating, producing,

283
00:24:32,477 --> 00:24:36,558
and putting out games under other franchise names,

284
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,559
Neo, technically, would be a brand new IP.

285
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,979
So if you think about it,

286
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,399
we're really starting from scratch.

287
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,160
There was really no fan base to begin with.

288
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,120
But the fact that we, through these demos,

289
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,901
we were able to gain new fans

290
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,702
and start establishing a Neo player community.

291
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:58,162
I'm not a fan of this game,

292
00:24:58,162 --> 00:25:03,725
but it was an experience I had when I was in the U.S.

293
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:06,106
I was really happy to know that SIE

294
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:09,027
would be collaborating in the U.S.

295
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:17,976
And another thing is that this title is actually published by Sony Interactive Entertainment Group

296
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,679
and I think all territories and

297
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:27,987
what happened was is that after seeing the results or the positive reception of the alpha demo we were able to

298
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:32,090
put together the publishing deal with Sony Interactive.

299
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,231
So that meant a lot for us.

300
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,052
And it proved that this game was going

301
00:25:36,052 --> 00:25:37,733
to be something that they would support throughout the launch

302
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:38,434
and with marketing.

303
00:25:38,434 --> 00:25:39,254
SPEAKER 1 IN JAPANESE

304
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:40,775
So obviously, after the good, let's look at the bad.

305
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:54,830
The first one is spoilers.

306
00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:00,093
I don't think there are many people in Japan who are expecting a story,

307
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:03,875
but it was a player's first experience,

308
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:10,640
and it was a side effect of stealing the fun of experiencing it for the first time.

309
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:19,215
So the first one is spoilers, and I don't know if spoilers is the most accurate term here, and also I don't know if

310
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:22,940
people looking forward to Neo were really

311
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,465
wanting to know it from a story or a narrative perspective.

312
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:30,329
But nonetheless, to be able to check out the game

313
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:32,871
prior to its final product or final release,

314
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:37,034
it does take away from being able to experience

315
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:40,498
that first-time impression.

316
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,479
So that might have been something

317
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:47,083
that was not really intended in terms of spoiling it,

318
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:51,467
but that you do get that feeling of knowing something

319
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:52,408
prior to its final release.

320
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:58,587
The development team was also under a lot of pressure.

321
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:05,175
Because this is a demo, it's something that the customers will be able to touch.

322
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:07,358
We had to realize the quality of the product.

323
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:10,582
I think that was a huge burden on the development team.

324
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:17,709
Secondly, it was a really heavy burden on the development team.

325
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:23,152
Even if the demo is at an alpha stage, the quality still needed to be reflective of a

326
00:27:23,152 --> 00:27:26,975
final product or a stage within the final product.

327
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:32,799
So that was something that we really had to concentrate and make sure that it was good

328
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,181
enough quality to put out as a demo.

329
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:41,977
Lastly, during the time we were streaming the demo, no one was working.

330
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:47,702
We were able to see a lot of reactions online,

331
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:52,686
especially the ones on Twitch where we were streaming gameplays.

332
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:57,010
We were able to see their gameplays in real time,

333
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,552
so we were watching those all the time.

334
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:03,415
There was a problem that no one was working at all.

335
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:13,767
And lastly a really big problem none of our guys were able to work or concentrate on what they were supposed to be doing

336
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:19,590
You know we were happy that people were checking out the demo, but it's very hard to block anything

337
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,792
That's maybe made online and are made available online

338
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:28,816
And so we were constantly checking on these players who are live streaming on Twitch, and we just couldn't

339
00:28:29,697 --> 00:28:40,487
We just couldn't ignore that and so it wasn't a very productive time spent,

340
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:43,470
time well spent during this period.

341
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:50,517
But it wasn't all bad even though we couldn't concentrate on our work because we were seeing

342
00:28:50,517 --> 00:28:54,020
a lot of positive reaction and responses as they were streaming.

343
00:28:57,066 --> 00:29:01,469
I felt this way through this trial version.

344
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:07,413
The first alpha demo was basically free, and anyone could play it.

345
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:11,676
I think it would have been better if it was limited to a few more people.

346
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,764
So in hindsight, I felt that the first alpha demo could have been limited

347
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:37,492
To a certain number of players to some extent. I don't have any specific ideas

348
00:29:37,492 --> 00:29:41,778
But maybe I feel that it would have been more effective to limit the amount of players

349
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:49,939
I think it's because there were a lot of people who were like,

350
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:52,902
if you can play for free, why not try it for a few minutes?

351
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:57,226
Especially this game is very fun and you'll die very quickly.

352
00:29:57,226 --> 00:29:59,748
So there were a lot of people who were like, what is this?

353
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:00,970
And they let go of their hands.

354
00:30:01,987 --> 00:30:06,692
And maybe even a purchase to play demo option.

355
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:09,554
What happened was is that because it was free to

356
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:14,919
download, free to play, there was a very, very wide variety

357
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:16,541
of feedback and opinions we got.

358
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,022
Yes, that's important.

359
00:30:18,022 --> 00:30:22,066
But at the same time, there would be players who would

360
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:24,428
probably play for a very, very short amount of time.

361
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:25,869
They would die instantly.

362
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,715
And then that would then become their first impression and maybe only impression.

363
00:30:30,715 --> 00:30:37,004
So there is this feeling that maybe we should have limited, we should have had a way to

364
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,567
limit the number of players who had access to the demo.

365
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:47,016
As I said, there were many points of regret and bad points.

366
00:30:47,016 --> 00:30:54,541
We don't know whether it is right or wrong to implement this trial version.

367
00:30:54,541 --> 00:31:02,527
However, it is a part that is definitely required and approached,

368
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:10,212
so I think it is a very good thing to do if you are prepared.

369
00:31:11,692 --> 00:31:18,634
And so I want to mention here that there is really no correct answer with regards to conducting game demos

370
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:22,696
Or in the way that we did this time around. I think there's both the good and the bad

371
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:25,777
it's definitely a

372
00:31:25,777 --> 00:31:31,860
Requirement for us developers to at least listen to the players voices

373
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,461
whether that takes shape or form in the way that we did or not

374
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:41,307
I think it's just fundamentally important to have our ears open so that we can listen.

375
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:49,274
So it's important for us to prepare and come up with new methods to acquire these valuable insights from our fans.

376
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:07,371
With confidence, I can say that. Even though it was our first

377
00:32:07,371 --> 00:32:12,355
time kind of operating in this way and changing the way that we

378
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:16,497
developed the game, we are seeing results in terms of

379
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:21,761
reaction, reviews, and even sales numbers. So I do want to

380
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:24,623
say that this was a great learning experience. Not only

381
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:29,146
that, but I think it added value to the entire project for NEO.

382
00:32:32,135 --> 00:32:41,358
Lastly, I would like to say that we have created Nioh by communicating with players through the demo.

383
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:50,001
I would be happy if you could learn more about the development process.

384
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:58,899
So that was a very small window into our journey with Nioh and the communications that took place

385
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:01,000
with us and the potential fans.

386
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,463
I hope this provided you with a better understanding of our creative and development process and how we ultimately shaped this game.

387
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:15,294
This was our first attempt, so it was a very unique experience for the team and I.

388
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:19,478
We were able to see what kind of expectations the players had for Nioh,

389
00:33:19,478 --> 00:33:23,981
and how they wanted us to respond to the game.

390
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:27,504
The biggest thing we learned from this was that

391
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:32,848
we were able to feel that our concept and goals were correct.

392
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:38,273
We were able to feel that our concept and goals were correct.

393
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:52,415
I've said a few bad things today, but I think the biggest advantage was that we were able to develop with confidence and strong motivation.

394
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:57,505
So it was a unique experience for myself and the team.

395
00:33:57,505 --> 00:34:03,210
We learned so much about our intended fans and their expectations for this game.

396
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:09,254
More importantly, this user engagement provided us with an opportunity to reaffirm our direction

397
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:13,557
and gain the confidence to steer boldly forward.

398
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:15,419
It added motivation for us.

399
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:20,022
As an exercise that was designed to learn more about our fans and gain valuable feedback,

400
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:24,785
We ultimately learned a lot about ourselves, our own selves in the process.

401
00:34:24,785 --> 00:34:29,728
And so that is a priceless lesson that we will not forget.

402
00:34:51,081 --> 00:35:01,950
It may not have been all good, but in addition to what I said,

403
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:09,657
we've learned about our own strengths as Team Ninja and what we're able to achieve.

404
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:15,722
So we want to definitely take that and carry that into whatever next project we have.

405
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:18,007
And so that's it.

406
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:19,689
Thank you again for coming,

407
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:22,592
and I hope I get the privilege to speak to you again

408
00:35:22,592 --> 00:35:24,033
someday in the future.

409
00:35:24,033 --> 00:35:24,694
Thank you.

410
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:24,974
Thank you.

411
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,461
So we have about 20 minutes,

412
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:38,702
and we're gonna open it up to Q&A.

413
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:41,903
There are two mics down the aisle here,

414
00:35:41,903 --> 00:35:43,343
and we are recording audio,

415
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:46,364
so if you could come up if you have any questions,

416
00:35:46,364 --> 00:35:47,745
and we'll take one at a time.

417
00:35:49,066 --> 00:36:03,911
Hello. I was wondering if you have any hard and fast rules on when to look at feedback seriously.

418
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:11,153
Like if you see 10 forum posts, you're like, okay, maybe we should look at this.

419
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:18,055
Or there's a hundred forum posts about a single topic, you're like, we need to fix this.

420
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:29,551
What is your standard in judging whether the response is positive or not?

421
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:30,591
Not really.

422
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:33,793
I don't have a standard.

423
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:38,555
Everyone has their own standards.

424
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:52,598
So the short answer is no, we didn't really go by any sort of guideline in terms of quantity,

425
00:36:52,598 --> 00:36:56,921
the number of feedback.

426
00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:08,108
and not quality, but it wasn't that we had a threshold that we thought we should meet

427
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:15,212
and then start looking into feedback. It was really about the content, what they were saying,

428
00:37:15,212 --> 00:37:19,874
what we thought was something that was important that we had to bring it up and reflect

429
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:26,017
into the next. So we started with really no guidelines and just looked at the raw responses

430
00:37:26,017 --> 00:37:27,258
that we were getting. Thank you. Thank you.

431
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,944
I can't see. Is there one person?

432
00:37:34,944 --> 00:37:39,747
Hello, my name is Ilya. First of all, thank you for the

433
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:46,171
question. I have three simple questions. First one is how

434
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:49,273
technically do you distribute the demos?

435
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:54,925
Second one, how many players participate in both demos, in

436
00:37:54,925 --> 00:38:02,268
three demos? And the last one, how technically did you gain

437
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:08,291
results from the feedback? It was emails or maybe Facebook

438
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:11,013
page or maybe some special mechanics in the game?

439
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:20,148
Okay. I just want to make sure the first one was you asked how

440
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:27,375
did we distribute the demo? Okay. So you mean outside of the

441
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:30,998
PlayStation store and that?

442
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:35,763
So it's just was the PlayStation store demo. Yeah? Okay.

443
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:36,404
I can react.

444
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:38,245
Yes, that's right.

445
00:38:38,245 --> 00:38:45,409
The first question was how many people were watching the demo,

446
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:48,871
and the third question was,

447
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:51,912
you went to a lot of places to get feedback,

448
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:55,394
but were there any particular SNS sites that stood out?

449
00:38:55,394 --> 00:38:57,555
Like Facebook?

450
00:38:57,555 --> 00:39:00,717
The second question was,

451
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,198
what was it again?

452
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:09,044
On average, 700,000 to 800,000 people downloaded and played it.

453
00:39:09,044 --> 00:39:11,026
So it's global?

454
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:12,447
Yes, it's global.

455
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:15,089
What about the third one?

456
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:18,291
The third one...

457
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:20,773
What was it again?

458
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:21,733
Was it on Facebook?

459
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,302
It was pretty much just NeoGaf and Regit.

460
00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:29,624
OK, so the way that the demo was distributed

461
00:39:29,624 --> 00:39:32,885
was you could download it for free

462
00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:35,867
through the PlayStation Store.

463
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:37,007
And that was the only way.

464
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,948
There was no other method of distribution.

465
00:39:38,948 --> 00:39:41,549
The second question, how many players?

466
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:44,330
So approximately, this is on a global level,

467
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:48,913
approximately 700,000 to 800,000 downloads of the free demo.

468
00:39:49,753 --> 00:39:55,997
And then thirdly, in terms of where social media channels,

469
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:57,378
where did we sort of hone in on or look at?

470
00:39:57,378 --> 00:40:05,323
It was really everything, including NeoGAF and Reddit.

471
00:40:05,323 --> 00:40:07,745
So anything and everywhere that you can think of

472
00:40:07,745 --> 00:40:09,426
that we can collect feedback, we were trying to cover.

473
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:09,706
Thank you.

474
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:09,907
Thank you.

475
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,063
All right, thank you for the presentation first.

476
00:40:18,063 --> 00:40:22,868
My question is, how did you prioritize the choices you had

477
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:24,810
to make during development?

478
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:29,874
Was it more depending on how strong the player feedback was

479
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:33,638
to make this or this specific choice on the top of the list?

480
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:37,021
Or was it more depending on how time-consuming it

481
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:38,403
would be for your team?

482
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:44,984
I think you mentioned this earlier, but what kind of feedback do you think we should get?

483
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,825
Is it something like, this is a small amount of work, so let's do it.

484
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:58,530
Or is it something like, it's going to take a long time to do this in Japan, so we can't handle it.

485
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,090
Is there a priority?

486
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,572
Well, I think the limitations are...

487
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:08,350
The budget and the time limit are huge.

488
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:12,554
When you make a decision, you can't avoid it.

489
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,096
When I was deciding whether to play or not,

490
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:20,200
the biggest thing was, as I mentioned earlier,

491
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,925
the concept and the target of this game.

492
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:29,889
I think it's hard to make a perfect 100-game game.

493
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:32,011
As for this game, I...

494
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:40,416
I think this game has a lot of good points, but we wanted to protect Nioh's unique combat.

495
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:49,502
We didn't compromise and focused on what we could do.

496
00:41:51,369 --> 00:42:00,591
So I mentioned this in the presentation a little bit, but yes, obviously we had a lot

497
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:05,432
of constraints, whether it was time or money or just resources.

498
00:42:05,432 --> 00:42:10,013
Even if we wanted to maybe address something that we thought was really important, we would

499
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:13,914
just have to make that call at the end of the day to say, yes we can or no we can't.

500
00:42:15,154 --> 00:42:22,899
But really it comes down to the very main sort of theme of today's presentation is that

501
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:29,442
we wanted to keep true to the game concept and approach that we had set for ourselves

502
00:42:29,442 --> 00:42:32,884
and hopefully for the potential consumers later on.

503
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:36,427
and we didn't want to sacrifice anything

504
00:42:36,427 --> 00:42:40,351
or affect the concept in a way that we didn't think

505
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,433
it was gonna be the Neo that we set out to do.

506
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:44,534
Additionally, what I can say is that

507
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:58,506
I hope it comes out right, but this game has a lot of good qualities from many different types of maybe games.

508
00:42:58,506 --> 00:43:02,289
I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing,

509
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:11,396
but in doing so, we did want to really have a Neo-like, a Neo-specific combat experience,

510
00:43:11,396 --> 00:43:13,377
and I just wanted to keep that.

511
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:18,280
very tight and very important and that was a high priority.

512
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,343
We didn't want to mess anything up in delivering that combat experience.

513
00:43:23,343 --> 00:43:26,625
So we put a lot of weight and focus and concentration on that.

514
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:27,626
All right. Thank you.

515
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:27,966
My gun. Hi.

516
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:49,745
Do you feel the timing of the demos was appropriate?

517
00:43:49,745 --> 00:43:59,508
Do you feel now in hindsight that doing them earlier may have been more beneficial?

518
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:12,635
Yes, the timing when I was making the alpha demo and when I was making the beta demo,

519
00:44:12,635 --> 00:44:20,702
was the exact same with the timing when I was making the whole game.

520
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:23,744
I think I should have done the beta demo earlier that time.

521
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:28,328
I think I should have done the beta demo earlier that time.

522
00:44:28,785 --> 00:44:33,930
We had a title that was based on the beta version.

523
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,912
It's true that we didn't have many options,

524
00:44:35,912 --> 00:44:38,675
but I think it would have been better

525
00:44:38,675 --> 00:44:44,901
if we had started working on the beta version earlier.

526
00:44:44,901 --> 00:44:47,964
In a way, maybe we could have...

527
00:44:48,905 --> 00:44:54,649
time the beta testing or the beta release of the beta demo a little bit earlier.

528
00:44:54,649 --> 00:44:57,872
There was quite some time, I think about three or three and a half, four months in

529
00:44:57,872 --> 00:45:04,417
between the alpha and the beta. It did sort of work in parallel with our

530
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:10,401
development process or sort of knee-deep into us creating the game, you know,

531
00:45:10,401 --> 00:45:12,903
developing and really aiming for

532
00:45:13,783 --> 00:45:15,924
hitting some of these schedules and milestones we had.

533
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:21,525
So we could have probably pushed up the beta demo a little bit.

534
00:45:21,525 --> 00:45:24,186
However, at that same time, we were

535
00:45:24,186 --> 00:45:28,547
very aware of these other titles that were coming in

536
00:45:28,547 --> 00:45:31,267
or maybe aiming for release at the same time.

537
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:34,608
So we had to make sure that we hit our schedule

538
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:38,189
and not hopefully be in a super competitive time

539
00:45:38,189 --> 00:45:39,209
frame for release.

540
00:45:39,209 --> 00:45:41,390
And so those were maybe some guidelines

541
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,470
that served us to do demos at a certain time.

542
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:53,897
time. Thank you. Hello. Thanks for the talk. When the idea for

543
00:45:53,897 --> 00:46:00,162
these public demos came across, did you encounter any resistance

544
00:46:00,162 --> 00:46:04,464
from Sony or Koi or even internally at Team Ninja and how

545
00:46:04,464 --> 00:46:07,186
did you kind of address that and mitigate the potential risks of

546
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:08,147
doing something like this?

547
00:46:08,707 --> 00:46:20,678
When you decided to do this, did you ever think it was risky for Sony or the doctor to do this?

548
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:34,610
Well, Sony never said it was bad, but the development team was against it.

549
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:37,890
That's it.

550
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,172
I agree.

551
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:44,936
But everyone knew that the schedule would be tight.

552
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,357
So we were against it.

553
00:46:46,357 --> 00:46:49,520
But there was also the new IP.

554
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,804
So we decided to put it out after 3 years.

555
00:46:53,804 --> 00:46:58,488
It was more of an experience than a risk.

556
00:46:58,488 --> 00:47:01,050
It's not a taste of cooking.

557
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,366
I remember convincing everyone that it was very effective.

558
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:27,079
I can say that our own dev team was entirely opposed to the idea.

559
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,501
So it was a really tough decision or a tough call.

560
00:47:31,501 --> 00:47:37,905
But the main thing was that we knew that if we had executed this plan that we put in place,

561
00:47:37,905 --> 00:47:40,026
that our schedules were going to really be tight.

562
00:47:40,026 --> 00:47:45,269
And we were, you know, basically it was a race against time.

563
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:46,369
But when you think about it...

564
00:47:47,603 --> 00:47:50,725
you know, releasing a new IP already has its own challenges

565
00:47:50,725 --> 00:47:55,328
in trying to communicate what this title is all about.

566
00:47:55,328 --> 00:47:58,310
So, you know, three years down the road

567
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,951
to not have released anything

568
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:02,072
and to put it out on the shelves

569
00:48:02,072 --> 00:48:05,053
and to hear sort of feedback for the first time,

570
00:48:05,053 --> 00:48:07,475
that's also a risk in a way.

571
00:48:07,475 --> 00:48:10,196
And so I feel like maybe going through this,

572
00:48:10,196 --> 00:48:11,897
we were able to mitigate those risks.

573
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:16,801
and people picking up a brand new IP for the first time.

574
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:21,104
So I'll use an analogy for maybe cooking.

575
00:48:21,104 --> 00:48:22,384
You know, when you have a dish

576
00:48:22,384 --> 00:48:24,426
that you're aiming for or targeting,

577
00:48:24,426 --> 00:48:26,607
you add ingredients and you add spices

578
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:28,589
and you add umami along the way.

579
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:31,170
So that's how we maybe saw this

580
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,392
as perfecting the dish at the end.

581
00:48:33,392 --> 00:48:35,313
We had to make these fine adjustments in the middle.

582
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:35,653
Great, thank you.

583
00:48:35,653 --> 00:48:35,954
Thank you.

584
00:48:44,428 --> 00:48:44,869
Good morning.

585
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:46,793
Good morning.

586
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:48,115
I'm Keira.

587
00:48:48,115 --> 00:48:49,518
Nice to meet you.

588
00:48:49,518 --> 00:48:50,380
Nice to meet you.

589
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,121
As a designer,

590
00:48:55,482 --> 00:49:01,025
How were you guys able to take player feedback and actually

591
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:04,527
dissect what they were saying to actually help with the game?

592
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:08,809
For example, instead of just taking something like a player

593
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:11,030
would say, oh, I don't like this about the game, or this

594
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,851
part sucks, or something like that, how do you actually take

595
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:16,253
that kind of feedback to apply to the system and say, well,

596
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,674
they're actually talking about this mechanic.

597
00:49:17,674 --> 00:49:19,075
They don't really like how this works.

598
00:49:19,075 --> 00:49:21,516
Or maybe this can be improved or tweaked a little bit so

599
00:49:21,516 --> 00:49:22,957
that it's easier for the player to understand it.

600
00:49:23,817 --> 00:49:28,900
I'm a designer, so I can't say I'm a designer, but I get a lot of feedback.

601
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:36,023
For example, you mentioned earlier that it's okay because it's okay.

602
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:48,028
But if you say it specifically, what do you have to adjust or change to reflect that feedback?

603
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:52,050
What kind of criteria do you have to meet?

604
00:49:53,295 --> 00:50:02,740
So, for example, if you change the system here, it will be like this?

605
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:12,665
Yes, when you consider it, you should look at the problem without bias.

606
00:50:13,403 --> 00:50:16,784
and we started discussing it.

607
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:23,025
After that, we had to find a solution to the problem.

608
00:50:23,025 --> 00:50:28,106
We had a premise that we wouldn't satisfy 100% of the players,

609
00:50:28,106 --> 00:50:31,907
but we wanted to satisfy as many people as possible.

610
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:39,108
That was the main reason for doing multiple trial versions.

611
00:50:39,108 --> 00:50:41,128
Otherwise...

612
00:50:41,733 --> 00:50:49,199
I think it was difficult to tell if the changes were good or bad.

613
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:55,683
I did it twice, actually three times, and I think it had a very good effect.

614
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:11,830
So there wasn't really, similar to the answer that we gave earlier, there wasn't really a rule book that we really played by.

615
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:22,262
We would collect all the feedback, look through it, sort through it, and the most important thing was that we had to look at it from a non-biased point of view.

616
00:51:22,762 --> 00:51:29,686
So we would take sort of ourselves out of the equation once and then look at it from that perspective

617
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:34,409
but then also to jump to the other answer that we had earlier is that

618
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:39,412
Next thing is we have to work within some time and budgetary constraints and technical

619
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:43,814
Maybe constraints that we maybe wanted to do but we knew that we couldn't achieve

620
00:51:43,814 --> 00:51:50,338
We knew that in making these changes or reflecting these adjustments in the game

621
00:51:50,898 --> 00:51:53,383
you know, we're not gonna make everyone.

622
00:51:54,089 --> 00:51:54,249
100% happy.

623
00:51:54,249 --> 00:52:01,551
It's almost impossible to make a perfect game for everyone who's going to be purchasing this game.

624
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:05,432
Knowing that, we would make

625
00:52:05,432 --> 00:52:11,694
adjustments, changes, implement new systems, and so forth, hoping that by the time...

626
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:15,155
This is in the alpha, but then by the time we reflected that in the beta,

627
00:52:15,155 --> 00:52:21,697
they would be either addressed or sort of proven. And if not addressed, we would make that sort of open.

628
00:52:23,137 --> 00:52:30,559
And so by doing an alpha and beta, and as a result, we did do the third one,

629
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:37,380
to kind of make sure that we can check that earlier feedback in the next one

630
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:44,481
was actually a really good, I guess, idea or plan that we followed through with the feedback from the users.

631
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:44,742
Thank you.

632
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:58,371
No other questions?

633
00:52:58,371 --> 00:52:59,832
No other questions?

634
00:52:59,832 --> 00:53:05,034
Everyone's very quiet because it's in the morning.

635
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:10,516
Oh, OK, I see someone walking up.

636
00:53:10,516 --> 00:53:10,556
Hi.

637
00:53:12,572 --> 00:53:35,108
I was curious what kind of telemetry and metrics you are tracking over your alpha, beta clients and that kind of thing.

638
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:36,329
Thanks.

639
00:53:38,703 --> 00:53:44,247
In the game Nioh, there is a blood sword in the game logo.

640
00:53:44,247 --> 00:53:51,452
It is a blood sword that can be used when a player dies in an online game.

641
00:53:51,452 --> 00:53:58,497
The data shows how many people died in which stage and in which place.

642
00:53:58,497 --> 00:54:05,942
The data shows the difficulty of the game.

643
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,138
to other machines.

644
00:54:11,532 --> 00:54:14,614
So as you see in this logo too, the katana zuka,

645
00:54:14,614 --> 00:54:21,117
this is something that, so whenever a player dies, we were capturing

646
00:54:21,117 --> 00:54:24,539
where, location, and when.

647
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:26,440
So that was something that

648
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:32,904
was, amongst other data that we collected, that was something that was kind of an obvious thing that we wanted to catch.

649
00:54:32,904 --> 00:54:39,047
And it also would tell us or inform us kind of the difficulty level

650
00:54:40,848 --> 00:54:45,861
demo, but obviously from the results we would see where

651
00:54:45,861 --> 00:54:48,869
people were dying the most or the least.

652
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:59,636
One more question for me. How was your experience testing this

653
00:54:59,636 --> 00:55:03,377
game with players and getting feedback from them significantly

654
00:55:03,377 --> 00:55:06,618
different from doing something more like traditional internal

655
00:55:06,618 --> 00:55:09,759
focus group testing or something like that? Was the nature of the

656
00:55:09,759 --> 00:55:10,759
results very different?

657
00:55:11,337 --> 00:55:16,540
If you test the players with the general public,

658
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:23,044
what do you feel is the difference between the event,

659
00:55:23,044 --> 00:55:28,428
the one in the club and the one outside?

660
00:55:28,428 --> 00:55:29,068
What's new?

661
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:33,871
And the format for the Focus Group has changed.

662
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:36,333
I went through both events

663
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:40,996
but the players in the Club

664
00:55:42,888 --> 00:55:46,494
In some cases, there were honest reviews

665
00:55:46,494 --> 00:55:53,064
Also, there were quite a few players who gave scores

666
00:55:53,064 --> 00:55:55,068
So that was very reassuring

667
00:55:55,564 --> 00:56:06,749
So we actually did both. We still did our sort of usual traditional methods.

668
00:56:06,749 --> 00:56:14,071
But obviously when you put something out in the public and they're free to say whatever in the public forum,

669
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:17,813
there's a very wide variety of feedback and opinion that we

670
00:56:17,813 --> 00:56:23,155
could get. So that was probably the biggest difference. When

671
00:56:23,155 --> 00:56:26,837
you go through maybe like a focus group test, there's maybe

672
00:56:26,837 --> 00:56:30,818
a questionnaire that's already given or it's already, you know,

673
00:56:30,818 --> 00:56:35,220
fit in a format that they have to follow. So that was number

674
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,982
one. And then obviously the volume of responses we can

675
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:42,883
gather from doing a public demo is very different from doing a

676
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:51,274
kind of restricted time scheduled, whether it's QA testing or focus group testing.

677
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:56,584
Hello. Thank you for making a great game. I noticed that Neo

678
00:56:56,584 --> 00:57:01,488
has the very best performance options on any game that we've

679
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:05,231
seen on console. You can pick 1080p, 60 frames per second or

680
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:08,573
you can go HD. And this is something that's a big topic of

681
00:57:08,573 --> 00:57:11,976
discussion among players now is that the performance and when

682
00:57:11,976 --> 00:57:13,497
you guys have it on PS4 Pro.

683
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:17,921
you can choose between resolution or high frame rate.

684
00:57:17,921 --> 00:57:21,665
And I was wondering if your team was in tune with these

685
00:57:21,665 --> 00:57:26,129
discussions and the desire for higher performance on console

686
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:29,052
games now, or if that was just a company internal or team

687
00:57:29,052 --> 00:57:33,256
internal directive of your own to bring out the best of your

688
00:57:33,256 --> 00:57:34,818
tight gameplay?

689
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:41,203
The setting of Nioh is the most important part of the story.

690
00:57:41,203 --> 00:57:44,426
It's not something that was decided by the team.

691
00:57:44,426 --> 00:57:47,929
It's not something that was decided by the players.

692
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:52,753
It's not something that was decided by the players.

693
00:57:52,753 --> 00:57:56,877
It's something that the players can enjoy.

694
00:57:56,917 --> 00:58:00,600
We know that it was very well received.

695
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:06,225
But this is probably due to the trial version.

696
00:58:06,225 --> 00:58:12,771
Since it's an action game, we always put the final optimizer at the end.

697
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:17,615
But since it's a trial version, we couldn't optimize it enough.

698
00:58:18,775 --> 00:58:24,218
Not only the action, but also the RPG elements are very strong.

699
00:58:24,218 --> 00:58:28,501
We were actually going to prepare both options for the Alpha version,

700
00:58:28,501 --> 00:58:35,405
but the engineer gave us an idea and we thought it was a good idea to incorporate it.

701
00:58:35,405 --> 00:58:42,869
It was very well received, so we decided to include it in the product version.

702
00:58:42,869 --> 00:58:45,491
And PS4 Pro was also announced after that,

703
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:47,111
and it worked very well with that.

704
00:58:47,456 --> 00:58:49,758
I think it's all thanks to the demo.

705
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:20,325
Performance wise, you aim for the highest even during development, but it's really the last stretch that we put in so much effort to make sure that the performance isn't lagging.

706
00:59:20,325 --> 00:59:29,211
And so, you know, while we put out a demo, we would hear some of this feedback and our engineer would try to say, well, maybe we can address this.

707
00:59:30,032 --> 00:59:31,854
Let's give it a try.

708
00:59:31,854 --> 00:59:35,336
Knowing that this is not just a pure action game,

709
00:59:35,336 --> 00:59:37,618
but it has its RPG elements as well,

710
00:59:37,618 --> 00:59:39,480
we're like, you know what, it might actually be good

711
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,263
to offer these user, or these settings, and have a user.

712
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:49,788
pick and choose kind of what they want to do. So thanks to some of the feedback

713
00:59:49,788 --> 00:59:53,391
and discussions we had post alpha demo

714
00:59:53,391 --> 00:59:59,035
it I think helped our engineering team to look into that direction and at the same time the ps4

715
00:59:59,035 --> 01:00:04,999
announcement came out and so we felt like it was a natural fit or a good idea for the game.

716
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,977
You've set a very good example for all games on console,

717
01:00:08,977 --> 01:00:10,518
so keep up the good work.

718
01:00:10,518 --> 01:00:10,878
Thank you.

719
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:13,560
I think we should learn other games as well.

720
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:13,960
Thank you.

721
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,842
OK, I think we have time for one last one.

722
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:22,852
I have another question actually.

723
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:29,177
So, how do you feel about doing more changes to the game in the future

724
01:00:29,177 --> 01:00:32,699
alongside season pass content, for example? Do you feel you should

725
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:36,722
still

726
01:00:36,722 --> 01:00:40,345
do changes to the original gameplay experience or not?

727
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:55,357
What kind of information will your users need, as well as how late an update and dlc should be available, in the future?

728
01:00:55,357 --> 01:01:02,139
I want to make sure the release is on time.

729
01:01:16,709 --> 01:01:24,897
and we are considering a Day 1 patch or an update after the release.

730
01:01:24,897 --> 01:01:32,624
I think the communication will be the same as the one we had in Nioh,

731
01:01:32,624 --> 01:01:40,271
so I think we will be increasing the weight of the game.

732
01:01:41,492 --> 01:01:46,215
So obviously, you know, release day and what you get out of the box or download,

733
01:01:46,215 --> 01:01:51,279
the first thing that you open up is really important. We need to have the

734
01:01:51,279 --> 01:01:58,304
game there. But as, you know, online day one patches or updates or DLCs become

735
01:01:58,304 --> 01:02:05,089
more and more of a common thing, we kind of expect to get more. And we, thanks to

736
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:08,891
the demo and the feedback, but continuing on that path we feel like there's going to be...

737
01:02:09,612 --> 01:02:13,675
a wealth of opinion exchanges, hopefully for Nioh,

738
01:02:13,675 --> 01:02:17,737
and we will take a look at it and see when the right timing

739
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:19,999
or what the proper content is that we can reflect

740
01:02:19,999 --> 01:02:21,320
in these updates and DLCs coming forward.

741
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,782
So we will, in a way, probably put more weight

742
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:27,324
in doing that than we did for our previous titles.

743
01:02:27,324 --> 01:02:28,325
Thank you very much.

744
01:02:28,325 --> 01:02:28,565
Thank you.

745
01:02:28,565 --> 01:02:30,026
I think time's up, so this is the end.

746
01:02:30,026 --> 01:02:30,246
Thank you.
