1
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:09,781
Hello everyone, hope you are all doing well today.

2
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:13,584
It is an honor to be here at the Game Developers Conference

3
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:15,446
to present to you on the topic,

4
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:18,748
Genshin Impact, Crafting an Anime-Style Open World.

5
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:20,730
So before we start,

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,373
please allow me to give you a brief introduction

7
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:26,235
about myself.

8
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,856
My name is Hao Yu Cai.

9
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm the game producer and CEO of miHoYo.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,442
So you can find my contact here.

11
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:41,817
So feel free to email me if you have any questions after today's presentation.

12
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:47,303
So today I'm going to cover these topics in the presentation.

13
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:52,128
First of all, I'm going to give you a brief history of Genshin Impact

14
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:54,850
and talk about the core philosophy of the game.

15
00:00:55,773 --> 00:01:03,719
After that, we're going to dive into why we think characters are so important for an anime-style game.

16
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,443
As most of you may know that we have a lot more playable characters in Genshin Impact,

17
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:14,787
and I'm going to tell you how we create and design our characters.

18
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:20,412
And lastly, I will explain how we go about building this anime-style NPR world.

19
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:30,481
So first, let me give you a simple overview of why we want to make Genshin Impact.

20
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:36,487
Definitely it's not because we have been mentioned and we have noticed that open world games are

21
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:43,773
popular. It is because our company has a goal in mind, and which is to create the Honkai universe.

22
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:51,128
something like Meta Universe we mentioned recently, I guess, but we first had this idea in 2014,

23
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:59,676
long before we started Genshin Impact. It is not difficult to see our goal if you look at our

24
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:06,342
history, to see the games we made from Gong's Girls to Honkai Impact.

25
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:12,646
and Genshin Impact, which I am the producer of all three till the launch.

26
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:18,787
From our first side-scrolling action shooter game, to our first third-person action game,

27
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:25,809
and finally to our first open-world game Genshin Impact, we strive to create a more immersive

28
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:32,471
gaming world. When we start the Genshin Impact project, we want to create a new IP.

29
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:38,160
based on what we learned from Honkai Impact and build a more user-friendly world.

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,182
As you can see, Genshin Impact is available to a broad range of audiences.

31
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:51,645
For example, in the early years of Honkai Impact, there was no availability of male characters.

32
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:56,587
But you can do so in Genshin Impact since the very beginning.

33
00:02:56,587 --> 00:03:01,189
Also, rather than having a sci-fi or hardcore-themed setting,

34
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:06,491
We hope to create a visually stunning and beautiful world instead,

35
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,793
as you can also tell with Genshin Impact.

36
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:15,677
As you know, there are seven nations in Genshin Impact.

37
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:18,519
So let me take Liyue as an example.

38
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,942
Here is the concept art of Latin Rite,

39
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:24,303
which is a festival in Liyue.

40
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:27,586
I guess maybe some of you already joined this event

41
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:29,127
during the February.

42
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,227
In Genshin Impact,

43
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:34,390
when we create different nations in the game,

44
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,612
we try to integrate elements

45
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:37,953
from various cultures in reality.

46
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:48,679
Under the fantasy world concept, we have a motivation to enrich the world with diversity of different culture styles.

47
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:54,423
So players from all around the world may find something fun and interesting in the game.

48
00:03:54,423 --> 00:04:00,887
For instance, in Liyue, although it is heavily inspired by Chinese culture,

49
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:06,448
We hope that not only can Chinese players feel connected to Liyue,

50
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:14,193
but also the players from different backgrounds enjoying the ancient and living culture from a fresh perspective.

51
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:18,175
So for those who might not be familiar with Chinese culture,

52
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:25,759
when they think about China, I guess Panda, maybe Kung Fu or the Three Kingdoms may come first to their mind.

53
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,062
With Liyue here, we want to present something different, something new.

54
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:41,206
Obviously, in my point of view, Chinese culture has much more than these popular concepts mentioned above.

55
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:47,750
So we integrated some iconic Chinese landscapes into the skinners of Liyue,

56
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,673
such as Guilin with its hills and waters, you can find similar things in Liyue,

57
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:59,536
and Zhangjiajie with its picturesque peaks and rocks, like the mountains in Liyue.

58
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:04,478
We want to build a fantasy world that contains these beautiful scenes,

59
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:11,721
which is our goal to let players may find their inner peace when they play in Genshin Impact.

60
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:17,003
And for global players, we hope that everyone can feel the common beauty together.

61
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:22,598
Of course, most of our developers are born and raised in China,

62
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:26,701
and we immersed ourselves in Chinese culture.

63
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,423
We want to refine what we are familiar with

64
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:31,905
into something that is easy to understand,

65
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:35,208
and then deliver it to global players.

66
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,849
We hope the global players,

67
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:40,551
they will also enjoy and share the beauty of Liyue

68
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:42,813
and the culture elements that we integrated.

69
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:45,734
even without much knowledge of Chinese culture.

70
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:48,875
So, for example, like Liyue,

71
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,697
it is a nation with agriculture civilization.

72
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:55,918
We use the geo as the element of it

73
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,479
to reflect the characteristic of the city

74
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:00,860
and its pursuit of peace.

75
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:07,679
So for now, we only released Mondest and Liyue so far,

76
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:10,121
two of the seven nations in Tibet.

77
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:13,583
The third city, Inazuma, will come available

78
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,205
in a few days.

79
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:18,447
As said, we want to create a fantasy world

80
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:21,048
filled with culture diversity.

81
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:25,191
We believe the anime art style allows us to collaborate

82
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:28,473
and integrate more culture element

83
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:30,034
into a visually stunning world.

84
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:39,221
The characters and the world of Tivert are indeed important carriers of the concept of diversity.

85
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:44,303
So, next, let's talk about the characters in Genshin Impact.

86
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:49,084
Before diving in, let me answer a question.

87
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:51,945
How many playable characters in Genshin Impact?

88
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,727
I think maybe you know the answer.

89
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:58,308
Actually, for now, the answer is 33.

90
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:00,108
Exclude the avatar of the player.

91
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:05,008
So I don't have enough space in this page to show you all of the characters.

92
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:10,170
And in a few days after we update version 2.0, there will be 36.

93
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:18,055
And we expect it to add about approximately 17 characters per year.

94
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:22,157
So for an open world ARPG game, it really saves a lot.

95
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:24,378
In this chart

96
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:31,013
It is easy for you to see all the characters in different element categories.

97
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:35,458
Character is one of the most important aspects of the game,

98
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:41,123
not only because each character carries the unique gameplay and the element,

99
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:44,426
but also it represents cultural characteristics.

100
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:50,250
So why are characters so important in Genshin Impact?

101
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,591
And why is it so important to keep up the consistency of our character updates?

102
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:59,633
I will list several very important points here.

103
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,834
First of all, characters are one of the most

104
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:08,376
desired content for our players, which makes it essential for us to keep

105
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:12,537
up updates to fulfill our players' demands.

106
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:13,137
No doubt.

107
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:20,310
The multi-characters gameplay this fall is inherited from Japanese card games.

108
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:26,412
Before we launched the game, we were also worried about whether Western players would accept it this fall.

109
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:30,093
The result exceeded our expectations.

110
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:37,715
It shows that both Eastern and Western players in Genshin Impact, they like to collect multi-characters.

111
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:45,158
And secondly, in Genshin Impact, the world and the storytelling revolved around characters,

112
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:54,128
which has a different focus from some AAA games that emphasize highly on cinematic narration.

113
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:55,770
Based on my understanding,

114
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:01,252
of the Tremor Wing games, or including some popular TV series and animes,

115
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:05,913
those productions prioritize the plotline.

116
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,554
The characters are serving the development of the plot.

117
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:13,895
But from the very beginning, when we start Genshin Impact,

118
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:19,817
we are trying to create it with parallel and mountain narratives to this series.

119
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:24,579
to depict the stories of characters in a massive, vast world,

120
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:29,481
which is quite different from those examples I mentioned above.

121
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:32,662
And finally, and most importantly,

122
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:36,483
characters serve as the foundation for our commercialization.

123
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:39,484
Genshin Impact is a free-to-play title.

124
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:42,605
In addition to some characters,

125
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:45,467
a large portion of the game's content

126
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:50,356
including the world exploration, quests,

127
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:55,680
since all the quests and various events came with no charges.

128
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,883
While some players have a relative smooth gameplay experience,

129
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:02,806
we also heard someone may complain that

130
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:05,528
they are getting stuck in certain adventure levels.

131
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:11,896
which comes down to the issue of insufficiency with our content production.

132
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:19,219
So this situation can be improved if we are more effective at creating new content.

133
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,720
And of course we are working on it right now.

134
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,923
To illustrate how we design characters, let me take Xiao as an example.

135
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:30,763
This is Xiao.

136
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,705
Xiao is an important playable character in game.

137
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:43,243
He is an adaptor and the only remaining member of the five yaksha dispatched by Morax

138
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:47,666
to subdue the demonic spirits that plague the Liyue.

139
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:54,090
According to our character pipeline, first we confirm the world setting and where the

140
00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:01,654
character lives in, and then any member from any team, maybe art team, design team,

141
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:07,303
And IP team, in our team, means writers.

142
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:11,129
If any of them have ideas for the new characters,

143
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,213
they can bring it up for group discussion.

144
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,771
During the production, we always insist on collective creations,

145
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:23,332
especially in the early stage.

146
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:29,874
The final decision of a character design was not from any single person.

147
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:31,574
It's made by a group.

148
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:37,856
Honestly, we don't have a typical art director or creative director in our team,

149
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:42,077
and I guess that is why I am here today to give the lecture.

150
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,797
So, in the group.

151
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:53,604
We evaluate the idea from aspects including but not limited to art, settings, gameplay, and the study of players' preference.

152
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:59,488
Afterwards, we follow the same procedure to proceed with character creation.

153
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:07,975
When the character's concept is settled, we started to implement it.

154
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:15,239
Our goal is to ensure the characters look as good as the original character concept while in-game.

155
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:19,141
This picture is the drawing of a character in three-wheels,

156
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:24,484
Xiao's drawing of Xiao in three-wheels.

157
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,445
And this is a character with...

158
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,542
finalized 3D model and texture assess.

159
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:35,024
We review the model from an orthogonal perspective in-game

160
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:39,727
to make sure it looks exactly the same as the original concept,

161
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:43,009
as well as having reasonable tessellation,

162
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:46,331
topology, and follow our texture standards.

163
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:53,815
Following that, we will continue with compact and movement design,

164
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,615
action designs.

165
00:12:55,188 --> 00:13:01,210
and also integrating with gameplay design to ensure the ultimate visual effects in the game world.

166
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:11,934
In order to achieve this goal, many technical and artistic details must be confirmed,

167
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:16,655
and the following are a few of the most important.

168
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:22,303
First and foremost, as I mentioned before,

169
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,104
the models and textures must be authored as perfectly

170
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:30,866
one-to-one recreations of the concept art.

171
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:32,567
This is the basic requirements.

172
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:39,750
And secondly, given the anime art style we created,

173
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:43,066
the terminator, you can see this in the video,

174
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:47,589
the terminator between light and shadow on the face

175
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:49,571
must be good-looking enough.

176
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:55,475
And the normal physical-based shading cannot accommodate this.

177
00:13:55,475 --> 00:13:59,639
So as a result, we created hand-painted shadow masks

178
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,423
specifically for the face, which can be adjusted automatically

179
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:07,405
based on the direction of the main light.

180
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,625
This is the effect of the dynamic light map in the video.

181
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,685
You can see that.

182
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,107
The artist can control the shape of the shade

183
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:18,787
under every light direction.

184
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:21,608
From the front or from the side, the artist

185
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:25,150
can totally control the shape of the shade on the face.

186
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,610
So we can make sure the shadow on the face

187
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,292
could be good-looking any time from any direction.

188
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:37,353
And another point worth mentioning is that...

189
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:44,846
In-game, the characters and scenes are rendered independently using two different render pipelines.

190
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:51,031
They are rendered separately. We use the deferred rendering pipeline for the scenes,

191
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:58,537
of course, because taking into account time of the day, weather changes, and the complexity of

192
00:14:58,537 --> 00:15:05,463
the environments. However, because there are many complicated NPR stylization requirements for the

193
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:06,424
characters.

194
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:10,875
We decided to continue to use the forward rendering pipeline

195
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:14,698
to ensure that the character can always show the effect

196
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:17,540
that the artist wants in the games.

197
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,203
Because this allows us to control all the lightning

198
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:23,625
effects and the impact that they have easily.

199
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:31,218
Maybe rendering the character and scene separately sounds a little weird,

200
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:34,560
but we can show you an example later.

201
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,744
For example, while character shadow is primarily determined by one single light source,

202
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:45,368
the transition of the shadow can be artificially set based on material settings,

203
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:51,473
light intensity, and mesh curvature in order to achieve the best shadow transition performance.

204
00:15:52,130 --> 00:16:00,791
The color in the darker areas can also be controlled based on the color of the environment and the artist's preference.

205
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:07,633
So let me show you the light of the scenes first.

206
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:16,994
To better support our 24-hour cycle and dynamic weather system, we don't use any big lighting in Genshin Impact.

207
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:18,915
All lights are dynamic.

208
00:16:19,723 --> 00:16:26,026
The video shows how our image-based lighting and ambient lighting component

209
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,347
changes throughout the day and night.

210
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:32,408
And as you can see, when local lights turn on at night,

211
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,089
you can see there is a lamp,

212
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:36,049
when local lights turn on,

213
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:42,132
they also make contributions to both direct and indirect light,

214
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:44,793
as shown in the video.

215
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:44,973
Okay.

216
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:55,260
And for character shading, our character shading has very unique style.

217
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:02,081
While keeping the cartoonish look, we also apply real-time lighting onto characters.

218
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:08,962
When environmental light condition changes, characters will also get affected.

219
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:14,223
You can tell from the video.

220
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:15,783
You can tell from the video.

221
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:25,953
When Yura walks under the tree, the tree leaves cast a shadow on her body.

222
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:26,733
Yeah.

223
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:27,974
Okay.

224
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:29,535
Let's see it again.

225
00:17:29,535 --> 00:17:29,635
Yes.

226
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:40,762
So after talking about the character, following that, let's move on to the creation of Genshin

227
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:41,622
Impact's world.

228
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:47,326
We build a world comparable to Genshin Impact's world.

229
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:52,136
composed of seven nations from the start of the project,

230
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:55,479
and the world will be updated on a long term

231
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:57,981
based on the annual agenda.

232
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:01,984
As a result, how to create a stylized world

233
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:03,706
that becomes critical?

234
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:11,712
So after settling on the basic concept of the world,

235
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:15,395
we encountered some hardships creating the art style.

236
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:21,033
This is the concept art of Inazuma.

237
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:26,115
As you can see, we intend to create a world with anime rendering style.

238
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:32,576
Following this idea, our artists create many concepts on their own.

239
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:35,817
Like this picture. Yes, this is the concept of Inazuma.

240
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:40,798
So now when we have this concept, our job is to recreate it in-game.

241
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:46,709
However, considering the TOD, weather changes,

242
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,091
lightning environment, as well as the procedure content

243
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:55,053
generation and production and set sharing,

244
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:58,134
we found it is really difficult to perfectly recreate

245
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:01,076
the impact in the original art concept

246
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:04,197
during the actual production process.

247
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:06,958
And to be honest, to recreate the character

248
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,760
is much more easier than recreate the scenes.

249
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:19,901
So, but if the methods for creating stylized art cannot be standardized,

250
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:27,024
our painters will create different art styles from their own strokes,

251
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:32,566
which makes massive productions impossible. So how to solve this problem?

252
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:41,070
Finally, after more than a year of struggle, we built our world first on the PBR pipeline.

253
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:45,709
and then tweak it to achieve the stylized look we desire.

254
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:51,892
So thanks to, and we have a very clear idea of our character style,

255
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:55,414
so we have at least one standard to adhere to.

256
00:19:55,414 --> 00:20:00,797
So that is match the style of the scenes with our characters

257
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:03,238
and make it harmonious and beautiful.

258
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,034
To achieve the stylized effect we want,

259
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:11,355
we need to make some hacks on the real rules in nature.

260
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:14,755
As for there are too many examples,

261
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,796
and our time is limiting this presentation,

262
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:23,418
so I only list a few of them here.

263
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:25,998
First, as an open world game,

264
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:28,919
failing the huge landscapes

265
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,260
becomes an important job for Genshin Impact.

266
00:20:31,937 --> 00:20:39,106
We made some specialized design terrains to fulfill the stylized art effects we want.

267
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:44,292
Because each block of terrain has an upper cap of mixing eight layers,

268
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:46,735
we can mix eight layers at most.

269
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:50,159
So our art effects production has its limitation.

270
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:56,911
For this, we made customized tint functions for the terrain material.

271
00:20:56,911 --> 00:21:00,936
We can get color variation without adding layers.

272
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:05,302
Then we fill it with grass feature same color tone

273
00:21:05,302 --> 00:21:08,206
and to add color variations on the land surface.

274
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:14,364
As an important element in the world, grass is used a lot naturally.

275
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:20,967
In order to avoid the repetitive of just using a single model,

276
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:24,349
we use a variety of grass culture models.

277
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:30,232
These models have randomized densities, size, and orientation.

278
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:35,706
At the same time, we grouped multiple sets of grass LODs

279
00:21:35,706 --> 00:21:39,308
and even prepared simplified models for mobile platforms.

280
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:45,612
As you know, Genshin Impact is available on mobile platform and console platforms.

281
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:48,994
To maintain the overall color of the picture,

282
00:21:48,994 --> 00:21:53,337
each grass culture has only one color, but the color can be changed.

283
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:57,940
The color of the grass corresponds to the color of the terrain by default.

284
00:21:58,654 --> 00:22:01,776
But everything can be tuned by artists.

285
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:06,761
The artist can also modify the color again.

286
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:11,184
And next, in Genshin Impact, cliffs and mountains

287
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:14,587
occupy a big proportion of the scenes.

288
00:22:14,587 --> 00:22:16,769
And when you play this game, the players

289
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,091
can climb all kinds of hills as they wish.

290
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:22,935
So in order to stylize the rock.

291
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:27,402
we need to recreate some of the brush stroke effects.

292
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:30,625
We use Substance Painter's Blur Slope filter

293
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,968
to stylize each layer of the texture

294
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:36,010
of our rocks and mountains,

295
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:40,154
and then mix three different textures together at the same time

296
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:44,098
to show different details and textures at different distances.

297
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:49,146
The three pictures below shows the rock effect

298
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:53,108
from different distance, from the near to medium distance

299
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:53,868
to far.

300
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:56,449
So we also consider the reusability of rock sets,

301
00:22:56,449 --> 00:23:00,091
making the details of rocks change

302
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:05,153
when zoom in and zoom out.

303
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:08,955
Another thing it was to be mentioned are trees.

304
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,477
Trees are also an important element in the world.

305
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:20,612
Unlike realistic trees, trees in Genshin Impact uses lots of shading tricks to blend in with

306
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:24,780
the surrounding environment while retaining the details.

307
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:32,307
So let me list some key points about how we make trees.

308
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:35,370
First, we use a spherical normal for leaves.

309
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,832
You can tell the differences between these two tree

310
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:39,993
pictures here.

311
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:44,697
And next, we have to weaken the specular and the shadow

312
00:23:44,697 --> 00:23:49,621
between leaves in order to make it more like an anime style.

313
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:53,043
And for tree shading, we set a minimum value

314
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:54,584
for main light intensity.

315
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:03,646
This prevents trees from looking too dark, too black when the main light intensity is pretty low in dawn and dusk.

316
00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:09,490
But after doing all of these things above, they still have a very critical problem.

317
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:15,894
The size of the leaves' cards are still looking too obvious, like it's showing on the right picture.

318
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:24,620
So we click the leaf out by dot production of the leaf and card normal and the view of the direction.

319
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:33,648
Okay, so at last, there is another thing very interesting I want to show you.

320
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:41,035
It's about the stylized dynamic cloud production. Let me give you a brief introduction about it.

321
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:45,839
This video shows the stylized dynamic clouds in the game.

322
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:49,287
You can see the cloud, the shape can change.

323
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,969
The cloud will grow and the color of the cloud

324
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:57,351
changes according to the weather change and the time change.

325
00:24:58,993 --> 00:25:02,495
So we made this cloud in the following steps.

326
00:25:02,495 --> 00:25:05,997
First, the artist draw the cloud silhouette

327
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:09,598
and the growth animation of the cloud keyframes.

328
00:25:09,598 --> 00:25:12,440
And next, according to these keyframes,

329
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,422
we have a tool to interpolate the cloud keyframes

330
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:19,223
into a gradient map as shown below.

331
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:24,645
And then we use two basic light map and a rim highlight map

332
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:27,167
to realize the 24 hours light effect.

333
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:35,867
Lastly, when we finished this, we used generated gradient map with some noise to realize the

334
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:43,809
dynamic changes at the clouds. Due to the stylized art style of the game, the dynamic

335
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:49,810
lightning effects mentioned here refers to the 24-hour color. Gradients was presented by our

336
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:56,732
artist too. So, well, that is all I want to share with you today.

337
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,354
Although Genshin Impact has been online, we are still developing future contents.

338
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:08,899
We just finished the Three Nations in Seven, and the third one, Inazuma, hasn't been updated yet.

339
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:15,924
It will take us another four years to finish all the Seven Nations in Tibet.

340
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:21,388
I believe that in the future, we will encounter many more problems,

341
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:24,571
and I also hope that in addition to the content update,

342
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:28,714
our team can continue to make improvements in technology.

343
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,855
So thanks for your listening today.

344
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:34,076
If you have any questions, please contact me by email.
