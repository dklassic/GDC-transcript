00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,281
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

2
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:08,542
My name is Brian Francis, the invisible voice inside your head, here as always talking about

3
00:00:09,523 --> 00:00:12,124
interesting games and how they get made with the people who make them.

4
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:17,826
We are here today playing a game called Overland, though we aren't exactly playing it, unfortunately.

5
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:19,686
I have to give two disclaimers up front.

6
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,207
One, the footage you're looking at is pre-recorded.

7
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:27,991
Um, and the other disclaimer is that, uh, I need to give a trigger warning for today's episode slightly,

8
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:33,676
in that we are, uh, going to be discussing and looking at footage of, uh, not real footage,

9
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:36,458
it's game footage, but like the footage of animals dying in this game.

10
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,501
The only reason I give that warning is that that was pretty...

11
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:50,325
In the lower left hand corner of the screen is Adam Saltzman of FingyCo.

12
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:52,805
Is it Fingy or FingyCo or Fingy Company?

13
00:00:55,826 --> 00:01:02,488
Usually just Fingy because of squatted accounts and things.

14
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:05,269
We have a lot of online identities that are FingyCo.

15
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:09,729
But, uh, yeah, just Fingy's fine.

16
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:12,732
Yeah, so the first important thing we have to talk about, this dog's name is Potato,

17
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:14,333
and it has put on a hat.

18
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:16,696
That's the first important thing to discuss.

19
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:21,760
The second thing to discuss is Overland, uh, the actual game.

20
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:28,106
Overland is a, uh, turn-based strategy game, uh, kind of looks a little, it reminds me of XCOM

21
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:31,769
when I look at it, because there's aliens and humans, but the vibe is very much more,

22
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,371
uh, Walking Dead in that.

23
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:45,937
The world is bleak, the monsters are scary, you are not an amazing alien killer, you are a bunch of fleshy humans and dogs trying to survive, and you are on a road trip across America trying to make it to the West Coast.

24
00:01:45,957 --> 00:01:48,878
You're going to see two runs here today from our gameplay yesterday.

25
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:51,360
They are really, I think they're really good explanations of what...

26
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:59,002
So Adam, that's going to bring me to my first question for you.

27
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:05,404
I saw Rebecca Saltzman talk at GDC this year where she talked about what the first versions of Overland looked like.

28
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:13,606
What was the first inspiration that you thought, me and my team can make Overland and we can sell this game?

29
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:16,967
What was kind of the first thing that you were thinking about when that thought crossed your mind?

30
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:21,371
Oh boy. I mean, it was, I think it was a, uh,

31
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:26,675
it was a very different scope of game when we started thinking about it, uh,

32
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:29,778
for sure. But, um, you know,

33
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,821
I think it was my initial inspiration mostly came from,

34
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:38,405
um, other games. I usually, uh, I like,

35
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,729
usually think kind of in terms of screenshots first, which is kind of a weird.

36
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:49,971
process maybe, but like it helps me a lot like to be able to sort of imagine what a game might look like and then I

37
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:53,634
Try to get a sense of like, oh would that be kind of like fun to play? I don't know

38
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:59,819
Uh, and I was i'm definitely playing a lot of x-com at the time. We started working on this game like six years ago

39
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:02,040
um, so the um

40
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:07,565
That first kind of big x-com reboot from pharaxis, uh had just come out and I was playing a lot of that

41
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:13,472
on prohibitively difficult settings and game-overing a lot.

42
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:17,253
And I was also playing a lot of...

43
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:21,735
And I still play a lot of Michael Bro's mobile games.

44
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:27,916
And at the time, I was playing a lot of a particular one called 868 Hack,

45
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:33,018
which is this just very elegant kind of...

46
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:41,381
I guess procedural puzzle game, sort of a rogue-like, sort of a dungeon crawl, but kind of abstract.

47
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:49,806
But basically, an 868 level is kind of a turn-based, move-through-the-level, zap some guys, collect some treasure kind of experience.

48
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:55,909
Maybe presented a little abstractly, but it all plays out on this teeny tiny space.

49
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,350
I think it's like a 6x6 grid or something like that.

50
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:00,651
And it's just...

51
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:09,647
elegant and compelling and beautiful and interesting and it was I felt like it was getting at a lot of the

52
00:04:10,427 --> 00:04:10,888
kind of

53
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:15,831
Things that were exciting about XCOM a lot of the things that are exciting about XCOM for me

54
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:17,813
But it was getting at them in this very

55
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,134
compact

56
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:28,634
kind of package or presentation. Like literally compact. Like in XCOM you might, which is a game

57
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:36,697
that just to be clear I adore, you know the first 20-25 minutes of a level sometimes are just this

58
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:43,079
very very careful anticipatory exploration period and then you start making life or death decisions.

59
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:44,139
And

60
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:54,621
That's sort of a maybe unfair generalization, but 868-HACK, like the first time you swipe the screen and move your little computer chip or whatever,

61
00:04:54,641 --> 00:05:02,045
that was a life-or-death decision. And then whether to move left or up next is a life-or-death decision, essentially.

62
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:07,067
It's got that kind of like... like it's been really, really boiled down.

63
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:12,770
And I think maybe not in terms of trying to replicate...

64
00:05:14,345 --> 00:05:19,308
other strategy experiences, but that's just kind of the shape the game took and so it's interesting to play like a like a bigger

65
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:26,253
More maximalist more spread out kind of turn-based strategy game at the same time is like a very very compact

66
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:28,474
abstract strategy game

67
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:31,236
both of which had generative elements

68
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:38,821
both of which were these turn-based games with these big trade-offs for short-term decisions versus long-term decisions and

69
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,010
That kind of thing.

70
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:48,634
And so yeah, the very first versions of this were just kind of me thinking about,

71
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:53,077
trying to think about like, you know, if you mash these things up, like what do you end up with?

72
00:05:54,618 --> 00:06:00,121
And the original sort of doodle of like what a screenshot of this game might look like is a very

73
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:06,184
like, thinking about like old John Carpenter movies and like a handful of iconic characters

74
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,806
out in the middle of nowhere at night.

75
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,584
Trying to get some gas and get back in their car.

76
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:15,185
Which is what's happening right now.

77
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,306
That's pretty much what's going on right here.

78
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:21,048
That part of the game has carried through since about week one.

79
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:25,331
A long, long, long, long, long, long, long time ago.

80
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,873
But that was the piece of it that was really interesting to me.

81
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:29,874
It was like, okay, what if...

82
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,635
A lot of things fell out of that.

83
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:34,796
It was like, oh, if it's this teeny, teeny, tiny board

84
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:36,938
and everybody on the board has superpowers

85
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:38,078
that's going to be kind of weird.

86
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:45,863
And also, you know, I tend to like science fiction stories that are less about some kind of

87
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:52,827
super-powered hero character and more about kind of average people trying to deal with

88
00:06:53,387 --> 00:07:01,391
very unaverage things. And yeah, and sort of a lot of different little bits and pieces

89
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:07,975
kind of like grew out of that. A lot of the games that I have made historically are

90
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:16,132
Not games where you're a very powerful person and they are often not games where you are fighting to

91
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:20,455
beat something but maybe like running away from something and I think

92
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:24,938
a lot of those interests kind of carried over into earlier versions of the game as well

93
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:31,502
where it became more about like almost these little like nighttime heists like get out of the

94
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:36,805
car and steal these valuables before the creatures get you and jump back in the car and drive away

95
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:37,506
kind of a feel.

96
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:50,369
As opposed to like a, you know, go in guns blazing and kick all the aliens butts and wear their skulls for hats and collect their alien guts for treasure or whatever.

97
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,272
Even though I enjoy playing those kinds of games.

98
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:55,864
Right on.

99
00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:01,709
It's worth then before digging into my other questions asking about, I mean, just to ask

100
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:06,154
how Overland evolved is to ask how have you spent the last three, four, five years of

101
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:06,534
your life?

102
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:09,737
Because I saw this thing at IndieCade in 2015, 20-ish?

103
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,238
I forget when.

104
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,600
I forget exactly when.

105
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,121
Whoops.

106
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:14,361
Sorry.

107
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:14,582
Uh oh.

108
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,974
I'm good. I'm good.

109
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:24,017
Oh boy, we're about to watch a very rough first couple of levels here.

110
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,038
That's good news.

111
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:31,863
So if I'm going to ask how this game evolved, I'll ask you for a compact version from that initial vision of

112
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:35,866
compact XCOM, of elegant XCOM, kind of fear-based running away.

113
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:40,930
What did the development process bring out of that initial design that wasn't there before?

114
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:47,347
I think probably the main thing was bringing in a bunch of collaborators

115
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:51,629
who I think have kind of more interesting ideas than I do

116
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,650
and sort of bringing them to bear on this thing

117
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,931
and seeing where that went after that.

118
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:00,872
So I think the...

119
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:07,885
While there are aspects of the original prototype that probably would be recognizable in this game,

120
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:14,666
the small group of people, limited inventory, limited actions, every choice is pretty important,

121
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:20,667
even if it's not life or death. And, you know, grab the fuel, get back in the car,

122
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:24,868
let's get out of here. Like a lot of that focus has stayed intact, but a lot of the things that

123
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:29,249
have changed have been like, you know, what is the actual mood?

124
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:38,842
of the game and what does the actual game look like and why and you know how do you go about trying to

125
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:46,068
um like one thing that you run into if you're trying to make kind of a a a dense game you know

126
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:49,451
a game where you have a lot of interesting complicated choices but they all exist in a

127
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:54,896
small space is you get these kind of like information problems like how many hit points

128
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:57,618
does that thing have and what's going to happen if i do this and

129
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,448
What are my options with this character now?

130
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,452
And a huge amount of time was spent trying to figure out

131
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:08,854
what we wanted to do with that and what made sense for this game.

132
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:11,656
There aren't a lot of games that are squad-based,

133
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:14,359
where each character has their own inventory, for example.

134
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,222
And in retrospect, it seems like,

135
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:20,463
oh, maybe there's a reason that people were avoiding that.

136
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,824
It's really hard to do well.

137
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,888
And so, like, a lot of iteration and...

138
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:32,415
development time went into trying to figure out how to

139
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:38,239
just kind of like help people, especially people who maybe don't play a ton of strategy games,

140
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:43,923
to roughly have an idea of what's going on right now and what's at stake.

141
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:53,690
So like the idea that, you know, someone who maybe isn't an expert level Final Fantasy tactics player

142
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,912
could see this screenshot that's right here and go like...

143
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:02,385
Oh boy, that dog is surrounded by scary looking things,

144
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:08,107
and the road is blocked, and the car is damaged now.

145
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,187
And that's probably bad.

146
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:14,048
And I hope that they can get in the car

147
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:17,029
and drive away and escape and be OK.

148
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,910
And that's something that you can extract just

149
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,971
from one screenshot, which I think is kind of cool.

150
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:23,771
There's a lot of strategy games where

151
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,972
if you weren't really thoroughly

152
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:34,021
um, versed in all of the pros and cons of the different stat systems and so on,

153
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:40,848
uh, you wouldn't be able to tell even which, like, team was winning or something.

154
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:49,378
Um, and I think it's a thing that, um, Beck and I both love about, um, uh.

155
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:54,964
You know, I think board games was another big inspiration for this project, but

156
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:01,526
pandemic in particular, and pandemic is this kind of like, imagine like risk, except instead of armies,

157
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:05,668
it's viruses, and you're trying to control these kind of virus breakouts around the world, these

158
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:14,371
epidemics. And as soon as you know that the game is about epidemics, the

159
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:19,636
Basic game board is really communicative, even if you don't know a lot about board games.

160
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:21,636
You can see that it's a map of the earth.

161
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:27,739
You can see that certain cities have a lot of cubes on them. You may not necessarily know right off the bat which

162
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:34,722
whether or not it's good to have a lot of cubes, but you can certainly tell that there are big differences between certain cities

163
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:40,385
on this world map that you know, because you can recognize these places. They're real actual places.

164
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:41,905
And so

165
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:49,462
I think developing, especially developing the visual look and feel of the game

166
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,283
was motivated by a lot of those concerns,

167
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:56,264
wanting a lot of the places in the game to be kind of recognizable

168
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:59,684
and for the stakes to be easy to understand.

169
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:07,786
And that all kind of is connected to, I think, the way that the gameplay evolved,

170
00:13:07,886 --> 00:13:12,887
which was an ongoing increasing interest in

171
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:22,560
Maybe initially making what we felt was a challenging strategy game, but over time realizing that

172
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,322
that was only kind of interesting because you were worried about these little characters,

173
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,303
and you wanted them to be okay.

174
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:39,386
And Beck and I started calling it, like, Tuning for Drama, which is a...

175
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:45,703
A possibly ridiculous way of talking about this kind of game design, but it was things like,

176
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:50,487
you know, in older versions of the game, the characters couldn't move diagonally.

177
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:57,352
They could only move kind of orthogonally along the grid, like a, you know, most chess pieces,

178
00:13:57,552 --> 00:14:03,217
or like all the sort of monsters in the game. They can only move up, down, left, right. And

179
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:06,940
that seemed like a reasonable thing to do. Everything follows the same rules.

180
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:10,412
Cars go up, down, left, right. Monsters go up, down, left, right.

181
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:12,933
And characters go up, down, left, right. And that feels fine.

182
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:18,155
Because, you know, you want consistency and you want fairness.

183
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:24,959
But it turns out it's much more fun if the characters can move diagonally.

184
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:27,880
You get, like you're seeing here...

185
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,742
Yeah, literally, that moment was like the only reason Anton makes it out of here is because of that.

186
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,305
Yep, exactly. And it's like, oh, you get really cool close calls now.

187
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:39,008
I guess it didn't matter in this case, maybe, but...

188
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:40,270
Oh, watch, watch.

189
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:42,813
Oh, is he going to pull a move here?

190
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,755
He's going to pull a...

191
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:46,517
Oh, maybe he doesn't pull a move. No, he just gets...

192
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:46,918
Maybe not.

193
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:50,402
Oh, he had a good run.

194
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:53,644
And he took care of that plant to the very end. That's beautiful.

195
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:55,885
You were saying, sorry.

196
00:14:56,406 --> 00:15:01,149
Oh no, it's fine. But yeah, like this moving diagonally feels like it's breaking rules and making the game unfair

197
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,070
and maybe making the player too powerful.

198
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,193
We wanted players to feel kind of scared and vulnerable, but what it really does is it gives you all these opportunities

199
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:11,215
to have even more close calls and even more narrow escapes.

200
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:19,381
And that started to become the metric by which we judged what sorts of decisions we were going to make about...

201
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:24,758
Game mechanics or game rules or game actions or whatever it was like does this

202
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:29,079
Help you does this give you a way to

203
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:32,140
It's kind of like you know

204
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,802
What sorts of tools can you give the player to make them to give them ways to cleverly take care of these?

205
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:39,322
like lost little puppies

206
00:15:41,223 --> 00:15:48,525
and so letting them move diagonally and push things around and repair things and heal each other and revive each other and

207
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:57,241
Shove things away from you and sometimes, you know, really fight back or manipulate the environment by starting fires or whatever.

208
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:05,748
Anything that felt like it was not just systemically interesting and a good fit for the setting,

209
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:15,995
but also that played into these kinds of fantasies of taking care of these lost little people on their road trip.

210
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:18,748
Those started to be things where we felt like,

211
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:22,111
okay, maybe this is a slightly unconventional decision

212
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:25,994
in terms of the mathematics about this game mechanic,

213
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:32,659
but it kind of elevates this,

214
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,822
squeaking out by the skin of your teeth kind of experience.

215
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:41,906
Or either because it's an interesting mechanic, like,

216
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:44,888
oh, I can squeeze between these two things and barely make it to safety.

217
00:16:45,432 --> 00:16:51,195
Or because it's something that makes you feel sympathy toward the little characters,

218
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:54,796
like trying to come up with a good system for generating their backstories,

219
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:59,218
or when our art director Heather made sure that everyone had eyebrows,

220
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,440
or coming up with a couple of cute items that they can carry around,

221
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,102
like all these little bits and pieces that make you feel more connected to the little characters.

222
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,230
Those are things that help elevate this too.

223
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,731
And it seemed like it was these two things,

224
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:18,112
coming up with kind of gameplay opportunities

225
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:25,875
for people to feel like they have agency

226
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:27,615
in orchestrating these narrow escapes,

227
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:33,658
but also just taking time and effort

228
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,099
to make the little characters feel like they're people that are worth saving

229
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:39,160
and that you feel like you want to protect.

230
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:42,918
That is quite an answer.

231
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:44,039
Sorry, did I cut you off?

232
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:45,099
Oh, no, no, no.

233
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:48,842
That's a lot of answer.

234
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:55,145
My immediate follow-up is to ask, and for folks in chat, I'm going to give a quick

235
00:17:55,165 --> 00:18:02,910
shout out to Sean Peoples, to Sam Falavin, to Clifton B, who I saw in there.

236
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,671
We are going to take your questions.

237
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:07,132
We're going to, for a minute though,

238
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,992
we're just going to be focusing on

239
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:11,193
this discussion about the game's design.

240
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:13,294
Adam, that leads to

241
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:14,774
my immediate follow-up question,

242
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,195
which is sort of born

243
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,316
explained by the

244
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:20,476
answer you just gave, but

245
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:23,257
why is this game so hard, and why is this game so

246
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:25,037
sad, then? Like, it's

247
00:18:25,077 --> 00:18:27,618
interesting, because Narrow Escapes,

248
00:18:28,218 --> 00:18:29,119
you're going to see a ton, like,

249
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:31,259
we've seen a ton of these in the stream already, and there's going to be

250
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:31,980
more happening.

251
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:40,605
Like the game, what you described is almost eerily playing out in echo with your answer in my footage, which is just like, I feel like I'm being haunted by you.

252
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:42,526
You are. It's okay.

253
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:54,373
But difficult and sad are still the two immediate vibes I got when I came away from this game after this hour yesterday. And I'm curious, why is that? It feels very intentional.

254
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:04,742
It is intentional and I feel like historically a lot of my game ideas are pretty gloomy.

255
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:09,983
And I think that comes from a few different places but partly like

256
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:22,447
there are a lot of games that are kind of ostensibly about the end of the world and they are

257
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:26,749
Uh...

258
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:31,212
Very...

259
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:35,595
If not upbeat, then very, like, action-oriented.

260
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:37,096
Or they're very...

261
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:38,476
Not even action-oriented.

262
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:40,478
They're still about conquering.

263
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:42,499
It's like, there's a lot of end-of-the-world games

264
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,782
where you win by engaging in the kind of, like, actions and morals

265
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:50,704
that tend to bring about the end of the world in the first place.

266
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:51,864
Mm-hmm.

267
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:54,066
And then that's how you win, sort of.

268
00:19:55,548 --> 00:20:04,352
So, you know, I think a classic, like a classic game loop that we accidentally ended up not using,

269
00:20:04,392 --> 00:20:10,315
but then I think retroactively felt kind of good about, is, you know, like a classic dungeon crawly game loop,

270
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:18,599
is you kill all the monsters on the floor that you're on, and then you go collect all the treasure that all the monsters had,

271
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:20,880
and then you proceed down to the next floor.

272
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:25,857
Which is...

273
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:29,881
I don't know. I feel like that...

274
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:34,785
It's something that makes you feel powerful, which is a big part of what makes it fun

275
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:38,208
for a lot of players. It's also been done a lot.

276
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,130
And...

277
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:46,656
Something that has been a preoccupation for this whole project

278
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,198
is, you know, what if you made...

279
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:55,482
A game that had the post-apocalyptic setting like you're maybe sort of familiar with,

280
00:20:55,642 --> 00:21:00,766
and also had this kind of turn-based, kind of tactical gameplay

281
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:03,347
that maybe is familiar from other games in the genre.

282
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:09,751
But the emotional palette wasn't that you were leveling up overwhelming power

283
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,313
in order to save the world,

284
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:19,917
but instead you were just sort of there when the world was ending.

285
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,123
And what would you do? And I think, like...

286
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:32,751
The short answer is I think it's extremely appropriate for a game about the end of the world to be challenging and sad.

287
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:37,375
I think the world ending is challenging and sad.

288
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:40,978
And...

289
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,801
But I also think that it's not necessarily the only...

290
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,380
I don't think it's a one-note emotional experience.

291
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:56,402
Like a lot of the mechanics in this game are reactions to mechanics in other procedural

292
00:21:56,522 --> 00:22:03,684
long-form strategy games where, you know, having a crushing defeat in one level means

293
00:22:03,744 --> 00:22:08,605
your campaign is over and you really fundamentally have to restart the game in order to proceed.

294
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:11,826
And in Overland, you can have a crushing defeat.

295
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:12,206
You can.

296
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:18,138
have to abandon your very favorite dog, even though they're named Potato.

297
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:24,503
And it feels bad, but it does not end your campaign.

298
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:27,705
You can meet other people, and you can recover.

299
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:36,572
And you can have another hard loss, and you can recover from that too.

300
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:41,596
And I feel like...

301
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:49,563
I guess I totally agree that it is a challenging game and is a game with a lot of sad parts,

302
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:58,691
but I think it has... I think there's a lot of hopeful things in it, and that the

303
00:22:59,432 --> 00:23:04,817
the palette is definitely not intended to be one of complete hopelessness.

304
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,681
That there are...

305
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:14,633
good things to do and things worth doing and there are people in the game that you can help

306
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:22,416
and there are, you know, positive things that you can do even though the world is ending.

307
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:30,259
Right on. We are going to move on through our stream. I have more questions about

308
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,782
this game's design but Adam, I do think those were very eloquent answers about tone and

309
00:23:35,942 --> 00:23:39,463
designing for toning games. I really liked your phrase earlier, tuning for drama.

310
00:23:40,724 --> 00:23:44,986
In particular, I just wanted to add one comment about, you said in there, like, you know,

311
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:49,189
in games about the end of the world, you're often participating in the behavior of ending

312
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:49,509
the world.

313
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:53,972
I think that even strangely loops back to your bit about dungeon crawling and how the

314
00:23:54,012 --> 00:24:00,555
dungeon crawling loop is loot things and then, or kill the monsters, loot things.

315
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:05,178
Even though those settings are not apocalyptic, you're kind of creating an apocalypse for

316
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,381
Oh, anybody who lived in the dungeon is having their world ended by you, definitely.

317
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:18,263
I think that's an insightful... I hadn't thought about that before, which isn't to condemn that kind of mechanic.

318
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:23,765
It's just to... I understand your... I think your framing goes broader than you stated originally.

319
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:30,908
CliftonB would like to know, what's one feature you've had to cut for some reason that you really wanted to keep in the game?

320
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,869
Ooh...

321
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:43,635
I think we didn't... well, oh boy, good...

322
00:24:45,936 --> 00:24:46,756
Good question, Clifton.

323
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:51,838
Yes, good question. There were... there's... we got pretty lucky in a bunch of ways.

324
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:57,860
One is that there wasn't that much stuff that we ended up cutting.

325
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,281
There were a lot of things that were planned, but never actually got started.

326
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:05,063
One thing that was in a bunch of the early prototypes was...

327
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:08,640
Basically like a dirt bike.

328
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,781
Mm-hmm.

329
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:14,142
So especially for doing solo runs through the game,

330
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:15,663
it was this sort of weird vehicle

331
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:17,104
that you could drive all over the map.

332
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:19,044
And you didn't have to stay on the road.

333
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:21,926
And it had a bunch of weird properties

334
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:23,206
compared to the other vehicles.

335
00:25:23,246 --> 00:25:26,448
And it ended up feeling like, A, it

336
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:27,828
was going to be a lot of animation work

337
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:29,849
to get all that set up and feeling good.

338
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,431
And B, it kind of, we.

339
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:39,257
Playing with that vehicle and exploring that thing would kind of miss out on a lot of the

340
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:44,620
sort of hunkered down inside the car in the rain while things move around outside feelings.

341
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:53,164
But it was kind of cool and fun. There was a bunch of planned stuff that I think would have

342
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:58,346
been interesting to investigate and we might still get a chance to do. My favorite one was

343
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:02,128
I wanted to put horses in.

344
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:10,500
Uh, like you could ride horses from place to place and they wouldn't need gas, but you would have to like find

345
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:12,382
grass instead

346
00:26:12,402 --> 00:26:18,647
And like get off and like defend the horses while they munched and then like hop on and ride some more

347
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:23,411
um, and I was really jazzed about that right up to the point that I realized that was like almost

348
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:28,135
A completely separate game than the one we were building and that probably we would have to set that aside

349
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:28,195
uh

350
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:34,585
I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch of other stuff, but those are the two that come to mind.

351
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:38,487
Overland 1, you pet dogs. Overland 2, you pet horses.

352
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:42,210
It's still pretty tempting.

353
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,349
Oh man, Overland Expansion Pack.

354
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,692
There's a lot of ways you could implement horses.

355
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:54,274
Clifton, thank you for the question. I'll just share a few other quick comments here.

356
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:57,176
Chris Graft at Gamasutra Editor-in-Chief is hanging out in chat.

357
00:26:57,636 --> 00:27:00,618
Had a perspective of, from our comments earlier about Worlds Ending,

358
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:04,140
Fallout is a game where you nuke the world in response to the world being nuked.

359
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:07,883
Sean Peeples is hanging out in chat making geometry jokes.

360
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:13,308
Sam Palavan has a question, how does one get good at Overland?

361
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:21,396
Sam Palavan, I would say that this current stream is about 40 minutes of decent gameplay advice for getting good at Overland.

362
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,299
So maybe that'll help you. I hope it does.

363
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:31,485
We'd love to do gameplay advice, but I think the Fingie Discord has been a good place for that, right?

364
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,226
Yeah, there's a pretty active community of players on there.

365
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:40,628
And there are, I think, you know, when you start building a game that is about

366
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:51,933
not nuking the world in a genre, and a little bit more broadly for this genre, or this, you know,

367
00:27:53,854 --> 00:27:55,574
both gameplay genre and story genre.

368
00:27:57,704 --> 00:28:01,265
You end up with different mechanics and different things that you're trying to do.

369
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:05,287
And those are not always intuitive.

370
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:08,929
And so, you know, things like,

371
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:11,530
oh, it's really important to protect the car.

372
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:19,561
Cars are not a completely disposable asset that you can simply lose and carry on the game as if nothing happened.

373
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:26,263
That's a new idea to some players. But yeah, hopping on the Discord and talking to

374
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:34,927
the players on there and we also like some of the design crew are on there from time to time as well

375
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:36,808
and super happy to

376
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:41,370
help give tips and feedback and hear stories about how

377
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:48,103
They thought that they had left Harold behind, but in fact they hadn't and were very upset to see him later.

378
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:52,063
Right on.

379
00:28:52,123 --> 00:28:54,484
Going to go back to my question pile real quick.

380
00:28:55,464 --> 00:28:57,065
Let's talk about procedural generation.

381
00:28:57,565 --> 00:29:07,930
Adam, I think we've had a good chat about mood, tone, vibe, and making specific artistic, aesthetic, and design, like, interactive choices to drive that mood.

382
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:15,514
But at the end of the day, the computer has to dive into some base of logic in order to make something procedural spit out.

383
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:17,635
Would you mind outlining?

384
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:25,600
I'm going to dive into one question.

385
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,583
How does the game know to say in a level like the one we're looking at to spit out a house

386
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:33,645
that takes up a quarter of the map, a fifth of the map, I don't know, an eighth?

387
00:29:33,745 --> 00:29:37,187
That's like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, a ninth of the map.

388
00:29:37,507 --> 00:29:40,509
It takes up a ninth of the map and effectively says this area is not play space.

389
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,931
How does the game know to do that and what is the game trying to do when it makes procedural

390
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:44,112
stuff?

391
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,502
Yeah, so we went through a few iterations on that also,

392
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:54,246
but the current system, the base system is one that I'm really happy with.

393
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:56,828
And I don't know if other games do it or not,

394
00:29:56,908 --> 00:30:01,612
but basically, because we know that every level is going to take place

395
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:05,875
in this little nine by nine space, we've got like 81 tiles there.

396
00:30:06,656 --> 00:30:08,477
I think you could do this at larger scales too,

397
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:11,580
but it's a little bit more manageable at smaller sizes

398
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,241
in terms of defining these things.

399
00:30:13,281 --> 00:30:13,921
But basically...

400
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:29,186
Every object in the game, we call them placement masks, but they're essentially gradients based on existing level features.

401
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:34,790
So the primary ones are, where are the edges of the level, and where are the roads.

402
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:41,454
And we can sort of make a little kind of blurry gradient out of that information

403
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:46,036
and then start to overlap it with the placement masks that these different objects have.

404
00:30:46,156 --> 00:30:50,037
So, for example, the placement mask for houses says,

405
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:55,698
you know what, these things really do, these things don't look good if they're in the very bottom corner,

406
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,439
right there in the middle of the camera, taking up the whole level.

407
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:01,020
They also don't look good when they're in the road.

408
00:31:02,142 --> 00:31:06,046
And they don't look great if they're too close to the road. Something about it feels off.

409
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:09,209
And so we can define a placement mask for the house

410
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:13,653
that's like you should be at least this far away from the road and you should stay out of that

411
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:14,574
what is it?

412
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:16,776
Southwest corner of the level.

413
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,038
And then

414
00:31:19,058 --> 00:31:25,985
the level generator can... oh, we also can keep track of how hilly the terrain is.

415
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:30,516
And so we can have it kind of check, you know, is this on a, is this part too slopey?

416
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:38,618
Or is this part kind of flat enough to, uh, uh, believably place a human domestic structure?

417
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:45,861
Uh, and then, um, so the, I guess the very first step is the terrain that this level

418
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:47,361
takes place on is actually quite large.

419
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:49,982
This road goes on and on off the screen, both ways.

420
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:54,704
Um, we pick out the slice of it that we want to use first, and then we

421
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:56,184
start populating it with objects.

422
00:31:57,147 --> 00:32:01,174
So once we've cut out that little square, the level generator will usually go through

423
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:06,906
and roughly from largest to smallest, we'll start to populate the level with key items.

424
00:32:07,507 --> 00:32:13,888
So there are many arrangements of roads and hills that will prohibit the appearance of a house entirely,

425
00:32:13,968 --> 00:32:15,268
and so it simply won't happen.

426
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:17,448
And then it might go through...

427
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:22,429
We usually prioritize your kind of mission-critical resources, so...

428
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,010
This is, I think, like a scavenging level probably.

429
00:32:28,471 --> 00:32:35,992
And so we'll go and place in a few objects where you can go and open them up and get some items out of them.

430
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:40,714
And each of those objects has its own placement mask.

431
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:45,916
So smashed up cars usually show up near the road or on the road.

432
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:51,338
Sheds usually show up kind of back toward the edge of the level with their door facing outward.

433
00:32:52,358 --> 00:32:58,921
Fences tend to be arranged along specific lines near the edges of levels, that kind of thing.

434
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:04,179
So we're able to give that information to those objects, which is great.

435
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:09,381
And there's a few special cases where we have some code that does something a little more complicated,

436
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,742
but most of the placement is controlled by those things.

437
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:16,784
But the ingredients that it chooses from are all based on where you are in the game

438
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:18,645
and what kind of level you're going into.

439
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:25,528
So on this stream here, they're going to a level where you can get a hopefully undamaged vehicle

440
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:28,750
with a little bit of gas in it and maybe find a cool upgrade for a car too.

441
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:32,688
This is a special set of ingredients where we're saying,

442
00:33:32,768 --> 00:33:36,552
okay, you're in the woodlands, that means we're looking at these kinds of ingredients for the level.

443
00:33:37,272 --> 00:33:40,875
We know that you are a little ways off the main road,

444
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:47,061
so we're going to use kind of a medium difficulty level enemy set instead of a high difficulty enemy set.

445
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:51,665
We are going to also... oh, it's nighttime. Okay, we're going to make sure that...

446
00:33:52,353 --> 00:33:56,195
In this zone, maybe there's a streetlight that you can activate. That might be kind of interesting.

447
00:33:57,576 --> 00:34:01,439
And then also you're supposed to be scavenging a vehicle, so somewhere on this map we're also

448
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:09,043
going to place a car that you can maybe collect and drive out of there. And somewhere down the

449
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:16,208
chain you can also have kind of like wild cards. So wild cards are sort of these late stage

450
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:19,070
modifiers for the kinds of ingredients that go into the level.

451
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:30,118
So it might be to populate the level with a forest, or to add a little, like, farmhouse vignette, or to...

452
00:34:30,598 --> 00:34:38,262
It turns out you're in kind of an open space with a lot of dry, flammable things, and there's a fire in the corner, and so on and so forth.

453
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:40,463
But those kind of...

454
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:44,866
Sort of, I guess, like a...

455
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:50,616
Cascading overrides for the kinds of situations that you might or might not run into,

456
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:57,703
plus these placement masks, plus paying attention to where you are in the game and what kind of resources you're getting.

457
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:03,489
Those are all factors that feed into how it generates the level and where things go.

458
00:35:05,194 --> 00:35:09,997
Right on. This level is really, really, this is such an interesting bit of game we're seeing here because

459
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:17,222
in two, the fact that the game is going to keep going after this one is such a testament to the

460
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:22,945
work you all have put in. Because in an instant, the light of the explosion showed me where the car was.

461
00:35:23,866 --> 00:35:28,669
My principal character, who I started this run with, was killed by one of these creatures.

462
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,290
My dog goes on a rampage.

463
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,912
Invent of vengeance and my new survivor...

464
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:35,753
Good job Patches.

465
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,813
Patches is a good dog.

466
00:35:39,194 --> 00:35:43,516
And this other survivor is gonna get them both out by the skin of his teeth.

467
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,317
Ooh!

468
00:35:46,957 --> 00:35:48,458
Samplevan...

469
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:51,239
Samplevan...

470
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:53,660
Would like to know how do you deal with some of the feedback...

471
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,061
The RNG of the game can feel unforgiving.

472
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:59,223
And I have a follow-up question for that but I'm gonna let you answer his question first.

473
00:36:01,356 --> 00:36:08,560
I think it's a super understandable response that I sympathize with to a great degree.

474
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,342
There's a lot of things in this game where you learn by doing.

475
00:36:13,843 --> 00:36:22,908
There's not a huge formal tutorial process where you have to read lots of text before you go out into the world.

476
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:29,491
It's a lot of sort of, you know, actually thinking about what you're doing.

477
00:36:29,997 --> 00:36:36,640
Trying to make good guesses, but also paying a lot of attention to what happens.

478
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:40,182
Those are things that are hard to do.

479
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:47,025
Not saying that this is the right way to make a game, obviously,

480
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:51,507
but there are lots of games where that's not really a thing that they demand that you do.

481
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:54,408
There are a lot of games where the...

482
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:06,843
I guess progress is determined mostly by doing one very straightforward task at a time,

483
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:10,926
and that's how you move forward.

484
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:16,509
And I play a lot of games that are built that way,

485
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:18,430
and I enjoy a lot of games that are built that way,

486
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:22,873
and I think there's a lot of people who...

487
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:29,933
don't need a game to ask them to think really hard about what to do next.

488
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:36,695
That's like, that's not why they play games. And I think that's a completely fair stance.

489
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:44,078
And it is something that Overland asks you to do, and I think it does create a little bit of a

490
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:52,482
gap between two player bases, where one player base feels like, wow, this game is so attentive.

491
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:57,444
From just feedback we've been getting, like, this is an attentive, detailed game,

492
00:37:57,865 --> 00:38:05,711
and almost any situation you get into, if, you know, you can figure out a sneaky way to escape.

493
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,433
That's so rewarding, this is the kind of game I've always wanted to play.

494
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:11,015
Something to that effect, right?

495
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:14,177
And then you have another audience of people who are like,

496
00:38:14,657 --> 00:38:18,520
well, I had a big car, and I rammed the thing really hard and killed it,

497
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,282
and then my car blew up, and I got game over,

498
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:21,362
and...

499
00:38:23,657 --> 00:38:27,180
Um, frankly, uh, this isn't fun for me.

500
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:35,745
Um, and like, I don't know, I guess I feel like that's a pretty fair reaction

501
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:39,447
to a video game, but I also think there's a little bit of a culture of like really

502
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:47,952
needing or wanting to, um, assign that dislike some, uh, you know, something

503
00:38:48,372 --> 00:38:49,733
that sounds more.

504
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:54,828
like justified or intellectual or something. In film theory this is sometimes called like,

505
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:59,992
at least like in like pop film theory, like there's this idea of tangible details

506
00:39:01,353 --> 00:39:06,317
and tangible details is like you're watching a movie, you're not really gelling with it for

507
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:12,863
lots of different reasons and then there's like one scene in it where a character has a

508
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:15,945
really deliberately stylized costume or something.

509
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:24,223
And you'll start to see a lot of feedback about this movie, which is like, this movie's, um, uh, look at this costume.

510
00:39:24,243 --> 00:39:28,744
Look at this one specific thing about this movie that is just like completely preposterous.

511
00:39:29,124 --> 00:39:32,105
And this is what makes this movie bad is this costume choice.

512
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:37,726
Um, when really it's like, maybe, uh, you know, just not your kind of movie.

513
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:41,667
And there's a lot of different reasons that you feel that way, but you've found.

514
00:39:42,552 --> 00:39:44,913
You have this one thing that you can kind of say is like,

515
00:39:44,993 --> 00:39:48,054
oh, you know what it is though? It's really this. It's this one thing.

516
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:50,635
It's a, uh, you know,

517
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:54,576
there's one simple reason that I feel this way. Um,

518
00:39:55,717 --> 00:39:59,558
and I think for this game so far, there's definitely like, um,

519
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:04,600
a subset of players who have decided that it's the RNG. Um,

520
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:10,303
so I guess our floating point numbers are not the kind that they want.

521
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,741
a game like this to have.

522
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:16,743
Which, I don't know. I guess that's...

523
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:24,828
I think it's a totally valid feeling to have, and I understand how people get there if they haven't

524
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:28,270
sort of discovered

525
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:31,432
all the things that you can do in the game.

526
00:40:33,673 --> 00:40:38,476
Or sometimes I think it's just like this reboot. Like the thing we were talking about about like

527
00:40:38,496 --> 00:40:38,516
I...

528
00:40:41,428 --> 00:40:43,309
Actually, you know what? Let me put it this way.

529
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:55,175
If your totally reasonable assumption on picking up this strategy game is that you're going to kill all the monsters, get all the treasure, and proceed to the next level,

530
00:40:55,795 --> 00:41:02,398
the RNG in this game probably feels very unfair.

531
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:09,622
Because that's not what you can or should do in this game.

532
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:15,127
Um, so I guess, yeah, I think I, I would stop short of saying that people are,

533
00:41:15,147 --> 00:41:22,850
um, wrong or misinformed or, you know, um, entitled or anything like that.

534
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:27,392
I don't think those things are true, but I think if you turn this game on,

535
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:33,374
fully anticipating, um, something very similar to a game that you've

536
00:41:33,414 --> 00:41:34,555
played many times before.

537
00:41:36,374 --> 00:41:41,776
and you start playing it that way, that it probably is going to feel unfair.

538
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:48,579
And that is a completely intentional design decision. I don't know that it's

539
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,482
the best one for every audience or anything, but that definitely is a...

540
00:41:57,003 --> 00:42:01,885
I guess like we were talking about before, we wanted to tell stories about the end of the world.

541
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:16,502
I think it's pretty appropriate for those stories to not be stories where you obliterate everything and you get lots of awards for doing it.

542
00:42:19,526 --> 00:42:21,688
I don't know. Sorry, that was a bit of a roundabout answer.

543
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:28,612
I like roundabout answers because I feel genuinely as though when people are making roundabout

544
00:42:28,652 --> 00:42:33,676
answers they are letting us share in the thought process that help make these decisions happen

545
00:42:33,716 --> 00:42:38,139
because at some point, you know, you had to ask yourselves that question because you were

546
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:41,101
talking about XCOM and talking about that hack game earlier.

547
00:42:42,246 --> 00:42:51,392
Definitely, yeah. And it's funny because my relationship with those games is very much a relationship with trying to understand their approach to randomness.

548
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:56,956
One thing we deliberately omitted from this game was percentage to hit.

549
00:42:58,437 --> 00:43:03,580
That was a thing that I wanted to not be part of the equation for a wide variety of reasons.

550
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:07,863
And, you know, there's a lot of...

551
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:09,839
I think pretty...

552
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:13,842
Stuff that I hope I can reuse on later projects,

553
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:15,723
but sort of ways of thinking about, like,

554
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:17,705
okay, we've got a compact space.

555
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:19,626
How do we make sure that

556
00:43:20,486 --> 00:43:21,847
once people have learned the ropes

557
00:43:21,927 --> 00:43:24,169
that they do have a ton of agency

558
00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:26,290
and that they can interact with all the random systems

559
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,312
in this game in a valid and interesting way?

560
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:30,913
And what does that mean for, for example,

561
00:43:30,933 --> 00:43:31,994
we do want...

562
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:36,222
Random events are great, technically.

563
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:39,744
They create a good sense of anticipation and surprise,

564
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:42,806
and they ask the player to improvise, and all of those things.

565
00:43:42,846 --> 00:43:47,348
But how do you make those feel fair,

566
00:43:48,769 --> 00:43:50,010
once you understand what's going on?

567
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:57,314
And I think a big part of that is things like delays.

568
00:43:57,854 --> 00:43:58,074
So...

569
00:44:00,062 --> 00:44:05,983
A big mechanic in Overland is that if you choose to fight off these creatures, or you're forced to fight off the creatures,

570
00:44:07,123 --> 00:44:11,865
they usually make a ton of racket, and it attracts reinforcements.

571
00:44:13,385 --> 00:44:17,126
But reinforcements showing up is a big deal in this game.

572
00:44:17,346 --> 00:44:22,047
That's a really bad thing to happen to you while you play, even if it's frequently necessary.

573
00:44:23,655 --> 00:44:25,737
And so there's like kind of this big stepped out delay.

574
00:44:25,777 --> 00:44:29,019
There's like two or three turns before the creatures actually appear in the level

575
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:31,700
and you can see exactly where they're going to appear ahead of time.

576
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:40,206
And trying to maintain, we always thought of it internally as like proportional distance.

577
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,423
So if something is going to happen that was going to have a big outcome on the gameplay,

578
00:44:45,543 --> 00:44:48,905
and it has a random element to it, that you get warning.

579
00:44:48,945 --> 00:44:55,248
You get some kind of proportional warning in terms of turns or steps or distance or something.

580
00:44:55,348 --> 00:44:55,568
Right?

581
00:44:56,489 --> 00:45:01,792
You'll almost never have something actually random happen right in front of you with no way to react

582
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,273
to it and no way to engage with it.

583
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:10,436
Even if the way to react to it or dodge it is not wildly obvious.

584
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:17,753
RumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumbleRumble

585
00:45:30,386 --> 00:45:37,350
I am going to briefly turn back to chat and let folks know we only have, we started late today, so we only have about I'd say 15 more minutes?

586
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:40,712
Let me see, how long has this video been running for?

587
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:43,634
Yeah, about 14 minutes left.

588
00:45:44,014 --> 00:45:47,716
So we've only got about 14 minutes left to chat about Overland.

589
00:45:47,756 --> 00:45:49,598
If you have questions, drop them in chat, we'll get them in.

590
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,742
Adam, I would like to know...

591
00:45:53,762 --> 00:45:55,624
God, I have too many questions.

592
00:45:55,744 --> 00:46:00,910
Okay, I'm going to prioritize a question that I saw Chris Graff ask before I move on to my question.

593
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:04,714
This game launched on... I counted it at four platforms.

594
00:46:05,035 --> 00:46:06,636
If the number's five and I forgot one...

595
00:46:08,439 --> 00:46:12,822
But you guys launched on Apple Arcade, which is a brand new platform for everyone.

596
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:14,744
And the Switch is still relatively new for everyone too.

597
00:46:14,804 --> 00:46:20,148
Trying to figure out how to make and sell appealing games on Switch is certainly not an easy thing.

598
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:26,794
What did it take for a small company like Finji to be able to make sure this game worked on all

599
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:31,377
five of those platforms? Because it's not as simple as going into Unity and pushing export,

600
00:46:32,258 --> 00:46:37,062
despite what nobody believes. Nobody believes that. I just make up that hypothetical.

601
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:41,196
Right, right. Maybe slightly straw software issue.

602
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:51,498
It was tricky. So we launched simultaneously on Apple Arcade,

603
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:56,500
PC, Mac, Linux, Switch, PS4, and Xbox.

604
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,980
There we go, yeah. So expand PCM into several dimensions.

605
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:00,681
Yes.

606
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:03,883
And it was...

607
00:47:05,143 --> 00:47:08,244
And also, like, technically three different PC storefronts.

608
00:47:09,124 --> 00:47:12,045
So either by platforms or storefronts,

609
00:47:12,765 --> 00:47:15,846
PC was its own complicated beast, for sure.

610
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:19,807
It was tricky. We had a lot of help, so

611
00:47:22,368 --> 00:47:24,368
Mike Lee from Lodoco has been...

612
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:30,351
working on the Apple Arcade version of the game full-time for months now.

613
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:36,435
We get to collaborate with a porting studio in Austin, Texas called 22nd Century.

614
00:47:37,415 --> 00:47:43,179
And they have full-time engineers there who have been helping us build the console versions.

615
00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:48,582
And Mike spent a ton of time doing performance profiling stuff for us

616
00:47:49,122 --> 00:47:52,884
throughout the porting process, which started months ago at this rate.

617
00:47:55,030 --> 00:48:11,435
And our lead architect and engineer, Caitlin Culley and I, spent buckets of time just trying to figure out how to get this game running as smooth as we could on as many things as we could.

618
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:20,278
I think the Overland's presentation, I think, is pretty elegant and pretty clean, thanks to our art director, Heather Penn.

619
00:48:22,154 --> 00:48:27,299
It is not necessarily a super game engine-friendly

620
00:48:29,841 --> 00:48:36,007
target visual in the sense that

621
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:40,871
it's a procedurally generated game that usually imposes some

622
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:44,475
tricky performance issues one way or another on some platforms.

623
00:48:44,962 --> 00:48:47,363
But in addition to that, it was...

624
00:48:47,763 --> 00:48:50,464
You know, one of the big goals was to make a game

625
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:55,987
where the procedural levels didn't necessarily look terribly procedural.

626
00:48:56,047 --> 00:49:02,490
We wanted to have something where there was a certain amount of composition.

627
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:06,252
And to a point where, I guess, speaking to earlier things

628
00:49:06,312 --> 00:49:08,233
about procedural generation and level generation,

629
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:13,256
once we got the level generator working well enough to create...

630
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:20,033
valid gameplay scenarios, almost the second half of working on the level generator was to

631
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:28,275
push those playable scenarios into being pleasantly visually composed scenarios.

632
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:33,676
So for example this scenario here, there's a bunch of like grass and weeds on the ground.

633
00:49:34,776 --> 00:49:37,457
Those have all been dynamically colored at

634
00:49:38,197 --> 00:49:40,697
level load time to match the terrain.

635
00:49:43,065 --> 00:49:47,246
But the train also is on fire, which is spreading at the moment,

636
00:49:48,106 --> 00:49:50,567
systemically through these dried patches of grass.

637
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:55,048
So we actually need to dynamically recolor everything that's on the ground

638
00:49:55,888 --> 00:49:58,629
to match the new burned ground color or else it looks wrong.

639
00:50:00,129 --> 00:50:00,949
So that's a whole nother

640
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:05,410
like stack of the tech, but then also the diorama effect

641
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,431
is done dynamically and non-destructively

642
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:11,472
and at load time also.

643
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:17,043
So this piece of terrain extends far beyond the 9x9 boundaries here,

644
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:20,705
but we need to present it to look as if it's, you know,

645
00:50:20,906 --> 00:50:25,469
a nice clean kind of model train diorama sort of situation.

646
00:50:26,229 --> 00:50:29,831
And doing that was interesting.

647
00:50:31,513 --> 00:50:33,774
That was a trick in and of itself.

648
00:50:36,507 --> 00:50:39,129
When I was googling around for advice about how to do it,

649
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,972
I finally found a link to a Unity Forums post

650
00:50:45,114 --> 00:50:46,995
asking about diorama cutaway tech.

651
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,718
It needed to be non-destructive for a bunch of weird reasons.

652
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:56,062
But I opened the post and there was a screenshot

653
00:50:56,282 --> 00:50:57,903
of an older version of Overland.

654
00:50:58,744 --> 00:50:59,765
And the person was asking,

655
00:50:59,825 --> 00:51:01,506
hey, how do you get this effect to work?

656
00:51:02,514 --> 00:51:04,056
And I was like, oh, this is hopeless.

657
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:04,697
So, um...

658
00:51:05,158 --> 00:51:08,142
That's the most self-looping problem.

659
00:51:08,162 --> 00:51:10,145
Yeah, it was a little bit terrifying.

660
00:51:10,165 --> 00:51:14,051
That's when, like, kind of like, all caution to the wind and started trying really weird ideas.

661
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:16,134
And the way we ended up building this is, um...

662
00:51:17,937 --> 00:51:20,817
Pretty odd, but works really, really well for our purposes.

663
00:51:22,018 --> 00:51:28,239
We do not have time to get into that today, but I hope either A, you've submitted a GDC talk about it, or B,

664
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:33,320
we forgot to mention you're on the GDC board. Man, I'm good at this.

665
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,441
Oh, yeah.

666
00:51:35,941 --> 00:51:39,562
Or B, if you're able to blog about it on Gamasutra, our sister website.

667
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:45,303
Yeah, I can share a link. I blogged about a part of the stack a year or two ago,

668
00:51:45,643 --> 00:51:45,803
and

669
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,927
But yeah, there's a lot of things like that where there's like, you know, game

670
00:51:50,987 --> 00:51:54,369
engines don't like cutaways of 3d models. It's not what game engines are

671
00:51:54,409 --> 00:51:58,953
designed to do. Game engines don't like you dynamically recoloring everything in

672
00:51:58,993 --> 00:52:03,756
the scene to look just a certain way. And there was a lot of...

673
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:15,325
a lot more, I think, work to support that technology in a console-friendly way

674
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:20,166
across the board than hopefully is obvious. Hopefully nobody notices.

675
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:23,727
The ideal situation is people turn on the game and they go, oh nice.

676
00:52:24,947 --> 00:52:29,748
And that's the maximum depth of appreciation they have for the kinds of weird things that

677
00:52:29,768 --> 00:52:37,570
we had to do to get it working. But yeah, there was a significant amount of experimentation and

678
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:43,418
Sort of new approaches behind the scenes to get something that could be, you know,

679
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:50,980
You know, we love game consoles, but a lot of them are like four years old now or something

680
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:53,761
and

681
00:52:54,802 --> 00:53:00,904
You know weren't exactly the most powerful computers in the world when they came out anyway, and so trying to

682
00:53:02,284 --> 00:53:07,566
Try to put something together that breaks a lot of kind of basic game engine art rules in the first place and then also

683
00:53:08,698 --> 00:53:22,588
You know, runs at a nice, kind of satisfying 60fps clip on kind of medium-end consumer computers from four or five years ago is, I found it tricky at the very least.

684
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:29,805
Right on. We're coming up on the end of our hour and sadly, sadly we're coming up at the end of our time with Russell here.

685
00:53:29,845 --> 00:53:33,047
Russell's about to take one for the team, guys.

686
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:37,591
Um, uh, is that kind of spoiling my own gameplay footage? I don't know.

687
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:42,774
I was actually going to try something really weird here for Russell.

688
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:46,136
But, um, so, uh, uh...

689
00:53:48,186 --> 00:53:52,190
My next question then, because we only have a few minutes left,

690
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,052
Russell did nothing wrong, Sean Peoples, I don't know what you're talking about.

691
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,334
My next question then is, will the game like Overland,

692
00:53:57,454 --> 00:53:59,857
oh, this is where I accidentally had my dog get out of the car, good job, Brian.

693
00:54:02,482 --> 00:54:08,764
Um, how do you make sure every when every time the game opens up and starts generating,

694
00:54:08,804 --> 00:54:15,326
like what a player's run will be, how do you make sure that that run is 100% beatable?

695
00:54:15,366 --> 00:54:19,167
Like, say I was a player who was so good at this game, who understood every logic and

696
00:54:19,247 --> 00:54:23,028
every time, and I understand it's part of the game for it to end tragically, like it's

697
00:54:23,068 --> 00:54:27,249
about to see poor Russell gets left behind, but he has a car with no gas.

698
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:28,070
Bye Russell.

699
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:28,950
Bye, Russell.

700
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:31,953
He's definitely not going to make it.

701
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:35,295
Tragedy is...

702
00:54:35,956 --> 00:54:37,377
Well, no, this is actually a good point.

703
00:54:37,457 --> 00:54:39,199
In theory, this is where the game...

704
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:41,761
You just said earlier, this is where the game should go.

705
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:43,302
The game should go through the hard points.

706
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,524
There is no acing this game.

707
00:54:46,445 --> 00:54:48,646
Maybe if you're lucky you can do some kind of version of 100%.

708
00:54:49,867 --> 00:54:52,209
Certainly, you should be able to make a run from east to west coast.

709
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,871
But how as a designer do you make sure that's still possible?

710
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:59,116
Because to me, it feels almost like some runs are designed to be...

711
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,501
As a player, my bad perspective is sometimes it feels unbeatable,

712
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:06,664
but I also know I watch the stream again and I'm like, I made so many mistakes.

713
00:55:07,525 --> 00:55:08,266
Right, right.

714
00:55:10,717 --> 00:55:16,720
Yeah, like short of coming out and just telling people, it's a lot like as a designer it feels very like faith-based.

715
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:29,386
Like I'm hoping that they may be, you know, that we've indicated through being very very careful about the art and design and controls and all of these things that maybe, you know, it's okay for them to...

716
00:55:30,278 --> 00:55:35,479
have expectations about how careful we were with other components of the game.

717
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:41,300
But it's really, I think, something that people have to, you know, figure out for themselves,

718
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,781
or hear from a friend that they trust, or something like that, in a lot of ways.

719
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:50,902
But as a designer, like, especially for Overland, that was like the easiest part of this game.

720
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:57,072
You know, like you just like just on the stream right here,

721
00:55:57,092 --> 00:56:00,894
um, pulled up into a night level, horrible monsters everywhere,

722
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:05,618
no thanks, I'm driving away. You can just leave.

723
00:56:06,761 --> 00:56:12,186
And a lot of strategy games aren't built that way, especially like, you know, these dungeon crawl scenarios where it's like,

724
00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:16,249
oh, you have to go from this entrance over to this entrance, and you have to make sure it's navigable,

725
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:20,293
and that the number of monsters and power-ups are balanced or whatever.

726
00:56:20,773 --> 00:56:25,017
And really all we have to do, like, every level you come into, the road starts clear.

727
00:56:25,878 --> 00:56:29,041
Except for one. Our boss levels are the only exception.

728
00:56:30,382 --> 00:56:32,304
The kind of blockades at the end of each zone.

729
00:56:34,295 --> 00:56:41,603
And so those were their own kind of design problem that is kind of almost separate from a lot of the other generative stuff that we were working on.

730
00:56:41,703 --> 00:56:48,470
But, you know, every level that you go to initially, the road is clear and you can leave if you need to.

731
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,771
And that.

732
00:56:52,623 --> 00:57:00,466
As a procedural designer, I feel like it gave me a huge amount of wiggle room for what to do with the level designs.

733
00:57:01,306 --> 00:57:03,687
I think we tried as much as possible.

734
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:12,029
Perversely, not wildly dissimilar from Wilmot's, but a lot of Overland levels are levels where you make your own problem.

735
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,590
And...

736
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:19,751
Speaking of making my own problems...

737
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,292
Yeah, for example...

738
00:57:23,923 --> 00:57:25,163
You have this situation, right?

739
00:57:26,204 --> 00:57:32,186
And I think it takes a little while to sort of feel that out and get a sense for whether or not

740
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:34,447
what is kind of like your culpability

741
00:57:34,467 --> 00:57:37,168
and exactly what's going down here. But I think

742
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:42,390
a great example, our community manager, Harris Foster, was running a stream

743
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:45,531
a few days ago and he got stuck at the blockade in the mountains.

744
00:57:45,911 --> 00:57:49,413
And things do get, I think, legitimately challenging at that point in the game.

745
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,623
And he started the roadblock, and it was a catastrophic failure.

746
00:57:54,423 --> 00:57:56,665
He had level restart turned on, so he restarted the level,

747
00:57:57,325 --> 00:57:59,967
and started making different choices,

748
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:04,251
and got a completely different, but equally catastrophic outcome.

749
00:58:05,111 --> 00:58:08,534
So he restarted the level again, and made different choices,

750
00:58:09,354 --> 00:58:14,538
and got a completely different, super successful outcome.

751
00:58:16,095 --> 00:58:21,437
So, you know, this is a game where there are a lot of feedback loops.

752
00:58:23,017 --> 00:58:26,938
And if you're not careful, you absolutely can back yourself into a corner.

753
00:58:27,018 --> 00:58:33,861
But I think the basic building blocks of the game were essentially, like,

754
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:37,862
we will never back the player into a corner on our own.

755
00:58:37,902 --> 00:58:39,042
That is not the game's job.

756
00:58:39,222 --> 00:58:42,743
Players can do that, for example, very effectively.

757
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:47,032
We don't have to back them into a corner. They can handle that.

758
00:58:49,673 --> 00:58:52,795
That just happens.

759
00:58:53,035 --> 00:58:56,337
Adam, we could keep going, but I literally only have about 30 seconds of footage left.

760
00:58:56,397 --> 00:58:59,339
So unfortunately it is time to wrap things up.

761
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:01,840
Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Informal Attire.

762
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,582
Stay mighty. Sean Peoples. Chris Graff. Thank you for dropping by.

763
00:59:06,003 --> 00:59:07,644
Thank you, Adam, for joining us today.

764
00:59:08,304 --> 00:59:11,146
Overland is out now. You can play it on all the platforms we mentioned earlier.

765
00:59:11,906 --> 00:59:16,488
If you yourself are a game developer, a game designer, we would love to have you at GDC next year.

766
00:59:16,888 --> 00:59:22,810
We just closed our sub-talks edition, so unfortunately we aren't going to be able to take your great talk ideas.

767
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:31,353
But if you submitted a talk to the Indie Summit, Adams Holtzman, Indie Summit board member, will be reviewing it. Has reviewed it, maybe.

768
00:59:33,193 --> 00:59:39,035
That'll be tricky. I am not an Indie Summit board member, but they might let me peek at the talks anyway.

769
00:59:39,055 --> 00:59:40,636
What are you a board member on again?

770
00:59:41,689 --> 00:59:48,071
I'm on the design and business tracks for the main conference, but because of putting this game out,

771
00:59:48,091 --> 00:59:53,612
they graciously allowed me to take a year hiatus, which is great.

772
00:59:53,692 --> 01:00:01,653
I don't like... I've been on the board for about 10 years, and I do not like not being able to give the talks the attention that they deserve,

773
01:00:01,893 --> 01:00:04,534
and that was just going to be impossible this year.

774
01:00:05,966 --> 01:00:11,236
But I'll be back next year and I'm very eager to see everyone's design submissions then.

775
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:13,671
Right on. Sorry about the confusion, folks.

776
01:00:13,731 --> 01:00:16,692
Yeah, so if in the future you are submitting a talk to GDC

777
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:18,733
and it's in the design or business track,

778
01:00:19,593 --> 01:00:22,574
Adam will be helping you make a better talk.

779
01:00:23,014 --> 01:00:26,035
With that, I'd like to just give a quick shout-out

780
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:26,755
for everyone in the chat.

781
01:00:26,815 --> 01:00:29,015
If you liked this conversation with Adam,

782
01:00:30,896 --> 01:00:32,436
we would love to have you follow us

783
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:34,097
on this Twitch here, Twitch channel,

784
01:00:34,437 --> 01:00:35,617
because we're regularly going live

785
01:00:35,657 --> 01:00:37,778
trying to have the conversations like the one we just had

786
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,158
to learn more about how games get made,

787
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:40,978
how games get so...

788
01:00:41,618 --> 01:00:44,480
It's sold and other topics of conversation.

789
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,062
You can read more, you'll be able to find the stream video for this on Gamasutra.

790
01:00:50,323 --> 01:00:53,024
And our own Twitch channel after this, on our YouTube channel too.

791
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:57,706
And we would absolutely love to have you at GDC next year.

792
01:00:57,806 --> 01:01:02,388
Keep your eyes peeled, registration will be opening soon, trademark.

793
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:10,572
With that, that's all I've got. Adam, if they have more questions about how this game got made, where should they ask them?

794
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:15,855
Oh, welcome to Ask on Twitter, even though it's the worst website in the world.

795
01:01:16,676 --> 01:01:19,577
We have an account for the game called at Overland Game,

796
01:01:20,638 --> 01:01:24,920
and the official Finji is at FinjiCO, at Finjico.

797
01:01:25,841 --> 01:01:32,145
But I'm a lot more likely to hang out and talk about game design on the Finji Discord,

798
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:34,166
which you can probably Google at this point,

799
01:01:34,226 --> 01:01:38,728
but just in case you can also just type in discord.gg slash Finji.

800
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,631
And that should take you right to a little invite page.

801
01:01:42,011 --> 01:01:48,016
And it's probably, it's our community manager and community designer's biggest project since we hired him.

802
01:01:48,216 --> 01:01:55,482
And it's become like a really marvelous place for lots of folks, game designers and otherwise,

803
01:01:55,582 --> 01:02:01,526
to kind of hang out and have a cozy place on the internet that is not horrible.

804
01:02:01,546 --> 01:02:02,607
Not Nazi.

805
01:02:02,827 --> 01:02:07,571
And yeah, not, it is a completely Nazi-free hangout.

806
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:13,623
It's just, it's become like a really nice online community.

807
01:02:13,683 --> 01:02:16,966
So, especially if folks have a little bit of interest in game design

808
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,367
or working on small projects,

809
01:02:18,387 --> 01:02:20,268
we have a channel that's kind of just for that.

810
01:02:20,408 --> 01:02:23,551
And we would love for people to stop by and talk about game design

811
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:24,872
and share the stuff that they're building.

812
01:02:24,972 --> 01:02:29,595
And we have a couple of dope emojis.

813
01:02:29,715 --> 01:02:31,357
That's a thing, I guess.

814
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:31,717
So...

815
01:02:32,037 --> 01:02:32,978
We could use some emojis.

816
01:02:33,038 --> 01:02:34,579
Admittedly, I've been slacking on that front.

817
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:35,820
Yeah, there...

818
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:39,822
I was about to say they're important, and that's not true.

819
01:02:39,942 --> 01:02:40,542
But they are fun.

820
01:02:41,202 --> 01:02:41,543
Right on.

821
01:02:42,243 --> 01:02:45,584
Well, I believe we're in the business where fun is important, Adam, but I'm not going

822
01:02:45,604 --> 01:02:46,445
to tell you how to do that.

823
01:02:46,525 --> 01:02:48,045
You literally sit on the design board.

824
01:02:49,146 --> 01:02:51,347
With that, I wish everyone have a good Wednesday.

825
01:02:51,787 --> 01:02:52,367
Have a good week.

826
01:02:52,907 --> 01:02:53,648
Happy October.

827
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:54,728
Heck, be spooky season.

828
01:02:55,068 --> 01:02:59,310
Make your Twitter handles, if you have them, if you're in the Nazi infested hellhole.

829
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:00,030
Make them spooky.

830
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:05,833
Celebrate games, and we will see you all next week, hopefully.

831
01:03:06,133 --> 01:03:06,353
Maybe.

832
01:03:07,014 --> 01:03:10,236
Maybe next week? Yeah, I'm trying to get something for next week. If not, it's going to be later this month.

833
01:03:10,476 --> 01:03:13,058
Because at some point I'm going to Sweden and I can't stream from Sweden.

834
01:03:13,478 --> 01:03:15,039
Have a good day everyone. Bye!
