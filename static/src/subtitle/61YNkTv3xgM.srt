00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:15,839
My name is Sarah Shipp, and this is Creating Resonance with Thematic Design.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,705
My background is in professional theater, so I approach game design from a fine arts

3
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,868
as craft perspective.

4
00:00:25,988 --> 00:00:29,050
I have about eight years experience doing theater professionally.

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,311
I've only been designing board games for about three years.

6
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:38,094
But a few things have struck me about how board game designers view design compared

7
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:39,375
to theatrical designers.

8
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:46,278
I feel that starting out, many board game designers view game design as an engineering

9
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:46,738
problem.

10
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:50,920
But I contend that game design isn't engineering.

11
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:52,241
It's architecture.

12
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:59,699
Architecture needs engineering in order to build buildings, but architecture is also art.

13
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,661
Game design needs math and probability and a solid technical foundation,

14
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:08,123
but if we stay there then we will stop developing as a field.

15
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:11,484
We need the language of art to move forward.

16
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:15,506
This is especially true when it comes to designing themes.

17
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:18,287
Yes, I said designing themes.

18
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:24,530
Thematic design is just as much about which thematic details you include as it is about

19
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,211
how the mechanics relate to the theme.

20
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:32,293
To that end, I've pulled from classical, renaissance, and modern thinkers to create

21
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,034
a formula for resonance within thematic design.

22
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:41,562
I'm using the term thematic design to indicate that I am designing both the theme and the mechanics.

23
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:47,765
And I use the term resonance to refer to how players respond to the presentation or experience

24
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:53,668
of a design. I don't use the phrase experience design very often because I feel that it isn't

25
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:59,892
specific enough to the aspects of design I'm talking about. You can design for experiences

26
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:01,433
in a themeless abstract game.

27
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:07,620
I have an entire series of blog posts discussing different categories of experience design

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,323
that I've developed if you're interested in hearing more about my thoughts on that.

29
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:14,565
But what is resonance?

30
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:17,606
Every designer wants to make a resonant game.

31
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:23,230
It's one of the current buzzwords in the industry used to describe games that really stand out.

32
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,011
But it's a term no one can define.

33
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:31,675
Opera singers know that resonance is depth, shape, and clarity of tone.

34
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,252
That's also the dictionary definition.

35
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:39,657
To create resonant themes, we have to strive for those qualities in our games as well.

36
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:45,943
Or we could avoid themes that are amorphous, muddy, or shallow.

37
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:52,190
Other terms you may hear when talking about resonance are evocative, sticky, or memorable.

38
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:59,578
I originally stopped my definition of resonance as depth, shape, and clarity of theme, but

39
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:02,800
I think there's a more useful definition for the designer.

40
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:08,483
I'm going to be talking about how to make themes that are more resonant.

41
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:15,307
Mechanics can resonate with players, but only to players who are inside the gaming ecosystem.

42
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:19,289
Nobody outside of gaming knows what a worker placement game is.

43
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:26,871
I personally didn't learn the names of board game mechanics until I started designing in

44
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:30,493
spite of several years of exposure to hobby games before then.

45
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:36,418
When someone asks what a game is about, we usually respond by telling them the theme.

46
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:40,981
Resonant themes are the best tools we have to pull new players into the hobby.

47
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:44,103
By ignoring certain aspects of thematic design,

48
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:49,435
by not treating theme as a skill that can be learned, you will severely limit your potential

49
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:55,437
audience. When asked, many designers will tell you that resonant games are the ones where the

50
00:03:55,477 --> 00:04:00,619
mechanics and theme align. I think that's putting the cart before the horse in terms of a good

51
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:07,441
definition. First, we have to understand what theme is. Theme encompasses the setting, story,

52
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:12,403
and tone of a game. Theme is expressed in a variety of ways in board games.

53
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:17,457
Illustration, components, mechanics, narrative description, and flavor text.

54
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,139
I'll be referring to these as a game's elements.

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,402
Elements of a game can be motivated or unmotivated.

56
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:29,085
I'm talking, I'm taking these terms from theatrical lighting design.

57
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:35,069
A motivated element is one that has an in-world explanation for why it exists.

58
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:40,633
Unmotivated elements may not be abstract, but they do not have a clear reason for existing.

59
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,682
In theater, light shining through a window is motivated.

60
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,504
We imagine the sun causing the light on the stage.

61
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:51,908
Whereas if the light suddenly shifts to red, that's unmotivated.

62
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:55,271
We cannot imagine a realistic reason for the light change.

63
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:59,314
Iron ingot components in a game about manufacturing are motivated.

64
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:03,417
Whereas the same components are unmotivated in a game about butterflies.

65
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,341
The player pieces in Monopoly fall into this category.

66
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:12,064
In spite of their interesting history, they are not motivated by the theme of the game.

67
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:18,647
Unmotivated elements are not inherently bad, but they can make a game feel themeless or

68
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,088
like the theme is pasted on.

69
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:24,730
Motivated elements add resonance because they are a form of world building.

70
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:30,882
When you are, what you are saying when you include motivated elements is that these things

71
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:36,746
exist in your game world for a reason. Some unmotivated elements are necessary,

72
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:43,490
such as scoring conditions that can't logically arise from the theme. The trick here is balance.

73
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:50,996
There needs to be enough motivated elements to offset the necessity of including elements that

74
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:53,317
aid rules comprehension and gameplay.

75
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:59,328
If you don't find this balance, the game will either be incomprehensible or the theme will

76
00:05:59,348 --> 00:06:00,209
feel pasted on.

77
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,894
I refer to games where the theme and mechanics mesh well together to produce a complete experience

78
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:11,115
as being thematically well integrated.

79
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:13,416
An element could be motivated and still not be integrated.

80
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,758
When this happens, those elements will either feel superfluous or like the theme is pasted

81
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:15,838
on.

82
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:16,698

86
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:22,381
Bye!

87
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:28,964
Each individual card in the hand-building game Fantasy Realms is thematically motivated.

88
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:35,187
But the experience of gameplay lacks a thematic cohesion. Cards go in and out of your hands

89
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:41,050
quickly and for no thematic reason. Once you finish the game, you can describe the world

90
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,032
you created, but the focus of the game is on getting the most points, not establishing a

91
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,573
believable world. Comparatively.

92
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:54,599
in the deck building game. Star Realms, no relation, each turn visualizes an episode of

93
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,100
space commerce and combat and politics. I won't go into all the ways this game works thematically

94
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,842
because I'm going to take a close look at some other games, but I would recommend these two

95
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:13,544
games as a solid examples of the spectrum of how to implement theme. Both are saturated with

96
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:14,824
motivated elements.

97
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:20,453
but Star Realms has an integrated theme and Fantasy Realms does not.

98
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:28,776
Thematic games don't have to be sprawling epics to be considered thematic. Motivated,

99
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:34,579
integrated themes will feel resonant even in filler length games. I think we as a hobby are

100
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:39,441
prone to confusing thematic games with games that are narrative heavy and tell a complete linear

101
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:43,202
story by the time you finish playing. I reject that narrow definition.

102
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:48,327
For me, a thematic game is any game where the players can feel the theme through the gameplay.

103
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,568
Let's move on from general principles and look at specific ways to make games more resonant.

104
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,810
But first, here's my definition for resonance.

105
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:04,952
Resonance is familiarity plus unexpectedness minus chaff.

106
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:09,173
This is the formula I developed to explain what makes a game resonant.

107
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:15,039
This formula is inspired by concepts from Made to Stick,

108
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,460
Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die by Chip and Dan Heath.

109
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:21,121
They developed the SUCCESS model,

110
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:24,923
which stands for Simple, Unexpected, Concrete,

111
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:26,763
Credible Emotions and Stories.

112
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:29,905
It's a handy mnemonic, but the authors admit

113
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,846
it doesn't show the relationship that exists

114
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,727
between the traits that they outline.

115
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:43,141
I reworked the model to show the interconnectedness, and I cut out the element credible that is

116
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:44,806
mostly outside the scope of design.

117
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:50,642
Credibility can be built within a piece of entertainment or art by having internal credibility

118
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:57,426
through the use of vivid details, supporting the core idea, but I'm proposing that by following

119
00:08:57,506 --> 00:09:03,190
my formula for resonance, you will be producing that feeling in players anyway. So this trait

120
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:10,734
would ultimately be redundant. Internal credibility is a product of resonance, not a cause. And

121
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:14,316
external credibility is outside the scope of this discussion.

122
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:20,640
Now let's break down what familiarity plus unexpectedness

123
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,601
minus chaff means.

124
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:26,703
Familiarity is a concept that should seem obvious,

125
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:28,124
but it's got a lot going on with it.

126
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:32,226
Familiarity is best described by, of course, moments.

127
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:36,688
Of course, wheat makes bread, or flour,

128
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:38,969
or charcoal, or cattle.

129
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,191
Of course, the ground floor must be built

130
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:44,352
before the second floor.

131
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,622
The more the audience already knows, the less you have to teach them,

132
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:51,603
which makes rules intuitive.

133
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:55,205
Familiarity taps into show-don't-tell,

134
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:58,628
which is the major axiom of storytelling.

135
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:02,730
You don't have to explain that two factions hate each other

136
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,892
if the emotion comes through in your game.

137
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,874
Just because you state something in your lore

138
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:10,515
doesn't mean the gameplay will support that story.

139
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:14,338
You have to show players what the world is like through your gameplay.

140
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,019
Let's talk about how.

141
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:19,278
Familiarity can be expressed in two ways.

142
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:22,479
Through emotions and through story elements.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,081
We want players emotionally connected to our games.

144
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,522
We want them engaged.

145
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:35,304
A game that touches us emotionally gets talked about more than a game of similar weight that

146
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,505
is merely a good puzzle.

147
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:42,447
Essentially, this is the difference between Pandemic and Pandemic Legacy Season 1.

148
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:49,209
Designing for emotions in players who play our games seems like a daunting task,

149
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:56,011
but it's worth striving for. It's a skill you can get better at. When designing for emotions,

150
00:10:56,271 --> 00:11:00,912
it is important to remember that everything has emotional content.

151
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:08,455
Game elements can be divided into tangible and non-tangible, or physical and mental.

152
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:16,008
The way physical and visual elements produce emotional responses is the subject of entire

153
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:24,737
fields of design. We are used to the idea that colors can create certain moods, but so can shapes,

154
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,724
or textures, rhythms, or sounds.

155
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:37,176
We see this in board games with upgraded components.

156
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:42,500
Players like metal coins because they have a more pleasant emotional response to the

157
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,143
weight and texture of metal coins than cardboard chips.

158
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:51,187
Spanning a game's tempo can create emotions.

159
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,949
Spanning the spectrum from methodical to frenzy.

160
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:57,351
How players move their bodies.

161
00:11:58,512 --> 00:11:59,233
How they look.

162
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:02,966
What they reach for, what they hold in their hands,

163
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:06,386
all produces emotions in players.

164
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:10,868
Studying areas like product design or visual design,

165
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:13,729
color theory, can increase your awareness

166
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:17,230
of how these types of physical elements can affect players.

167
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,510
Think of it as cross-training

168
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:22,291
to improve your design muscles.

169
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:26,292
But don't overlook studying body language of your players.

170
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:31,374
This is a big reason why digital playtesting will never replace in-person playtesting.

171
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:36,596
Board games are physical objects with layers of emotional content.

172
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:45,020
Non-physical elements, such as ideas, also produce emotional responses.

173
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,262
Narrative elements, such as settings, stories, or even characters,

174
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:55,124
are capable of producing complex emotional experiences.

175
00:12:57,095 --> 00:12:58,816
Just ask anyone who's played Time Stories.

176
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:05,960
In addition to other narrative elements, strategies and other elements of emergent gameplay can

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,201
create emotions in games.

178
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:14,285
I'm not going to touch on strategy here, though, because there are other resources out there

179
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:19,588
that discuss game arcs and player engagement a lot better and more in depth.

180
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:23,826
The point here is that everything produces emotions.

181
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,748
And the only emotion we really want to avoid is boredom.

182
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:33,390
Emotions are something to be aware of and even playtest for,

183
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:35,731
but they can be somewhat ethereal

184
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,413
when we are attempting to list design principles.

185
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:42,535
Designing for emotions comes with practice.

186
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,456
So let's move on to story elements,

187
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,277
which are more concrete.

188
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:50,824
and easier to implement into design.

189
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:56,608
In 1570, Lodovico Castelvetro codified what became known

190
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:58,249
as the classical unities of theater,

191
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:01,971
unity of action, unity of place, and unity of time.

192
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:06,093
This meant that a story, the story of a play

193
00:14:06,274 --> 00:14:09,856
needed to occur in one location during one day

194
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:11,677
and be about one thing.

195
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:15,279
This was supposed to prevent audience confusion

196
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:16,920
about what was taking place on stage.

197
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:23,685
Anyone who's watched Hamilton knows that these unities didn't stick as guiding principles.

198
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:30,489
However, we can use the classical unities as a jumping off point to create,

199
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:33,130
of course, moments in our game stories.

200
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:43,795
The purpose of the classical unities was to make sure that the audience knew what was going on.

201
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:47,357
One of the traits of resonance is clarity.

202
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:52,468
I know I said one of the other traits was depth, but we need to prioritize clarity

203
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:57,532
because players need to be able to see what they are doing clearly before they can appreciate the

204
00:14:57,572 --> 00:15:03,357
breadth and scope of your game world. Our players need to know why they are performing the actions

205
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:09,143
of the game. To design a more thematic game, there needs to be unity of action between the

206
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:15,708
mechanics and the theme. I label this as plot. Game objectives should align with the theme.

207
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:20,556
which is to say the plot of your gameplay should align with the plot of your theme.

208
00:15:22,898 --> 00:15:26,202
And themes should be complete sentences, not just nouns.

209
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:34,991
Dogs is not a theme. Dogs chasing mail carriers is a theme. Can the dogs work

210
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:39,596
together to protect their house from trespassing mail carriers? That's a resonant theme.

211
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:41,473
Themes should have verbs.

212
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:43,254
Verbs indicate actions.

213
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:46,655
Themes without verbs almost always feel pasted on.

214
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:52,498
Themes should be able to be stated as questions because the outcome of a game is not predetermined

215
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:53,959
the way the end of a novel is.

216
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,081
Make sure how you win the game is the crux of your theme.

217
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:04,385
If a game claims to be about conservation but the main mechanic is cutting down trees

218
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:08,166
to build lumber mills, the theme is not in line with the objective.

219
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:12,769
Every action a player takes should further the narrative arc.

220
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,213
Or to put it another way, the actions taken in the game are the story.

221
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:20,774
And the theme should match the action.

222
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:25,517
Don't claim your plot is something other than what is present in the gameplay.

223
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:32,122
One way to achieve this is to try to incorporate as many evocative actions as possible.

224
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:37,745
Evocative actions are game actions that use thematic words as the names of the actions.

225
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:46,280
They evoke the theme. So you build a house instead of placing a piece. There is a balance

226
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,622
here with rules comprehension, but when done well, evocative actions will actually make your rules

227
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:59,506
easier to learn. Yes, these are all technically ways to create mechanic theme alignment,

228
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:06,609
but this is a more detailed story-focused perspective. This is the process of thematic

229
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:07,309
integration.

230
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:13,076
Well, there's more, but we're getting to it. Since we're discussing plot, I want to address

231
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:19,477
fluff, which is the term I use for flavor text and lore that is not required reading in order

232
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:26,939
to play the game. My particular concern here is the fluff found on the first page of the rulebook.

233
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,281
Introductory worldbuilding fluff at the beginning of a rulebook, ideally.

234
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:37,268
should lead into gameplay by explaining why characters are in the position that they are

235
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:42,349
in on the first turn of the game, because the goal of every thematic detail in the box

236
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:49,491
should be clarity. Use the lore paragraph before setup to create incentive to play the game,

237
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:54,873
to find out more about the world. Including too many thematic details

238
00:17:55,113 --> 00:18:00,014
when players are trying to internalize rules can contribute to information overload.

239
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,290
This is where Unity of Action really comes in.

240
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,571
I've read a number of rulebooks where the lore fluff didn't seem to have anything to

241
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:09,831
do with the actual game.

242
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:15,673
This paragraph or two is an opportunity to set the stage and establish the tone for the

243
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:16,413
actual game.

244
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:21,594
Don't waste that opportunity by trying to cram in all the worldbuilding you possibly

245
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:21,894
can.

246
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:27,255
There are places for your worldbuilding, but the page before setup isn't one of them.

247
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:33,129
Now let's turn to unity of place, which I call location.

248
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:35,950
Location isn't just setting.

249
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:39,072
It's also world physics and character physics.

250
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:41,593
Setting is where an event takes place.

251
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,434
World physics is the manifestation

252
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,736
of the rules of that world, such as gravity, propulsion, heat,

253
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:49,797
or visibility.

254
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:52,418
Character physics usually manifests

255
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,479
as direction of movement and speed,

256
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,900
but it could also be inventory size, strength.

257
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:05,939
need to eat, et cetera. I include character physics and location because all game physics

258
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:14,281
helps establish the rules and feel of your world. Location can be expressed through illustration,

259
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:22,404
components, and mechanics. The conveyor belts in Sushi Roll are such a small addition,

260
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:25,565
but they do so much to add sense of place.

261
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:29,494
In Sushi Go, players collect sushi to form their meals,

262
00:19:29,694 --> 00:19:31,974
but they seem to do so in a void.

263
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:35,195
By that, I mean there is no indication in the game

264
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:38,216
where the players are when they are collecting sushi.

265
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:41,577
The only sense of location is the chopsticks,

266
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:44,518
which reminds us that we're not eating with our hands.

267
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:47,778
Not only are the conveyor belt tiles and sushi

268
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:50,779
roll useful mechanically, but they go a long way

269
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,100
to evoking location.

270
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,940
We are in a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.

271
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,591
That's a way cooler place to be than a void.

272
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:05,097
The building rules in Walking in Burano are one example of how using recognizable physics

273
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:06,538
can help teach the rules of the game.

274
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:11,642
In Burano, players are constructing buildings one floor at a time, but must build from the

275
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:14,965
ground up unless they use scaffolding as a temporary floor.

276
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:17,987
It seems like such a little thing.

277
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:24,486
but a board game that acknowledges gravity clearly sets that game in a world that is

278
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:30,289
comprehensible to the players. And because the world is comprehensible, the rules are easier

279
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:37,431
to remember. I may be alone in this, but I'm a big fan of the Rondell mechanic in Scorpius Raider.

280
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:42,115
The action locations are visited by ships that are slowly orbiting planets.

281
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:48,460
This mechanic ties the circular rondelle-shaped orbits and the limited movement per turn evokes

282
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:55,165
the vastness of space. Whether or not actual orbits would be that slow. Location is about

283
00:20:55,265 --> 00:21:00,908
creating a sense of reality through game elements. As humans, we can relate to physics that matches

284
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,410
what we see in the real world.

285
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:08,109
However, I'm not saying that the physics in the game needs to be scientifically rigorous.

286
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,690
Merely something logical to players.

287
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:19,215
But the Pagoda in Four Gardens doesn't create a sense of location because its physics are

288
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:20,996
not analogous to the real world.

289
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:27,099
Even skyscrapers with spinning restaurants only spin part of the building and only one

290
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:27,239
way.

291
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:34,925
There's nothing in the physics of Four Gardens pagoda that evokes the real world.

292
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:37,886
Just being a pagoda is setting.

293
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:39,566
It's not world physics.

294
00:21:41,307 --> 00:21:44,508
However, that doesn't mean Four Gardens isn't resonant at all.

295
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:50,350
But it does mean that it's not using world physics to build on resonance.

296
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:51,951
More on that later.

297
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:56,173
The next story element is time.

298
00:21:57,245 --> 00:22:00,546
I don't view time exactly the way unity of time works in theater.

299
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:06,368
Games don't have to tell linear stories in order to be understandable by players.

300
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:10,710
Time behaves differently in games than in linear entertainment.

301
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,772
This is because perception of time passing has a lot to do with how a player feels while

302
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:17,512
playing a game.

303
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:24,575
Time is about pacing and rhythm and scale, not about game length or linear narrative.

304
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:29,797
How we theme our games should be informed by the pace of the gameplay.

305
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:35,219
Game progress should align with the amount of time represented by the game's theme.

306
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,322
Civ games tend to be slow because accumulating that much history is slow.

307
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:44,523
Some themes need to feel pressed for time.

308
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:48,845
Bomb defusal games should avoid analysis paralysis, for instance.

309
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,502
Turn length, round length, and scoring style affects the pacing of the game,

310
00:22:55,862 --> 00:23:01,286
but a player's physical movement and handling of game components can also contribute to

311
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:07,650
the perception of time scale in a game. An exciting game with a short round structure

312
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:13,293
can actually feel like a shorter game than it actually is. A thinky game will feel slow,

313
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:14,954
even if the game isn't very long.

314
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,366
Combining time and location, I use the phrase,

315
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,527
find the movement, as a great place to start

316
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,888
when re-theming a game.

317
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:26,350
Start with what the game feels like,

318
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,632
its rhythm, how things move, and build the theme from there.

319
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:35,454
I do this because the pace and physics of a game

320
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:38,996
are what will contribute most to a feeling of verisimilitude

321
00:23:39,956 --> 00:23:41,777
between the theme and the mechanics.

322
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:48,280
This method is harder than just picking a cool sounding theme, but it yields better results.

323
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:52,324
Alternatively, be prepared to change your mechanics to match your theme.

324
00:23:54,566 --> 00:24:02,654
I add to Castlevestro's list of plot location and time, character. I think of player characters

325
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:05,837
more like miniature plots unto themselves.

326
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:11,305
I separate character from plot because in storytelling, characters are often at odds

327
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:12,426
with the overall plot.

328
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:16,107
Characters have desires, faults, and ideals.

329
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:21,768
So this category is more about a character's goals than about their physical traits, which

330
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:23,229
I place in location.

331
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,890
Characters' in-world desires should match their mechanical goals.

332
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,271
In good fiction writing, characters have goals and obstacles to those goals.

333
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:38,601
Good game design works the same way. So it only makes sense to have a character's deepest desires

334
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:45,824
line up with their win condition. Root does this surprisingly well in that the mechanics and win

335
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:53,348
condition of the different factions are expressed so much about the sociopolitical environment of

336
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:59,651
that world. Individual characters are easier to identify with and thus more empathetic than

337
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:06,053
faceless collectives like factions or corporations. Humans are also more empathetic than aliens.

338
00:25:06,654 --> 00:25:11,577
Remember, the goal is to create an emotional response in players and one way to do that is

339
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:18,141
empathy. We like what we can relate to. One concrete element that can add a lot of emotion

340
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:24,966
to a theme is relationships. This doesn't have to be fully developed fog of love style relationships.

341
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,525
Two brothers raising armies and going to war is a better story than two factions going to war.

342
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:40,392
I experienced this with my first signed game. I started with a game about how the aristocracy

343
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:46,256
built generational wealth, but I felt the theme didn't resonate as well as I wanted.

344
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:52,301
I didn't really care about money being passed on generationally from father to son.

345
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:57,137
I wanted players to play as a single person they could identify with.

346
00:25:58,017 --> 00:26:04,538
However, a single person receiving inheritance from multiple sources becomes increasingly

347
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:06,718
implausible with each inheritance.

348
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:13,520
I wanted a stronger sense of relationship than that that would raise the emotional stakes

349
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,320
of the theme.

350
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,881
So I changed the theme to Victorian women filling their husbands for inheritance money

351
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:22,481
and called it Deadly Dowagers.

352
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:30,533
In addition to only playing a single character, the retheme adds relationships between the player characters and the NPCs.

353
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:38,818
Admittedly, this may not be a theme that pulls everyone in, but it is memorable, evocative, and resonant.

354
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:43,220
Familiarity isn't enough to make a game stand out.

355
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,831
Unexpectedness adds spice to familiarity.

356
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:50,914
Unexpected elements grab attention and generate interest

357
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:52,255
through breaks in a pattern.

358
00:26:52,855 --> 00:26:55,297
However, this requires that you establish a pattern

359
00:26:55,317 --> 00:26:56,318
before you can break it.

360
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,500
If everything is unexpected, nothing is.

361
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,702
Unexpectedness can occur thematically

362
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:07,826
as whimsy, fantastical elements that depart from reality.

363
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:13,831
as reversals or flipped tropes, as uniqueness and innovation, or as high production values.

364
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:20,833
But again, once everyone has games with miniatures or the latest hotness, that ceases to be a draw

365
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:26,194
for any particular game. The trick to adding unexpected elements is to keep them unexpected.

366
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:34,797
I explain Whimsy as the defining aesthetic of a Miyazaki film. In design language, fantasy

367
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:39,869
means images and themes that depict things that could never exist in reality.

368
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:48,492
More along the lines of the flying whales from Fantasia 2000 and less medieval wizards,

369
00:27:48,852 --> 00:27:55,895
if that makes sense. Whimsy is the inclusion of fantasy elements with possibly a lighter touch.

370
00:27:57,036 --> 00:28:00,477
This is where Four Gardens fits thematically for me.

371
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:08,979
A 3D rotating tower of resources is whimsical and creates the unexpectedness needed for

372
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:09,659
resonance.

373
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,061
Reversals take familiar storylines and flip the script.

374
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:22,623
This is an easy unexpectedness hack, but not everything is made better by using a reversal.

375
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:29,586
The story you tell still needs to feel motivated by the actions and needs to create the proper

376
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:36,308
emotional responses in players in order to feel thematic. Trope subversion doesn't have to be a

377
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:42,650
complete reversal, however. Subverting expectations can be a powerful storytelling method and resonance

378
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:48,872
generator. Reversals or subversions can create feelings of imbalance in players that can draw

379
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:52,653
them into a game emotionally because they no longer know what to expect.

380
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,233
While we're talking about tropes, reversals are a good way to avoid stereotypes.

381
00:28:58,994 --> 00:29:03,837
However, regardless of whether an element is presented as true to type or as a subversion,

382
00:29:04,238 --> 00:29:08,821
we should take care to present our themes in a manner that is well thought out and respectful.

383
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:14,365
I find that most harmful stereotypes appear in designs in which the designer simply didn't care

384
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:18,868
enough to put in the work to make the theme more vibrant and respectful.

385
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:23,386
I hope that one takeaway from this panel is that good themes don't just happen,

386
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:24,250
they take work.

387
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:30,162
Innovation or other forms of uniqueness will always create excitement.

388
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:34,944
But just like production values, there's a limit to how far uniqueness can take you.

389
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:39,926
Innovation generally will lead to more critical acclaim than commercial appeal.

390
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,387
And uniqueness is difficult to set as a design goal.

391
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:46,829
While it's great to stumble into genuine innovation,

392
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:50,470
high quality iteration is easier to plan for and to achieve.

393
00:29:51,471 --> 00:29:55,774
And by making a really resonant game, you can make a game that feels innovative even

394
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:58,075
if the concept is a rehash of something else.

395
00:29:59,796 --> 00:30:03,119
A lot of games rely on production values to generate excitement.

396
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:07,281
Previously, production values were a type of uniqueness.

397
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:10,944
I'm a proponent of good-looking, high-quality games.

398
00:30:11,907 --> 00:30:15,629
but as high production values become commonplace and expected,

399
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:18,351
they will no longer be able to be relied upon

400
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:21,252
to single-handedly generate interest in a game.

401
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:27,516
In other words, production values can still provide a hit of uniqueness,

402
00:30:27,997 --> 00:30:30,778
but the jury's out on how much longer that will remain true.

403
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:35,962
Also, as a designer, production values are typically outside of my control

404
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,843
as I don't plan to ever self-publish.

405
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:42,095
There are trends within product design, the product,

406
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:45,398
there are trends within the product design of a game

407
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:46,739
to try to generate interest.

408
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,403
Miniatures, custom shaped or screen printed meeples,

409
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:53,946
scenario books that replace boards, apps, et cetera.

410
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,749
One that I find interesting is verticality.

411
00:30:57,412 --> 00:31:01,535
the implementation of components that make significant use of the y-axis.

412
00:31:02,276 --> 00:31:07,180
I find verticality interesting because some designs seem to include it only to increase

413
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,965
table presence and don't connect it to gameplay, which is not very resonant.

414
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:17,588
Speaking of table presence, let's talk about gimmicks.

415
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,833
Let's rely on big splashy elements to grab attention.

416
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:29,617
Anything that does that can feel gimmicky.

417
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:34,458
Instead, we need to be asking interesting questions of our design.

418
00:31:35,198 --> 00:31:38,299
What component would most help drive home the theme?

419
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:43,280
What would make players care more about the characters or story in the game?

420
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,880
How can I subvert expectations?

421
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,682
I particularly like trope flipping because it requires a minimal amount of effort to achieve results.

422
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:58,963
Theme forward techniques like that, that don't increase the cost of the game in the way adding

423
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:03,985
miniatures does, is a low impact way to get a lot of results.

424
00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:05,725
It's cheaper.

425
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:10,327
Asking questions of your design requires you to engage with your theme.

426
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:17,869
Never ever, ever expect your audience to do the imaginative work that you were unwilling

427
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:18,169
to do.

428
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,650
I don't mean that you have to spell everything out for your players.

429
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,371
I mean that you need to critically examine your theme to see where engagement or interest

430
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:27,071
could be added.

431
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,772
Engage your theme and interrogate it.

432
00:32:30,052 --> 00:32:31,452
You'll be surprised where you end up.

433
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:40,013
When you know what your theme is, it's plot, location, rhythm, characters, and twist.

434
00:32:40,854 --> 00:32:41,934
Cut everything else out.

435
00:32:42,854 --> 00:32:47,015
Do as little as possible to build the world beyond what is represented by the game.

436
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:51,972
Figure out the core of the theme and get rid of everything else.

437
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:54,933
Try to always leave your players wanting more.

438
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:59,734
That feeling will drive engagement more than extensive world building will.

439
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:04,195
Feel free to write a novel about your world, but don't put it in the game box.

440
00:33:05,335 --> 00:33:09,376
However, putting a limit on the amount of detail expressed in your theme is

441
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:11,337
not licensed to skimp on research.

442
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:16,318
Really good research will inform which details are most necessary and evocative.

443
00:33:18,926 --> 00:33:23,388
The components ought to be so firmly compacted that if any one of them is shifted to another

444
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:28,089
place, the whole is loosened up and dislocated, for an element whose addition or subtraction

445
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,551
makes no perceptible difference is not really a part of the whole.

446
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:35,873
This is my favorite quote about board game design, even though it's actually about

447
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:36,793
theatrical design.

448
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:41,675
Many people have said similar things throughout history, but not only did Aristotle say it

449
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:42,875
first, he said it best.

450
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:48,462
Side note, the classical unities come from the neoclassical era, but they were an attempt

451
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:50,382
to build on Aristotle's rules for theater.

452
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:55,504
Theater history has a lot of good advice for board game design.

453
00:33:58,644 --> 00:34:00,265
Good design is about removing clutter.

454
00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:04,126
Every detail of your game should reinforce the core theme.

455
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:08,267
Just because a detail fits into your world doesn't mean it belongs in the game.

456
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:14,250
If you really must add details, I do recommend using illustration as a way to convey details

457
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,291
that doesn't impede gameplay.

458
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:22,155
Including a detail because it's cool will feel gimmicky because it is a gimmick.

459
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:28,219
I define a gimmick as anything that brings a sense of novelty and appeal and not much

460
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:28,479
else.

461
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,783
If you are including an unnecessary element that you don't think is cool, why are you

462
00:34:34,803 --> 00:34:35,203
doing that?

463
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:42,909
A gimmick looks cool, but either it isn't functional or it impedes usability.

464
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:47,771
A gimmick adds more cost than value of what is received.

465
00:34:48,691 --> 00:34:51,372
Every element should feel necessary to the game experience.

466
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,933
Anything else is a distraction.

467
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:57,855
Your core theme will create your core emotional experience.

468
00:34:58,615 --> 00:35:01,837
Adding extraneous elements deletes the emotional experience.

469
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:06,078
In other words, too much fluff makes your game less resonant.

470
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:08,667
But there is a compromise here.

471
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:14,590
I like to think of flavor text and certain other thematic details as opt-in details,

472
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:19,033
meaning a player can choose to ignore these details if they want.

473
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:24,056
Flavor text is usually in a small font at the bottom of a card.

474
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,817
I have the choice to read it or not.

475
00:35:27,698 --> 00:35:31,380
Components, even card art, don't give me that option.

476
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:39,099
I can't opt out. They're too prominent for my eyes to skip over. That's the reason I get

477
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:43,242
frustrated by the lore at the beginning of rulebooks. I can't tell straight away if it

478
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:48,765
contains important information about the game or not. If you want to include extra detail in your

479
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:54,328
game that provides only flavor, it needs to be the kind of detail players can choose to opt into

480
00:35:54,668 --> 00:36:02,173
or not. Removing chaff is also about finding the proportion between the familiar and the unexpected.

481
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:09,200
Too much unexpectedness is jarring and will disconnect players from the theme.

482
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,765
Too much familiarity only becomes a problem when the details stray from the core theme.

483
00:36:15,505 --> 00:36:21,090
So generally speaking, leave unexpectedness to a few surprising twists compared to the

484
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:21,771
rest of the game.

485
00:36:28,077 --> 00:36:33,538
Now I'd like to look at two games as case studies to see how they implement the traits I've outlined.

486
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:41,199
The first is Takedo. Let's start with the rules lore to see what the game says about itself.

487
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:48,341
The players are travelers into Japan in the days of old. They will follow the prestigious Takedo

488
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:53,822
and try to make this journey as rich an experience as possible. To do this, they will pass through

489
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:57,343
magnificent countrysides, taste delicious culinary specialties,

490
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:03,391
purchase souvenirs, and benefit from the virtues of Hot Springs, and have unforgettable encounters.

491
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:08,315
Or as most gamers have described the game, you're competing to have the best vacation.

492
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:11,097
I like the brevity here.

493
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:15,981
There's additional historical information at the end of the rulebook, but the introduction

494
00:37:16,102 --> 00:37:18,544
only tells you what you need to know to get into the game.

495
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:22,066
It's not amazing writing, but it gets the job done.

496
00:37:24,227 --> 00:37:29,530
The board itself is fairly abstract, but we still see a road clearly stretching across it,

497
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:35,834
with wayside points to stop at. In this case, the suggestion of a road is just as effective

498
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:41,997
as a more realistic illustration. After all, the character movement reinforces the idea of a road,

499
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:47,220
as does the elongated shape of the board. Without these signifiers, however,

500
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:50,142
the abstract representation would not have been as effective.

501
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:55,709
Takedo is a master class of evocative actions.

502
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,472
Let's look at the action names in the game.

503
00:37:59,352 --> 00:38:03,736
Well, first a player moves a traveler and lands on a space.

504
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:12,143
I prefer if the player traveled to a location and visited or stopped there, but we can't

505
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:12,864
have everything.

506
00:38:13,944 --> 00:38:17,808
However, each of the spaces is evocative in a way that aids rules comprehension.

507
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,125
Shops sell souvenirs. Temples accept donations. Encounters reveal people. Inns provide meals.

508
00:38:25,966 --> 00:38:32,231
Ending a round or day with essentially dinner is particularly evocative.

509
00:38:33,332 --> 00:38:37,815
The remaining locations require a small amount of imagination, but we can assume that farms

510
00:38:37,855 --> 00:38:43,500
produce money because you spend time there as a day laborer. Panoramic views appear to produce

511
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,663
panoramic artwork. The location and the cards are just called panoramas.

512
00:38:48,355 --> 00:38:53,419
which is a touch confusing, and hot springs presumably produce relaxation.

513
00:38:55,601 --> 00:39:01,485
Nowhere on the board is there a generic board game symbol to draw a card. The thematic graphic

514
00:39:01,525 --> 00:39:07,389
design is effective at reinforcing the rules while also helping reduce the abstraction of the board,

515
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:13,934
particularly the road. Takedo deathly uses time and location elements to create the feel of

516
00:39:13,994 --> 00:39:17,336
gameplay without needing full bleed art on the game board.

517
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,173
This is good news for game designers.

518
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,855
You can create rich experiences in your prototypes,

519
00:39:24,215 --> 00:39:25,636
even if you aren't an artist.

520
00:39:28,438 --> 00:39:31,619
The cards do have generic game graphics on them

521
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,861
in the form of scoring tables and transformation arrows.

522
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:37,703
However, the larger art of these cards,

523
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:39,764
as opposed to the locations on the board,

524
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,606
offsets the necessity of this information.

525
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:45,828
There is a balance struck between thematic expression

526
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:46,728
and usability.

527
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:55,983
We find plenty of familiarity in shopping, sightseeing, stopping at an inn for the night.

528
00:39:56,924 --> 00:40:02,569
The unexpectedness of Takedo comes from the clean visual design of the board coupled with

529
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:03,830
the thematic gameplay.

530
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:07,714
That same clean design keeps the game feeling uncluttered.

531
00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:10,596
It's a rare feat in a point salad style game.

532
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:14,100
It's also still unexpected almost a decade later.

533
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:20,566
For the next case study, I'll be looking at a much more detail-filled game, Eberdell.

534
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:26,088
Oh, once again, let's start with the lore and the rulebook.

535
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:31,537
A new year begins within the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering

536
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:36,098
trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters

537
00:40:36,178 --> 00:40:37,919
is thriving and expanding.

538
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,640
Ever since the famed adventurer Corrin Evertail discovered the Hidden Realm long ago, the

539
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,381
citizens have prospered under the shelter of the Evertree.

540
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:49,942
From Everfrost to Belsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new

541
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:52,263
territories to be settled and new cities established.

542
00:40:52,643 --> 00:40:55,825
You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task.

543
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:59,246
There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host.

544
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:00,667
It will be a busy year.

545
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:04,489
Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?

546
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,271
It's not great.

547
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:12,734
There are too many details in general, but also too many details that only exist

548
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:15,535
in the rulebook and that don't appear in the game.

549
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:21,239
This is a game with a lot of flavor text, both on the cards and in the rulebook,

550
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:28,061
including a short story and a poem. In addition to this intro fluff.

551
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:34,842
But most of that text is very clearly opt-in lore. The beginning of the rulebook is a place

552
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:40,884
most players don't want to dwell on. Lengthy fluff like this with lots of adjectives and

553
00:41:40,944 --> 00:41:45,845
place names feels like a loss of momentum before the game has even begun. I would prefer something

554
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:46,405
more like this.

555
00:41:48,605 --> 00:41:52,128
Within the charming, a new year begins.

556
00:41:52,268 --> 00:41:54,209
Within the charming valley of Everdale,

557
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,312
a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding.

558
00:41:57,732 --> 00:42:00,334
But the time has come for new territories to be settled

559
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:01,755
and new cities established.

560
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,618
You will be a leader of a group of critters

561
00:42:04,698 --> 00:42:06,159
intent on just such a task.

562
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:07,940
There are buildings to construct,

563
00:42:08,101 --> 00:42:10,302
lively characters to meet, events to host.

564
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:11,603
It will be a busy year.

565
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:13,825
Will the sun shine brightest on your city

566
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:15,166
before the winter moon rises?

567
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:20,621
The focus changes from what the players will be doing in the game.

568
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:22,803
To what the players will be doing in the game.

569
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:25,665
Not the geography and history of the world.

570
00:42:26,867 --> 00:42:27,667
Now, don't get me wrong.

571
00:42:27,928 --> 00:42:31,311
This is perhaps my biggest criticism of Everdell's expression of theme

572
00:42:31,711 --> 00:42:33,553
and it's one that's shared by many games.

573
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:37,016
One lesson here is to read your lore fluff out loud

574
00:42:37,477 --> 00:42:40,159
to see if you're giving the reader too much detail.

575
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,983
Let's move on. The art of Everdale is highly evocative.

576
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:50,748
Reminiscent of other works such as The Wind in the Willows or

577
00:42:50,788 --> 00:42:54,072
the Redwall series, the art immediately establishes the tone

578
00:42:54,092 --> 00:42:58,497
of the game. Cozy, but not completely free from conflict.

579
00:43:00,303 --> 00:43:03,204
The resources in Everdell are delightfully tactile.

580
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:05,985
The berries, which are made of a squishy plastic,

581
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:09,005
are a standout example of how materials used in components

582
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:10,166
can create resonance.

583
00:43:10,726 --> 00:43:12,806
The rest of the resources are nearly as good.

584
00:43:13,406 --> 00:43:14,646
The resin is translucent.

585
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:16,467
The pebbles are opaque, hard plastic.

586
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:17,727
The twigs are made out of wood.

587
00:43:18,447 --> 00:43:21,328
Tactility that matches our expectations

588
00:43:21,428 --> 00:43:23,408
provides a strong emotional response.

589
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:26,569
Tactility can also be an avenue of unexpectedness.

590
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:31,467
I'm not sure that I can name another game that uses the same kind of squishy plastic

591
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,728
as the berries in Everdell.

592
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:39,269
The building tarts produce resources or effects that are highly thematic.

593
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:44,410
Mines produce pebbles, farms produce berries, storehouses store resources.

594
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:49,011
Buildings also attract critters whose profession matches the building.

595
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:52,812
Little pigeons move into post offices, kings move into castles.

596
00:43:53,628 --> 00:43:57,451
Placing a closed-door token on a building that has already attracted a critter is a

597
00:43:57,531 --> 00:44:00,772
simple and thematic reminder that that building is occupied.

598
00:44:01,533 --> 00:44:06,235
We get a sense of location from the materials used to build the buildings, from how the

599
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:09,437
buildings are used, and from the critters that inhabit the buildings.

600
00:44:10,057 --> 00:44:13,519
Coupled with the game board, Everdell has a strong sense of place.

601
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:19,663
One small element of dissonance is that the positioning in your tableau has no game effect.

602
00:44:20,668 --> 00:44:26,173
Now, I'm far from wanting Everdel to be more complicated, but I wish that neighboring buildings

603
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:31,677
or critters had some slight mechanical relationship rather than just being a random assortment

604
00:44:31,757 --> 00:44:32,557
in front of the player.

605
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:37,481
While discussing location, we have to talk about the tree.

606
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:44,006
The tree adds a sense of scale to a world relative to the wooden critter workers.

607
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:48,449
It also adds unexpectedness through sheer verticality.

608
00:44:49,332 --> 00:44:54,555
It makes an attempt to be incorporated into the game board as a place to store components,

609
00:44:55,176 --> 00:45:01,520
which ultimately isn't that useful, but I would rather have it have some use than for it to just

610
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:07,404
be a cardboard sculpture. The tree impairs usability slightly by blocking lines of sight

611
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:13,968
during gameplay and when it's awkward when storing it outside of the game.

612
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:20,279
but I suppose the lesson here is that if you are going to include an element that is even

613
00:45:20,399 --> 00:45:25,162
slightly difficult to use, it had better be gorgeous and highly thematic to offset its

614
00:45:25,202 --> 00:45:26,183
potential downsides.

615
00:45:28,424 --> 00:45:33,548
Everdell is not the only game to divide rounds into phases or seasons, but it uses this structure

616
00:45:33,608 --> 00:45:35,709
pretty well to create a sense of time passing.

617
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:42,108
Players can imagine harvests, births, and rests after long journeys during the prepare for season phase.

618
00:45:42,828 --> 00:45:47,030
My only complaint here is that the theming is so strong that it conflicts with the rules.

619
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:52,713
One player can move into a new season while the other players are still in the previous season,

620
00:45:53,214 --> 00:45:57,716
which is so counterintuitive that I got this rule wrong the first time I played Everdell.

621
00:46:00,045 --> 00:46:05,691
Eberdell uses illustration, tactility, and verticality and timing to create a rich world

622
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:09,815
while mostly not over-cluttering this world with distracting details.

623
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:17,722
These were just two examples that use a variety of tools to create resonance, particularly

624
00:46:17,782 --> 00:46:19,404
with regards to location and time.

625
00:46:20,096 --> 00:46:25,078
I hope to see more games in the future that leverage character motivation and relationships

626
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:27,759
for resonance, especially in shorter games.

627
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:32,681
Campaign and legacy games are already exploring more complex characterizations.

628
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:38,043
I hope that you leave today with a better sense of what it means for a game to be resonant.

629
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:44,786
To recap, resonance is a combination of emotions and story elements with some attention-grabbing

630
00:46:44,846 --> 00:46:48,647
twists that focuses on the core experience and nothing else.

631
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:57,276
familiarity, yeah, familiarity plus unexpectedness minus chef. If you want to dig into more thematic

632
00:46:57,316 --> 00:47:03,140
design concepts, I have a blog at shipboardgames.blogspot.com, which updates most Mondays.

633
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:04,842
Thank you.
