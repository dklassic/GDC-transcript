1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,084
this is all true. Even that long list of

2
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:09,705
post-nominals are actually legit

3
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:10,966
movement certifications that I hold.

4
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:13,147
We'll talk about that later. Yes I'm also

5
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,388
a technical artist at Facebook. Yes

6
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:15,848
Facebook hires technical artists. If any

7
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:16,909
of you guys are technical artists looking

8
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,130
for work please come talk to me. And

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,912
before we dive in let's do a little bit

10
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:24,153
of housekeeping. So we're actually going to do

11
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,914
our very first movement exercise. So I

12
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,795
want you to take one of your shoulders

13
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,376
depending on which side of the

14
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,057
room you're at, and I want you to turn it

15
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:31,897
so it's pointed.

16
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:36,504
roughly at one of those beautiful green turquoise-ish shirts in the back.

17
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,446
So there we go. Yeah. Okay.

18
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:41,848
Now, whichever shoulder is pointed at those guys—

19
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,229
No, no, no, stay in that position. Hold that position.

20
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,290
Okay, so whichever shoulder is pointed at those guys,

21
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:48,413
I want you to take your hand, I want you to stretch that arm out

22
00:00:49,053 --> 00:00:50,134
all the way through the finger.

23
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:54,157
Get a nice point at whichever shoulder, whichever beautiful green shirt you're pointing at.

24
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:56,138
Now, I want you guys to repeat after me.

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:56,779
You.

26
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:56,859
You.

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,781
Come on, you guys, with feeling.

28
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:00,061
You.

29
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:00,141
You.

30
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:07,007
awesome. Yes, thank you CAs. You guys are awesome. You guys, in fact, give them a round

31
00:01:07,027 --> 00:01:12,549
of applause. So like I said, I've been, I've been speaking here a long time and this conference

32
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,130
would not go off the way it does without those guys. I mean, they're here before we're here.

33
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,292
They're here after we're here. They do, they, they, they basically do all the, all the micro

34
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:22,673
dirty jobs and make sure that GDC is an awesome conference.

35
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,969
So, you know, and help them out you guys.

36
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,110
If they, you know, if they ask you to do something, you know,

37
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,110
they're not trying to assert their dominance.

38
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,071
They're not trying to get you to respect their authority.

39
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:33,431
They're just trying to make sure the conference runs smoothly.

40
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,032
So, and on the flip side, you know, if some of, some of our students,

41
00:01:37,052 --> 00:01:40,233
they're all volunteers, if they come up to you and have questions about the

42
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:43,073
industry or, you know, they want to ask, you know, spend some time with you,

43
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:45,354
like, you know, give them your ear for a bit, you know, like, you know,

44
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:45,874
help them out.

45
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:48,734
And another way you can do that, and I don't have a slide for this,

46
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:49,715
but you guys have probably read it.

47
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:52,027
is follow the code of conduct.

48
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:56,650
GDC has a pretty simple, non-intrusive code of conduct.

49
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,451
And it's got a couple points.

50
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:59,551
Like I said, I don't have it here.

51
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:01,392
But I think we could sum it up best

52
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:03,634
in the words of one of the preeminent philosophers

53
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:06,255
of at least my generation and one

54
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,637
of my favorite movie characters, Dalton from Roadhouse, who

55
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:10,158
said, anybody?

56
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:12,939
Yes, oh my god, be nice.

57
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,460
Thank you.

58
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,580
You're my people.

59
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,081
We can do this.

60
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:16,001
Oh, I'm so excited.

61
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,962
OK, I'm double happy now.

62
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:19,903
And another way to be nice and.

63
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,421
make this your conference and keep it your conference.

64
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,842
And you guys are going to get tired of hearing this.

65
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:25,263
You're going to hear this the next three days,

66
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:27,505
but please fill out your evaluation forms.

67
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:29,086
And this is a serious thing, you guys.

68
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:30,967
And I know it kind of sucks.

69
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:32,729
I mean, I went to like one session yesterday

70
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:33,989
and already my inbox is like,

71
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,011
hey, fill out this, hey, fill out this.

72
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:38,513
But we really do value that feedback.

73
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:41,435
I mean, that's what kind of makes this conference

74
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,716
you guys' conference, you know?

75
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,598
I mean, all the organizers for all the disciplines

76
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:47,379
and all the tracks read all the feedback.

77
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,678
and it really does help kind of decide what you guys want.

78
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:52,460
I mean, if you guys like this, who knows?

79
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,002
Maybe next year we'll do a full on, I don't know,

80
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:56,083
like full on workout.

81
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:57,885
I'll get my buddies on it to roll some gear down here

82
00:02:57,905 --> 00:02:59,026
and we'll swing maces for an hour.

83
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,427
I don't know, we'll do something like that.

84
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:03,830
But, and me personally, I'm actually really interested

85
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,972
in what you guys have to say too,

86
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,655
because this presentation in this incarnation,

87
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:11,057
I've never actually done for, I guess,

88
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:12,499
a general population fitness audience.

89
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:13,479
Like I've done it as kind of a,

90
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,730
like a full on day long workshop.

91
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,771
But usually it's been for other coaches,

92
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:19,292
gyms, trainer in sessions.

93
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:21,012
But I want to kind of take this out

94
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:22,012
to a more general population.

95
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:23,473
So you guys are kind of like my beta testers.

96
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:26,134
So I mean anything that you guys

97
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:28,155
from your specific perspective think is useful,

98
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:29,135
like anything you like,

99
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,476
if there's something you wish you had gotten out of this,

100
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:32,956
if there's something you wish I'd talked about more,

101
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:34,397
something I talked about less,

102
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:35,537
if you think my jokes are terrible,

103
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:37,678
they are, they're not gonna get better.

104
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:40,199
I mean if you don't like my shirt,

105
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,899
which I would actually take kind of personally,

106
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,760
because I think this is like.

107
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:46,134
This actually passes for fitness industry presentation formal.

108
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:47,455
I mean, I match.

109
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:50,578
I'm wearing, I guess, partial synthetics

110
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:53,640
with no swoosh or animal or stripes on the side.

111
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,041
I mean, I'm doing all right.

112
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:57,043
Can you believe I dressed myself this morning?

113
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:57,563
I did.

114
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:00,345
But that's another thing.

115
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:03,068
I laugh too much at my own bad jokes and deprecating comments.

116
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:04,268
So you can write that down, too.

117
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:05,549
But I've been hearing that for 13 years.

118
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,631
So I guess that just means I need to write better jokes,

119
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:07,831
right?

120
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:08,512
Teachable moment.

121
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:08,952
Yes.

122
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:09,613
All right.

123
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:12,015
And lastly, one of my favorite quotes

124
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:13,015
from one of my favorite.

125
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,231
I don't know what you call him anymore, Joe Rogan.

126
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:16,191
Be the hero of your own story.

127
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,574
What that means is for the time that we spend here,

128
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,035
we are going to be in a,

129
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:22,918
I'm looking at this more as a personal training session

130
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:24,699
than a seminar, and we are gonna actually do some moving,

131
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,262
but one of the hallmarks of a good personal training session

132
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:28,863
that we see at the Yoneda Academy,

133
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:30,965
which is kind of my alma mater for personal training,

134
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,227
is training is largely experiential.

135
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,788
A training session is a story,

136
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,591
and you guys, the clients, are the heroes of that story.

137
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:38,892
So I wanna make sure that.

138
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:42,013
everything we talk about like somehow comes back to you.

139
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,294
That means if you have a question,

140
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,215
go ahead and jump up in the middle of the presentation

141
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:45,535
and ask it.

142
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:47,836
I mean, I've kept the practicum and the theorem

143
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:49,656
like kind of purposely short,

144
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:51,537
like we'll probably be out of here in about 45 minutes

145
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:53,078
so you guys, so we can have kind of

146
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:54,278
that real time conversation.

147
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:59,040
Okay, so let's go ahead and start that story,

148
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,641
but with the boring part that is talking about me.

149
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,423
So yeah, it's actually,

150
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:06,303
I don't think it's a horribly boring story, but.

151
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:08,017
But it's really interesting to me

152
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,520
when I kind of look back at sort of my path up through,

153
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,061
from like fitness enthusiast to fitness pro

154
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,642
to now fitness education lecturer,

155
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:17,764
because it's kind of inextricably linked

156
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:20,886
to sort of my time in the games and tech industry.

157
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:23,227
And actually there's some cool artifacts.

158
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:24,208
Like Ross, there you are.

159
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:26,329
So that guy right there, Ross Patel from,

160
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,070
where are you at now, BioWare Austin?

161
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:30,092
So Ross and I were at Crystal Dynamics together

162
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:30,752
years and years together,

163
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:33,254
and he was actually one of my first personal training clients

164
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:34,755
and training partners.

165
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:36,650
And one day, if we ever are in the same town,

166
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,550
we'll probably train together again.

167
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:39,792
And good talk at TABC, by the way.

168
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:40,692
You made your old man proud.

169
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:41,092
Thank you.

170
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,254
Ross is also somebody that I mentored in tech.

171
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:45,115
I knew Ross before he was a tech artist, and so I mentored him.

172
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:47,556
So he's actually been kind of with me through this whole path.

173
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:48,417
So thank you for coming, sir.

174
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:53,680
But the other cool thing was just that a lot of these companies

175
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,721
have really good fitness programs.

176
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:56,841
They have really good gyms.

177
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:58,622
And that's actually kind of how we all got together.

178
00:05:58,662 --> 00:05:59,323
We were all at the gym.

179
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:02,148
And I kind of realized that, oh, it's actually really fun

180
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:02,769
to train people.

181
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,430
It's actually really fun to research this.

182
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,992
And since I was kind of in software engineer, developer,

183
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:12,235
kind of nerd mode, take that how you will, I apologize,

184
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:14,377
I really did like kind of the research side.

185
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:16,798
I mean, putting together programs for training

186
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:19,200
is a lot like putting together programs for writing code

187
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,620
programs.

188
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:20,961
I mean, because you have to debug.

189
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,002
You have to try things at work.

190
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:24,204
You have to take things that kind of already exist

191
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:25,164
and maybe rearrange them.

192
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:25,885
And so.

193
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,122
So it was kind of a natural fit and now that I've actually gotten into what we call movement coaching,

194
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:37,687
it's even more so because movement, you know, and what makes good movement and how we use good movement to kind of,

195
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:43,952
like I said, we're here to really turn back the hands of time, you know, to make sure that, you know, if you have movement conditions or pain,

196
00:06:43,972 --> 00:06:49,116
we're trying to get you out of that, is even more of a puzzle because even though we all have, you know,

197
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:54,320
I mean, able-bodied people, we all have a spine, a neck, two shoulders, two elbows, you know, all these wonderful things we have.

198
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,274
Everybody is subject to different things.

199
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,295
We hold tensions differently based on how we do things.

200
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:03,496
So figuring out what's right for you

201
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,476
is just like trying to chase down that bug

202
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:08,477
or trying to figure out exactly what shade of blue

203
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:09,537
that one picture should be

204
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:10,698
that's throwing off the whole image.

205
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,819
So let's see, was it Intel I was at?

206
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:16,439
So I was at Intel, yeah, about three or four years ago.

207
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,400
And I was kind of climbing that hill

208
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,081
up to that age that shall not be spoken.

209
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:24,682
And I was kind of thinking to myself, well, you know,

210
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:28,124
somehow I made it this far being relatively unencumbered.

211
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:29,584
So I wonder what I do with all my free time.

212
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:32,025
And of course, I thought back to spending time

213
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:34,626
with guys like my buddy Ross and all these other great people

214
00:07:34,646 --> 00:07:36,267
that I've trained with at a bunch of other gyms.

215
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:37,568
I thought, you know, that was really fun.

216
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,568
I should try and do that for real.

217
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,270
And so again, thankfully, because a lot

218
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,430
of these companies have very flexible schedules

219
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,072
and pay very well, I was able to kind of get

220
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:50,953
onto a real fitness education path, which kind of led me

221
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:51,713
to where I am today.

222
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,834
And so again, these are some of the certifications I have.

223
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,115
Viking ninja, that's like the coolest thing ever, right?

224
00:07:58,055 --> 00:07:59,957
And so, and these are all the,

225
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:01,437
what these all have in common is,

226
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:03,138
they're actually not strength

227
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:04,319
and conditioning certifications.

228
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,841
They're actually more along the lines of physical therapy,

229
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:09,282
rehab, prehab, correctives.

230
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,043
And that's actually what I bill myself as.

231
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,345
I'm actually a movement coach and corrective specialist.

232
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,266
And it's really interesting.

233
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,427
The way I got into all this was,

234
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:20,328
is everybody here familiar with Rigging Dojo

235
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:21,909
or some of you guys heard of Rigging Dojo at all?

236
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:24,003
Yeah, a couple of you guys.

237
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:25,863
So Brad Clark, I found out, he's a really good friend of mine.

238
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:28,405
And he lives out in Austin where the Onnit Academy is.

239
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:32,966
And I'd kind of seen Onnit's ads come up on Facebook.

240
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,688
And at the time, it's Joe Rogan with the gorilla kettlebell

241
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,288
looking all hard.

242
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:39,249
And at the time, I thought they were a clothing company,

243
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,670
which is funny because they'll actually tell you

244
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,510
they are if you ask them.

245
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,591
But he sent me a podcast from them.

246
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:46,292
So of course, me being the obsessive impulsive that I am,

247
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:48,153
binge watched all their podcasts, thought this is great.

248
00:08:48,741 --> 00:09:09,855
And so I come to Seattle to DJ a show and just by sheer coincidence on I was doing a one of their I think it's actually their first sort of vacations that weekend so I dropped in got certified said wow this is great and three years later I'm here and I love all this stuff and I'm really excited to actually talk to you guys about it and speaking of you guys.

249
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:12,977
Let's talk about that so.

250
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:21,131
The interesting thing about the tech industry that I've noticed as kind of a sort of outsider,

251
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:27,714
not outsider, is there's been this really interesting progression of what training programs

252
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,114
people have.

253
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:32,216
I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but everywhere I've worked, everybody kind

254
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:33,957
of does a similar training program.

255
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:39,319
For example, when I was at Bungie back in 2007, everybody there was into boxing fitness

256
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,120
or MMA.

257
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,160
It probably had to do with the fact that.

258
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,456
We're in the 434 building at Kirkland, which

259
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,317
is right up the street from AMC Pankration, which

260
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:47,038
if you're a UFC fan, that's where

261
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:48,880
Mighty Mouse does his camps, which is kind of awesome.

262
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,843
And when I was at, let's see, when I was at 3, two years

263
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:55,304
later, everybody was on P90X.

264
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,506
And now it's things like, I think it's Body Beast.

265
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:00,447
I still see some P90X, a lot of OCRs.

266
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:02,028
So let's talk about you guys.

267
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:05,351
Who here actually just works out at all, whether for fun,

268
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:08,633
or whatever structured program, not structured program,

269
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:09,493
just likes to play pickup?

270
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,102
Anything, just does physical stuff sometimes.

271
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:13,783
Oh, wow, awesome.

272
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:15,724
All right, so let's drill into that a bit.

273
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:18,606
So who actually does kind of some of that?

274
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:21,167
Oh, god, the CrossFitters are going

275
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,028
to sue me for saying this.

276
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,809
But who does, I guess, kind of the boot camp style stuff,

277
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:28,912
like CrossFit, Orange Theory, Barry's Fit Body,

278
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:29,592
anything like that?

279
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,554
Oh, you guys are my friends.

280
00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:33,334
I love all of you.

281
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:34,755
Don't do CrossFit.

282
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,942
OK, cool. So does anybody here do obstacle course races?

283
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:44,625
Spartan race, Tough Mudder, anything like that?

284
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,487
How about specialized stuff?

285
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:50,009
Martial artists, dance, anything like that?

286
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:51,511
What do you guys do?

287
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:52,071
Jiu jitsu?

288
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:54,413
Sweet, awesome.

289
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,474
My people, let's roll afterwards.

290
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:56,615
I'm kidding, let's not.

291
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:58,416
Yeah, even better.

292
00:10:58,516 --> 00:10:59,097
Awesome. Who else?

293
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:00,178
Any sports?

294
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,180
Oh, no kidding.

295
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:32,330
VR guy VR VR and exercise. See that. See that to me is like this. This giant like untapped market like VR fitness and air. OK, let's not get started on that. That's what this whole part is going to turn to you because I love that. But OK, cool. So what we're saying is though is you know there was this time in the long long ago where software developers taking and we were. Let's be honest, we're all classified as nerds, right? We're like the guys who sat around and didn't do things. Well, we all know that's BS. So but like I said, what I think is really interesting is.

296
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:40,093
watching the trends that have kind of that I've sort of seen in the industry and when I step back and kind of

297
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:43,834
analyze what I'm seeing what I see is a lot of

298
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:50,475
A lot of things that require high degrees of skill and movement variability and now to me that makes sense

299
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:55,436
right because we all work with our brain and and if you're not aware of this your brain is actually, you know,

300
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,837
Movement and physicality is very very tied to our nervous system

301
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:02,458
so I mean that's why you know, you see a lot of research now that says people that do things like

302
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:08,198
ballroom dance or jujitsu even or martial arts in general, you know, have actually,

303
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:13,880
I guess there's actually a study that showed that like the development of new white brain

304
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,823
matter based on these activities. So right off we see that, you know, that doing this

305
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:23,285
stuff is obviously good for us on many levels and like I said, I think that people who use

306
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:28,467
their brains like day to day are more drawn to those activities. Now, good and bad for

307
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:31,608
a couple reasons. The good thing about that is that

308
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:34,056
A, it's fun and we're all exercising, which is awesome.

309
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:36,298
The bad, well, let's not say bad.

310
00:12:36,358 --> 00:12:39,939
Let's just say one of the overlooked requirements

311
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,340
of doing things like that is, like I said,

312
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,023
they have high movement and high movement variability

313
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:47,583
and high movement capacity requirements.

314
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:49,685
That means we need to be able to move a lot,

315
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,646
and we need to be able to move well in different ways.

316
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:57,469
So the problem is that we work in a job where

317
00:12:57,669 --> 00:12:59,129
it's the exact opposite of that, right?

318
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,670
I mean, even if we have standing desks.

319
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:04,527
you know, half the time we're like this all day or we're,

320
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:08,388
you know, worst case, we're like, which, I mean,

321
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,708
does that even look comfortable?

322
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,609
Because if it does, I did something wrong and I apologize.

323
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:16,469
But, so, and the sad part about that is,

324
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,509
and first of all, I think it's awesome,

325
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:21,050
but the sad part of that is it's put us in this really kind

326
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,051
of, this really interesting and not preferable place to be,

327
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:26,511
and I call that the state of the union.

328
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:29,752
So, where we are now is,

329
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:33,897
There's been a lot of studies done in the last 10 years on the tech population

330
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:39,159
in general because it's been noted that the tech industry spends probably more per capita

331
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,682
on healthcare and research and payouts and everything around healthcare.

332
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:45,962
I actually have a number for you guys later.

333
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,983
And there's a reason for that.

334
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:48,343
Why?

335
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:53,505
Well, so 80% of us report that we're in some kind of back pain.

336
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:54,126
This is from a 2007 study.

337
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:00,768
Has anybody here ever had any kind of back pain, whether it's anything from like...

338
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:03,649
Okay, I'm not quite 80% but yeah, we all have.

339
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,910
I mean, I'm in pain right now.

340
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,510
No, I'm just kidding.

341
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,351
But hopefully you'll be out of that by the time we're gone here.

342
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,372
Actually, that's one of the things I like about doing this workshop.

343
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:15,472
One of the things I hear from people after this is something to the effect of,

344
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:17,533
wow, I had no idea I had a thoracic spine.

345
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:20,214
Well, you do. It's just been asleep for several years.

346
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:26,645
The interesting thing about the back, too, is the reason it's such a horrible, awful,

347
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:29,506
kind of all-encompassing, like you wake up in the morning and you're just like,

348
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:33,627
I'm just going to stay in bed. Think about what happens kind of like,

349
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:36,988
where can I get where everybody can see me? Think about what happens back here, right?

350
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:42,849
All these giant muscles, like our leg musculature and our shoulders and our lats,

351
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:48,230
they all kind of connect at this giant chunk of connective tissue called the,

352
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,571
I think the technical name is thoracolumbar fossia.

353
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:54,095
and it kind of acts like a corset. It just like gathers it all up and just kind of like,

354
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:58,977
you know, pulls it together and holds it tight. And the problem is, you know, our body is really

355
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:04,479
good at adapting to things. So, you know, as we sit here like this, that thoracolumbar fossa just

356
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:07,440
gets tighter and tighter because it's kind of, because your brain just kind of says, all right,

357
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,742
well, this is the position that obviously you're telling me that you need to be in, so I'm going

358
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:13,622
to stay in this position. And...

359
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:19,599
The back from a movement standpoint, you know, everything I said, everything connects.

360
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,701
So all of our movement actually starts from our spine.

361
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:27,587
And as an example, I'm going to violate the cardinal rule of GDC presentations and switch

362
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:30,610
out of my presentation and try and pull up a video.

363
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:33,313
This may be the end of my talk for all I know.

364
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:35,515
Yeah.

365
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:38,458
Okay, so this is my movement coach, Sarah.

366
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:39,299
Oh, hey, Justin.

367
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:39,619
What's up?

368
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:43,484
This is my movement coach, Sarah's child,

369
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:45,605
that she had back in August, I think.

370
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:46,585
August, September, something like that.

371
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:49,326
And he's just now learning how to kind of move.

372
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:52,147
And we were both really excited when she got pregnant.

373
00:15:52,347 --> 00:15:53,187
I was probably more excited,

374
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:54,187
because I was like, oh, that's great.

375
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,367
We can actually watch your kid

376
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:56,608
go through the developmental patterns.

377
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:59,828
And we can actually see how he goes from the ground

378
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:00,909
to squatting to standing.

379
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,269
And you're gonna videotape all that for me.

380
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:03,149
And she's like, oh yeah, of course.

381
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:03,929
And so she did.

382
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:05,970
So I'm gonna show you two videos,

383
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,211
and pay attention to specifically

384
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:10,471
how he's moving in this one.

385
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,188
Good job, keep rolling.

386
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:13,068
There you go.

387
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:14,549
Also Sarah's Canadian, so she has weird...

388
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,050
You gotta pose off that elbow, buddy.

389
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,590
You gotta lift that schnog.

390
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:19,011
Schnog, like a...

391
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:20,592
Oh, you're so close.

392
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:22,493
Oh, look at you.

393
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:24,454
Oh, you're doing it.

394
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:26,435
Lifting, there you go.

395
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:28,356
Oh, you good man.

396
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,136
Look at you go into your sphinxies.

397
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:31,797
So that's the first movement we do,

398
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:33,178
rolling onto our stomach.

399
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,439
Oh, you're such a good boy.

400
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,239
Lee-oo-hee-hee.

401
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:37,420
He's adorable.

402
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,241
Need to roll back over.

403
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,643
I know. I love that part where she's like roll back over. You can almost hear him be like no mom,

404
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:51,785
F no. I'm not doing that right now. You're gonna roll back over this way.

405
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:59,530
Get a pose. There you go. Yeah. He's like I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it yet.

406
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:05,334
All right. So this is Leo three weeks later. I think three or four weeks later.

407
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:08,636
And I want you to watch the difference in the movement now.

408
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:12,277
Must resist the urge to check my notifications.

409
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,700
Oh no, don't. There we go.

410
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,441
Go for it. Show me your rolling pattern, you funny man.

411
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:25,164
Boom shakalaka.

412
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:26,785
Gotta lift the schnoggy.

413
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:29,926
Lift the schnoggle.

414
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:34,169
Lift the schnoggle.

415
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:38,291
Atta boy, kick that leg. Kick that leg. Boom!

416
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:41,464
Hello, Darphin.

417
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:43,964
Hi Bubbles.

418
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:45,444
OK, so.

419
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:48,125
So I don't know if you guys notice it,

420
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:49,065
but in the second video,

421
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:51,046
what you saw was a lot more segmentation.

422
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:51,746
So in the first one,

423
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:54,726
he was kind of just like I'm just going to try and get over.

424
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:55,046
All right,

425
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:55,366
cool.

426
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:56,427
Or in the second one,

427
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,087
it was more of a OK,

428
00:17:58,107 --> 00:17:58,227
well,

429
00:17:58,247 --> 00:18:00,087
let me let me see if I like kind of reach.

430
00:18:00,227 --> 00:18:00,688
OK,

431
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:01,048
yeah,

432
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:01,648
now I'm moving.

433
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:02,148
All right now,

434
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,868
maybe if I oh yeah,

435
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:04,268
awesome,

436
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:04,708
I'm over and.

437
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,069
There's actually a corrective strategy called the Functional Movement System.

438
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:13,712
I think you guys saw that there's a sticker that said FMS on that second slide.

439
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:17,854
And that's actually their approach to movement is when they're correcting somebody,

440
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:22,077
they actually go back to, okay, well, let's look at all your developmental patterns.

441
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:24,379
Let's see how you move your spine.

442
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:28,281
And the rolling pattern is actually a corrective exercise we give to our clients

443
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:31,484
that when we assess that people don't have good T-spine movement.

444
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,064
So.

445
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,864
Point being, you know, spine, it is literally the center of our movement.

446
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:39,126
So that's why back pain sucks so bad,

447
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:42,428
is because it literally shuts you down from doing anything else.

448
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:47,453
So that said, this next number will probably make a lot of sense.

449
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,655
That is that 45% of us have neck pain. Why?

450
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:52,877
Because A, it's right above our spine,

451
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,800
and what do we spend a lot of time doing now

452
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,123
since the inception of that horrible devil device called the mobile phone?

453
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,781
ever see people like that? Like, like, who can somehow just like, like, like this part of their

454
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:09,923
neck is almost just like vertically, like horizontal. That's the weirdest thing. It's like,

455
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:14,345
it's like something out of like Hellraiser. I don't know, but, but that's obviously not good.

456
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:18,047
I mean there's, there's a stat that says something like, I think it's like every,

457
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:26,231
every one inch or one degree of neck tilt adds something like 10 pounds of force to, to like,

458
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:30,114
to the weight of your head. So, so if you think about, you know, here I'm neutral here. I mean,

459
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:30,814
you know.

460
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:32,610
How far forward is my neck tilted?

461
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,511
This is like the whole weight of my head is just

462
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,532
kind of just cranking on my neck.

463
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:38,674
So even if I'm just standing at the bus

464
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:40,015
for five minutes doing that,

465
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:42,436
imagine if I do that during my day for,

466
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:44,117
I don't know, five or six,

467
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:45,338
at five or six different instances

468
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:46,318
for varying periods of time.

469
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,340
Well, yeah, of course your neck's gonna hurt.

470
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,121
So I'm not suggesting that you have to go on.

471
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:52,862
Does anybody here know who Kelly Sturette is?

472
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:54,663
He's this movement coach in San Francisco.

473
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:56,404
He recommends that if you check your phone,

474
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:57,265
you should kind of like,

475
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:58,506
you should check your phone like this.

476
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:00,807
Like, I mean.

477
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:03,520
I mean, it looks cool, and it actually feels really great,

478
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,721
but I'm not gonna recommend you do that,

479
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:08,464
but I mean, maybe once in a while, I don't know.

480
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:11,506
So those are some specific instances,

481
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:14,328
but pain in general is actually super prevalent.

482
00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:18,271
I think the number that I found,

483
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,113
and this actually comes from a study

484
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,874
called Voices of Chronic Pain,

485
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,856
which is either the most depressing name for a study ever

486
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:27,838
or the most metal gospel choir mixtape in the world.

487
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,539
Like, you be the judge.

488
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:32,907
52%, so that's like who here ever went to college orientation, right?

489
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,829
Look to the left of you, look to the right of you, all right,

490
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,231
one of those people probably has some incidence of pain.

491
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:39,431
That's really sobering.

492
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:43,274
And specifically, one of the ways that manifests,

493
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:48,217
a couple of ways that manifests is that six out of ten people

494
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:52,139
actually cite having what we call breakthrough pain once in their life.

495
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:55,622
Now, breakthrough pain is anything from you wake up in the morning

496
00:20:55,802 --> 00:20:57,383
and you're just like, oh, God, or...

497
00:20:58,046 --> 00:20:59,547
You're just kind of sitting around, you have that,

498
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:00,848
I call it voodoo doll pain, right?

499
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:01,849
It just feels like somebody just like,

500
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:04,591
you're like, oh wow, I need to stop keeping

501
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,413
that voodoo doll in public places, all right.

502
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:10,236
And to kind of couple, to kind of give you an idea

503
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:12,838
of how serious that is, those same six out of 10 people

504
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:16,441
said if you were to ask me to,

505
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:19,223
if you were to give me a blanket tax of $1

506
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:22,365
on top of my income tax, regardless of my,

507
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:25,027
whatever percentage I'm paying, I would gladly pay that

508
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:27,089
if it went towards the curing of chronic pain.

509
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,818
So I mean, what's so serious that you would actually pay more taxes?

510
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:34,821
So that right there hopefully gives you a good idea of kind of what we're dealing with.

511
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:45,249
And even more so, so half of those people also said that the pain is so bad that I feel like I have no control over it.

512
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,271
Like I literally cannot do anything.

513
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:50,733
So I don't know about you guys, but that's terrifying to me.

514
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:55,377
Like the idea that, well, that's it for me, I guess.

515
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,038
This is kind of what I live with.

516
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:57,278
And.

517
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:01,248
You know, this is kind of funny, because when I was researching these stats,

518
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:05,771
I think I found this one, it was like a Wednesday night,

519
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:08,692
I'd done a jiu-jitsu class, then gone right back to the office

520
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:10,233
to kind of finish working on this.

521
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,654
And, you know, I was feeling really good.

522
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:15,196
I mean, you know, when you work out, you feel good.

523
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:18,237
And so I was like, all right, that's cool. Yeah, life's awesome.

524
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:20,218
I feel great. My neck really hurts,

525
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,320
because I think I choked on my own blood a little bit.

526
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,801
But I saw that, and I was just like, what would it be like to...

527
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,102
to just not be able to do things like that? What would it be like to,

528
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,725
you know, to just be in a situation where like, wow, I really want to try

529
00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:37,647
and learn that new skill, but this pain is keeping me from doing that.

530
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:41,090
Or I really want to just, you know, worst case scenario, my friend,

531
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,232
one of my other coaches out the on Academy, a wonderful mover by the name

532
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:47,114
of Shane Hines, slipped a disc once and

533
00:22:48,676 --> 00:22:52,358
after he had gone through surgery and after he was kind of into his rehab.

534
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:59,025
he was sort of that mindset of, well, I guess this is just the process and it's going to take a while and I'm going to be in pain for maybe the rest of my life.

535
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:05,367
And one day he goes to, you know, his son runs up to him. If you have kids, you know, they do this around you and they're like, Daddy, you know.

536
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:12,650
So he tried to pick his kid up and he winced. And his kid kind of, his son recoiled just in horror. He's like, oh my God, I hurt Daddy.

537
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:21,573
And in that moment, he thought, oh my God, I need to fix this because I don't, I don't want my son to think that, that hugging me is, you know,

538
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:23,828
like loving your dad is a painful thing.

539
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:29,012
So that's just an idea of how serious this stuff can get.

540
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:31,574
I mean, it's one of those things, like I said,

541
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:33,115
some of us, maybe we get to the point where it's like,

542
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:34,616
oh yeah, I have that nagging ache,

543
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:38,119
but it goes to dark places sometimes.

544
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:42,021
And kind of one of the really interesting things about that

545
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:44,303
is the way the human body works,

546
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:48,026
great quote from Sarah, whose lovely son you just saw.

547
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:51,507
100% of us have restrictions, tightness, or tensions

548
00:23:51,567 --> 00:23:53,568
that could be addressed, reversed, prevented,

549
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:55,250
or otherwise mitigated through movement.

550
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,531
Now, the way the human body works,

551
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:02,635
so back in the day, and by the day I mean like six years ago,

552
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:04,497
to give you an idea of how fast medical research

553
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,138
is moving out, it's almost like technology, right?

554
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,301
We, what we thought was that the way your skeleton

555
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:12,984
is set up, if you were able to stack all of your bones

556
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:15,085
perfect, like if there was some mythical position,

557
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:16,466
I don't know, maybe something like the T-pose

558
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:17,367
for all you animators out there.

559
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:22,596
if we were able to get our bones into that position and then just relax all of our muscles,

560
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:28,140
like the bones would just would hold us in place. What we know now is anybody has anybody seen like

561
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,683
a tense what we call a tensegrity structure? It's like there's a bunch of like struts and

562
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:35,785
they're held together by cables and just the tension of the cables kind of holds them in

563
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:40,648
place but otherwise there's nothing that really anchors them. So what we know now is that the

564
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,890
human body is actually more like a tensegrity structure. So your bones are kind of sort of

565
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:46,451
floating in this sea of...

566
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:52,084
of muscle and fascia and fluids, and there's a certain amount of tension required to hold

567
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:52,744
that structure.

568
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,986
So we're always under some kind of tension.

569
00:24:56,046 --> 00:24:58,286
It used to be, we used to think, well, if we could just figure out to—I mean, that's

570
00:24:58,306 --> 00:24:59,667
why massage used to be so popular.

571
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:03,168
We used to just think, like, oh, if we could just relax everything, you'll be fine.

572
00:25:03,748 --> 00:25:05,029
Problem is we know that's not true.

573
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:09,010
The problem is we know we need some of that tension, and not having that tension—for

574
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,312
example, if you've ever seen people who are really, really flexible, they end up having

575
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:15,253
joint problems because that tension isn't there.

576
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:18,936
But the problem is, like I said, having that tension means that at some point

577
00:25:20,096 --> 00:25:23,137
it can build up if we don't kind of move it around a bit.

578
00:25:23,777 --> 00:25:27,058
And if we think about where we are now,

579
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:31,059
well, let's think about some of the lifestyle changes that have gotten us here.

580
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,619
I mean, first of all, I'm not a Luddite. I love technology.

581
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,520
I love this. I love this. I love my phone.

582
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,381
But let's be honest, as these things get better,

583
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:42,201
we're bombarded with all sorts of things that are not good for us.

584
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,470
more blue light, more EMF.

585
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:47,172
Like I said, more time doing this, more time doing this,

586
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:48,633
less time outside.

587
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:54,816
And as our, let's call it, day-to-day technology

588
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:57,477
has gotten better, so has our medical technology,

589
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:01,099
but not necessarily to maybe the best end.

590
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:04,540
For example, nowadays, a serious injury,

591
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,461
where do we go from there?

592
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:07,182
We get referred right to surgery,

593
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:08,782
we get referred right to orthotics.

594
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:12,953
The problem is that may not always be the answer.

595
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:14,874
Back in the day, we were like, oh, God,

596
00:26:14,914 --> 00:26:16,235
we can't do anything about it.

597
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:17,676
Then we got to this point where it's like, oh, great,

598
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:19,297
surgery, we can fix everything.

599
00:26:19,317 --> 00:26:22,699
Now we're starting to realize, oh, maybe actually

600
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,901
by fixing things, we're just making them worse.

601
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:25,981
Because when we think about it,

602
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:27,602
the human body is incredibly resilient.

603
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:29,424
Guys, anybody here watch the Winter Olympics?

604
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:31,425
Anybody, anybody, Winter Olympics?

605
00:26:31,585 --> 00:26:32,205
So yeah.

606
00:26:32,606 --> 00:26:34,447
I mean, think about those athletes.

607
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,989
I mean, this continuum that is human performance,

608
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:41,688
whatever this end is and this end is an Olympic athlete.

609
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:43,349
I mean, any one of us can exist,

610
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:46,071
I was gonna say if we're able-bodied,

611
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:48,072
but actually I work with a coach out in Houston

612
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:51,154
who all of her athletes are what we call adaptive athletes.

613
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,075
And I'll tell you what, man,

614
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:54,716
when you see a guy who has a wheelchair

615
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:57,198
do more dead hang pull-ups and you can only do one,

616
00:26:57,338 --> 00:26:58,779
like, I don't know, well, right there.

617
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,121
So point being that we're so quick

618
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:05,503
to try and apply this giant band-aid when maybe,

619
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:09,314
maybe we need to like figure out what the foundation of the actual problem is.

620
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,474
And one of the big issues with surgery,

621
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:14,215
expressed very well by my buddy Dr. John Russin,

622
00:27:14,895 --> 00:27:16,596
so if you injure your right shoulder,

623
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:18,556
you're something like six times more likely,

624
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,537
I think the number's like 66% actually,

625
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:22,838
to re-injure not just your right shoulder,

626
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:24,298
but your left shoulder at the same time.

627
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:26,279
And this is actually played out a lot.

628
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,519
Has anybody here ever like torn your knee?

629
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,360
Had a, had, ooh.

630
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh.

631
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,381
Tell us about it, please.

632
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:34,461
Which one?

633
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:38,472
What were you doing?

634
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:43,814
And there it is, you guys.

635
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:46,495
And that's the really devious thing about this stuff, right?

636
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:49,296
It's never like, it's, one of my other buddies,

637
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:52,497
a guy named Dr. Dre Spina who runs a system called Functional Range Conditioning,

638
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:56,558
says, you're always going to regret not training the position that you hurt yourself in.

639
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:58,879
And that's usually how it happens.

640
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,780
And it's usually not like, you know, it's not a,

641
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,661
it's not an immediate onset thing.

642
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:06,602
It's a cascade. It's a buildup over time.

643
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:11,187
And the problem with surgery is it puts us in the state where we're told, okay,

644
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:14,588
we're gonna stitch this down, we're gonna tighten it up,

645
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:19,590
we're gonna immobilize everything, and in weeks when we take the cast off,

646
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,270
everything will be fine.

647
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,352
Well, the problem is, we know now that that's not how tissue heals best.

648
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:30,013
It used to be that we thought that because your connective tissue has a poor

649
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:32,714
blood supply, unlike your muscles, we thought, well,

650
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:34,435
there's no way to repair connective tissue.

651
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:40,161
What we know now is that your fossia actually is very highly innervated.

652
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:41,962
So there's a lot of nerves that go into your fossia.

653
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:43,783
So it receives electrical stimulation.

654
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,505
And it actually holds water very well.

655
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:52,689
So what we need to do is, so when you're not moving around,

656
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:54,990
you're actually not providing the, I guess,

657
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,832
the stimulus that your fossia needs, A, to flush out the fluids,

658
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:01,154
like the old fluids that have accumulated toxins, waste products from movement,

659
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:03,355
and let new fluids and movement in.

660
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:06,078
So you imagine you're sitting in a cast for a month.

661
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:09,660
Well, all that connective tissue is kind of growing together,

662
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,462
but it's not growing better.

663
00:29:12,062 --> 00:29:16,926
And back to the story about my friend Shane,

664
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:18,787
he actually just tore his ACL recently.

665
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:21,949
And actually, the story's going to start horribly,

666
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,311
because he tore one of his ACLs when he was a child,

667
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:26,472
and then he tore his other one when he was an adult.

668
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:27,773
So he's outside that year, at least.

669
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,115
But the interesting thing was that when

670
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:32,016
he went in to get surgery, his doctor said,

671
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:34,097
the one that you tore when you were a child,

672
00:29:34,257 --> 00:29:36,138
I literally can't tell that you tore it

673
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:37,880
because he'd been doing so much

674
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,921
of this movement practice stuff that we're gonna go into.

675
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:42,342
And we're actually going to that right now.

676
00:29:42,362 --> 00:29:43,423
I actually have a bunch of other slides,

677
00:29:43,523 --> 00:29:45,865
but how many people are here?

678
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:46,885
Ooh, way more than I thought.

679
00:29:46,905 --> 00:29:48,827
All right, well, we're gonna go ahead

680
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:50,468
and jump to the end and start the movement practice

681
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,789
because like I said, I wanna get you guys

682
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:52,549
out of here a little early.

683
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:57,812
So disclaimer, I am not a licensed medical professional.

684
00:29:57,933 --> 00:29:59,093
I am a certified personal trainer.

685
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,254
I am a certified correctives coach,

686
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,255
but you can sue me if you want to.

687
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:08,430
Please don't. None of this is meant to assess, diagnose, or treat any pre-existing conditions.

688
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:15,514
And if you do want to adopt any of this later, please see a PT or an ortho first.

689
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:20,236
Don't go see a general practitioner unless it's to get a referral to a PT or an ortho.

690
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:25,119
So the first thing we're going to do is... I'm going to skip through all these numbers.

691
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:27,360
I'll leave them up so you can see them and be terrified.

692
00:30:28,081 --> 00:30:29,601
But I don't know what that is.

693
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:31,937
All right, so the first thing we're going to do

694
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,558
is what we call a self-check.

695
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:36,979
And this is something you can do anytime you're at work,

696
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,760
you're at home.

697
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,581
And this is optional participation.

698
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:43,163
But what I'd like you guys to do is from that seated position,

699
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:45,624
so if you remember that first thing we did,

700
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:47,826
I'd like you to take your right shoulder,

701
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:50,767
and I'd like you to just look over it as far as you can.

702
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:55,030
And as you're turning back, if you ever

703
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,492
feel any sort of restriction, kind of breathe into that

704
00:30:58,572 --> 00:30:59,472
and see if you can get.

705
00:30:59,989 --> 00:31:03,970
little bit more. And work on your proprioception a bit. See how much of

706
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,412
your shoulder and your spine you're moving, but see how much you're having to compensate

707
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:11,794
with your hip. Now go ahead and turn back over the other shoulder. And breathe

708
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:19,138
through the movement. Good. Let's go back to the other side one more time. And

709
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:23,200
again, be cataloging where you're feeling tightness. Be cataloging your range of

710
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,122
motion. And try and use your breath light to go a little farther if you're not

711
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:28,342
feeling any pain or restriction.

712
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:31,035
Good. And back to the other side one more time, please.

713
00:31:34,356 --> 00:31:37,137
Excellent. Yeah. And I see some folks have their have their arms up here.

714
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:38,277
This is this is really good.

715
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:44,979
You can if you know if it helps as a as a proprioceptor, go ahead and put your your kind of your knuckles at your sternum and just use this kind of.

716
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:46,719
Yeah, there we go.

717
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,821
Okay, so second part of that, we're going to turn and as we turn, we're actually going to we're going to turn our neck, too.

718
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:58,582
So we're going to turn our spine and our shoulders first, and then we're going to follow it with our neck.

719
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:01,605
Again, breathe out and crank your neck as far as you can.

720
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:02,266
Don't crank.

721
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,106
God, why do I say that?

722
00:32:03,446 --> 00:32:03,847
Don't crank.

723
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,328
Thoughtfully turn your head.

724
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:07,409
There we go.

725
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:09,730
And back the other way, please.

726
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:14,813
Very nice.

727
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:18,835
And again, be mindful of where your neck is pulling.

728
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,396
Are you feeling it in your scalenes?

729
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:21,476
Are you feeling it in your traps?

730
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:22,257
Are you feeling it...

731
00:32:22,737 --> 00:32:25,418
You know, I mean, heck, if you're as jacked up as I am,

732
00:32:25,438 --> 00:32:27,940
you might feel it down into your quadratus, your hips.

733
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:28,640
But...

734
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:30,769
Sir?

735
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:33,610
The ribs, is that normal?

736
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,691
It's not normal, but it does happen though.

737
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:38,712
I mean, because if you think about...

738
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:40,593
So your neck is interesting, right?

739
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:42,953
Because you have these two giant muscles here

740
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,274
that kind of run, that sort of attach here,

741
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:46,635
like along your clavicle,

742
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,696
and also attach kind of back here

743
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:50,276
on your traps and rhomboids.

744
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,397
And that all kind of...

745
00:32:51,717 --> 00:32:53,218
And then there's some stuff here

746
00:32:53,258 --> 00:32:54,798
that kind of runs out of that

747
00:32:55,318 --> 00:32:56,239
down into your ribs, right?

748
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,619
Like your serratus and stuff like that.

749
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,931
That's the fascinating thing about all this.

750
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:00,871
All this stuff is connected.

751
00:33:00,931 --> 00:33:01,992
So yeah, like I said, you might.

752
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:03,953
And that's why we're doing this slowly.

753
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:07,174
I mean, everybody remembers elementary school PE.

754
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,415
We do this sort of thing.

755
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:10,816
I mean, that's A, not great for you,

756
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,856
and B, you miss out on the opportunity

757
00:33:12,876 --> 00:33:15,878
to kind of actually move the way you're supposed to move.

758
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:18,399
So that's why we do this slowly, like I said,

759
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:19,599
because you feel things like that.

760
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:22,761
I have a coach named Max Shank.

761
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:25,002
He has a great quote, and that is, speed hides need.

762
00:33:26,532 --> 00:33:28,935
we can get away with things if we're moving very quickly.

763
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:30,636
It's funny, as a personal trainer,

764
00:33:31,157 --> 00:33:33,939
when you teach somebody a bit more of a skilled movement,

765
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,161
or even a simple movement, when people get tired,

766
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:36,922
and we've all done this, right?

767
00:33:36,942 --> 00:33:38,684
When we get tired, what do we start to do?

768
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,165
We start to move a little faster, right?

769
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:42,107
Just to kind of get the reps out.

770
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:44,169
Well, that's because our brain is saying,

771
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:46,431
oh my God, we need to just do whatever we can

772
00:33:46,451 --> 00:33:47,032
to do the movement.

773
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:49,134
If we think about...

774
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:52,144
back to the Olympics, and we think about Olympic athletes, right?

775
00:33:52,524 --> 00:33:55,287
So most Olympic athletes, most even high-level athletes in general,

776
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:56,648
are actually not great movers.

777
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:59,530
You can actually find mocap data of these guys,

778
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,912
and you'll see their joints all over the place.

779
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:05,175
But what they're good at is they are master compensators.

780
00:34:06,115 --> 00:34:08,557
Their neural patterns are so developed that their brain just kind of says,

781
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:12,340
OK, well, you need to do this at this level, at this level of performance.

782
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:17,144
And hey, you're conditioned enough that I think I can make you do it this way

783
00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:18,345
without hurting you too badly, but...

784
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:20,978
We all know that's not true, given the prevalence of ACL

785
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:23,539
tears in the NFL and the NBA and things like that.

786
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,101
So like I said, so that quick self-check,

787
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:29,162
I mean, it seems really simple.

788
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:30,903
But if you think about it, it hits kind

789
00:34:30,923 --> 00:34:33,064
of like that major column, your spine and your neck.

790
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:34,705
And this is something, I mean, I do this every day.

791
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:36,966
I have an online, I just run what is it?

792
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:38,627
I think it's like onlinetimers.com or whatever.

793
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:41,008
But yeah, just set a timer for like three hours

794
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:42,689
and do this like every three hours.

795
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,049
Just kind of check in with yourself.

796
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:45,730
I mean, A, I think it feels good.

797
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,090
And B.

798
00:34:47,245 --> 00:34:49,987
I use it to kind of diagnose what I should be doing when I train that day.

799
00:34:50,027 --> 00:34:53,210
So if you guys know you're going to go work out that day and you feel something a little off,

800
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,611
maybe you warm that spot up a little more.

801
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:59,974
Maybe you don't do the thing you were going to do that's going to kind of rely on that pattern.

802
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,476
So, all right, awesome.

803
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:06,079
So the next thing we're going to do, I like to call it the 14-point inspection.

804
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,600
So I'm going to ask everybody to stand up.

805
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,262
And I was thinking about this, it actually is kind of a 14 points because, you know,

806
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:12,983
I've got, you know, neck, shoulders, my name, whatever.

807
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,745
But all right, so I'm going to come down here now.

808
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:21,251
And you guys can like filter over you want. I mean, I mean, let's all be friends. Geez, I like all of you. Thank you for coming.

809
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:26,673
Um.

810
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:29,875
Could I not?

811
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:32,216
Do what?

812
00:35:34,857 --> 00:35:35,018
Uh.

813
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,099
OK, cool.

814
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,620
Nobody wants to look at me. Let's be honest. I mean.

815
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:41,961
Alright, so.

816
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:46,999
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to kind of align everything.

817
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:49,001
We call this tall neutral pose.

818
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:51,563
So what I want you guys to do is we're going to go from the ground up.

819
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:54,706
And I want you to point your toes forward.

820
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:58,250
And think about this line on your outstep.

821
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,992
Think about pointing that straight forward.

822
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:03,195
So I know some of you might have heard make sure your instep is straight.

823
00:36:03,215 --> 00:36:04,936
We're going to make the outstep straight.

824
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:06,738
And what we want to do is

825
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:11,883
imagine you're grabbing the ground with your feet and twisting out just a little bit.

826
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:15,264
So you should feel a little bit of tension kind of along this line here.

827
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:18,826
So we're going to soften our knees just a little bit,

828
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:21,167
because we don't want to lock anything out.

829
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:23,509
We want to make our muscles and our connective tissue work.

830
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:27,971
And we're going to take our hips and we're going to try and like tuck them under in a little bit.

831
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:30,732
You know, a lot of us kind of stand like this, you know, Instagram pose.

832
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:32,433
Yeah. Am I hot? No, I'm not.

833
00:36:34,474 --> 00:36:34,574
And

834
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:38,438
Cool. So now from here what we're going to do is, now this is kind of, this is the tricky part.

835
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:44,801
So we're going to try and reach up with our spine but not flare our ribs out. So try and stand as

836
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:50,324
tall as you can. Imagine that, imagine using the muscles on the side of your spine to kind of

837
00:36:50,484 --> 00:36:56,306
track your spine apart just a little bit. There we go. We're going to pull our chin back just a bit.

838
00:36:56,326 --> 00:37:01,009
So actually do this. So I want you to force the, think about trying to force the back of

839
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:03,150
your head through whatever's behind you as hard as you can.

840
00:37:04,146 --> 00:37:07,068
Now I want you to push your face forward as far as you can.

841
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:11,512
Now I want you to try and settle to somewhere that's in between.

842
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:13,354
Yeah, there we go.

843
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:16,816
Cool. So what we're going to do now is we're going to take our shoulders

844
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:20,099
and we're going to think about putting our shoulder blades in our back pocket.

845
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,081
So we're going to roll our shoulders back and down,

846
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:24,142
but we're going to try and make sure that our ribs don't flare up.

847
00:37:24,162 --> 00:37:28,226
So we don't want to do this. If we do this, let's try and push those ribs back down.

848
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:32,389
Excellent. Now we're going to take our hands down at a 45.

849
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:36,116
and we're just gonna try, we're gonna reach out through our fingers,

850
00:37:36,136 --> 00:37:37,878
kind of like we did like that first drill.

851
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,699
We want to kind of like, we want to feel a little bit of tension.

852
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:42,802
So this is what we call, so this is almost a perfect

853
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,824
H-Kin, you know, physiological alignment.

854
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:48,266
So, and this is a position you,

855
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:50,948
you practice it for like a month, you know, when you're,

856
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,690
and not actually, just like when you're standing waiting for the bus,

857
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,652
when you're at the gym, just kind of check in with yourself,

858
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:59,074
say, oh am I, and you'll be surprised at how natural this comes.

859
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:02,117
All right, so from here, we're gonna start from the spine out,

860
00:38:02,137 --> 00:38:03,558
so we're gonna take our hands and we're gonna put them here.

861
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:07,850
We're going to do a variant of that first thing we did, except we're going to move a little faster.

862
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,851
So we're just going to think about moving our spine,

863
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:15,673
and we're going to try and make sure that our hips don't go along for the ride.

864
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:16,253
So we don't want to...

865
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:20,435
We want to make sure that our hips stay in place and just move from our T-spine up.

866
00:38:22,155 --> 00:38:27,657
And we're going to use our fists at our sternum to kind of make sure that we're not reaching.

867
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:30,338
So our fists should stay on our sternum the whole time.

868
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:38,018
We want to breathe as we come to the extreme.

869
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:39,419
Breathe out as we come to the extreme.

870
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:41,380
Breathe in on the way through.

871
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,241
Good.

872
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:51,244
Five, four, three, two, one.

873
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:52,065
Awesome.

874
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:53,425
So now what we're going to do

875
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:55,786
is we're going to move up the spine.

876
00:38:55,886 --> 00:38:57,587
We're going to imagine that we have,

877
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:01,469
let me see the original King Kong remake,

878
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:02,949
you know that part where the guy gets like,

879
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:04,370
like stabbed in the back with a spear,

880
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,070
kind of like he's got this.

881
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,842
So we're going to imagine that just happened to us, except it actually felt awesome, or we didn't feel it or whatever.

882
00:39:09,462 --> 00:39:13,405
But we're going to imagine that we have a thing right here, and we're going to rotate around it.

883
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:16,246
So we're not going to, like, lean over.

884
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:21,629
We're going to try and just kind of twist from our T-spine up.

885
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:24,390
It takes a couple reps for practice, but...

886
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:28,733
And this isn't a big move. You're not going to get a ton of movement out of this.

887
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:30,353
Yeah, good. Awesome.

888
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,062
And what we're doing with this is we're moving up each of the major segments of the spine

889
00:39:37,122 --> 00:39:39,402
and just kind of seeing how the movement feels.

890
00:39:39,802 --> 00:39:43,124
Like, you know, can, do I have a T-spine? Can I feel that movement?

891
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:46,685
Awesome.

892
00:39:49,426 --> 00:39:52,106
Okay. Good. Now, one of my favorite moments.

893
00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:56,968
So from here, we're going to, we're going to, so that spear that just like punctured us in the chest,

894
00:39:57,008 --> 00:39:58,308
actually, we're going to go ahead and pull that out.

895
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:00,589
And we're actually going to stick it through the side now.

896
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:04,009
And what we're going to do is we're going to glide back and forth.

897
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:08,931
So what we're going to try to do is make sure that our shoulders don't rise too

898
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:11,712
much. We want to just think like we're floating back and forth.

899
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:16,275
And check in with your hips. Like sometimes we tend to let our hips go so

900
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:18,736
we can get a little bit more motion, like you know this kind of thing,

901
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,377
but we want to make sure that we're still grounded, that we're still kind of

902
00:40:21,437 --> 00:40:22,738
grabbing the ground with our feet.

903
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:29,682
Good. Now from here we're going to we're going to move...

904
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:30,918
back and forth.

905
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:32,158
So we're going to like, so imagine

906
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:34,939
that like there's kind of a rope attached to your sternum

907
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:36,560
and it's pulling you forward.

908
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,822
And then you can't really push with a pusher rope, can you?

909
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:43,683
All right, let's pretend it's like a pulley then, or a piston.

910
00:40:43,823 --> 00:40:45,224
Yeah, like it's part of a train.

911
00:40:45,264 --> 00:40:45,684
There we go.

912
00:40:47,025 --> 00:40:47,685
That's uncomfortable.

913
00:40:47,885 --> 00:40:50,066
And then we're just going to like pull forward.

914
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,727
And then we're going to let it push us backwards.

915
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,368
So the movement is happening.

916
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:58,892
So this is kind of from here up.

917
00:40:59,072 --> 00:41:02,533
So I'm kind of like gliding this back and then gliding this

918
00:41:02,613 --> 00:41:03,073
forward.

919
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:08,615
Yeah, you got it.

920
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:10,015
All right.

921
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:12,416
So now we're going to put those two together.

922
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,116
This is really fun.

923
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:14,636
So we'll segment it first.

924
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,637
So let's go ahead and glide forward first.

925
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:20,158
Now let's glide to your right or your left, whichever.

926
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,858
Now let's glide back.

927
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:26,039
Now let's glide to the opposite side.

928
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:33,713
And forward, side, back, side.

929
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:34,134
Good.

930
00:41:34,214 --> 00:41:36,315
Let's try and smooth that out a bit now.

931
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:42,439
Very nice, you guys.

932
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,661
Let's try it back to the other side now.

933
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:48,482
Let's just go right into it if we can.

934
00:41:51,564 --> 00:41:52,605
Just this time.

935
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:53,846
Seriously, do this every day.

936
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:06,879
Good. All right, so the neck. All right, so what we're going to do first is we're going to try and

937
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:11,702
go back to that tall neutral position because we don't want anything to move. And we're going to

938
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:16,864
try and look to the right side as far as we can with just our neck. So we don't want to be,

939
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:21,967
we want to try and just think about like you're just pointing with your chin.

940
00:42:21,987 --> 00:42:24,589
And we're going to look back the other way.

941
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:24,689
Good.

942
00:42:29,192 --> 00:42:35,277
And when you find kind of an edge, try and breathe out a little bit and see if you can get just a tiny bit more range.

943
00:42:49,689 --> 00:42:50,410
Good.

944
00:42:52,452 --> 00:42:53,973
So now we're going to nod yes and no.

945
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:56,495
So we're going to go chin to chest.

946
00:42:58,369 --> 00:42:59,670
And we're gonna go nose to sky.

947
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,772
And like I said, we're gonna try to make sure

948
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,313
this movement only comes from our neck.

949
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,575
So let's not let our ribs kind of flare out.

950
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:17,428
Good.

951
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:19,250
All right, so we're gonna go ahead and look forward.

952
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,213
Now we're gonna try and touch our ear to our shoulder.

953
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:28,899
Again, try and make that motion, try and localize that motion to your neck as much as you can.

954
00:43:35,463 --> 00:43:36,743
And you can do this at your own pace too, guys.

955
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:39,665
Like, yeah, we're actually doing this on time, not really for reps.

956
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:42,127
So, you know, get what you need to out of this.

957
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:43,948
You know, feel what you need to feel for.

958
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:48,431
You know, if you want to hang out on one side more, which is totally normal,

959
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:50,572
because we're all in balance, we're all asymmetrical.

960
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:51,893
Very cool.

961
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:04,337
And my favorite, neck circles. So we can go chin to chest, ear to shoulder, nose to sky, ear to shoulder.

962
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:09,862
And again, do this at your own pace. Whatever feels right to you.

963
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:23,940
You know, let's just let it run.

964
00:44:24,301 --> 00:44:24,721
Yeah, you know what?

965
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:25,341
I'm cool with that.

966
00:44:26,102 --> 00:44:26,803
And back the other way.

967
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:33,047
Wait for it.

968
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:33,928
Oh, there it is.

969
00:44:39,492 --> 00:44:39,952
All right, good.

970
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:41,554
So to the shoulders.

971
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:43,595
And this is going to actually, well, no, we have to do elbows and wrists too high.

972
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:46,998
All right, so we're going to, so this is, you know, these are all my favorite moments.

973
00:44:47,348 --> 00:44:54,092
So with the shoulders, the interesting thing is when we move our shoulders, we tend to borrow movement from our elbows and our wrists.

974
00:44:54,112 --> 00:44:58,254
We don't want to do that. The point of all this is to learn to get that interdependence back into our joints.

975
00:44:58,754 --> 00:45:04,917
So imagine that you're holding swords or TV remotes or something that you hold like this, Vive controllers for you HT guys,

976
00:45:05,478 --> 00:45:11,681
and point your thumbs at the floor and try and not hard lock your elbows out, but try and make sure they don't bend too much.

977
00:45:12,081 --> 00:45:15,543
And we're just going to like try and roll our shoulders without bending our elbows.

978
00:45:18,484 --> 00:45:21,906
Again, we're trying to localize that movement to our shoulders as much as we can.

979
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,209
You can actually go hands forward too, if that's easy.

980
00:45:32,473 --> 00:45:33,534
Let's go back the other way.

981
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,621
Yeah, yeah, that's, you know, compensation.

982
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:47,603
It happens all over, and we're actually trying to get rid of that.

983
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:52,687
I mean the more each one of our joints can kind of move interdependently when we go to do complex movements,

984
00:45:52,788 --> 00:45:55,850
the less we have to borrow from other places that might not be ready for it.

985
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,571
So, all right.

986
00:45:57,971 --> 00:46:00,053
Yeah, let's do one more shoulder thing.

987
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:03,315
So this is, you know, I mentioned my buddy Dr. Gary Spina.

988
00:46:03,335 --> 00:46:07,638
So this is an exercise from his system called, we call these controlled articular rotations.

989
00:46:07,658 --> 00:46:09,800
And there's a whole series of these if anybody's interested.

990
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,781
And you can hit me up afterwards and we can talk about.

991
00:46:11,821 --> 00:46:14,423
But it's a multipart movement.

992
00:46:14,443 --> 00:46:15,364
So we're going to start by...

993
00:46:15,955 --> 00:46:18,356
with our hand down at our side, with our thumb pointed forward.

994
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:21,558
And we're going to roll this hand up.

995
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:24,099
Now, as it passes our ear,

996
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,681
we're going to try and push back as far as I can.

997
00:46:28,781 --> 00:46:31,342
And then when I feel like I absolutely have to roll my hand over,

998
00:46:31,362 --> 00:46:32,783
I'm going to let my hand roll over.

999
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:35,604
And then as I come down,

1000
00:46:36,665 --> 00:46:39,486
I'm going to keep rolling my thumb inward.

1001
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:45,469
And I'm going to finish up with my thumb behind me.

1002
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:52,013
Kind of a weird movement, but this is a great way of expressing your shoulder through its whole range of movement.

1003
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:53,514
And I'm going to come back the other way.

1004
00:46:53,534 --> 00:46:58,596
And I'm going to push, push, push until I need to roll over.

1005
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:01,197
And when I need to roll over, I'm going to...

1006
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:05,519
And then I'm going to come back down.

1007
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:14,163
And there's a great little self-assessment version of this you can do where you can stand up against a wall or something and see how much extra movement you're getting.

1008
00:47:14,756 --> 00:47:16,597
And it's interesting.

1009
00:47:17,518 --> 00:47:18,799
We compensate on this kind of movement

1010
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:19,640
more than we think we do.

1011
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,741
Let's go ahead and do the other side at your own pace.

1012
00:47:35,912 --> 00:47:38,494
Yeah, it's interesting how far, like, you're

1013
00:47:38,514 --> 00:47:40,215
trying to keep it in a, like, you know,

1014
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:41,776
we think we're actually keeping it on a plane,

1015
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:42,537
but we're actually kind of.

1016
00:47:43,434 --> 00:47:44,814
out here somewhere realistically.

1017
00:47:44,834 --> 00:47:52,016
Ah, awesome.

1018
00:47:54,396 --> 00:47:55,376
Alright, let's move down to the elbows.

1019
00:47:55,396 --> 00:47:57,817
So, we're going to hold our hands out, thumbs in.

1020
00:47:57,837 --> 00:48:01,117
And what we're going to do is we are going to

1021
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:03,338
roll our thumbs in, point at myself.

1022
00:48:03,898 --> 00:48:05,038
I'm the man, yes I am.

1023
00:48:05,058 --> 00:48:07,799
And then we're going to roll our elbows in.

1024
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:09,099
We're going to extend.

1025
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,400
Roll over.

1026
00:48:16,804 --> 00:48:17,444
Extend.

1027
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:20,388
Good.

1028
00:48:20,428 --> 00:48:20,828
Let's do that.

1029
00:48:20,848 --> 00:48:21,889
Let's just do that for a bit.

1030
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:22,870
Let's just hang out here for a bit.

1031
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:23,311
Yeah.

1032
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:29,318
Oh, and don't forget to breathe.

1033
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:32,001
Seriously, I've had people pass out doing this.

1034
00:48:32,061 --> 00:48:33,262
It's the weirdest thing.

1035
00:48:33,282 --> 00:48:38,388
All right, let's go back the other way.

1036
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:47,178
And if you're old like me, you'll hear things crack and pop, and that's fine.

1037
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,860
Good. Let's move down to our wrists.

1038
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,161
Now, again, like we saw with the shoulders, so shoulders and wrists are interesting.

1039
00:49:00,181 --> 00:49:04,142
So, if we take kind of a joint-by-joint approach to movement,

1040
00:49:04,562 --> 00:49:08,083
some of our joints are meant to be stability joints, and some are meant to be mobile.

1041
00:49:08,283 --> 00:49:09,483
And injuries happen when...

1042
00:49:10,038 --> 00:49:12,479
we make a mobile joint try and be stable and vice versa.

1043
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:15,601
So that's why when we're moving our shoulder,

1044
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,682
we saw that borrowing.

1045
00:49:16,722 --> 00:49:20,224
That's because we're starting to juxtapose those roles.

1046
00:49:20,264 --> 00:49:21,244
The wrist is the same way.

1047
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:22,965
When we move our wrists, a lot of times

1048
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,686
we'll start borrowing movement up the chain.

1049
00:49:24,706 --> 00:49:27,648
So what we want to do here is we actually want to block

1050
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:28,888
our elbows with our body.

1051
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:30,750
So yeah, zombie pose.

1052
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:34,612
And actually, you can even do this one-handed too,

1053
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:36,753
or if it's subbed, you can actually block further.

1054
00:49:36,813 --> 00:49:37,493
But let's just try it here.

1055
00:49:37,513 --> 00:49:38,454
So what we're going to do is we're just

1056
00:49:39,387 --> 00:49:40,287
our wrists up or down.

1057
00:49:40,307 --> 00:49:44,230
And we're going to try and, actually try and squeeze your fists.

1058
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,371
Like, see how far you get if you squeeze your fists.

1059
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,193
And see like where your fists start to open up

1060
00:49:49,213 --> 00:49:51,494
when you're kind of moving up and down.

1061
00:50:03,202 --> 00:50:06,904
So you're going to feel it all along your forearms.

1062
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:09,066
And you might feel a little bit on the underside too.

1063
00:50:10,504 --> 00:50:12,866
Yeah. Now let's go side to side now.

1064
00:50:13,826 --> 00:50:15,927
So same idea. We're going to block with our elbows and try to

1065
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,950
not windshield wiper it too much. Let's just see how much we can get

1066
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,131
ask of our wrists.

1067
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,096
Good. Now let's like make circles. And again, let's try and

1068
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:33,278
see how little movement we can borrow from our elbows when we do this.

1069
00:50:39,962 --> 00:50:40,743
Let's go back the other way.

1070
00:50:40,763 --> 00:50:49,429
Do you want our warm up according to the guide?

1071
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:52,531
Yeah, yeah, because if not, we know that we're borrowing movement from.

1072
00:50:53,071 --> 00:50:53,612
So we're doing.

1073
00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:54,692
Alright, good.

1074
00:50:55,033 --> 00:50:56,113
So let's go ahead and shake all that out.

1075
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:58,995
So, I do that for time usually.

1076
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:00,857
I'll do 20 to 30 seconds each when I warm up.

1077
00:51:00,877 --> 00:51:01,837
And this is the kind of thing that,

1078
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:03,819
this, you know, if you go to the gym, whatever you do,

1079
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:04,899
this can replace your warm up.

1080
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:05,340
You know what I mean?

1081
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:09,327
This is when we start moving into what we call movement prep versus warming up.

1082
00:51:09,347 --> 00:51:13,568
Because this is actually good for your joints versus just like jumping on the treadmill for three minutes

1083
00:51:13,628 --> 00:51:18,089
or going for a sprint and not really priming the nervous system in the joints.

1084
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:22,390
So let's do the lower body real quick and then I'll give you guys some time back.

1085
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,110
How much time do we have left actually?

1086
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,691
Oh sweet!

1087
00:51:27,391 --> 00:51:28,851
Actually not sweet, that means I'm behind.

1088
00:51:29,532 --> 00:51:30,732
So this is my favorite one.

1089
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,865
So we're going to start by tilting our hips back and forward.

1090
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:38,446
And one of the things that we tend to do when we do this move

1091
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:40,046
is because we all have chronically tight hips,

1092
00:51:40,526 --> 00:51:44,207
is we tend to kind of like sit back and kind of break forward.

1093
00:51:44,607 --> 00:51:46,428
What we want to do is actually, so if we want,

1094
00:51:46,468 --> 00:51:47,828
so we put our hands on our hips.

1095
00:51:48,448 --> 00:51:50,309
And if you watch how my hands, what my hands do.

1096
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:55,590
So I'm not really pushing my hips out of plane.

1097
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,790
I'm just kind of tilting forward and back.

1098
00:51:58,711 --> 00:51:59,691
So let's try that a bit.

1099
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:09,030
If you're like me and have chronically tight hips,

1100
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:10,891
this will be a life saver.

1101
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:15,872
All right.

1102
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:17,572
So now we're going to go side to side.

1103
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,432
And this is the one that loses everybody, which is fine,

1104
00:52:19,452 --> 00:52:21,933
because it's kind of a mind-eff.

1105
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:26,234
So we're going to take, let's start with our right leg.

1106
00:52:26,914 --> 00:52:28,834
And we're going to straighten our right knee.

1107
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,015
We're going to bend our left knee.

1108
00:52:31,675 --> 00:52:33,815
And notice how that pushes my right hip up.

1109
00:52:34,796 --> 00:52:36,316
So if I switch that.

1110
00:52:36,901 --> 00:52:38,262
Notice how my other hip moves up.

1111
00:52:38,663 --> 00:52:39,964
So watch what I'm not doing.

1112
00:52:40,004 --> 00:52:41,225
So I'm not doing this.

1113
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:43,968
I'm not driving away from my hip.

1114
00:52:44,048 --> 00:52:48,812
I'm just driving my hip straight up off the posted leg.

1115
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:50,094
So let's try that.

1116
00:52:50,114 --> 00:52:53,757
Can you do the vertical stretch again?

1117
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:53,857
Sure.

1118
00:52:53,897 --> 00:52:56,640
So start by straightening your right leg, your right knee.

1119
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,844
Now bend your left knee and let your right hip rise.

1120
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:07,335
And then as you reverse that, so as you straighten your left leg and bend your right knee, let your left hip rise.

1121
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,361
Yeah, all right, yeah, you guys got this. Awesome.

1122
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:17,704
So now we're going to put those two together. So we're going to go,

1123
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:19,866
so we're going to right hip up,

1124
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:22,048
and we're going to tilt back,

1125
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:24,370
and go left hip up,

1126
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:26,552
and we're going to tilt forward.

1127
00:53:27,973 --> 00:53:29,675
Let's try and smooth that out.

1128
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:33,870
You guys are horrible dancers. This will fix you right up.

1129
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:37,892
You guys got your party scheduled for Thursday, right?

1130
00:53:37,912 --> 00:53:38,913
Like everybody knows where we're going, right?

1131
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:41,975
Now let's reverse that.

1132
00:53:49,379 --> 00:53:50,900
It's only weird if you make eye contact, I promise.

1133
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:56,803
HR, oh God. Do we have HR for GDC? Am I allowed to say that?

1134
00:53:56,823 --> 00:53:59,625
Alright, good. So let's move down to the knees.

1135
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:01,687
You guys have all seen this movement before.

1136
00:54:01,827 --> 00:54:03,027
It's oldie, goodie.

1137
00:54:03,068 --> 00:54:03,968
We call it the Tootsie Roll.

1138
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:05,528
We're going to add.

1139
00:54:05,568 --> 00:54:06,989
So it's basically, it's this thing right here.

1140
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:10,090
So we're going to modify this a little bit

1141
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,371
and make it a little bit of an ankle exercise too.

1142
00:54:12,971 --> 00:54:16,012
So take a slightly wider than hip-width stance

1143
00:54:17,092 --> 00:54:21,233
and try this out and see how it feels.

1144
00:54:21,253 --> 00:54:22,754
Some of us don't have great ankles

1145
00:54:22,814 --> 00:54:23,634
and I don't want to even get hurt.

1146
00:54:23,674 --> 00:54:27,515
So try to roll up onto the insides of your feet

1147
00:54:27,795 --> 00:54:29,056
and let your knees kind of vagus.

1148
00:54:30,102 --> 00:54:32,304
Now if you can hold that, awesome.

1149
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:36,527
Drive your knees forward, come up onto your toes just a little bit.

1150
00:54:36,547 --> 00:54:42,272
Then roll your knees outside, come onto the outside of your foot.

1151
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:46,016
And then push back onto your ankles.

1152
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:48,558
Good, let's just smooth that out.

1153
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:51,240
Awesome.

1154
00:54:57,183 --> 00:55:02,504
And again, try and be mindful. Try and feel where your balance is, where it isn't.

1155
00:55:03,204 --> 00:55:05,425
Try and feel your knees, and let's reverse that too.

1156
00:55:09,285 --> 00:55:09,685
Awesome.

1157
00:55:15,727 --> 00:55:19,607
All right, last one. Ankles. Super easy. We're just going to hold one foot up,

1158
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:24,648
right, left, I don't care which one. We're going to point, flex, point.

1159
00:55:25,797 --> 00:55:28,077
Flex. And let's just hang out here for a bit. Yeah.

1160
00:55:29,498 --> 00:55:31,818
At your own pace. Like I said, get what you need to out of it.

1161
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:44,582
Good. And now we're going to scoop. So we're going to scoop to the inside,

1162
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:51,383
to the outside, inside. Same idea. Your own pace. Get what you need to out of it.

1163
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:58,155
Yeah, it's almost like a roll.

1164
00:55:58,715 --> 00:56:00,857
So you're not actually rotating side to side.

1165
00:56:00,897 --> 00:56:03,479
It's like, if there's kind of like a z-axis here,

1166
00:56:03,499 --> 00:56:04,840
you're kind of wanting to twist along that.

1167
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,543
Or whatever axis is forward in your system, I guess.

1168
00:56:11,764 --> 00:56:13,385
Tech art joke, don't laugh, please.

1169
00:56:15,326 --> 00:56:16,447
All right, let's do some circles now.

1170
00:56:26,205 --> 00:56:31,229
And again, this one's interesting because watch where your movement breaks down.

1171
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:36,013
Watch and find for points where you can't necessarily move through smoothly.

1172
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:36,794
And let's go back the other way.

1173
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,081
All right, let's switch feet.

1174
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:49,224
It's my idea. Let's start with the point and flex.

1175
00:56:58,954 --> 00:57:00,654
Let's go side to side, scoops.

1176
00:57:11,477 --> 00:57:15,338
And let's circle one way, whichever one feels right to you.

1177
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:23,361
And back the other way.

1178
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:32,112
All right, good.

1179
00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:32,572
Check it out.

1180
00:57:33,852 --> 00:57:36,713
And it seems super simple, but that's really

1181
00:57:36,773 --> 00:57:37,513
all it takes, you guys.

1182
00:57:37,653 --> 00:57:39,434
I mean, like I said, throw that into the beginning

1183
00:57:39,454 --> 00:57:40,654
of your warm-ups when you go to the gym.

1184
00:57:41,174 --> 00:57:41,954
Use it as cool-down.

1185
00:57:41,974 --> 00:57:43,134
Do it during your day.

1186
00:57:43,154 --> 00:57:45,215
Like I said, I mean, I work out during the day

1187
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:46,335
myself, usually in the afternoon.

1188
00:57:47,055 --> 00:57:48,396
And sometimes it's just this.

1189
00:57:48,456 --> 00:57:51,377
Sometimes I'll just foam roll, just do this for time.

1190
00:57:51,817 --> 00:57:53,297
And yeah, cool.

1191
00:57:53,317 --> 00:57:54,737
So you are now all empowered to take

1192
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:56,478
ownership of your own movement and your own joint health.

1193
00:57:56,778 --> 00:57:58,098
And like I said, it really is that simple.

1194
00:57:58,618 --> 00:57:59,118
So do this.

1195
00:57:59,138 --> 00:58:01,159
In fact, I'm going to challenge you guys to try this.

1196
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:04,507
Every day for a month and see how you feel afterwards.

1197
00:58:05,247 --> 00:58:07,409
And alright, so now I'm going to go back up here.

1198
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:09,030
You're at the important slide.

1199
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,631
The ones you've been waiting for.

1200
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:11,872
That is how to get in touch with me.

1201
00:58:11,952 --> 00:58:13,413
Cause I know you all care.

1202
00:58:14,754 --> 00:58:15,314
And so that's me.

1203
00:58:16,655 --> 00:58:18,116
If you have questions about any of this stuff,

1204
00:58:18,356 --> 00:58:18,896
please hit me up.

1205
00:58:20,057 --> 00:58:21,918
I can talk about this all day and I like to.

1206
00:58:22,579 --> 00:58:25,401
So that's that.

1207
00:58:25,441 --> 00:58:26,882
And we are actually out of time.

1208
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:28,863
So you have to find me in the wrap up room.
