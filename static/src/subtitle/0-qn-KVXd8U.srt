1
00:00:04,936 --> 00:00:09,860
I'm here today from NYU Game Center, I'm a project coordinator there, which means I work

2
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:14,925
on a bunch of projects, mainly I run our grant program.

3
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:19,129
So this is me as a bird.

4
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:25,655
So I run a grant program at NYU, and I'm mainly going to be talking about one grant from New

5
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:26,055
York State.

6
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:33,262
Outside of managing grants, I have a little newsletter called the sportswoman and that's

7
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:36,326
a weekly email that goes out about all the news in women's sports.

8
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:41,292
So if you're interested in that in addition to games, I'll share the link with you later

9
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:43,194
and you can check that out as well.

10
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,116
But first we're going to talk about...

11
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:53,908
So what I'm going to do is take you through three micro case studies about three different

12
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:57,651
schools who got a great state grant.

13
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,634
And then for the second half of the talk I'm going to tell you how you can do some of these

14
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:06,517
things yourselves if you don't have a huge grant from the state or somewhere else.

15
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:11,041
Mostly we wanted to share our budgets.

16
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:15,184
I don't think a lot of grant programs and academic programs obscure those things.

17
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:18,226
So I think it's sort of interesting that all three of these schools have gotten together

18
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,727
and are sharing these things.

19
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:25,191
So I want to share those with you and then give you some tips and show you a lot of cute

20
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:25,451
birds.

21
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:31,060
Okay, so first a quick sort of big picture overview.

22
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:35,742
New York State has a grant program funding digital gaming.

23
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:39,503
So for this grant, three New York State universities

24
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:43,064
have game programs applied for this grant

25
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,365
and they were given money to increase the awareness

26
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:49,406
of the industry inside the state and outside the state.

27
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:52,487
California, you guys have a lot of jobs

28
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:55,007
and a lot of game companies and New York wants those jobs

29
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:56,008
and those game companies.

30
00:01:56,785 --> 00:02:01,429
So we're here to hopefully bring some of those jobs to New York.

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,471
So this is a three-year matching grant.

32
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:07,054
And that means that every dollar that the school spends

33
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:09,196
towards the grant, the state will also spend a dollar.

34
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:10,857
So they did that up to $150.

35
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:17,380
per year. So we were each spending roughly $300,000 a year.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,181
So that's $900,000 total per school and about $2.7 million overall.

37
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:29,443
So the state was really investing in this. It's really important to bring jobs out to New York.

38
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:35,704
Before I tell you about the schools, I wanted to do a shout out to the other schools who are working on this.

39
00:02:35,744 --> 00:02:39,185
So Rob and Jen from RIT, Amanda and Ben from RPI.

40
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:44,783
Judy and Matt, they are New York State contract officers that are really great and helpful.

41
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:49,845
Dylan, Kevin and Colin at NYU, they're the people who work with me on this every day.

42
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:55,808
And then also Gwena and Paul who listen to me fret about talking in front of a room full

43
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:56,148
of people.

44
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:57,368
Okay.

45
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:03,091
So now we're into the fun part of the talk where I briefly explain how does this work.

46
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:09,665
New York State Empire State Development said, okay, we have a lot of money and we want even

47
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:12,586
more money and we want to get that money by bringing games to the state.

48
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:16,227
So they want economic growth and they're trying to do that through games.

49
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:21,869
So our three schools said, hmm, okay, we have a bunch of students who want jobs.

50
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,611
We know the local industries and we could use some money.

51
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:28,732
So we all said, great, we would absolutely love to do that.

52
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:31,293
So, the three of us got this grant,

53
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:34,253
and this is sort of how we felt when we got the grant.

54
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:37,574
We were just like, ooh, money, this is nice.

55
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:39,414
It's pretty exciting to get a grant.

56
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:40,735
You feel like you can do anything.

57
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:44,075
So then, we started working on the grant,

58
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:45,296
and the state's like, all right, great.

59
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,896
We're really excited to have you.

60
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:48,776
You've gotta match all of your spending.

61
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:50,497
We're not gonna just give you money.

62
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:52,657
You gotta send in a bunch of reports.

63
00:03:52,937 --> 00:03:54,137
You're gonna attend a bunch of events.

64
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,558
We want you to create jobs, that's the goal here.

65
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:58,558
You have three years, create a bunch of jobs.

66
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:03,685
And maybe if you can do it, like, get Riot or Blizzard or somebody, get them to move

67
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:04,185
to New York.

68
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:05,806
It's a really cool place.

69
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:06,747
We want them here.

70
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:08,528
Don't you think you can do that?

71
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,950
And we're like, yeah, we've got a bunch of money.

72
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,650
We know everybody.

73
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,330
Let's do this.

74
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,492
But wait a minute.

75
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:15,633
What are those little stars?

76
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:21,279
The little stars are all of the things that happen when you get a grant that you're not

77
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:21,620
ready for.

78
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:24,523
So, for example, there are a lot of spending restrictions.

79
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:26,266
You can't just spend whatever you want.

80
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:30,211
The state tells you you can't spend in certain ways.

81
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,734
Your school tells you you can't spend it in certain ways.

82
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:38,534
So you're working within some certain constraints based on what both of those places say.

83
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:40,715
You spend a lot of time waiting on signatures.

84
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:43,196
Let's see.

85
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:47,237
Sometimes the categories for how you can spend are really specific and you know exactly how

86
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:51,238
you can spend it and other times they're incredibly vague and you're like, can we spend a lot

87
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,058
of money on pizza?

88
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:56,579
Then you spend a lot of money on pizza and the state's like, you can't spend money on

89
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:56,900
pizza.

90
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,021
So, these things happen.

91
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:05,324
It's not always as easy and as danceable as you would like.

92
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:09,787
Things take a lot of time and a lot of paperwork.

93
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:13,729
So how you actually feel when you're managing your grant is more like this.

94
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:14,669
You're just sort of in it.

95
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:18,511
You're like there, trying to do all the paperwork, trying to keep the school happy, trying to

96
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:20,312
keep the state happy, trying to create jobs.

97
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,093
You really are doing a lot of things at once.

98
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:28,479
Okay, so now that I've given you a quick little review about that, I want to tell you about

99
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,139
each of the schools that got the grant.

100
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,561
I'm going to do just a really brief intro on each of the three programs and then tell

101
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:40,982
you what their goals were and how their budgets looked.

102
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:48,064
And the other schools are actually right here in the front, so at the end, during Q&A, if

103
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:51,185
you have questions for them about the specifics, they're here and they can help you out a little

104
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:51,705
better than I can.

105
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,256
Okay, so everyone got to pick their birds, first of all.

106
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:59,141
So NYU, we're the skateboarders.

107
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,243
But we're going to start with RPI.

108
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:02,985
So RPI is in Troy.

109
00:06:03,726 --> 00:06:07,810
Their academic program is the Game Simulation and Arts and Sciences Program.

110
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:10,473
It's an undergrad program, roughly 160 students, 14 faculty.

111
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:18,094
And the goal of the program is to give students a comprehensive understanding of interactive

112
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:24,419
digital media, including games from a really wide range of perspectives.

113
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:27,461
So their goals for the grant.

114
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,893
Their main goal was to provide a three-step path for students to enter the game industry

115
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,314
while retaining local talent.

116
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:38,197
So we want people who are here, going to school, to stay here and get jobs.

117
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:42,140
And we want the people who are already here to also stay and grow that community.

118
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:48,304
So they did that through incubator programs, local partnerships, economic development partnerships,

119
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:51,106
and increased presence at events.

120
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:53,247
You're going to see that a lot of these are similar.

121
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:57,028
This first breakdown of spending,

122
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,749
though, is actually sort of an outlier.

123
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:03,230
So as you can see, they spent the most amount

124
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,510
on an incubator program.

125
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,851
Other programs in this grant are running an incubator as well,

126
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:12,652
but RPI is putting the most effort behind their incubator

127
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:13,213
out of the three.

128
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:16,193
The other big categories are salary and fringe,

129
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:18,274
and that's sort of a recurring thing.

130
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,435
You need people to run these programs.

131
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,613
And so that's where a lot of spending for all three of us is going.

132
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:28,256
And then the next big category was community partnerships.

133
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:32,039
And you can speak with them a little bit more about those because I think that they're pretty

134
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:32,960
specific and interesting.

135
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:35,522
Equipment and travel are other things.

136
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:37,384
Okay.

137
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:40,247
For RIT, they're in Rochester, New York.

138
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,409
They run the RIT Magic Center.

139
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:46,853
And there's an undergrad and graduate program in interactive games and media.

140
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:49,135
And they're a little bit larger.

141
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:53,231
I believe admitting 220 students per year.

142
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,112
Yeah, okay, great.

143
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:57,634
And so they have a university-wide research center

144
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,257
that's more multidisciplinary and entrepreneurial.

145
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:04,880
So they're all about creating and sustaining careers,

146
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,962
growing the industry in that center,

147
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:08,123
separate from this grant.

148
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:11,786
And they focus a lot on digital media education

149
00:08:11,886 --> 00:08:12,406
and production.

150
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:17,410
So that focus on education means that they collaborate

151
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,911
with a lot of.

152
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,611
K-12 institutions, schools and after school programs.

153
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:26,294
They also spend a bunch of time with entrepreneurial activity.

154
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:29,296
Similarly, they want to keep their local talent,

155
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:31,677
and they want to grow the businesses.

156
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:34,059
So their bigger goals.

157
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:37,945
We're changing public perception around games.

158
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:41,148
And so just telling people, games are here.

159
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,350
They're not just something you should play with.

160
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,911
They're really important in a lot of other ways.

161
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,793
And transforming industry attitudes,

162
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,915
saying New York State is great.

163
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,677
California is sunny, but New York is also really wonderful.

164
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:55,399
Bring your business here.

165
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,881
If you're from California, let me

166
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:58,282
know at the end of this if you're convinced.

167
00:08:58,462 --> 00:08:59,223
We have another deck.

168
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:01,725
OK.

169
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:04,852
So RIT, this one is a little different.

170
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:12,334
Most of the spending is going towards salary and fringe, but a huge chunk is on things

171
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:13,094
like events and travel.

172
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,075
So GDC is one of those things.

173
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:16,456
They're here every year.

174
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:17,456
They've got a really great booth.

175
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:18,956
Be sure to check it out.

176
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:25,258
In addition, they've got some money going towards marketing and also students and contractors.

177
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:28,179
Finally, the game center.

178
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:28,800
This is where I'm from.

179
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,020
We're in Brooklyn.

180
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,880
It's really great.

181
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:36,084
We have an MFA and a BFA program, and we have roughly 200 students in both of those programs,

182
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,305
and 10 faculty.

183
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:43,488
And we are dedicated to the exploration of games as a cultural practice, of a cultural

184
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:45,489
form, sorry, and game design as a creative practice.

185
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:47,648
and our goals.

186
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:50,591
So again, these are very similar.

187
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:55,715
We wanted to create a more sustainable game ecosystem in New York City.

188
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:57,277
That's an expensive place to live.

189
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:58,278
We have a lot of indies.

190
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,621
So we wanted to sort of help support those indies and help them grow.

191
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:05,424
We want to help our students start and work in those companies.

192
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,447
We also have been working on tax incentives.

193
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:13,310
That's an important thing to move a large company out.

194
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,751
You need to have tax incentives.

195
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:16,213
So we've been working a little bit on that.

196
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:19,915
And also we really wanted to bring together local stakeholders.

197
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:24,318
The city is a really big, busy place and it's hard to get people together, so one of the

198
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:27,980
things we did was we started an advisory board.

199
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:32,763
We also grew our incubator, so we opened it up to the public.

200
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:37,726
It was previously just open to NYU students, so now it's open to other folks in New York

201
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:39,547
State and around the country.

202
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:48,372
We also have improved our career services, and we continue to grow and expand our free

203
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:48,953
public events.

204
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,461
So our grant spending looks like this.

205
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:57,806
Again, a lot of money into salary and fringe, and also our incubator.

206
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:03,151
So we have a summer incubator that's three months funding for teams.

207
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:05,373
We put a lot of money into our events.

208
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:08,016
We like to host a bunch of different events.

209
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:08,857
We have a conference.

210
00:11:09,457 --> 00:11:15,663
We have an artist no-quarter event, which is commissioned artists.

211
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,387
And then we have a bunch of weekly playtest events and a bunch of stuff like that.

212
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,709
And also GDC.

213
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:24,410
We have a booth, too.

214
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,851
Actually, all three schools have a booth.

215
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:27,051
So you should check them out.

216
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:32,976
So here's the spinning side by side so you can sort of get a better idea of who's spinning

217
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:34,117
what and where.

218
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,360
Let's leave this up for just a second.

219
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:50,067
Okay, so for a few takeaways, all the schools, we had similar goals.

220
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:53,009
In the end, we wanted to bring companies out to New York and

221
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:54,710
make people more aware of games.

222
00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:58,093
So there's no right way.

223
00:11:58,113 --> 00:12:00,655
I think we all sort of approached it similarly, but

224
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:04,217
in ways that made sense for our individual institutions and communities.

225
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:06,019
So there was no right way.

226
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:11,895
Another thing, incubators are really popular, not only within games, but New York State

227
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:14,836
has a bunch of incubator-related initiatives.

228
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:19,777
So right now I think a lot of people are sort of thinking about that structure as a way

229
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:20,717
to grow companies.

230
00:12:22,218 --> 00:12:23,978
And finally, grants are not as easy as you think.

231
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,420
It is nice to hear you're getting a bunch of money, but there's no golden ticket with

232
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:29,700
grants.

233
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:35,630
So getting a huge grant doesn't necessarily mean you're getting an extreme makeover, though

234
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,193
RIT did get a really new, nice, cool building.

235
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:45,117
I don't have a picture of it, but you can check it out.

236
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:45,757
It's very nice.

237
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:47,299
Okay.

238
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:52,603
So now we're going to switch gears and I'm going to give you four sort of tips on what

239
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:54,304
you can do if you don't have a grant.

240
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:57,546
It's maybe not a huge problem.

241
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,458
The first thing that I would recommend if you are a university is to get some university

242
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:03,879
support.

243
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:08,606
There are three specific offices at NYU that I had no idea about and had never worked with

244
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:09,567
until we got this grant.

245
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,714
And those are governmental affairs, sponsored projects, and the development office.

246
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:19,477
I did a little test before this to just sort of see how easy it was to track down who these

247
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:21,018
departments are at other institutions.

248
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,599
So I just picked a couple of schools I don't really know much about.

249
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:29,461
I picked Carnegie Mellon, American University, and just Googled those school names plus department

250
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:29,521
of...

251
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,642
or sponsored programs, and I found them right away.

252
00:13:35,123 --> 00:13:39,026
So that's super easily Google-able, at least for big schools.

253
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:43,190
So I would say get in touch with those folks.

254
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,173
When you get in touch with them, they can sort of give you the lay of the land in terms

255
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:50,536
of what's going on locally with your state government or your local government.

256
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:56,773
Maybe there's like a games or media or technology initiative in the area that you, you know, haven't heard of.

257
00:13:57,513 --> 00:14:01,616
You can also tell them to like keep an eye out for those things so you don't have to do that work of like

258
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:07,039
always paying attention to what's going on. You can have like backup, somebody else looking into it.

259
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:11,261
The Sponsored Programs and Development Office, once we talked to them, they started

260
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:16,804
reaching out to places they thought might be interested in sponsoring game programs.

261
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:18,084
So that's another option.

262
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:20,465
If you don't know exactly where to go for funding,

263
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:22,725
those resources exist in most institutions

264
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:24,685
and you can use them, or you should use them.

265
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:25,666
I would totally recommend it.

266
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:28,386
From my experience, they're all really nice,

267
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:30,246
really smart people who just want to help you.

268
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:34,527
So first of all, number one, university support, use it.

269
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:39,968
Number two is to map out and make connections

270
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:41,268
with your local stakeholders.

271
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:44,089
This has been super important for us at the Game Center

272
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:45,889
and I think at the other schools as well.

273
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:53,575
In New York City, there are like two or three other university programs with game programs.

274
00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:57,257
And usually we're like, those are our competitors, we don't want to talk to them.

275
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:03,022
But once we started talking to them, we realized that their students were having the same trouble like finding jobs locally as ours were.

276
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:10,328
So talking to other universities helped us sort of like figure out that all students in the area were having trouble with this,

277
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:14,811
and we needed to better prepare them to look elsewhere, or we needed to like...

278
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:17,614
bring the companies to us.

279
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:20,317
Other examples are alumni.

280
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:23,421
They are students who have experience finding jobs.

281
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:30,875
have mini interviews with them and see how they did it and what they would recommend.

282
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:37,919
Similar to the university offices, local government sometimes has good tips, and it's great to

283
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:43,242
have them on your side because they can sort of help advocate for you when they see an

284
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:46,364
opportunity that you wouldn't have access to otherwise.

285
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:52,107
So this list can be like dozens of other places, but these are some of the most common ones

286
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:55,770
that I think all of us have tried to build relationships with.

287
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:00,994
All right, number three, I think this is actually the most important one,

288
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,236
so I'll probably spend a little bit longer on it.

289
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,440
One of the things that we did at the Game Center was we created an advisory board.

290
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,683
This we started with the local stakeholders.

291
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:15,528
We figured out who's important in these places, who are we not talking to?

292
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:20,893
And we built this board of advisors, and we invited them to regular meetings.

293
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,536
And at those meetings, we did something called field reports.

294
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:31,418
And you can structure this based on what sort of needs your group has.

295
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:36,440
But what we did was everyone would sit down, and the first thing that we would do is we

296
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:41,023
would go around and ask each other, what has surprised or frustrated you lately?

297
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:42,683
And you're only allowed to say one thing.

298
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:47,405
And so we would go around and we had people from everything from indies to

299
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:56,129
AAA companies, media companies, game journalists, other schools. We had like a pretty wide range of people, Games4Change and nonprofits.

300
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:03,353
We had everybody together and when we did these field reports just asking like what's been surprising to you in games or what's been frustrating for you?

301
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:09,397
We found a lot of common ground, and also it sort of exposed us to places we weren't familiar with.

302
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:20,225
I don't really know, as someone who works at an academic institution, that tax breaks are super important for a AAA studio.

303
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:23,488
The folks we worked with from Take-Two were saying,

304
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:28,532
yeah, we send a bunch of our stuff out to California to be done because there are tax breaks there, or to Canada.

305
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:33,902
We all learned a lot about what people were struggling with.

306
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:38,223
We sort of built relationships with each other.

307
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:41,244
And once we started learning what everybody was struggling with,

308
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:43,685
it was much easier to sort of make action plans.

309
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,526
So that's what we started to do next.

310
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,587
We started making some plans of action.

311
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:53,429
So one thing we realized was that New York City specifically

312
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:57,911
has some really good funding and support for film programs,

313
00:17:58,091 --> 00:18:00,392
but not necessarily for other types of media.

314
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:05,614
So we have been working for like all three years.

315
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:12,414
Developing a good relationship with New York City's office of media and entertainment.

316
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:14,755
And it's taken so much time.

317
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:16,815
People change jobs.

318
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,796
People forget about meetings.

319
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:20,417
We forget about meetings.

320
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:21,897
It took a long time.

321
00:18:21,997 --> 00:18:27,119
So once you've got your advisory board, start making plans and then start putting those

322
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:27,799
plans into action.

323
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,120
I know it sounds super basic, but if you can just sort of hold yourselves and your communities

324
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,281
accountable for these things, you can get people together and you can sort of like...

325
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:41,865
Find that one person at the governmental office who wants to answer your email and have coffee

326
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:42,166
with you.

327
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:44,288
All right.

328
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:48,151
So once you do the plans of action, yeah, you got to know it's going to take some time.

329
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:53,616
Probably the idea that you had in your head of how this is going to work out is not how

330
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:56,078
it's going to work out, similarly to when you have a grant.

331
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,983
And things will probably take you on a different path, which is not always a bad thing.

332
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:01,924
It can be really great.

333
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:03,465
Okay.

334
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:09,128
In conclusion, money can help, but community building and goal setting once you have a

335
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:11,889
community can actually get you pretty far.

336
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:18,452
And once you've established a board or, you know, a regular sort of meeting group, it's

337
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:21,853
a lot easier to get funding because you've sort of already built that structure up and

338
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:23,114
you have stuff to work off of.

339
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:29,737
You've sort of proven that you know what's at stake and how to get there.

340
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:33,134
All right, so that is the end of my talk.

341
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:33,915
Thank you.

342
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:34,756
It was really fast.

343
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:35,717
There's so much more.

344
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:38,741
I think I could probably spend the entire talk just

345
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:40,283
explaining how the grant worked.

346
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:46,464
So I guess I'm going to leave the rest of the time.

347
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:49,787
We've got about nine, 10 minutes, about 10 minutes

348
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,228
for questions, if you have questions.

349
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:53,550
We've also got the other schools here.

350
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,392
I won't make you come up here, but they're here.

351
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:58,394
So if you want to chat with them about their specific programs,

352
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:00,396
please do that.

353
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,397
I think they'd probably be really excited to chat with you.

354
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,099
And then finally, my last plug is

355
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,782
for the Sportswoman, which is a sports newsletter, again,

356
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:08,482
about women.

357
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:09,323
It's great.

358
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:10,063
It's very fun.

359
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:12,045
Thank you.

360
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:18,633
All right, we got a couple of questions.

361
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:21,354
And if you can, I don't have the paper with me,

362
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:22,854
but I think you're supposed to introduce yourself.

363
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:24,555
So just say like your first name.

364
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:25,235
OK.

365
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:28,956
Hi, I'm Andre Thomas from Texas A&M. Great talk.

366
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:29,597
Thank you so much.

367
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:33,198
Have you measured the effectiveness of this program?

368
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:35,679
How effective actually has it been?

369
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:37,580
How many companies have been created?

370
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,000
How many?

371
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:41,385
Big publishers have moved to New York.

372
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:42,847
Do you have some data on that?

373
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,349
Yeah, that's a super great question.

374
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:47,073
When I was putting this together, I was like, oh my

375
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:48,334
gosh, there's so much more I should add.

376
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:50,076
And that was actually the first thing that I.

377
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,282
We do have that.

378
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:56,104
I don't have a slide for that right now.

379
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:03,371
I guess I would say that in terms of measurable success, New York State at least thinks it

380
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,454
has been a worthy investment.

381
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:10,899
The grant ended in 2018, but now all three schools have been refunded as centers of excellence,

382
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:14,443
which is basically like double the funding for...

383
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:22,825
We have continued funding from the state, so I think they've seen that we are sort of

384
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:23,705
making improvements.

385
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:31,607
I don't have the exact number of jobs created on me, but if you email us, I can put together

386
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:32,227
a few slides.

387
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:36,908
It might take us a week for me to get in touch with everybody and get all this info, but

388
00:21:37,348 --> 00:21:42,069
we do report that on our reports to the state so I can get that together and I can put those

389
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,449
up on Twitter, those slides with those numbers and stuff.

390
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,716
So far, no AAA company has notified me that they're moving here, but tell them we're waiting.

391
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:57,104
Hi, my name is Chris, and I'm trying to do exactly what

392
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:00,602
You folks did in my part of the UK.

393
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:06,868
I wanted to ask you, how did you manage expectations at the beginning of this collaboration between

394
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:07,548
the universities?

395
00:22:07,608 --> 00:22:12,413
Because much like in the UK, universities here are their own and financial corporations.

396
00:22:12,994 --> 00:22:18,779
So how did you decide who took Riot if they decide to come today to New York and so on?

397
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:25,286
Yeah, great question. I think we really lucked out. The three of us, the three schools, we all get along really well.

398
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:30,430
We're operating as individual institutions, so we all have our own sort of goals and ways of doing things,

399
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:33,533
but we've all been really flexible in terms of coming together and like...

400
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:40,478
working together and making sure we've got like, I send out the invites to their community

401
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:42,319
events and they send out ours and stuff like that.

402
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,543
So I don't know if we really set up expectations, we just sort of like, I think you should set

403
00:22:48,563 --> 00:22:52,766
up expectations, but I think we just sort of naturally were excited to work together.

404
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:56,067
There's another part of your question.

405
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:01,607
And it is, oh, if Riot decided to come, how would we decide?

406
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,849
I think Riot would probably decide where they were going.

407
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,172
Each of our parts of the state are very different

408
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:10,795
in terms of the population

409
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,876
and what sort of housing is available

410
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:15,038
and what sort of infrastructure for companies is available.

411
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:17,040
So I think probably that would fall to the company.

412
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,182
And I think any of us would be super stoked

413
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:22,124
if a company moved into any of our towns.

414
00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:24,406
So I think since we're all really excited

415
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:26,267
and we would consider it a win.

416
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:29,896
If any of us had that sort of success.

417
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,583
So I think it's not particularly competitive, it's more collaborative.

418
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:33,987
Okay, thank you.

419
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:34,569
Yeah.

420
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:41,219
Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a program director for a middle school in Dallas Fort Worth.

421
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:46,062
And so I'm coming here as a researcher, but also coming as an interested admin to figure

422
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:47,683
out how I can expand our program.

423
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:52,806
And so I'm interested in figuring out how we can start creating some university partnerships

424
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:58,689
at the middle school level from a public educational institution and to connect that with privatized

425
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,431
educational research institutions or collegiate partners.

426
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:07,479
partners or just to expand our network so that we can keep our growth because we received a grant, but now we don't have

427
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,084
additional funding any longer besides what we have to maintain salaries.

428
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:12,011
Sure.

429
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:12,851
OK.

430
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:13,452
Well, that's great.

431
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:15,612
I'm sure your students are very excited.

432
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:16,613
Yeah.

433
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:17,433
Let's see.

434
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:20,034
Our university works, at least our department,

435
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:25,015
works less with elementary, middle school,

436
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:25,796
and high school programs.

437
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:27,376
We don't work with them a ton.

438
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:29,817
But I know one of the other schools does do that.

439
00:24:29,897 --> 00:24:30,937
Yeah, Ben is shaking his head.

440
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:33,718
So I would say chat with these guys

441
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:35,779
afterwards because they have more experience working

442
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,079
with them.

443
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:36,699
All right.

444
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:37,019
Great.

445
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:37,540
Thank you so much.

446
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:37,740
Yeah.

447
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:44,077
Hi, I'm Juno Moro from the City University of New York.

448
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,299
Oh, you're a neighbor.

449
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:53,627
So I was wondering, so we have nearly 400 students in our program and two full-time

450
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:54,729
faculty members and no staff.

451
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:00,173
I was wondering if you had any recommendations for grants if we don't have money to match

452
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:02,234
funding for a public school.

453
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:02,975
I don't know if you do.

454
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,676
It's a very different situation.

455
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:07,318
Yeah, that is a good question.

456
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:12,822
Off the top of my head, for getting grants, I would say...

457
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:19,644
I mean, you could also check out the, I'm sure like CUNY, the CUNY schools have some

458
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:20,985
sort of like governmental affairs.

459
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:25,367
This stuff is happening in New York State, so I would imagine there are some, I know

460
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:31,229
like we could put you in touch with the folks, at least in New York State, who work with

461
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:36,711
like the sort of like grants and incubator programs and like accelerators for that sort

462
00:25:36,731 --> 00:25:37,031
of stuff.

463
00:25:40,212 --> 00:25:46,335
I don't know if I have something off the top of my head, but maybe your school is someone

464
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:53,178
who we should get into our mix of advisory board members, because I don't have an answer

465
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:56,340
for that right now, but I imagine there is some resource available.

466
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:56,960
Sorry.

467
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,681
It's okay.

468
00:25:57,701 --> 00:25:58,141
Thank you.

469
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,270
Hi, my name is Victor.

470
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:08,916
Do you have any international programs, partnerships?

471
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:17,725
I am a professor at Brazil, and I already

472
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:21,729
have contact with incubators.

473
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:27,642
that may help create game development studios.

474
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:30,425
But the problem there is the,

475
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:33,448
well, there are plenty of problems there

476
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:38,834
to create a business there, game business there.

477
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:42,679
So sometimes it's better for us to create something.

478
00:26:43,557 --> 00:26:43,657
in

479
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:44,078
any way.

480
00:26:44,178 --> 00:26:44,498
Thank you.

481
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:45,239
Thank you.

482
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:08,259
But I think to the extent that we have those sort of relationships,

483
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,062
it's more of a we'll travel somewhere and give a talk, or

484
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:16,646
we'll invite people to come be a visiting scholar in our program.

485
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:21,450
I don't know much and haven't really worked on those sorts of partnerships.

486
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,013
But again, we could totally talk about it and see what you're looking for.

487
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:30,035
Yeah, we'll be open to negotiate something.

488
00:27:30,055 --> 00:27:31,716
Yeah, we talk, yeah, definitely.

489
00:27:31,736 --> 00:27:34,418
We're happy to listen to where other folks are,

490
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:35,699
what other folks are working on.

491
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,740
So yeah, we can again chat afterwards.

492
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,641
I can give you my card and we can maybe follow up

493
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,602
on email or something or later at the conference.

494
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:43,683
Great, thank you.

495
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,484
All right, I think we have time for one more.

496
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:52,268
Howdy, I'm Terry from AIE, Uber at the Seattle campus.

497
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:55,069
I just wanted to know, or rather,

498
00:27:57,689 --> 00:28:00,092
What do you feel like you get most out of your advisory board?

499
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:02,476
And you mentioned that putting together one was very useful.

500
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:03,417
We have one.

501
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:07,242
But my colleagues and I always wonder about how

502
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:08,183
to get the most out of them.

503
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:11,067
We're not sure how to guide them to do that.

504
00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:14,838
So that's a great question.

505
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:18,999
I think we, so our advisory board has been really useful,

506
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,700
like I said, in those check-in meetings

507
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,441
where we sort of do the field reports.

508
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:25,842
Doing the field reports sort of creates,

509
00:28:26,842 --> 00:28:29,203
I don't know if it's quite like an emotional, like...

510
00:28:29,904 --> 00:28:34,287
connection with everyone, but it's sort of you get it all on the same page because you know you're struggling with similar things

511
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:36,989
Or you can at least empathize with other people's struggles

512
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:44,516
And so I think that has really that sort of helped bring our advisory board together at that level and from there

513
00:28:44,596 --> 00:28:47,478
It was a lot easier to advocate with and for each other

514
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:53,944
And it sort of just like got into people's brains when they'd be like, oh, okay. I know games for change is looking for

515
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:54,564
school

516
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:54,724
program.

517
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:56,786
We need to remember to send them to the Games4Change folks.

518
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:58,969
I think having regular meetings will create better relationships

519
00:28:59,009 --> 00:28:59,469
between people.

520
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:01,211
I think for us, that has turned into being, you know,

521
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:01,591
more like a team.

522
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:20,947
So, I guess that's sort of how it works.

523
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:25,669
And so I would just recommend, I mean, you could try something like the field reports

524
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,989
and see if that sort of helps connect people a little bit better.

525
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,911
I think we've sort of found, like, when people were doing it, they, like...

526
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:37,033
When people were like willingly showing up, that is when it worked better.

527
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:38,934
When it wasn't like, okay, time for the meeting.

528
00:29:39,554 --> 00:29:42,335
But when we were like, all right, we're having a meeting Wednesday night, join us if you

529
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:47,138
can and when they were showing up on their own accord, that is when we sort of knew that

530
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:49,259
they were all in it for each other.

531
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,161
I guess that's what I would say.

532
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:52,321
Okay.

533
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:52,941
I think we are out of time.

534
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:55,222
Thanks for coming.

535
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:55,822
Thank you.

536
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:56,203
Thank you.

537
00:29:56,243 --> 00:29:56,483
Thank you.

538
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:57,323
Thank you.

539
00:29:57,343 --> 00:29:57,523
Thank you.

540
00:29:57,543 --> 00:29:57,723
Thank you.
