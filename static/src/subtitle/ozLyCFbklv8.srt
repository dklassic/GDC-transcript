1
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:11,944
Good morning. Welcome to GDC 2019. How you all doing? Give me a big yeah.

2
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,737
That is a lot bigger than it's going to be in five days' time.

3
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:20,458
I'm really impressed by your enthusiasm.

4
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,138
Thank you so much for coming to see this talk today.

5
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:26,559
It's something that's incredibly close to my heart,

6
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:29,299
something that I'm exceptionally passionate about,

7
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,980
as you will very much see over the next hour.

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,100
And thank you to GDC and the Narrative Summit

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,441
for allowing me to talk about this.

10
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:40,361
It's something that I think is an incredibly important topic,

11
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,082
and I'm so...

12
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:46,304
thrilled that we're being given the platform to actually discuss these really, really important

13
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:47,125
issues with you.

14
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:52,348
Thank you to the developers whose games I showcase in a variety of videos in this talk.

15
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:56,951
In particular, Corey Barlog from Santa Monica Studio, who actually sat down with me and

16
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:00,433
talked about Kratos from the God of War series, so I was really, really grateful for that.

17
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:07,312
My name is Dr Jennifer Hazel. I've been a medical doctor for about eight years now.

18
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:13,740
I practiced in the UK and then I did emergency medicine in Australia and last year I moved

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,361
to New Zealand.

20
00:01:14,932 --> 00:01:17,473
and I've been practicing psychiatry for a few years now.

21
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,694
It's literally the most rewarding thing

22
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:22,475
I've ever done in my life.

23
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:27,036
The absolute privilege of being able to help people

24
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:30,557
who are at their most vulnerable when they've been shunned

25
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,638
and had the doors shut and rejected by the rest of society

26
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,659
is a fulfillment that I can't possibly describe

27
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,480
and it brings me joy every day,

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,901
which is why I'm so passionate about this.

29
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,141
And it's also why I co-founded Checkpoint.

30
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:50,085
We're an international non-profit organization that provides resources for the mental health

31
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,245
of the gaming community.

32
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:53,006
We raise awareness.

33
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:58,970
We aim to reduce stigma, which is a lot of what this talk is about, and we actually create

34
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,493
and distribute mental health resources for people who are very vulnerable and in need.

35
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:07,254
I just want to take a moment.

36
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:09,175
We are New Zealand.

37
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:14,592
organisation and I just want to take a very brief moment to extend my

38
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:19,396
extreme regret and sorrow for what has happened in Christchurch over the last few days.

39
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:25,002
Thank you for bearing with me while I got that out there.

40
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:29,004
I've gone the wrong way, excuse me.

41
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:32,506
I always put a content warning at the beginning of my talks.

42
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:37,288
We are obviously going to be speaking about mental illness over the next hour, but that

43
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:42,130
also includes themes of trauma and suicide, which is very important to specifically raise.

44
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:46,032
If you actually need to get up and go, or if you need to take a break, put your headphones

45
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:48,794
in, whatever you need to do, no one's going to call you out on it, you are free to do

46
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,975
whatever you need to do to keep yourself safe.

47
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:53,396
You're the most important person in the world and you're

48
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:57,358
health and safety is my absolute priority, so don't feel anything negative

49
00:02:57,398 --> 00:03:00,939
about doing what you need to do to look after yourself. Also there's some

50
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,061
swearing in the videos. I'll try and keep my swearing to a minimum. Sometimes on

51
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:10,844
the fly, you know, a little swear will slip out, but mostly it will just be in

52
00:03:10,884 --> 00:03:15,366
the video. So again, not as important as the trigger warning, but you know,

53
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:16,586
something that we need to raise.

54
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:19,008
And a couple of disclaimers.

55
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,069
Please, please, please, please, please don't sue me.

56
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:24,312
I don't represent anything whatsoever except for myself.

57
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:27,295
And everything that I interpret with the videos

58
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:29,356
and the characters in these video games we're about to see

59
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:31,378
is my personal interpretation.

60
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,741
It's not anything that's been said by the developers

61
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,341
themselves.

62
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:37,203
It is literally just opinion.

63
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:41,246
And so we have to kind of make that clear.

64
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:48,625
Mental illness is a legal term, so I'm going to be using the colloquialism, which is probably

65
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:54,267
better described by the phrase mental health issues, because mental illness in and as itself

66
00:03:54,627 --> 00:04:01,289
is in New Zealand defined as a disorder of cognition, volition, perception or mood that

67
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:05,630
actually impairs someone's ability to think or make decisions in a way that can keep them

68
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,751
safe or keep others safe.

69
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:10,672
And so they're the sorts of things we talk about in a legal term.

70
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:15,135
The lines get a bit blurry, so I just want to put that out there.

71
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:18,498
This is the colloquialism of the term mental illness.

72
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,542
And when I am with my clients at work,

73
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:27,865
I tend to function in a symptom-based formulation,

74
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,547
as opposed to a diagnosis-based.

75
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,208
So there's a kind of mixture of the two in here.

76
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:34,011
And what I mean by that is a good example

77
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,332
is the word psychosis.

78
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,894
So someone can experience psychosis.

79
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:41,395
as part of a diagnosis of schizophrenia,

80
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:42,955
so psychosis being the symptom,

81
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,836
schizophrenia being the diagnosis.

82
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:48,336
But they could also have a psychotic depression

83
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:51,057
or they could have a mania with psychotic features

84
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:53,777
as a part of their bipolar affective disorder.

85
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:55,658
And so sometimes I'll say depression,

86
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:57,058
sometimes I'll say psychosis.

87
00:04:57,758 --> 00:04:59,979
That's not to say psychosis is the diagnosis,

88
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:00,619
it's just...

89
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:04,660
easier for me to do it that way and also it makes it more human

90
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,421
for the audience and for the clients that I treat in my everyday life.

91
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:15,422
Of course, this isn't medical advice. If you're affected by anything that we talk about, please

92
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:22,204
do feel free to head to checkpoint.org.com slash global, where we have a variety of resources that

93
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:27,465
are localized to different countries and cities all over the world. We've tried to be quite

94
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:29,866
thorough there and there's also some that are worldwide resources.

95
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:32,767
Ah, spoiler alert.

96
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:34,829
There are a few spoilers in here.

97
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:38,813
I have tried my absolute best to keep any spoilers to the first two hours of the game.

98
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,835
A lot of these I reckon I get a free pass for.

99
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,557
The Last of Us has been out for like six years.

100
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:46,940
Um, you know, life is strange as well.

101
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:47,921
God of War...

102
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:52,005
There's a very, very small amount of it.

103
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:56,409
It's almost all the first bit and there's no big spoilers.

104
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,171
So people get sensitive about that stuff.

105
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,333
I just thought it was important to say.

106
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:04,256
Let's get started.

107
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:09,054
Why is this important? I tweeted the other day that I was going to be doing this talk

108
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:15,939
and I got a response saying, why? Why are you doing this? And it wasn't because they didn't

109
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:21,323
think it was important, it was because they were wondering, what's the point in representing

110
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:28,107
people's pain? It's just going to make it more real for them. And I take that, like, absolutely.

111
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:33,711
I understand that. But there are so many reasons to learn how to do this right.

112
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:40,792
Depending on where you are, which study you read, somewhere between 25 and 50% of people

113
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:47,160
will have a mental health issue at some point in their life. That is somewhere between a quarter

114
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,665
and a half of the people in this room. It might even be more.

115
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:58,078
It feels like a huge statistic to say half of us will have a mental health issue.

116
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,100
It feels disproportionate to what we know about the people around us.

117
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,362
If you think about the four closest people to you, two of them will have a mental health

118
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:07,682
issue at some point in their life.

119
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:09,983
And that seems baffling and it's because we don't.

120
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:11,344
talk about it.

121
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:13,685
And there's a reason we don't talk about it.

122
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:16,687
Mental illness is extremely stigmatized.

123
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:21,290
Surveys have shown that 25% of people would feel uneasy or fearful

124
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:24,552
around someone with a mental illness,

125
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:26,554
and 46% of people, excuse me,

126
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:30,376
believe that a mental illness is an excuse for bad behavior.

127
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:33,718
So, essentially, what we're saying is that

128
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:35,640
a significant proportion of the population

129
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,441
think that half of the people in this room are badly behaved and scary.

130
00:07:39,587 --> 00:07:41,728
No wonder we don't want to come out and say,

131
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,088
I've got a mental illness.

132
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:46,149
No wonder people are keeping this stuff deep down.

133
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,771
The fear of the stigma that they will be facing is huge.

134
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,931
They're scared that they're going to not get jobs,

135
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:54,912
that they're going to fail in their social lives,

136
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:57,112
that people are going to actively discriminate against them.

137
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:59,673
And worse still, the people in this society

138
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:04,375
who suffer a mental illness are 10 times more likely

139
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:06,275
to be a victim of violent crime.

140
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:10,267
10 times more likely.

141
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:12,769
That's ridiculous.

142
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:15,110
That's, to me, absolutely disgusting,

143
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:16,771
and it needs to stop.

144
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,813
These statistics are inherently linked to one another.

145
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,076
The violent crime is because we view, as a society,

146
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:27,658
people who are mentally ill as scary or badly behaved,

147
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:29,920
and therefore inhuman in some way,

148
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,761
that they're deserving of the mistreatment

149
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:34,803
that they're receiving from the rest of society.

150
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:40,466
And so of course people aren't speaking up, of course, that 50% statistic is a surprise.

151
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,348
And because people don't speak up, they don't get help.

152
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:48,411
Two thirds of people will never seek medical professional help for their mental illness.

153
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:54,904
Two-thirds. So you've got 50% of people have a mental illness and two-thirds of those never get help for it.

154
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:57,506
Whether that's because they don't want to actually say,

155
00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:01,470
I'm suffering, or whether they don't even want to, like the stigma is so bad,

156
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,793
they don't even want to acknowledge it within themselves. That's huge.

157
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:08,677
We know that like proper professional treatment helps,

158
00:09:08,817 --> 00:09:11,339
even if it's just a professional saying, you don't need pills.

159
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,582
Here's a very brief course of self-help.

160
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:19,909
like a self-driven CBT, or here's a social worker that can be an advocate for you.

161
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:23,331
Even if it's a simple intervention, we know that we can treat mental illness.

162
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:26,532
We can cure mental illness if you get professional help.

163
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:30,674
So why are people scared to get help?

164
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:33,215
They're scared they're going to get locked up in an asylum,

165
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:35,055
that they're going to put on medication,

166
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:37,316
that is going to change their personality.

167
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:41,798
There's so many things that people believe inherently.

168
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,093
And they're scared of these things because they've seen them.

169
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:48,055
They've seen them in the movies, they've seen them on TV,

170
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:50,297
and they've seen them in video games.

171
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:55,682
A thousand messages screaming at them constantly.

172
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,144
If you're mentally ill, you're terrifying,

173
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,226
and you deserve to be put in a straitjacket,

174
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:02,648
locked up in an asylum, the key thrown away,

175
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,289
and say goodbye to everything you knew.

176
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,771
But it doesn't have to be that way.

177
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:14,486
We know for a fact, we have studies that show that if you represent issues appropriately,

178
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:20,769
empathetically and realistically in media, public perception improves.

179
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,911
People understand the issues better, they're more empathetic for them.

180
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:30,214
That means that rates of violence decrease, respect and sympathy increase

181
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:32,535
and people are more likely to seek help.

182
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:36,977
So we're talking about the most vulnerable people in our society.

183
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:41,219
Sometimes people that can't tell what's real and what isn't.

184
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,561
This is how we protect them when they can't protect themselves.

185
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:49,023
And it is our obligation to do that, I believe.

186
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:53,585
And I assume that you agree as you are sitting here in this room.

187
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:56,406
So thank you for being on this journey with me

188
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:58,967
and thank you for coming because you have the power right now.

189
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:01,388
And that's thrilling to me.

190
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,882
So let's do this right, and I would be pretty terrible

191
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:08,244
if I came and talked to you about all this

192
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:10,185
and didn't tell you how to do it.

193
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,066
That's why we're all here.

194
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:17,691
These guidelines were made as an adaptation

195
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:20,613
of the generic screen and stage guidelines

196
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,315
from an organization in Australia called Mindframe.

197
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:30,146
They advised the media, writers, journalists how to talk about and how to represent mental illness

198
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:33,028
and they didn't have a games section.

199
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:39,913
So with their permission, I took the advice that they give to film and TV

200
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:43,496
and I adapted it to make it more appropriate for game developers

201
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:46,579
using what I know about game design and game development myself.

202
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,703
And because I'm a doctor and we make acronyms out of literally everything...

203
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,594
Have you heard the acronym TLA?

204
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:56,626
It means three letter acronym.

205
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:01,648
So I made an acronym called LAPSES.

206
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:03,770
And someone, I didn't think of this,

207
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,831
this is not my best pun game,

208
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:07,352
but someone on Twitter was like,

209
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:11,355
ah, this is when your lapses in judgment are a good thing.

210
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,596
I liked that a lot.

211
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:16,398
So LAPSES means language.

212
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:18,520
I'm gonna go through these very quickly

213
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,021
because me talking at you doesn't actually prove anything.

214
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:22,302
I wanna show you some videos

215
00:12:22,322 --> 00:12:23,543
and that's what we're all here to see.

216
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,945
But I'll go through them very quickly

217
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:27,506
to kind of just give you an overview.

218
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:45,602
Language is so important. If you're the writer, and it doesn't necessarily need to be the character dialogue, it can be the narrator or even just the in-game text in any form, get the language right and avoid getting it wrong.

219
00:12:45,822 --> 00:12:47,363
And I know that sounds like...

220
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,118
they're the same thing, but then they're not.

221
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:54,703
So we have a number of words in our everyday vocabulary

222
00:12:54,743 --> 00:12:55,604
that are quite loaded.

223
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:59,989
Psycho is my least favorite word in the entire world.

224
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,532
And if you take one thing away from this talk,

225
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:05,615
never use the word psycho again, please.

226
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:07,537
I will go on and on and on about this.

227
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:13,004
Psycho literally means nothing. It could mean psychotic, it could mean psychopath.

228
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:16,989
They're two different things, I will talk about that at length later, but if you

229
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,095
use the word psycho you're essentially labeling anyone who is having a psychosis

230
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:22,737
as being a psychopath.

231
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:26,639
and that is so dangerous because these people are incredibly vulnerable.

232
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,442
Crazy is another good example. I use crazy

233
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:33,864
all the time. Crazy and nuts is just part of my vocabulary. I'm trying to cut

234
00:13:33,884 --> 00:13:36,465
them out but, you know, I accidentally do it a lot of

235
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:41,429
the time. But it comes from the word crazed, meaning out of control,

236
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,631
meaning unpredictable. So in using that word you're actually

237
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:49,093
implying that they're traits that these people have and words do have power.

238
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:56,958
And then you've got the using words right part and a good example for that is

239
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,406
oh I'm so OCD I like everything neat.

240
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:05,556
And that's just completely trivialising the experience of someone who actually suffers

241
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:08,917
with obsessive compulsive disorder because it's not just needing things neat, it's an

242
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:14,539
incredibly complex illness which involves a variety of different obsessive intrusive

243
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:19,781
thoughts and then compulsive rituals, often in order to achieve things that are completely

244
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:20,641
unrealistic.

245
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:26,063
And so it's really important when you are writing to just double check the language,

246
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:28,504
just literally just Google it, see what Wikipedia says.

247
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:29,184
It's not...

248
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:35,039
something that has to be a real big time sink, it's just something that's really important to just double check.

249
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:41,444
When language and representation is done accurately,

250
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,344
it helps the people in the audience

251
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,785
to identify their own vulnerabilities.

252
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:49,205
So in seeing yourself or seeing a trait

253
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,706
or a part of yourself portrayed in the game,

254
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:54,267
and particularly in games, which are so immersive

255
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:57,487
and so fantastically involving,

256
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,628
you're able to, if you have this vulnerability,

257
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,749
identify it in the character that you're playing as.

258
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:07,912
That's a really powerful tool to promote help-seeking.

259
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:12,917
So if you want to represent a character's mental illness accurately, ask.

260
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:17,381
Ask professionals, ask people with lived experience.

261
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,985
Do the research and it goes hand in hand with not

262
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:25,248
perpetuating stereotypes which I'll talk about in a little bit.

263
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,471
Purpose.

264
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:30,876
Why are you doing it? Why are you including mental illness in your game?

265
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:35,739
No one wants the 50 gazillionth horror game that's set in an asylum because

266
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:37,961
someone decided one day that asylums were scary.

267
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:42,143
You can and should represent mental illness.

268
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:44,465
I'm not in any way saying don't do it.

269
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:50,147
but there is a way to do it correctly and a way to do it for the right reasons and those reasons

270
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:55,888
are things like character development, making characters that are real, that you can relate to,

271
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,949
sympathize with, that the player feels like they're actually going on a journey with because they can

272
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:05,650
see parts of themselves or their friends or their loved ones in this digital person.

273
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,535
things like driving plot motivations and conflict in the game.

274
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:14,960
The person that is representing mental illness doesn't need to be perfect or a saint.

275
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,483
Everybody makes mistakes.

276
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:18,844
I was going to say the F word then.

277
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:20,827
And I said I wouldn't swear.

278
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:22,268
Everybody makes mistakes.

279
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,913
good person can do a bad thing and that might be because they're experiencing a mental illness.

280
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:35,840
The point is that you're using it for a reason to drive something and obviously what I would

281
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,663
consider to be the most important reason to represent mental illness is if you're actually

282
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:42,625
trying to raise awareness and reduce stigma for that mental health issue.

283
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:47,766
Stereotypes tend to fall into three different trees.

284
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,727
There's stereotypes of fear and exclusion,

285
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,228
i.e. mentally ill people are scary.

286
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:57,590
Authoritarianism, which is mentally ill people

287
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,211
are not able to make their own decisions

288
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,191
and thus we must make decisions for them.

289
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:06,173
Sorry, stereotypes of benevolence,

290
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:08,834
which is mentally ill people are childlike

291
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:09,994
and must be taken care of.

292
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:12,186
Be aware when you're writing,

293
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:16,148
am I falling into one of these trees of the stereotype

294
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:17,769
and how can I avoid doing that?

295
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,390
Show empathy.

296
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:24,073
And again, it doesn't need to be someone that's a saint.

297
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:26,215
You can have a good person that does bad stuff.

298
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:28,756
They don't need to be 100% empathetic all the time.

299
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:31,458
And maybe you could even use their mental illness

300
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,759
or part of that as the reason

301
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,260
that you're empathizing with them.

302
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,856
and support is a huge one.

303
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:41,197
Life is Strange did this really well.

304
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:45,138
They actually had in the game a list of external resources

305
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:46,739
that you could go to if you were experiencing

306
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,419
a mental health issue because those themes

307
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,200
are used so much in the game.

308
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,561
But it doesn't need to be as oblique as that.

309
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,081
It doesn't need to be this big, obvious,

310
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:56,222
signposted mental health stuff.

311
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,083
Like you know when there's a terrible story on the news

312
00:17:59,123 --> 00:18:00,883
and they're like, if you've been affected by this issue,

313
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:01,924
use your cool lifeline.

314
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:05,967
It's good to do that, and please do if you want to.

315
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:08,730
We've actually had a couple of games direct to Checkpoint,

316
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,892
which is really cool because it's a gamers charity.

317
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:13,374
So that's something to consider.

318
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:15,476
But it also could just be behavioral modeling.

319
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,663
It could be a character who is experiencing something,

320
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:21,125
and then that character says, OK, I probably need help,

321
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:22,006
and then goes to get it.

322
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:25,029
So you, as the developer, don't need

323
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:27,772
to break the fourth wall by speaking directly to the player.

324
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:30,615
You can have the character, or those around the character,

325
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,698
speak to the player through the game.

326
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:41,952
We're going to move on to some specifics, which is the bulk of the talk, what I'll be doing for roughly the next half an hour.

327
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:48,135
Breaking down specific symptoms and conditions that are commonly associated, or are mental illnesses.

328
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:54,278
Explaining the myths that are associated with each, and the reality of the situation.

329
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:58,260
And then showing some video games that have done each of them particularly well.

330
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,242
I actually don't go through substance abuse and addiction.

331
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:06,683
I should have took that out, I apologize, because the talk was too long.

332
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:11,585
Depression, one of the most common mental

333
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:15,547
health conditions that we as a society, society, excuse me,

334
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:19,068
face and also one that is incredibly

335
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:21,689
misrepresented a lot of the time.

336
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,012
Many people believe that depression is just feeling sad.

337
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:31,013
I'm a bit down today, and I might be a bit down a day next week.

338
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:35,674
Actually, depression is a pervasive state of mind

339
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:39,535
that can last consistently for weeks, months, or years.

340
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:44,336
Someone with depression is most commonly describing to me

341
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:48,617
as their doctor, not as feeling sad, but feeling nothing.

342
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:51,681
and that is incredibly distressing to them.

343
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:56,686
They feel apathetic, they can't enjoy anything anymore.

344
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:59,629
Even the things that were their best hobbies in the world,

345
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:03,693
they're just like, I just don't have fun doing this.

346
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,436
They can't concentrate, their memory's shot,

347
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:08,638
they're not motivated, and they're not motivated

348
00:20:08,678 --> 00:20:10,519
to improve their situation either.

349
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:13,222
And that's a really challenging thing to overcome.

350
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:17,651
And the physical symptoms are almost never represented.

351
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:20,894
These people usually, when they're experiencing depression,

352
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:23,456
when they eat too much or not eat enough.

353
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:25,358
One of the really worrying signs

354
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:26,899
is when people start losing weight

355
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,521
and they're not even trying to, it's just falling off them.

356
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,704
They might not be able to sleep or sleep too much.

357
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,386
And we have a very classical symptom of depression,

358
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,088
which we call early morning waking,

359
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:39,029
which is people that will wake up without an alarm

360
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:40,270
at like four o'clock in the morning.

361
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,192
And then they're like, well, what do I do with my day now?

362
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:46,997
I want to bust this thing about antidepressants.

363
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:50,301
I actually don't like the name antidepressants because that's not really what they're designed

364
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:50,661
to do.

365
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:54,786
But there are a group of drugs that treat depression, therefore we call them antidepressants,

366
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:57,649
and that they make you feel numb and they change your personality.

367
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,414
And of course, if you believe that, you're not going to go out and try them, right?

368
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:06,875
Even if that's the one thing that's going to take you from being depressed to being functional again.

369
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:10,536
If you feel like they're just not going to do anything for you and in fact going to harm you,

370
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,677
you're not going to try them. But all medications have side effects.

371
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:17,318
There is not a medication in the world that does not have a potential side effect.

372
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:19,738
And in fact, most people don't get any whatsoever.

373
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:23,859
And if they do get one and it's not very good, you just go back to the doctor and the doctor says,

374
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,540
oh, sorry about that. Let's try this different drug instead.

375
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,401
And it's a growing and a collaborative journey that you could take together.

376
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:30,461
So...

377
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:36,683
That's something that, again, I'll talk about drugs later, but it's something that's really important.

378
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:39,584
Depression's not a sign of weakness, of course.

379
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:46,447
You don't necessarily have had to experience a trauma or a negative event in your life to become depressed.

380
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:50,848
You could be doing the best you could be, as my Australian friends say, living your best life

381
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:58,311
and still have an episode of depression because it's a biological illness that happens within the neurotransmitters of your brain

382
00:21:58,371 --> 00:21:59,912
and there's nothing that you can do about that.

383
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,433
and it doesn't require medication to treat.

384
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:04,953
You can also use psychotherapy and lifestyle treatment

385
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:05,493
options.

386
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:07,633
So we can't be just fitting everybody

387
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,154
into this one thing of depressed drugs, depressed drugs.

388
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:12,434
There's actually a variety of things that you can do.

389
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:16,675
And so I'm just going to, and I'm desperately

390
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:27,777
hoping that the sound works.

391
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:29,317
So you might know in Stardew Valley

392
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:29,477
that.

393
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:36,504
you're a farmer and there's a number of non-playable characters in the village

394
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:41,488
and they all have an arc. You can romance and marry many of them as well.

395
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:44,591
And Shane's arc, as what's indicated here,

396
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:49,875
includes that he is suffering from what I perceive as a depressive illness.

397
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:53,999
It makes him relatable, it makes him realistic as you're playing through the game.

398
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:54,919
Oh.

399
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:57,261
Excuse me.

400
00:23:02,623 --> 00:23:05,065
What I'll try and do is just speak very, very quickly then,

401
00:23:05,105 --> 00:23:06,245
because I can't pause.

402
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:13,408
So by this point in the game, you've actually built up

403
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:14,589
a relationship with Shane.

404
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,711
I think this is the first meeting.

405
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:29,296
And he's exhibiting some real significant symptoms.

406
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:40,132
And later you see him here surrounded by tins of beer.

407
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:43,534
And you really feel for him.

408
00:23:44,455 --> 00:23:47,277
He's literally crying on this cliff side

409
00:23:47,878 --> 00:23:50,140
and encouraging you to support and help him.

410
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:03,406
He's experiencing suicidal ideation.

411
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:06,028
I think that's pretty clear from what's happening,

412
00:24:06,248 --> 00:24:07,950
which is a common feature of depression.

413
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:14,915
And importantly, he asks for help.

414
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:17,897
He says to the player,

415
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,139
I really need you to take me to the hospital.

416
00:24:24,122 --> 00:24:26,404
Coincidentally, the doctor is another romantic choice.

417
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,552
And I like that we're not dictating to Shane what he needs to do at this point.

418
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:58,713
It's a suggestion that's appropriately labelled.

419
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:17,781
I'm so sorry.

420
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,282
Anxiety, another incredibly common mental illness

421
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:28,843
or mental health issue, I should say,

422
00:25:29,623 --> 00:25:32,024
that is very regularly misinterpreted.

423
00:25:32,404 --> 00:25:34,465
Lots of people think it's just having panic attacks

424
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:37,427
or that someone who has anxiety is emotionally.

425
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:42,629
sensitive or shy person when in fact anxiety disorders are real.

426
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,632
I have one, you wouldn't know it because I'm standing up here talking to hundreds

427
00:25:47,652 --> 00:25:48,112
of people

428
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:52,254
but actually people with anxiety disorders often

429
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:53,774
overcompensate.

430
00:25:54,795 --> 00:26:04,081
quite a lot and they will come across as extroverted, as outgoing, and sometimes can be a bit irritable

431
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:04,841
at times.

432
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,304
And the reason for that is that they're constantly in a state of fight or flight.

433
00:26:09,324 --> 00:26:12,586
Their body is telling them you need to get out, you need to run, you need to go, and

434
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:17,549
they don't have the mental capacity to actually process information at an acceptable rate.

435
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,572
So there's about a gazillion things firing and they're not really able to...

436
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:26,215
kind of really see what's happening and that's in an episode of acute anxiety

437
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,898
whereas a lot of people who have anxiety disorders

438
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,682
go a long time without experiencing anxiety, they feel completely normal.

439
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:39,145
GAD, what I've written there is Generalized Anxiety Disorder, that's what

440
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:42,307
I have, which is feeling very worried all the time about everything.

441
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:45,890
There's also things like social phobia and specific phobias.

442
00:26:47,043 --> 00:26:50,804
and they used to include OCD and PTSD in the anxiety disorders,

443
00:26:50,824 --> 00:26:54,625
but they now have their own sections of the diagnostic manual.

444
00:26:57,646 --> 00:27:02,688
Interestingly, whenever I see anxiety presented on screen,

445
00:27:03,348 --> 00:27:05,249
people are prescribed sedatives like Valium.

446
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:08,590
Valium isn't going to actually take away anxiety.

447
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,731
It will make you feel a little bit calmer for the moment,

448
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:13,352
but the treatment of choice is high-dose antidepressants.

449
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,724
This is the best thing I've ever seen.

450
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:21,947
Anyone played Celeste?

451
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:40,543
I just want to point out that on the top left of the gondola

452
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:42,965
is a little purple head character.

453
00:27:43,852 --> 00:27:48,495
That is an actual physical manifestation of the main character's mental health issues

454
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:51,457
and it's something that comes up again and again throughout the game

455
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:54,639
and is actually used as a powerful mechanic motivator

456
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:57,061
and it's a very, very emotional driven story.

457
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:24,776
So obviously she's having a panic attack. He labels it immediately. The language is

458
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:29,919
incredibly appropriate, it is what's happening. I also like the way that the environmental

459
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:34,981
storytelling is explaining to you what Madeline's experiencing by showing these kind of tendrils

460
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:40,164
coming into the side and the music is also communicating an experience to you without

461
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:42,505
actually having to say to the player what's happening.

462
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:54,291
Now when I didn't play it was too hard for me but my other half did, and when he played this and I saw this I was like,

463
00:28:54,411 --> 00:29:02,613
pause this game, this is amazing. The game teaches the player how to cope with a panic attack using

464
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:11,415
a breathing exercise. It includes it in the game's mechanic in an intricate way and gives the player

465
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:16,896
transferable skills that can be used in their real life. That is exceptional.

466
00:29:17,737 --> 00:29:19,698
Amazing, amazing, amazing work.

467
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,299
This is how you do this correctly.

468
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:30,242
We're moving on to psychosis.

469
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,624
I would like you to repeat after me.

470
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:36,905
Psychosis and psychopathy are not the same thing.

471
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:40,907
Psychosis and psychopathy are not the same thing.

472
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:41,568
Thank you.

473
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:49,974
Psychosis is a series of symptoms that describe a detachment from reality.

474
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:55,539
People who are experiencing psychosis can have hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder,

475
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,540
and a lack of insight.

476
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,082
Hallucinations can be of any modality.

477
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:02,064
It's not just hearing things, which is the most common,

478
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:04,886
and it's often not seeing things either.

479
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:07,909
In fact, if someone was seeing things, I would think they probably had

480
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:11,632
an organic problem within their brain, such as a dementia.

481
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:15,951
Hallucinations, as I say, can be of any modality.

482
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,552
Often they're hearing voices,

483
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:20,215
but you can hear other stuff too, explosions, music.

484
00:30:20,475 --> 00:30:22,777
Some people feel things under their skin,

485
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,520
like worms is the classic one.

486
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:27,902
Some people smell things.

487
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:30,765
Poison gas is one that I hear pretty commonly.

488
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,096
And they're not able to tell that these things aren't real.

489
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,817
Even if you challenge it, they still think it's real.

490
00:30:38,317 --> 00:30:40,177
And that's part of the illness itself.

491
00:30:40,978 --> 00:30:43,338
A delusion is different from a hallucination

492
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:46,479
because a delusion is a fixed, false belief.

493
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,660
Classic example, I'm an alien.

494
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,261
You could put me through a CT scanner,

495
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:54,282
cut off a bit of my body, dissect it and say,

496
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:56,322
look, you are clearly a human being.

497
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:59,063
And I still am like, no, the aliens made me look like that.

498
00:30:59,912 --> 00:31:03,095
That's a delusion. It's fixed, it's false, it's unshakable.

499
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:09,802
Thought disorder is the classic, you know, when you're thinking there's a sentence in your mind.

500
00:31:11,158 --> 00:31:16,564
If that sentence was to become muddled about or you were to jump very quickly from one unrelated sentence to another,

501
00:31:16,784 --> 00:31:23,872
and you don't know this is happening, so your perception of the world around you and how you're actually thinking and processing information is impaired,

502
00:31:24,873 --> 00:31:32,141
you obviously are not able to experience reality and make reasonable decisions about the reality that you're experiencing.

503
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:40,869
And the nature of psychosis is you don't know that that's happening and you believe that what's happening to you is the true reality and that everyone else is lying, essentially.

504
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:45,934
It makes it really tricky to treat, also makes these people so, so vulnerable.

505
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:51,058
They are so vulnerable, they just don't know what's going on and they need looking after, they need help.

506
00:31:51,438 --> 00:31:57,160
They do not need to be told that they're evil, that they're psychopaths, that they are going to kill people.

507
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,501
That is not the case at all.

508
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:06,663
And doing so is actively damaging these people in society, and we just need to stop doing it.

509
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:14,765
Psychosis is not a split personality, that's a misnomer because the etymology of the word skits is, it means split,

510
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:21,027
but it's just a coincidence in Latin, and we're really bad in medicine at naming things accurately.

511
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:25,871
And the vast majority of my clients who experience psychosis live in their homes,

512
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:29,754
they have jobs, they have kids and a family, and they live a very functional life,

513
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:31,175
and they are not all locked up.

514
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:36,438
Now before I play this video,

515
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:40,241
it's a game called Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice.

516
00:32:40,261 --> 00:32:42,423
It is my game of the decade.

517
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:48,347
These developers showed me what my patients have been experiencing

518
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:50,049
over the last 11 years.

519
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:57,070
Without me leaving my living room, I put on a headset and I played this game.

520
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,671
And I got the most overwhelming experience.

521
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:00,632
I was literally in tears.

522
00:33:00,652 --> 00:33:02,653
I was just like, I can't believe that this is what it is.

523
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:07,875
And it's just incredible the way that they use the sound design,

524
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:10,937
the environmental storytelling, even the mechanics.

525
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:15,839
Everything is unified to display what psychosis is,

526
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:17,340
how it feels, what it's like.

527
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:23,562
And they did it by asking doctors and people who have had psychosis.

528
00:33:23,662 --> 00:33:28,743
They worked closely with them and they actually represented their experiences in this game.

529
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:32,964
And it is one of the most powerful experiences I've ever seen.

530
00:33:32,984 --> 00:33:41,067
Are you scared? You should be scared.

531
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:43,427
If you didn't hear that was, are you scared, you should be scared.

532
00:33:46,268 --> 00:33:46,568
Thank you.

533
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:52,419
Oh right.

534
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,180
Just drop down.

535
00:33:54,361 --> 00:33:55,141
Why isn't she going down?

536
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:56,242
What's down there?

537
00:33:57,983 --> 00:33:58,643
Why did she do that?

538
00:33:58,663 --> 00:33:59,784
She shouldn't have done it.

539
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:04,946
You see how the hallucinations flipped from second to third person?

540
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:05,687
She's not going back now.

541
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:06,868
That's a common experience.

542
00:34:06,888 --> 00:34:07,688
No, this is it.

543
00:34:08,488 --> 00:34:09,169
The hidden path.

544
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,371
Often the hallucinations aren't saying anything derogatory,

545
00:34:12,411 --> 00:34:14,132
they're just talking about what you're doing.

546
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:17,253
The darkness does not bargain.

547
00:34:18,454 --> 00:34:19,355
It does not reason.

548
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:25,597
It is rocked, and now it has taken hold.

549
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,800
She is such a likeable character.

550
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,160
She's strong and vulnerable at the same time.

551
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:34,921
She's incredible.

552
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:38,922
The seed of the soul, until there is nothing left of her.

553
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:50,366
Now, I just want to clarify very briefly...

554
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:55,539
what this is, this black rock?

555
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,462
I believe there's a delusion of nihilism which means she believes her insides are dying

556
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:06,476
It's a common feature of psychotic depression.

557
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:11,718
And not only did they put it in to represent her experience,

558
00:35:11,738 --> 00:35:14,118
they actually made it part of the game mechanic.

559
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:17,919
So every time you die, the black rock grows.

560
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,039
And if it overcomes your entire body,

561
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,540
there's a permadeath or allegedly

562
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,160
there's a permadeath mechanic.

563
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:32,822
And I put this scene in as just a bit of contrast to show.

564
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:37,669
the various sides of this person, this character that they represented.

565
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:39,650
They showed her vulnerability, her strength.

566
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:43,373
They also showed her human side, her beauty.

567
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:47,015
They're challenging this really pervasive stereotype

568
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:48,977
that psychotic people are evil by showing

569
00:35:48,997 --> 00:35:54,180
her experience of the world in such a glorified, wonderful way.

570
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,343
And obviously, I really like this game.

571
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:58,263
Could you tell?

572
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:07,640
Trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder,

573
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:13,544
something experienced by many, many, many people,

574
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:17,207
and not just because they are war veterans.

575
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:24,012
It can be any form of trauma, which can be a loss or a grief of a loved one.

576
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:29,536
It can also be vicarious trauma, which is you weren't even there.

577
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:34,441
but you've heard or seen what happened and are therefore traumatised by it.

578
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:39,946
The unifying factor is there have to have been a threat to life or safety.

579
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:45,880
Having PTSD is not just lacking resilience.

580
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:50,424
The strongest amongst us can experience this,

581
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:53,647
and there are many contributing factors

582
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,389
that we're still trying to understand.

583
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,472
Invalidating someone's trauma by saying

584
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:01,434
that they're just weak or not resilient

585
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:04,217
is incredibly damaging and stops people

586
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:06,299
from being able to process and move on

587
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:10,182
by sticking them in this kind of vortex of self-doubt.

588
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:14,919
People with PTSD and trauma responses are not violent,

589
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:16,301
unpredictable, or psychotic.

590
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:19,484
They actually present with a variety of symptoms

591
00:37:19,964 --> 00:37:22,107
that usually include hypervigilance,

592
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:25,210
which is being constantly on the alert

593
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,292
for everything around you all the time.

594
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:33,375
flashbacks of the traumatic event and nightmares which don't necessarily need to be about the

595
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:37,798
traumatic event they could just be nightmares about anything but they are pervasive and

596
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:42,940
continuous they might become irritable they might become emotionally detached

597
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:45,722
i've got two games here

598
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:51,805
if you need to like go for the god of war bit i understand

599
00:37:51,825 --> 00:37:53,365
now

600
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:06,840
So there was a clear move here, I assume, to use environmental storytelling to communicate

601
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,261
Kratos's experience of his past trauma. He is looking at his deceased wife right now,

602
00:38:14,902 --> 00:38:20,623
not a glimmer of emotion on his face. The story's being told by the environment, by the music,

603
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:22,724
by the relationship between him and his son.

604
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:23,224
Are we hunting?

605
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:24,524
You were hunting, dear.

606
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:29,405
Which way?

607
00:38:30,218 --> 00:38:31,518
in the direction of dear.

608
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,022
This game isn't really about Kratos, it's about the relationship with his son.

609
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:48,425
And the reason that they're able to look at Kratos' trauma is to exemplify that relationship.

610
00:38:57,498 --> 00:39:01,600
Obviously, that's a massive overreaction for what's just happened, and this kid's mum's just died, so...

611
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,020
Holy fire.

612
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:05,581
When I tell you to fire...

613
00:39:07,102 --> 00:39:07,762
I'm sorry.

614
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:09,402
Do not be sorry.

615
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:11,703
Be better.

616
00:39:12,824 --> 00:39:13,544
Such a good line.

617
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:15,164
Follow me.

618
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:18,145
Why help us?

619
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:26,288
Again, this is a really artful way of communicating minor symptoms.

620
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:34,749
I'm willing to admit maybe maybe by helping you I'll make up for a lifetime of mistakes.

621
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:43,996
We're using an NPC to communicate Kratos's psychology.

622
00:39:46,658 --> 00:39:48,480
This is a little bit of a spoiler, sorry.

623
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:55,445
Cover your eyes and ears for 30 seconds if you're bothered.

624
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:11,259
So he's having flashbacks because of the lightning.

625
00:40:11,899 --> 00:40:13,860
Very common, big bang, big flash.

626
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,400
Your brain goes into hyper alert mode,

627
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,321
re-experiencing the trauma.

628
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,640
Quick apology for this next clip.

629
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:56,245
One of the words comes down out of sync with the dark bit.

630
00:40:58,987 --> 00:41:00,408
Also, it's my favourite game of all time.

631
00:41:00,729 --> 00:41:01,349
Just FYI.

632
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:11,779
You mumble in your sleep.

633
00:41:16,603 --> 00:41:17,844
Experiencing nightmares, of course.

634
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,201
I hate bad dreams.

635
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:24,022
Yeah, me too.

636
00:41:31,003 --> 00:41:32,044
What do you want from me?

637
00:41:32,744 --> 00:41:35,005
Admit that you wanted to get rid of me the whole time!

638
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:38,946
Tommy knows this area better than...

639
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:39,606
Oh, fuck!

640
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:43,807
Well, I'm sorry. I trust him better than I trust myself.

641
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:45,027
Stop with the bullshit!

642
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:46,748
What are you so afraid of?

643
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,264
that I'm gonna end up like Sam.

644
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:51,145
I can't get infected.

645
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:52,886
I can take care of myself.

646
00:41:52,906 --> 00:41:54,386
How many close calls have we had?

647
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:56,187
Well, we seem to be doing all right so far.

648
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:58,608
And now you'll be doing even better with Tommy.

649
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,711
The interesting thing here is

650
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,652
because Ellie reminds him so much of his daughter,

651
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,352
he's literally trying to get rid of her

652
00:42:09,412 --> 00:42:11,893
to avoid reliving his past trauma.

653
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:12,514
If you didn't know,

654
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:14,475
Joel's daughter dies at the beginning of the game.

655
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:21,518
You are treading on some mighty thin ice here.

656
00:42:21,558 --> 00:42:22,979
I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel,

657
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,281
but I have lost people too.

658
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:28,524
You have no idea what loss is.

659
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:32,367
So yeah, this is another example of how

660
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:36,250
he's not actually traumatized by the zombie apocalypse.

661
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:38,332
He's traumatized by his daughter dying.

662
00:42:38,592 --> 00:42:42,115
Has either died or left me.

663
00:42:42,576 --> 00:42:44,718
Everyone fucking except for you.

664
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:55,188
So don't tell me that I would be safer with someone else, because the truth is I would just be more scary.

665
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:58,190
You're right.

666
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:01,552
You're not my daughter.

667
00:43:04,495 --> 00:43:06,016
And I sure as hell ain't your dad.

668
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:12,260
Literally the entire game is driven by this trauma.

669
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,183
And we are going our separate ways.

670
00:43:20,442 --> 00:43:21,102
Alright, one more.

671
00:43:23,363 --> 00:43:24,984
Borderline personality disorder.

672
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:30,787
One of the most common mental health issues we see as a society.

673
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:38,711
The evidence suggests that between 7 and 10% of the population has a personality disorder.

674
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:44,674
And borderline is the most common personality disorder of which there are actually 10.

675
00:43:46,494 --> 00:43:48,555
which are, I like this game,

676
00:43:48,955 --> 00:43:51,716
schizotypal, schizoid, paranoid, borderline,

677
00:43:51,856 --> 00:43:54,376
antisocial, histrionic, narcissistic,

678
00:43:54,477 --> 00:43:59,238
avoidant, obsessive, compulsive, and dependent.

679
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:02,319
Come on, I need a round of applause for that.

680
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,840
And I'm not a narcissist.

681
00:44:08,275 --> 00:44:10,175
As I say, borderline is really, really common.

682
00:44:10,756 --> 00:44:12,676
It's experienced by a significant proportion

683
00:44:12,696 --> 00:44:13,476
of the population.

684
00:44:13,516 --> 00:44:14,937
And because it's poorly understood,

685
00:44:14,997 --> 00:44:18,098
it's misdiagnosed regularly, usually as bipolar disorder.

686
00:44:18,258 --> 00:44:20,079
And the reason for that is they're both characterized

687
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:20,879
by mood swings.

688
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:23,580
But the mood swings that are associated with borderline

689
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,660
go like this all day, every day.

690
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:28,061
And with bipolar disorder, you'll

691
00:44:28,081 --> 00:44:30,242
get a manic phase, which will last for several weeks.

692
00:44:31,483 --> 00:44:34,305
and a depressive phase which can last for several months

693
00:44:34,725 --> 00:44:37,447
and in between these people are normal or we call them,

694
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:39,729
normal is a terrible word, I shouldn't have said that,

695
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:42,371
but they're what we say euthymic,

696
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:45,273
they're sitting somewhere between the two mood states.

697
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:48,175
Whereas a person with borderline does not experience

698
00:44:48,215 --> 00:44:49,996
that normalcy for very long,

699
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:51,778
they're constantly going up and down.

700
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,501
We call that affective instability.

701
00:44:56,402 --> 00:45:02,108
They are not super able to respond to their perceived threats in the environment.

702
00:45:02,568 --> 00:45:07,613
So when they think that there is a threat coming, and it's usually a threat of abandonment

703
00:45:08,113 --> 00:45:10,496
because of an early trauma that they experienced,

704
00:45:10,856 --> 00:45:15,360
they react in a way that seems to others to be a bit too much.

705
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:17,002
They go a bit over the top.

706
00:45:17,422 --> 00:45:24,349
whether that be with rage or with kind of reaching out and desperately requesting love and affection,

707
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:31,295
they don't, they're not able to regulate those big powerful emotions as well as

708
00:45:31,655 --> 00:45:36,400
someone that doesn't have this disorder. And they can't help that.

709
00:45:37,126 --> 00:45:38,586
They can't control that.

710
00:45:38,686 --> 00:45:39,847
They don't want to be like that.

711
00:45:40,027 --> 00:45:42,027
It's incredibly distressing for them.

712
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:45,908
And these people are the ones that I see very often

713
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:50,449
because they just can't take this chaotic lifestyle anymore.

714
00:45:50,729 --> 00:45:52,029
And they really want to be different.

715
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:56,210
They seem to often be attention seeking

716
00:45:56,811 --> 00:45:59,071
because they occasionally will engage

717
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:00,752
in things like deliberate self-harm.

718
00:46:01,852 --> 00:46:03,952
But actually, they're asking for help.

719
00:46:04,412 --> 00:46:05,913
They really, really want help.

720
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:10,447
They just don't know how to ask for it because they're vulnerable.

721
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,772
They've been traumatized early in their life

722
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:19,380
and they're just not able to interact in a way that's effective or functional.

723
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:26,601
It's an incredibly treatable condition and if we were better at representing it,

724
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:31,345
better at diagnosing it, that more people would get the treatment that they need,

725
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:37,812
they would cease their levels of distress and be able to live a normal functional life.

726
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:39,894
This is something we really need to get right.

727
00:46:41,983 --> 00:46:42,743
It's the last video.

728
00:46:42,763 --> 00:46:45,705
You can't keep blaming me and everybody for everything.

729
00:46:45,745 --> 00:46:48,767
And it's Chloe that I think has borderline personality disorder, not Max.

730
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:51,189
I blame somebody, otherwise it's all my fault.

731
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:52,049
Fuck that.

732
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,651
So she has a very classical black or white thinking pattern here.

733
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:56,952
There's no area of grey.

734
00:46:56,992 --> 00:47:01,455
It's either her fault or not her fault, and there's no wiggle room there.

735
00:47:01,475 --> 00:47:03,176
That's a really distressing way to be.

736
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:05,097
Jesus, she was banging that pig Frank.

737
00:47:05,878 --> 00:47:07,739
Bitch lied to my face, Max.

738
00:47:10,178 --> 00:47:12,639
People are often ideated or denigrated,

739
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:15,420
so that means they're either perfect or terrible.

740
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,260
I can't trust anybody again.

741
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,641
And it's held with fierce conviction.

742
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:21,102
Everybody pretends to care until they don't, even you.

743
00:47:21,962 --> 00:47:25,263
And you can see that Chloe is emotionally lashing out at Max

744
00:47:25,323 --> 00:47:27,824
because she perceived that Max abandoned her at some point,

745
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:28,525
even though it wasn't her fault.

746
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:29,905
Do you know what it's like to wait for your father

747
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:31,026
to come home when you're a kid?

748
00:47:31,626 --> 00:47:32,326
And he never does.

749
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:34,347
No, of course not.

750
00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:36,748
But I was with you that day.

751
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:38,568
It was just a terrible accident.

752
00:47:41,855 --> 00:47:45,859
And what we're showing here is that there's a reason that Chloe has this disorder.

753
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,422
Even though she's lashing out and being quite inappropriate and hurtful towards Max,

754
00:47:50,482 --> 00:47:55,466
we can see that there's an empathetic reason for these symptoms.

755
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:01,631
And this is her, but without blue hair.

756
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:16,166
a very clear display of her frantic fear of abandonment.

757
00:48:17,587 --> 00:48:18,448
Fuck cameras.

758
00:48:21,631 --> 00:48:25,275
I'm not sure how there's such vulnerability here.

759
00:48:26,175 --> 00:48:28,217
Even though she's angry and all by herself,

760
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:33,282
she somehow seems small and needing protection.

761
00:48:33,362 --> 00:48:36,445
She's a very, very likeable, relatable character.

762
00:48:50,371 --> 00:48:51,952
Again, environmental storytelling.

763
00:48:52,193 --> 00:48:53,954
The music says more than any words could.

764
00:49:00,498 --> 00:49:02,820
There's some others that I really quickly want to go over.

765
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,062
I actually spoke a little bit more about bipolar affective disorder before, but...

766
00:49:07,965 --> 00:49:12,012
Big mood states, manic, impulsive, not sleeping,

767
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:13,775
too much energy for weeks.

768
00:49:14,975 --> 00:49:17,176
Normal for a bit, depressed for months.

769
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:20,819
Dissociative identity disorder, excuse me,

770
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:22,560
used to be called split personality.

771
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,262
Most psychiatrists agree that split personality

772
00:49:25,302 --> 00:49:29,846
doesn't exist and that we call it this specific diagnosis

773
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:33,628
because this different identity is a form of yourself

774
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:35,710
that you're so dissociated from yourself

775
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:38,012
that you're actually identifying as a different person.

776
00:49:38,432 --> 00:49:42,636
really rare and antisocial personality disorder.

777
00:49:42,656 --> 00:49:47,600
This is what psychopathy is. Antisocial personality disorder is a type

778
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,922
subtype of personality disorder for people that

779
00:49:51,104 --> 00:49:53,546
do not empathize with other members of society.

780
00:49:54,787 --> 00:50:00,112
They show very little respect for authority and don't believe that authority should apply to them.

781
00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:04,356
And they're hugely over-represented in the prison population.

782
00:50:05,217 --> 00:50:11,062
Psychopaths are a version of an antisocial personality disorder where they also want to harm others.

783
00:50:11,082 --> 00:50:13,465
And because they don't necessarily care...

784
00:50:14,982 --> 00:50:18,046
about others, they are much more inclined to do that.

785
00:50:18,827 --> 00:50:24,254
They know what they are doing, they know it is wrong, they can tell the difference between

786
00:50:24,314 --> 00:50:29,921
right and wrong, they are based in reality and they choose to do it anyway.

787
00:50:30,925 --> 00:50:31,965
that's a bad person.

788
00:50:32,926 --> 00:50:37,909
Someone who is psychotic does not know that what they are doing is wrong

789
00:50:37,929 --> 00:50:41,731
or they do know that it's wrong but their reality is so skewed

790
00:50:42,211 --> 00:50:45,013
that they can't actually tell what they're doing.

791
00:50:48,748 --> 00:50:52,770
And a very last slide of my very specific gripes.

792
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,252
Stop putting wheelchairs in mental health wards.

793
00:50:55,312 --> 00:50:56,152
We don't need them.

794
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,314
These people are walking around and talking,

795
00:50:58,694 --> 00:51:00,515
and they don't need to be in a wheelchair.

796
00:51:00,575 --> 00:51:00,955
Stop it.

797
00:51:01,656 --> 00:51:02,937
There's so many wheelchairs.

798
00:51:02,957 --> 00:51:04,558
There doesn't need to be wheelchairs.

799
00:51:05,945 --> 00:51:11,652
Asylums don't exist anymore, but the modern equivalent of mental health ward, they're not scary.

800
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:14,595
They're really, really boring most of the time.

801
00:51:14,976 --> 00:51:17,940
I've worked in them for years. You'd be amazed at how mundane it is.

802
00:51:19,481 --> 00:51:24,508
Not all psychiatrists are British. I'm a very bad example.

803
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:31,173
But they don't have to be evil and they don't have to be English.

804
00:51:31,573 --> 00:51:36,414
In fact, some psychiatrists are really quite small and un-intimidating.

805
00:51:38,215 --> 00:51:39,555
Please get the medication right.

806
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:43,716
I talked about this heaps earlier, but all you have to do is go on Google for like five seconds

807
00:51:43,756 --> 00:51:45,876
and you'll get what you need.

808
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:49,957
It really helps people in signposting to the appropriate treatments.

809
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:54,393
And yes, we still use electroconvulsive therapy.

810
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:55,934
Yes, we do.

811
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,135
Regularly, it's really, really effective

812
00:51:59,215 --> 00:52:00,195
for certain conditions,

813
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:02,737
particularly when someone's life is at imminent risk.

814
00:52:03,557 --> 00:52:04,997
If someone is catatonic,

815
00:52:05,058 --> 00:52:07,399
they're not able to move, eat, or drink,

816
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:09,659
they will die in a few days.

817
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,321
ECT works for them.

818
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:16,122
We anesthetize, we give them a general anesthetic,

819
00:52:16,302 --> 00:52:17,583
and we use a muscle relaxant.

820
00:52:17,943 --> 00:52:18,743
It's not scary.

821
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:20,304
It's not one flew over the cookie's nest.

822
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,916
this is an effective treatment, please stop demonizing it,

823
00:52:23,996 --> 00:52:26,617
or obviously none of, no one here is demonizing it,

824
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:27,277
but please don't.

825
00:52:28,337 --> 00:52:29,598
I think that's really important.

826
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:33,279
When we represent mental illness,

827
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,179
even talking about mental illness, it is a trigger.

828
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,060
Even being in this room is a trigger.

829
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,280
It might bring up stuff for you.

830
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,281
Look after yourself, look after each other.

831
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:43,922
Have a mental health protocol in your studio.

832
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,382
Ask a professional, ask me.

833
00:52:46,885 --> 00:52:48,545
You're here because you want to do good.

834
00:52:49,285 --> 00:52:50,685
Thank you so much for that.

835
00:52:50,765 --> 00:52:52,446
You're here because you want to change people's lives.

836
00:52:52,486 --> 00:52:53,386
You want to save lives.

837
00:52:53,406 --> 00:52:54,346
You want to change the world.

838
00:52:54,406 --> 00:52:55,946
You are so cool.

839
00:52:56,086 --> 00:52:56,567
I love you.

840
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:59,847
Look after yourselves and let us help you do that.

841
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:02,668
Thank you so much for coming.

842
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,504
How much time have we got for questions?

843
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:18,324
Few minutes?

844
00:53:21,106 --> 00:53:21,286
Huh?

845
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:23,367
About five minutes.

846
00:53:23,387 --> 00:53:23,907
About five minutes.

847
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:24,867
Sweet, I didn't overrun.

848
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:27,989
This is the first time I've ever done that.

849
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:28,889
Hello.

850
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:32,110
Hi, I'm working on a game that focuses

851
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,451
on the physical challenge of having a chronic illness.

852
00:53:34,892 --> 00:53:37,193
How can we represent the realities of some illnesses

853
00:53:37,273 --> 00:53:38,713
like taking a lot of medication

854
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:40,514
without turning it into a stereotype?

855
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,125
Sorry, could you repeat the first sentence?

856
00:53:43,365 --> 00:53:46,968
Okay, I'm working on a game that focuses on physical,

857
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:49,790
the physical challenges of having chronic illnesses.

858
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,651
So how can we represent the realities

859
00:53:51,851 --> 00:53:52,812
of some of these illnesses

860
00:53:53,232 --> 00:53:55,174
without turning that into a stereotype?

861
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:56,214
Sure, ask them.

862
00:53:57,595 --> 00:54:04,601
Literally, find the people who are experiencing what you are working on, talk to them, ask

863
00:54:04,621 --> 00:54:09,666
them, obviously ask their permission. If you're struggling to find them, go to your local

864
00:54:10,106 --> 00:54:15,311
mental health facility, try and speak to the person that's in charge there. There's usually

865
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:17,052
advocacy groups who are...

866
00:54:18,353 --> 00:54:22,555
very, very keen to get people involved in community service work like that.

867
00:54:22,675 --> 00:54:25,317
So these people really do want to talk about what they've gone through.

868
00:54:25,377 --> 00:54:28,979
They're fed up of seeing the same old shit on the telly representing their illness.

869
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:33,061
They want it to be done right and they're going to be so grateful that you're actually

870
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:35,182
willing to take the time to listen to their story.

871
00:54:35,262 --> 00:54:36,323
So please, talk to them.

872
00:54:36,963 --> 00:54:37,283
Thank you.

873
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,251
Uh, hi.

874
00:54:41,451 --> 00:54:41,971
So...

875
00:54:43,091 --> 00:54:44,311
This is hard to talk about.

876
00:54:45,312 --> 00:54:49,033
About two years ago, a friend of mine committed suicide.

877
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:49,793
I'm so sorry.

878
00:54:50,293 --> 00:54:50,733
Thank you.

879
00:54:51,173 --> 00:54:52,773
And since then, I've...

880
00:54:55,034 --> 00:54:55,214
I've...

881
00:54:56,895 --> 00:54:59,835
I may not be the best person because of that to say this,

882
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:00,595
but I have a really...

883
00:55:00,616 --> 00:55:03,196
I have really strong feelings in terms of game design of

884
00:55:03,956 --> 00:55:07,777
never, ever, ever make your player talk somebody off the ledge

885
00:55:08,377 --> 00:55:08,938
because...

886
00:55:10,714 --> 00:55:14,077
don't, do not do that, just simply do not ever do that.

887
00:55:14,137 --> 00:55:15,978
I just, that's very,

888
00:55:15,998 --> 00:55:17,900
that's an extremely emotional thing for me.

889
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,522
And for part of that, I partly to that,

890
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:22,184
I want to say thank you for not citing

891
00:55:22,224 --> 00:55:24,206
that part of Life is Strange as being good,

892
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:26,328
because I personally really don't think it is.

893
00:55:26,428 --> 00:55:29,190
And I really also fucking hate Doki Doki Literature Club

894
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:31,993
for doing the same goddamn thing, but even worse.

895
00:55:34,515 --> 00:55:36,857
As a professional, what are your thoughts and feelings about that?

896
00:55:36,877 --> 00:55:39,219
Because last night my friend Lou and I were talking,

897
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,501
and we sort of about these things,

898
00:55:41,861 --> 00:55:45,424
we kind of came to the conclusion that is a topic really we both felt

899
00:55:45,464 --> 00:55:49,147
is really only suitable or okay for an educational game.

900
00:55:49,587 --> 00:55:51,068
So what are your thoughts on that?

901
00:55:51,128 --> 00:55:52,309
Yeah, look, I think that's fair enough.

902
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:55,872
It's not something I consider the specific scenario of,

903
00:55:56,212 --> 00:55:58,614
and I like the way you phrased it, talking them off the ledge.

904
00:55:59,515 --> 00:56:02,857
It's something that is an art that I've spent the last...

905
00:56:04,078 --> 00:56:11,304
11 years learning how to do and I would not say that I'm perfect or that I really know how to do it

906
00:56:11,984 --> 00:56:15,867
or that anyone in fact does because sometimes we do have to put people in locked wards

907
00:56:16,908 --> 00:56:20,851
to protect them and therefore that means that the people around them are not going to be 100%

908
00:56:22,152 --> 00:56:27,556
sufficient at talking them down because what's going on there is a process that isn't rational.

909
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:30,358
It's a process that isn't going to be

910
00:56:31,946 --> 00:56:40,917
adherent to logic and so for example, a good example is when someone's incredibly suicidal,

911
00:56:41,037 --> 00:56:47,004
if someone is genuinely considering their own life at that point, they usually feel like they...

912
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,786
or a burden on those who love them.

913
00:56:50,486 --> 00:56:52,167
They genuinely feel like they're worthless,

914
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:53,087
they have no worth.

915
00:56:53,548 --> 00:56:57,149
And to tell them, no, you have worth, we love you,

916
00:56:57,469 --> 00:56:59,470
can actually sometimes make them feel worse.

917
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,252
So it's a very difficult situation to try and navigate.

918
00:57:03,272 --> 00:57:07,373
I would say that if you are going to do it in your game,

919
00:57:08,554 --> 00:57:10,094
that's a choice for the game developer,

920
00:57:10,154 --> 00:57:11,875
but ask people who know what they're talking about

921
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,436
so that they can advise best practice.

922
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:14,636
Thank you.

923
00:57:14,776 --> 00:57:15,277
You're welcome.

924
00:57:17,515 --> 00:57:27,723
Hi there. I watched an interview years ago on TV that gave me the impression that anxiety and psychopathy are mutually exclusive. I was wondering, is that true?

925
00:57:28,064 --> 00:57:34,489
Absolutely not. End. Anxiety and psychopathy or psychosis?

926
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:35,430
Psychopathy.

927
00:57:36,571 --> 00:57:42,255
No, I would say that they're capable of being anxious the same as everyone else. They're just anxious about different things usually.

928
00:57:42,275 --> 00:57:42,856
I see.

929
00:57:43,476 --> 00:57:45,998
Odd. Yeah, interesting.

930
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:49,380
Hello.

931
00:57:49,701 --> 00:57:49,881
Hi.

932
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:52,782
Yeah, so I thought Hellblades Annual Sacrifice

933
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,082
was interesting that they actually brought in

934
00:57:54,123 --> 00:57:56,704
like professionals and patients to work on like

935
00:57:56,864 --> 00:57:57,404
doing it right.

936
00:57:57,424 --> 00:58:00,825
Do you know any organizations that actually work

937
00:58:00,865 --> 00:58:02,806
on helping mental health professionals collaborate

938
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:08,349
with game developers or the same organization?

939
00:58:08,409 --> 00:58:08,869
Or the same?

940
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:10,170
Tippointorg.com.

941
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:10,810
Okay.

942
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:13,691
Or if there's any organizations that help do funding

943
00:58:13,711 --> 00:58:16,172
or grants for games that are focusing on mental health.

944
00:58:17,892 --> 00:58:24,836
The grants that I've seen are almost exclusively by health organisations.

945
00:58:25,176 --> 00:58:29,619
So I think Ninja Theory got quite a lot of funding.

946
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,461
Maybe not Ninja Theory, I don't want to say the incorrect thing.

947
00:58:33,782 --> 00:58:36,943
I know that there was funding from a UK health organisation involved.

948
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:40,636
that's who I would go to.

949
00:58:40,897 --> 00:58:42,478
We can't help with that one unfortunately.

950
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:45,862
If you can figure out how that works, please let me know.

951
00:58:46,703 --> 00:58:47,584
Okay.

952
00:58:47,644 --> 00:58:50,006
And does Checkpoint work like across different nations

953
00:58:50,066 --> 00:58:51,748
or is it just localized like New Zealand and Britain and stuff?

954
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:54,100
No, we're an international organization.

955
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,061
We have people on the ground in Australia, New Zealand,

956
00:58:56,121 --> 00:58:56,761
and the UK.

957
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:58,943
We have a couple of people on the ground in the US as well.

958
00:59:00,063 --> 00:59:01,624
But because most of our work comes

959
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,666
from digital and online interaction,

960
00:59:04,746 --> 00:59:05,666
it makes it much easier.

961
00:59:05,686 --> 00:59:07,747
There's no barriers anymore and that sort of thing.

962
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:08,508
Cool.

963
00:59:08,648 --> 00:59:08,888
Thank you.

964
00:59:09,008 --> 00:59:09,428
Get in touch.

965
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:11,589
There's heaps of business cards here and flyers

966
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:18,013
that have the summary of the lapses acronym at the front.

967
00:59:18,113 --> 00:59:19,293
So come and help yourselves.

968
00:59:19,313 --> 00:59:20,914
There's heaps, and I don't want to take them home with me.

969
00:59:23,223 --> 00:59:26,865
Hi, thanks so much for talking to everyone about this, this is such important stuff.

970
00:59:27,265 --> 00:59:28,386
Thank you.

971
00:59:28,826 --> 00:59:32,928
On the subject of Hellblade, so I love the game so much, it's so interesting and it's

972
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:39,111
so metal, but there was one criticism I read from a sufferer of psychosis which was really

973
00:59:39,151 --> 00:59:44,614
interesting and talking about how they, sometimes the voices in the game are actually helping.

974
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:44,994
Yes.

975
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,815
They'll say things like, I know, watch out, things like that.

976
00:59:47,432 --> 00:59:53,113
And it was one criticism that, from this sufferer of psychosis, that my voices are never helpful.

977
00:59:53,453 --> 00:59:58,654
This is not an experience. There is no upside to the things I experience.

978
00:59:59,314 --> 01:00:05,455
And so when you're making a game, there has to be a way to proceed. There has to be a way to get

979
01:00:05,475 --> 01:00:12,956
forward, usually. And so, have you encountered many of these examples where the kind of reality of

980
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:19,016
um the mental illnesses and sometimes the inescapable nature of them kind of conflicts with

981
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:25,741
Absolutely, absolutely. Like, think about the people that you will meet at GDC. Everyone has an

982
01:00:26,301 --> 01:00:34,125
intricately different personality. Everyone is completely unique and therefore so are the things

983
01:00:34,165 --> 01:00:40,067
that affect our minds. Our mental, our experiences of mental health are going to be completely unique

984
01:00:40,087 --> 01:00:43,228
to us and if you're going to represent them in a game, you...

985
01:00:45,189 --> 01:00:51,532
I don't think it's possible to actually represent the experiences of every individual.

986
01:00:52,852 --> 01:00:59,555
What the goal, I think, should be is to raise awareness that will reach as many as possible

987
01:00:59,955 --> 01:01:03,377
and reduce harm to those it doesn't reach, if that makes sense.

988
01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:04,757
So finding the balance.

989
01:01:05,197 --> 01:01:08,219
If it's one person that said that Hellblade they didn't relate to, that's...

990
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,901
you know, that seems like a really sad, distressing situation for that person,

991
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:17,682
that their voices are never, never positive, and unfortunately it's a common one.

992
01:01:17,702 --> 01:01:25,265
But the people that they spoke to did have that experience, and I've heard that often.

993
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:28,285
particularly with people that have schizophrenia,

994
01:01:28,345 --> 01:01:30,606
is sometimes their voices aren't derogatory

995
01:01:30,626 --> 01:01:31,346
and they're not nice.

996
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:34,327
They're just literally like saying what you're doing.

997
01:01:36,028 --> 01:01:39,349
Like Jenny walked to the other side of the podium.

998
01:01:39,689 --> 01:01:41,229
Jenny spoke to the audience.

999
01:01:41,269 --> 01:01:43,270
It would be so distracting and annoying

1000
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:46,091
to have that happen all the time.

1001
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:50,692
But you can't represent everyone's experience

1002
01:01:50,732 --> 01:01:51,552
simultaneously.

1003
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:53,393
Maximize benefit, minimize harm.

1004
01:01:53,995 --> 01:01:54,578
Thank you very much.

1005
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:55,303
The bottom line.

1006
01:01:55,384 --> 01:01:55,685
Thank you.

1007
01:01:57,173 --> 01:02:13,742
Hi, fantastic talk. In God of War, if I remember correctly in the trailer, we had the same scene where Atreus shoots at the deer and Kratos is saying no, don't do that.

1008
01:02:14,102 --> 01:02:19,065
I believe there was a game mechanic that got cut eventually where you had to control your anger.

1009
01:02:19,806 --> 01:02:24,048
Do you think that it would have been appropriate to leave that in?

1010
01:02:25,379 --> 01:02:30,261
Yeah, I think there would have been, I mean obviously I haven't seen it, but I think that

1011
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:32,222
would have been appropriate and would have been powerful.

1012
01:02:32,402 --> 01:02:37,584
I also understand the limitations of game development and sometimes you can work for

1013
01:02:37,664 --> 01:02:39,525
four months on a feature and then have it cut.

1014
01:02:40,545 --> 01:02:43,106
and it doesn't make it in, and that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

1015
01:02:43,186 --> 01:02:44,987
So, yeah, it would have been cool.

1016
01:02:45,107 --> 01:02:47,868
And certainly when I spoke to Corey, that was actually one of the things

1017
01:02:47,888 --> 01:02:51,709
that he he'd specifically mentioned was Kratos's journey of actually

1018
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:55,510
being able to control his impulsive rage responses.

1019
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:59,051
And that impacted the relationship with his son

1020
01:03:00,031 --> 01:03:01,691
because he was always away trying to do that.

1021
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:03,392
So, yeah, it would have been interesting.

1022
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:06,813
It's a shame. It is what it is, I guess.

1023
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,373
Thank you. Thank you.

1024
01:03:10,545 --> 01:03:10,765
Hello.

1025
01:03:10,785 --> 01:03:10,845
Hi.

1026
01:03:11,105 --> 01:03:12,326
Just wanted to say I love your talk,

1027
01:03:12,366 --> 01:03:14,348
and I really think this is an important conversation to have.

1028
01:03:14,368 --> 01:03:14,988
Thank you.

1029
01:03:15,428 --> 01:03:17,670
I'm currently interested in making a storyline about a

1030
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,291
person who's going into people's minds

1031
01:03:19,351 --> 01:03:20,913
and helping people with their illnesses.

1032
01:03:22,013 --> 01:03:26,157
And I know that there are people in the world, like you say,

1033
01:03:26,197 --> 01:03:28,919
that end up using derogatory terms

1034
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:32,001
or the wrong kind of terminology for people with illnesses.

1035
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:34,703
And it's something that we should try to avoid in games.

1036
01:03:35,343 --> 01:03:39,086
But I'll be honest, I actually am guilty of this myself,

1037
01:03:39,146 --> 01:03:40,886
and it's something I'm still trying to work on,

1038
01:03:40,906 --> 01:03:42,307
but it does slip out from time to time.

1039
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:47,030
I'm interested in actually including it into a game,

1040
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:50,612
but not as to support it, but to point out

1041
01:03:50,652 --> 01:03:52,453
that there are people in the world that does this,

1042
01:03:52,513 --> 01:03:54,074
and it is something we should condone.

1043
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:56,075
And I was wondering if that would be okay to include.

1044
01:03:56,525 --> 01:04:03,850
Yeah, look, I think blanket censorship is ridiculous because you're not communicating,

1045
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:06,832
if you just censor something, you're not communicating to the people that use that

1046
01:04:06,852 --> 01:04:13,357
language why it's inappropriate. And so I think what you've just described there of using it,

1047
01:04:13,757 --> 01:04:15,278
but framing it in a way that isn't.

1048
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,480
actually promoting it.

1049
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:20,682
So you can, for example, we put people that kill

1050
01:04:21,423 --> 01:04:23,104
in our games all the time, right?

1051
01:04:23,224 --> 01:04:25,566
Like that's a primary mechanic is killing other people,

1052
01:04:25,586 --> 01:04:27,867
but we're not necessarily saying it's a good thing to do.

1053
01:04:29,148 --> 01:04:31,009
And often the people who are doing that

1054
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:34,712
are quite demonized, and that's obviously

1055
01:04:34,732 --> 01:04:36,053
the correct way of approaching it.

1056
01:04:36,093 --> 01:04:40,136
So I would use that sort of analog if it was me.

1057
01:04:40,196 --> 01:04:41,417
But feel free to get in touch.

1058
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:42,417
I'd love to talk more about that,

1059
01:04:42,437 --> 01:04:44,339
because I think that's a really interesting topic, actually.

1060
01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:45,640
Thank you.

1061
01:04:45,888 --> 01:04:46,249
Thank you.

1062
01:04:48,029 --> 01:04:48,429
Awesome.

1063
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:50,990
Any more questions?

1064
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:55,792
If not, thank you again so much.

1065
01:04:55,852 --> 01:04:57,052
It's been an absolute pleasure.

1066
01:04:57,072 --> 01:05:01,974
I'm just really tall, so I actually don't.

1067
01:05:05,595 --> 01:05:05,835
Hello.

1068
01:05:10,334 --> 01:05:14,996
Yeah, we've got flyers, I've got business cards, and we have one more question.

1069
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:21,679
Hey, I have autism, high functioning, and one of the things that I've kind of noticed

1070
01:05:21,759 --> 01:05:26,882
with mental illnesses and gaming is that they all tend to be a lot of tragedies.

1071
01:05:27,522 --> 01:05:29,383
And I'm like, where are the positive stories?

1072
01:05:30,603 --> 01:05:31,584
That's my thing.

1073
01:05:31,704 --> 01:05:34,945
I'm just kind of like, you know, a little bit.

1074
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:37,048
Like what the hell?

1075
01:05:37,408 --> 01:05:39,209
I mean, all games have conflict, right?

1076
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,090
That's why we play them.

1077
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:43,311
Because we're trying to overcome the conflict.

1078
01:05:43,631 --> 01:05:45,292
I think a good example is Celeste.

1079
01:05:45,652 --> 01:05:46,913
There's no real tragedy there.

1080
01:05:46,953 --> 01:05:48,474
She's trying to get to the top of a mountain

1081
01:05:48,734 --> 01:05:51,355
and the whole thing is a metaphor for her journey

1082
01:05:51,395 --> 01:05:53,196
with her mental health issues.

1083
01:05:53,336 --> 01:05:55,437
And she actually gets to the top of the mountain

1084
01:05:55,637 --> 01:05:57,958
and I don't want to spoil it, but the end is amazing.

1085
01:05:58,018 --> 01:05:59,179
So if you want to give it a go.

1086
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:03,421
I'm totally not saying that they shouldn't have conflict.

1087
01:06:03,801 --> 01:06:06,262
I'm just saying, why do most of them end in tragedy?

1088
01:06:06,582 --> 01:06:11,984
Because with God of War, that is a game that's clearly

1089
01:06:12,085 --> 01:06:15,826
about a tragic aspect, and it continues

1090
01:06:15,866 --> 01:06:17,767
to get darker and darker and darker.

1091
01:06:18,067 --> 01:06:19,228
And it doesn't really let up.

1092
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:22,169
I haven't finished it.

1093
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,910
I am so sad for you.

1094
01:06:26,622 --> 01:06:27,282
Sorry about that.

1095
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:28,462
No, no, no, that's okay.

1096
01:06:28,522 --> 01:06:30,322
I thought it was funny.

1097
01:06:30,383 --> 01:06:31,563
I think it's the human condition.

1098
01:06:31,603 --> 01:06:34,143
We show stories about the deepest parts of our psyche

1099
01:06:34,604 --> 01:06:35,804
and often that is tragedy.

1100
01:06:36,384 --> 01:06:37,764
And yeah, it is tragedy,

1101
01:06:37,804 --> 01:06:40,805
but I also see a lot of people who persevere.

1102
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:43,566
Interesting.

1103
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:45,946
I work actively within that community, so.

1104
01:06:45,966 --> 01:06:50,107
Don't have an answer for that, I'm afraid.

1105
01:06:50,948 --> 01:06:51,808
We'll keep on tracking.

1106
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:55,522
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

1107
01:06:55,903 --> 01:06:58,285
Well, yeah, I also loved the talk, I had a good time.

1108
01:06:58,305 --> 01:06:59,847
Thank you, you're welcome.

1109
01:07:00,968 --> 01:07:01,508
All right.

1110
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:02,770
Sounds good, Taylor.

1111
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:04,331
I'll be around for a little bit.
