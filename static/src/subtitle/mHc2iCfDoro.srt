00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:08,178
Hello.

2
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:09,219
Hi.

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:10,499
Thank you all for coming.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,323
I'm happy to have this chance to do this post-mortem now after 40 years.

5
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:21,946
You may have noticed coming in that there's a little card on your seat.

6
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:28,950
This is a gift from the fine folks at Digital Eclipse who have made a wonderful interactive documentary about the making of Karateka.

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,433
So that's a Steam code so that you can play and interact with this documentary.

8
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:36,334
And if you have

9
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:40,095
a smiley face on your card.

10
00:00:42,156 --> 00:00:44,798
There's three smiley faces somewhere in the room.

11
00:00:45,298 --> 00:00:47,440
Then your card is even more special and valuable.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,121
And I'll explain what that's going to be.

13
00:00:51,222 --> 00:00:57,226
But everything I'm going to talk about, Karateka, you can also delve into the documentary.

14
00:00:57,246 --> 00:01:01,208
And that's a great kind of parallel supplement to this talk.

15
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:11,208
So how many of you remember 1982 from your own actual memories?

16
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:18,595
How many do not remember 1982 or weren't born yet?

17
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:26,623
How many of you didn't raise your hand either time for some reason?

18
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:27,444
We'll talk about that later.

19
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:31,309
So I was 17 years old.

20
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:36,430
I was a freshman in college when I started making Karateka, and I was 20 when it shipped.

21
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:41,732
So this is the story of a game development, but it's also a growing up story.

22
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:50,793
I went from a kid to a young adult while trying to make this game, and also trying to carry a full course load at college, but I'll get to that.

23
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:56,114
At 17, I was already a somewhat seasoned Apple II game developer.

24
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,035
So I want to just take a minute to kind of

25
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:03,251
back up and explain what that experience was.

26
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,101
These comic book panels are from my new graphic novel memoir, Replay.

27
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:14,702
This is the project I've been working on for the last three years.

28
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:18,583
I won't have time to talk about it today, because we're just going to talk about Karateka.

29
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:23,784
But this book is available in the GDC bookstore in the North Hall.

30
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:26,704
And I'm going to go straight there after this talk, and I'll do a book signing.

31
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:34,226
But for now, I'm just going to use this book as a convenient source of illustrations of moments in Karateka's development.

32
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:40,870
This one shows me at age 11 and at age 12, right before the Apple II entered my life.

33
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,013
So as a kid, I was more into writing and drawing comics, making animated movies.

34
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,654
I wasn't particularly technical.

35
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:58,280
But I made money drawing caricatures at the local booth, at a local fair.

36
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:02,863
And I used that money to buy my first Apple II computer.

37
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:06,415
her

38
00:03:23,883 --> 00:03:24,904
So there was equipment.

39
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:27,026
There were kids there who knew more about the equipment than I did.

40
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:32,670
And then at a certain moment, there was a TRS-80 and a Commodore PET.

41
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:39,796
And then a friend of mine got the first Apple II that I had ever seen, which was even more amazing because it could do color.

42
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:46,801
So I put all my caricature money into this purchase of an Apple II.

43
00:03:48,567 --> 00:04:01,917
and when I realized that this was a machine that I could use not just to play games but also to make games which were in effect little interactive animated movies I just put all of my energy into that so these are the artifacts of my programming environment

44
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:04,496
in 1979.

45
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,437
Of course, in those days, there was no internet.

46
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:14,539
So to learn to program, you had to just read books, articles, and magazines like Creative Computing were very important.

47
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:18,560
There's this book by David All with program listings.

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,301
So you'd type in the code, the basic program, and then run it.

49
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:26,242
And from that, you kind of learned how BASIC worked.

50
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:30,823
Now, about this time,

51
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,291
something really mind-blowing.

52
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:39,955
I mean of course Space Invaders the same year had arrived in the arcade and that was like the first arcade game that I played that was actually fun.

53
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:52,623
There was pinball and there were games like Tank War sort of alongside the pinball machines in the bowling alley but Space Invaders was a craze because it was addictive and it had thumping bass and it was just immersive, it was cinematic.

54
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:57,105
Whereas the computer games at home were kind of beeps and buzzes and blocky.

55
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:58,946
But some genius

56
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:11,471
who I only knew as the name on the screen, M. Hata, programmed, somehow programmed Space Invaders for the Apple computer so I could play Space Invaders at home and it looked, it played just like the arcade game.

57
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:20,953
So this, I mean, obviously it blew me away, but what I realized was that this game wasn't programmed in BASIC, it was done some other way.

58
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:22,274
Machine language was

59
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,343
you know, it was hard to find out what that was or how it worked.

60
00:05:28,264 --> 00:05:38,255
It wasn't fully explained in the manual, but I realized that to do a fast action arcade game with high-res graphics like this, it needed to be done in machine language.

61
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:43,080
So I spent a few years, got to the point where I could actually program

62
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:48,515
and what I did is I programmed my own version of Asteroids.

63
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:51,057
That was the game that was in the arcades after Space Invaders.

64
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:51,838
It was the next craze.

65
00:05:52,258 --> 00:06:00,364
And I figured Space Invaders had been a bestseller, and whoever M. Hata was, he was probably living in a castle on a mountaintop somewhere.

66
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:08,610
And so I thought if I could publish my version of Asteroids, that would be the next hit, and I would be set.

67
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,132
I would be a published software author.

68
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:11,952
And I actually

69
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:19,496
finished this game and I signed a contract with Hayden book company, publisher of Sargon, the best chess game.

70
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:28,099
But unfortunately this was around the time that Atari sent letters to software publishers that were knocking off their arcade games as discs and told them you can't do that anymore.

71
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,081
So Hayden got cold feet and never published my Asteroids.

72
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:44,010
I was disappointed, of course, but I started programming a new game using everything that I had learned making asteroids and using those skills to program a game that was nothing like asteroids.

73
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:46,152
Yeah, that was my death bounce.

74
00:06:52,310 --> 00:07:07,535
And this was sort of like the end of my five-year self-taught programming apprenticeship, because in doing Death Bounce, I mastered page flipping and programming in assembly language, all the skills that I would need to make Karateka.

75
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:15,258
This was also my first contact with BrÃ¸derbund Software, my favorite publisher, which I knew about from reading Soft Talk magazine.

76
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:18,841
I saw this ad in Softtalk.

77
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:24,467
I sent them the floppy disk, and Doug Carlston himself, one of the founders of VoterBun Software, called me back.

78
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,969
This was very exciting to me as a freshman in college.

79
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,753
The phone in the dorm room rang, and it was Doug Carlston on the other end.

80
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:33,096
But they didn't want to publish Death Bounce.

81
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:34,958
They thought it was too similar to asteroids.

82
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:45,074
Doug sent me a copy of Berterman's latest hit, Choplifter, by Dan Gorlin.

83
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:47,018
How many people here have played that?

84
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:48,548
Yeah, okay.

85
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:58,639
An amazing, incredible game with fast actions, cinematics, a scrolling background, and a helicopter that really moved and felt like a helicopter.

86
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,602
So, that was an inspiration.

87
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:06,587
And I should mention again, Soft Talk Magazine, because that was really my window into the industry.

88
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,530
Everything I knew about who was making games or what the companies were,

89
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:17,555
It was from my subscription to Softtalk, and Softtalk had a best-seller list that they published every month of the top 30 best-selling games.

90
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:26,459
So my dream kind of focused on, I want to make a game that's going to get published by Broderbund and is going to be on the Softtalk top 30, like Choplifter was at this moment.

91
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:28,239
and

92
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,234
It's interesting to me to look at now because it documents the whole creation of Karatek and of my early games.

93
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,955
And of course, the journal is handwritten.

94
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:52,797
What I used for school, for typing papers and so on, was this Smith-Corona typewriter.

95
00:08:53,218 --> 00:09:00,121
The Apple II that I had in my dorm room that was taking up the entire desk was useless for that because, for one thing, it had no lowercase letters.

96
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:05,785
And also, its memory could hold the equivalent of about three pages of text.

97
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:10,087
So this was my development environment.

98
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,404
And this is the first mention of Karateka that I found in my journal.

99
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:18,926
And I did these sketches.

100
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:24,150
I had an idea for Karateka and for another game, which I called Animated Adventure, which I never made.

101
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:30,635
The direct inspiration for Karateka was a game called Swashbuckler by Paul Stevenson.

102
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:31,195
Anybody here?

103
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:32,016
OK.

104
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:33,824
Yeah.

105
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:39,748
I mean, that game had large sprites and it was probably the first fighting game, the first combat game I'd ever seen.

106
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:41,449
It wasn't really fully animated.

107
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:44,992
It was kind of like alternating between key frames, poses.

108
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:56,099
But I thought, if I could do a game with big sprites, like Swashbuckler, but have smooth, fast animation, like Choplifter and Space Invaders, that was kind of the idea for Karateka.

109
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,141
And at this point, the idea was two guys fighting on a mat.

110
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:02,023
You would score blows and earn points.

111
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:14,751
In this talk, I've taken some excerpts from a journal and put them in big type there, so you can see what I wrote at the time.

112
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:20,314
The journal reminds me that before I could make any game, I had to make the tools to make the game.

113
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:24,716
There was no Photoshop or anything like that.

114
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:29,498
to do graphics, especially in assembly language, there was nothing off the shelf.

115
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:44,163
So the first step was to write a program that would let me, using the up, down, left, and right cursor keys, turn pixels on and off on the screen to draw shapes like these, which I mocked up in my program, which I called, with great imagination, Draw.

116
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:48,930
This was my graphics utility.

117
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:59,060
And eventually I added other functionality to it, too, to cut out shapes with rectangles and be able to blast those shapes to the screen anywhere and to then play them in order to do animation.

118
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:02,723
So that summer I was, you know, creating the tools.

119
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:06,267
Anybody recognize the game that I'm playing there on the screen?

120
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:08,929
Yes!

121
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,891
For my man who should know.

122
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:15,785
Yeah, Bill Budge, an inspirational genius.

123
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:18,126
His games were somehow so far in advance of everybody else's.

124
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:27,272
So I included this entry in my journal because it's interesting.

125
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:32,535
Scrolling landscape and storytelling, cinematic storytelling, are hallmarks of Karateka.

126
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:38,319
But two months in, I considered that and rejected it.

127
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,380
And here's what I wrote in my journal.

128
00:11:42,082 --> 00:12:10,527
trying to put mirror fighting in a real life setting would render the game banal even tasteless no, karate is karate and it should be played on a blue mat as I originally planned I love having a journal for many reasons but one is because it always reminds me that I'm just as articulate and convincing in defending my wrong ideas as my right ones and by the way if you're

129
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,128
For anybody who wants to read my whole journal of my college years, making caretake, and so forth, I've published it as a book, an e-book, and it can be downloaded from my website.

130
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:29,435
So five months in.

131
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:30,736
So I'm in school.

132
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,178
I'm taking a full course load.

133
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:33,679
I've decided to major in psychology.

134
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:41,418
I'm spending more time on my Apple II game development than I am on my courses, so my grades are terrible.

135
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:43,099
I'm on the verge of flunking out.

136
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,544
But even on the Apple II, I can't find the time to work on Karateka because I've got these two other projects.

137
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:52,648
I'm trying to improve Death Bounce in response to Broderbund's publisher feedback.

138
00:12:53,923 --> 00:13:02,707
And I've taken a gig with a local startup from Yale Computer Science Department faculty to make a game to teach kids the alphabet.

139
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,108
And I'm actually getting paid for that.

140
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:11,351
They're going to pay me $3,000, which I can use to buy computer equipment, things like a printer and a disk drive and more memory.

141
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:16,013
So I have this project that I'm super excited about.

142
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:19,475
I think it's got more potential than anything, but I can't find the time to work on it.

143
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:24,018
Any game developers here think that sounds familiar?

144
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:36,646
I included this slide because the other thing that I'm perhaps spending even more time doing than working on all of my courses put together is going to the movies.

145
00:13:37,911 --> 00:14:07,231
Yale had undergraduate film societies which on 16mm film showed movies from the past decades that I was too young to have seen the first time around and foreign films like this 1982 Hungarian film which really impressed me and so I was getting this cinematic education because I wanted to be a filmmaker too as well as wanting to be a software developer and I couldn't really decide between these two careers but at Yale at that time it was not possible to major in either of them

146
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:10,492
So I mean, there were no courses in game design.

147
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,993
So I was majoring in psychology.

148
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:23,138
But this is why I had, like, it was always hard for me to find time to move ahead in my development schedule.

149
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:26,520
So this is a pivotal moment.

150
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:32,563
Seven months in, I revised my vision in a way that's inspired by Choplifter.

151
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:34,664
The idea is that now there's a story.

152
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:36,304
and there's a helicopter.

153
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:46,628
This is a modern version of a Bruce Lee movie where your helicopter lands on the roof and you have to fight your way into the bad guy's headquarters and rescue your girlfriend.

154
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:50,029
This is not a screenshot, this is a mock-up that I did in

155
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:53,290
in, well, Drax.

156
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:05,597
I should say, if anybody reading the journals is confused, after I named the versions of my program Draw 1, Draw 2, Draw 3, for a really big upgrade, I incremented the final letter instead of incrementing the number.

157
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:06,858
So Draw became Drax.

158
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:11,280
And then if you read on to the Prince of Persia journals, it became Dre and Draz.

159
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,282
So if you ever wondered what that is, now you know.

160
00:15:16,378 --> 00:15:22,583
By the way, this Bruce Lee version of Karateka had a digital timer that was ticking down.

161
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,526
You had to win before it ended.

162
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:29,610
I ended up not using that in the game, but I did use it in Prince of Persia a few years later.

163
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:40,378
So I was pretty handy, by now, with Drax, my software animation package with an installed user base of one.

164
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:49,484
But when I drew these sprites and tried to animate them, it came out kind of disappointingly choppy.

165
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:58,736
As good as swashbuckler maybe, but it wasn't the smooth animation that I was seeing in my mind's eye.

166
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:04,625
So it was my dad who suggested, you know, why don't you film somebody and look at the film as a reference.

167
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:15,919
and my mom was taking karate lessons at the local dojo and she recommended the karate teacher, Dennis, who agreed to do the karate moves for me.

168
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:23,724
So my parents had a Super 8 camera which I used to film Dennis doing these moves in profile.

169
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:26,830
That film, unfortunately, has been lost.

170
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,432
I mean, I usually try to keep stuff, as some in this room know.

171
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:34,834
But stuff disappears.

172
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:41,478
It's kind of a reminder how amazing it is that I have this much stuff left as artifacts of Karateka.

173
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:43,999
But that Super 8 film, I don't have.

174
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:47,581
I do, however, have the second Super 8 film that I shot a few months later.

175
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:48,982
And that's my dad.

176
00:16:51,163 --> 00:16:52,323
My dad does not know karate.

177
00:16:54,028 --> 00:17:03,534
But he's about the same size as my mom, so he put on her karate outfit and I asked him to run back and forth in the woods in front of our house in Chappaqua.

178
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:05,976
There's me directing.

179
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:17,203
And because it's pixel versions, you can't really tell when that character, that rotoscope character, stops being my dad and starts becoming Dennis.

180
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,091
So that's the finished game footage we're seeing there.

181
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:25,312
And there's the rotoscoped footage that I used.

182
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:27,553
My dad climbing up onto the car became climbing up a cliff.

183
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,034
There's me in my bathrobe being the bad guy.

184
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:37,718
And there's my sister, Emily, standing in for the princess.

185
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:47,164
Yeah, so now you may wonder, how did I go from Super 8 film to pixely animated sprites?

186
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:50,405
The Apple II obviously had no video in.

187
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,886
It also had no Super 8 input.

188
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:59,190
So Max Fleischer, the guy who created Popeye, actually had invented something called the rotoscope in 1915.

189
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,052
He used it later to make a really cool animated cartoon of Superman.

190
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:09,255
And rotoscope is basically just taking live action frames and tracing over them.

191
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:11,997
frame by frame to create the animation.

192
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:18,881
So I thought I could do the same thing if I could just find a way to trace the frames somehow into the Apple II.

193
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:27,147
And there was no scanner, there was nothing like that, but there was a tool that I thought I could adapt to this.

194
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:29,369
It was a graphics tablet called the VersaWriter.

195
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,611
Has anyone here ever seen one?

196
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,812
Yep, yep, I'm seeing hands.

197
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:35,233
Ah, GBC is amazing.

198
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:41,442
There's hardly a room on the planet where I would have seen hands go up there.

199
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,584
The VersaWriter was already old in 1983.

200
00:18:44,884 --> 00:18:46,604
I think it shipped in 1980.

201
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:54,267
And the Apple II had these two potentiometers that were the game paddle input used to play games.

202
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:55,808
It was perfect for space invaders.

203
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:04,391
But the makers of the VersaWriter had the insight that if you used those potentiometers for a kind of a pantograph,

204
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:10,572
you would return two values from 0 to 255 that could then be transferred into X and Y coordinates.

205
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:15,453
And Roberta Williams had used this to create the graphics for her high-rise adventures.

206
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:26,796
So, I used my AB scenes earnings to buy myself a VersaWriter, and I used it to trace

207
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:31,537
the tracings of the film frames.

208
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:34,998
And this is a frame from Replay where I've kind of redrawn that.

209
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:36,478
Anybody remember the moviola?

210
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:43,239
This is what we used to, it was for home movie editing of Super 8 film, you know, cutting and hot splicing.

211
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:56,482
So I just used the screen of the moviola to trace with a pencil on little squares of vellum each frame, actually each third frame of animation to get six frames per second.

212
00:19:57,842 --> 00:19:58,763
which I hoped would be enough.

213
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:03,606
And there, that was the process.

214
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:08,549
The next step, of course, was to trace the tracings with the VersaWriter.

215
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:15,873
So this was kind of an experiment that required a lot of upfront investment and expenditure.

216
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:16,714
I hoped it would work.

217
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:23,088
But until it was done, I didn't really know for sure.

218
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:29,020
So my journal records that kind of eureka moment when, after the laborious

219
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:43,580
three-step process of filming, getting the film developed, tracing, tracing the tracing, and then in Drax, pixel by pixel, cutting out these rectangles and then animating them just to see if it would look like motion.

220
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,521
It did.

221
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:49,545
And I mean, there was Dennis, you know, doing his punches and kicks.

222
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,265
It was magical.

223
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:52,808
So that was like a

224
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:56,114
very satisfying moment and a huge relief.

225
00:20:56,814 --> 00:21:01,859
The next question, though, was, I mean, these frames were, they were very rough and scribbly.

226
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,223
That had been one of the questions in my mind, like, would the VersaWriter work for things that were so small?

227
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:09,466
Because, like, Roberto Williams' drawings were pretty big and filled the whole screen.

228
00:21:09,806 --> 00:21:14,510
Here, we're really down to the, you know, the character that's 40 pixels high, so would it,

229
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:16,733
with

230
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:35,888
There's the cleaned up character.

231
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:38,450
And I was, of course, studying psychology at the time.

232
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:50,559
So this was also interesting to me in terms of just how our minds construct the illusion of movement, like when we're watching a movie, how we somehow imagine that the action is continuous and imagine that something is real, even though it isn't.

233
00:21:53,161 --> 00:22:04,010
So yeah, here's this journal entry, which, as usual, I was a year off in my time estimate.

234
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:16,322
But I thought I was going to finish Karateka that summer, 1983, the summer that Return of the Jedi was released and cost me at least one day of development time.

235
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:31,865
At this point, this is during summer vacation, I changed Karateka from modern to medieval Japan, inspired partly by these woodblock prints by Hokusai, which had really strong, simple compositions.

236
00:22:31,905 --> 00:22:34,326
I mean, beautiful in their own right, almost like comic book frames.

237
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:40,652
but also I thought, you know, would it adapt well to the simple graphics of the Apple II.

238
00:22:41,013 --> 00:22:47,299
There you see my scribble sketches, you know, starting to block out, you know, the various moments in the game.

239
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,962
And this is a mock-up of the first

240
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:52,438
the first gate.

241
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:09,195
I'll get to that later.

242
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:14,677
But these features that took a few minutes to draw in Drax actually took then weeks or months to implement.

243
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:20,899
So to get that gate into the screen, into the game, I had to break it down into rectangles.

244
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:26,400
Because to cut out the whole gate as one rectangle would have been super slow to draw that huge rectangle.

245
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,281
So I made as few rectangles and as small as possible.

246
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:33,342
And even so, it really slows down the game once that gate comes on screen.

247
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:40,006
I mean, the Apple II was 40 bytes across.

248
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:45,749
Each byte was seven pixels, and the high bit would flip between purple and blue, or green and orange.

249
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:48,950
The odd-numbered bits were one color.

250
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,571
The even-numbered bits were another color.

251
00:23:50,671 --> 00:24:01,998
So just the simple things like moving an object on the screen required a lot of tricks, things like pre-shifting and page flipping, lookup tables.

252
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:04,950
It took time.

253
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:13,461
This journal entry I kept, too, because it reminded me how often I played games while blasting music on the record player.

254
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:18,425
And that just somehow added the cinematic excitement that I was experiencing in my mind.

255
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:21,887
Playing Choplifter with Raiders of the Lost Ark soundtrack just made it so much better.

256
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:29,372
And the next day, I decided to put music into Karateka.

257
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:35,556
The Apple had a built-in speaker, and Woz had helpfully included a routine for playing music in the Apple II Redbook.

258
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:38,118
of

259
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:06,468
I don't have time to do the full Death Bounce post-mortem today, but with a card on your seat, you can actually play in Digital Eclipse's Making of Karateka.

260
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:13,593
You can also play Death Bounce in all its various builds, see how it evolved, and to the point where I abandoned it.

261
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:20,478
And Mike Mika has actually finished Death Bounce and updated it so that you can play it and enjoy it.

262
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:25,682
So I feel vindicated that after 40 years, Death Bounce has finally been published.

263
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:36,874
So summer 83, I didn't finish the game as I had hoped, but key elements were already in place.

264
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:39,756
It's a series of guard fights going towards a palace.

265
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:44,218
And at this point, the map ended here at the entrance to the palace.

266
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:45,039
Then there's one room.

267
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:46,479
You enter the palace.

268
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,460
You fight the bad guy.

269
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,701
There's the princess.

270
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:49,941
You win.

271
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:57,446
And I added something that, I mean, today we would call them cut scenes.

272
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:14,136
But just to kind of keep the game from being visually monotonous, after each victory, the game would cut to the villain and show him sending out the next guard, and also show the princess increasingly enthusiastic and hopeful.

273
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:19,219
And this, of course, is not a screenshot, but a Drax mock-up.

274
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:21,300
I had to cut out these pieces and put them into the game.

275
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,402
And you can see my little Scribble storyboard up at the top.

276
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:37,579
Overall, the game started out, the game design started out much more complicated and progressively got simpler in the course of development.

277
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:48,349
Originally I had different kinds of kicks, different kinds of punches, blows would do different amounts of damage depending on various factors, and also you could turn around and fight from one side to the other.

278
00:26:49,931 --> 00:26:54,575
I had all these ideas which, partly because they were so difficult to implement, but also just because

279
00:26:56,164 --> 00:27:04,233
As the game became sort of more cinematic and more of a story, like doing a detailed, authentic karate simulator became less and less a focus.

280
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:08,818
And also the controls, I wanted it all to fit onto one two-button joystick.

281
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:12,937
a lot fewer buttons than we have on today's controllers.

282
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,481
On this slide I put the word alpha because I think that's the point the game was at now.

283
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:20,982
That's the word we would use today.

284
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:28,546
And of course back then didn't have those stages of preconception, production, alpha, beta.

285
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:30,067
I just called it finishing.

286
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:38,272
This slide

287
00:27:40,109 --> 00:28:05,751
nothing to do with games but it was at this point that, you know, just from being in college and going to films, I saw Kurosawa's Seven Samurai for the first time and it blew me away, it became my favorite film and about the same time I got this big book of Disney animation which was a wonderful story told by Disney animators, early Disney animators, about how they had developed these techniques and, you know, how they had experimented

288
00:28:07,805 --> 00:28:10,866
to invent what we now call the technology and the art of animation.

289
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,267
This was so inspiring to me.

290
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:22,791
And I thought, computer games are also an art form in their infancy, like animation was for these guys and like silent film was 80 years before.

291
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:31,014
So all of these things that got discovered and added are still waiting to be discovered and added for computer games.

292
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:39,357
Obviously, with the Apple II, I couldn't do anything like the beauty and the emotional power of a Kurosawa film or a Disney animated movie.

293
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,099
But at least it sort of set the bar.

294
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,199
It created the intention.

295
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:49,122
And within what I could do, I wanted to try to get some emotion and human feeling into Karateka.

296
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:56,205
And this inspiration, this influence, arrived at a point when the game was already at alpha, but certain elements were still malleable.

297
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:58,967
And so I could still change things and still kind of scale up.

298
00:28:59,787 --> 00:29:02,316
my ambitions notably for the storytelling aspects of the game.

299
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,305
This was a Christmas break, always vacations were a chance to work on the game and get a lot done in a short time because at school there were too many distractions.

300
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:22,930
The role of my friends and family as sounding boards and input, I can't overestimate it.

301
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:30,435
It was so many of the great ideas in Karateka came from people, I was showing them and building the game and they would say, oh why don't you do this?

302
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:33,017
And in this case,

303
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:50,617
You know, I was showing the game to my dad, and I don't remember exactly how he commented, but I realized that all the arcade games that were super addictive, like Asteroids and Space Invaders and Pac-Man, had a conflict of interest.

304
00:29:51,377 --> 00:29:57,938
In Asteroids, whether it's Asteroids or Pac-Man, you've got a job to do, like clearing the screen of rocks or eating all the little dots.

305
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:03,980
But then there's also something that adds suspense, like the Flying Saucer in Asteroids can arrive at any moment, and then you have to

306
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,101
react to that.

307
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:07,583
Karateka didn't have that, it was just a series of fights.

308
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:19,335
So the idea that I came up with to add that was the hawk, that the villain would have a hawk on his shoulder and then, so you're ready for the next guard, you're gearing up for the fight, but then the hawk can arrive at any time and you sort of have to be ready for it.

309
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:24,359
And then every good game design needs a trade-off.

310
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:27,482
There can't be a dominant strategy that if you just do this, you'll win.

311
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:34,107
And in Karateka, it was the two stances, the fighting stance or the standing stance.

312
00:30:34,547 --> 00:30:38,310
So the idea that if you're standing, you can run faster, but you're vulnerable.

313
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,071
But if you're in fighting stance, you're protected.

314
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:45,075
But then it'll take you twice as long to cross the territory and have to end up fighting twice as many guards.

315
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:47,437
That was my version of the asteroid's flying saucer.

316
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:50,417
of

317
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:09,230
instead of just holding on the screen with nothing happening, the game would cut away to show the next guard running towards you.

318
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,651
And it would cut back and forth.

319
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:13,151
And there was a silent film by D.W.

320
00:31:13,191 --> 00:31:23,794
Griffith which had, you know, the hero is running towards the waterfall where his girlfriend is, I think, tied to an ice flow by the villain and is floating towards the waterfall.

321
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:28,595
So it's cutting back and forth between these two things with faster and faster rhythm as he's trying to save her.

322
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:35,281
So I thought, well, I mean, cross-cutting had to be tried for the first time in silent films.

323
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:38,424
Like, in the early films, like, there was no guarantee that that would work.

324
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:42,128
Like, wouldn't, you know, the audience be like, what happened to the hero?

325
00:31:42,228 --> 00:31:44,051
Like, why are, wait, we're in a different place.

326
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:44,671
What's going on?

327
00:31:45,212 --> 00:31:47,655
If you look at the really early silent films, they have no cross-cutting.

328
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:49,417
They just all happen in one place.

329
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:53,881
So try that for games as well.

330
00:31:53,921 --> 00:32:02,408
And again, there was the question like, will it be frustrating or confusing for the player to suddenly have their controllable character disappear from the screen and they're looking at something else?

331
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,069
Will it be frustrating, disorienting?

332
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:05,110
But it worked.

333
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:11,075
And the thing that made it work was having a different footstep sound for the hero running and for the guards coming.

334
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:16,359
Because once those two different pitch footsteps was added, suddenly it became clear and it worked.

335
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,982
And it worked so well.

336
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:21,381
that

337
00:32:43,186 --> 00:32:52,273
theme for the hero, a theme for the villain, and a theme for, you know, a love theme, and then the music kind of tells the story of the game as well as the visuals.

338
00:32:57,233 --> 00:33:02,277
One limitation, by the way, was that you could only play one note at a time with the Apple II speaker.

339
00:33:02,637 --> 00:33:17,568
And because it took all of the computer's processor power to play a note at the desired pitch, it's basically just having longer pauses before toggling that memory location, it meant that the animation on the screen had to be frozen while the note was playing.

340
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:23,933
So the cinematic animations of the game were all kind of characters striking a pose and then playing a few notes.

341
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:26,375
And then you could animate and then play another

342
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:27,796
arpeggio.

343
00:33:28,596 --> 00:33:29,397
That's how we had to do it.

344
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:53,272
So it was at this point that I eliminated the map, which had taken so much work to program, but the cross-cutting worked so well that I didn't need it, and actually it was better without it, because there was a certain suspense of like, you feel like you're gaining a lot of ground, it must be getting close to the palace, and you can see that the cross-cutting is going quicker, it's taking the guards less time to reach you, but you don't know exactly how much you have left to go.

345
00:33:54,652 --> 00:34:04,075
And I also like to eliminate things like meters and numbers, inventory, anything on the screen that kind of detracts from the composition.

346
00:34:04,195 --> 00:34:18,019
Again, I was really inspired by Hokusai's woodblock prints, and I wanted Kerateka to have a really strong, simple, clean look so that somebody could walk into the room, and even if they weren't playing, would look at it and go, oh, and kind of be drawn to the screen.

347
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,200
So the map had to go.

348
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:34,277
Another really important element that I added at this point, fairly late, and again I think it was my dad who was watching and saying, I can't tell who's winning watching you fight.

349
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:45,640
And I realized that the sound alone wasn't enough, so I added these, what today would be called GUI, but I just put these comic book stars on top of the

350
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:52,915
the animation to show when a blow landed and it was like orange or blue depending on which character it hit.

351
00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:55,116
So that helped make the fights a lot more readable.

352
00:34:55,436 --> 00:34:59,778
You could also see where you'd gotten hit, like if it was in the head or in the middle.

353
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:07,260
Also, my journal reminds me that at this point I decided to change the title of the game and to call it Black Belt.

354
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:11,702
That didn't last too long.

355
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:23,323
So these are the frames of the climbing up cliff that I filmed my dad with the car.

356
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:30,106
And so you can sort of see how it went from the sketch, the storyboard sketch, to the Super 8, to the tracings, to the sprites.

357
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:37,170
And the Digital Eclipse product has a wonderful feature called the rotoscope theater, where you can actually

358
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:43,472
overlay these layers and you can try to see this animation in different ways and play with it yourself.

359
00:35:43,492 --> 00:35:47,893
So kind of get a feeling of what that rotoscope process was like in an interactive way.

360
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:54,594
Another late but really important change.

361
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:59,775
Until now I'd been using the same animations for the hero and the enemies.

362
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:02,776
They were all the same and it was actually the same shapes just mirrored.

363
00:36:03,843 --> 00:36:03,983
but

364
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:23,855
you have

365
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:49,180
suddenly you had enough time to see what the enemy was doing and react fast enough to change your next move.

366
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,301
Like, oh, he's hitting me, I'm going to back up.

367
00:36:51,681 --> 00:36:53,541
Or he's vulnerable, now I'm going to kick.

368
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:59,344
So now, for the first time, again, so late in development, Karateka became more than just button mashing.

369
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:09,003
I mean

370
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,712
Sometimes features get cut.

371
00:37:33,774 --> 00:37:36,337
By the way, the hawk is something that at this point I still hadn't implemented.

372
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:39,960
I was still debating in my journal that I might have to cut the hawk.

373
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,201
It's just going to be too much work.

374
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:43,242
There's no time to put it in, but the game needs it.

375
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:48,587
Here's one feature that I left in, even though looking back it's completely optional.

376
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:50,348
When you back up all the way to the left,

377
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:52,470
and you fall off the cliff.

378
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:09,661
I mean, I thought it was logical.

379
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:10,741
I thought it was funny.

380
00:38:10,942 --> 00:38:20,828
And I always feel that every chance to use an existing game mechanic in a new way makes the game richer and more coherent and is valuable.

381
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:25,271
And in this case, Karateka had so few game mechanics, and one of them is moving from left to right.

382
00:38:26,172 --> 00:38:30,455
So if you move too far to the left, it wasn't.

383
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:35,438
Anyway, I was determined to keep the falling off the cliff in, and I did.

384
00:38:37,237 --> 00:38:44,505
The text prologue was also a ridiculous amount of work to program because I'm inspired obviously by Star Wars.

385
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:48,229
I was reading George Lucas's biography at the time.

386
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:54,096
It's probably what I was reading 40 years ago today in March 1984.

387
00:38:55,537 --> 00:38:58,000
According to my journal, I mentioned that book.

388
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:14,166
But that text prologue, which I thought gave such a cinematic feel, I had to copy and paste each line of pixels and redraw it one line up, which is why it has that sort of choppy feel.

389
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,667
And it's kind of slow.

390
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:22,033
But I thought the scrolling kind of gave it a certain gravitas.

391
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,414
So I took the time to do that.

392
00:39:46,855 --> 00:39:49,837
Anybody in this room have, yeah.

393
00:39:50,578 --> 00:39:54,801
Sorry if this triggers traumatic childhood memories.

394
00:39:59,238 --> 00:40:02,260
I have this sketch where I first drew the puzzle.

395
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,722
I actually considered several different options.

396
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:13,788
There was one that was more forgiving and one that was even more brutal, where you actually had to bow, which was impossible.

397
00:40:13,808 --> 00:40:19,332
So I took that one out, which I thought was kind of a shame because there was really no use for the bowing mechanic in the game.

398
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:22,954
It's just kind of a nice optional thing that has no real function.

399
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:32,001
I mean, it's harsh because you have to start over from the beginning of the game, after having fought and won all those battles.

400
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:45,367
You could say it's a little unfair, but I thought it was logical because, you know, the princess has been waiting in this cell in the enemy's palace and suddenly the door gets kicked down and some guy in a karate suit walks up to her in fighting stance.

401
00:40:45,427 --> 00:40:45,947
What's she going to do?

402
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:47,168
Of course she's going to defend herself.

403
00:40:49,893 --> 00:40:57,172
The game has so few controls that switching between fighting stance and standing stance is one, so I wanted to use it.

404
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:02,093
I did find the memory to add the hawk.

405
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:08,035
At this point, as this DRAX screenshot shows me, the hawk was purple.

406
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:17,300
I wanted to use more colors, but any Apple II programmers here will immediately understand why that made my life a misery and created all kinds of ugliness.

407
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,320
It's that high bit.

408
00:41:19,201 --> 00:41:24,243
You know, it was just better for the whole game to be orange and blue with no green and no purple.

409
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:28,525
So

410
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:36,938
This is the version, this is the point at which I put the game on a floppy disk and sent it to BrÃ¸derbund.

411
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,280
There's the cover letter.

412
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:43,944
I also submitted it simultaneously to Electronic Arts.

413
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:45,886
They actually didn't answer.

414
00:41:45,946 --> 00:41:50,369
If they had, my life would have branched in a way I can't even fathom.

415
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:51,270
Everything would have been different.

416
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,933
This is me with my mom and my other sister, Linda, before I left for California.

417
00:41:58,854 --> 00:42:00,316
We're at my cousin's high school graduation.

418
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:11,906
I was 19, and I would say this is the moment where my childhood ends and my life as an adult software developer begins, because this is when I took the plane to Broderbund.

419
00:42:11,926 --> 00:42:18,532
Yeah, I mean,

420
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:22,636
I'm

421
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:46,667
I guess today you'd call them game designers, because they were at Vertebrand, but they were not programmers, and they weren't responsible for developing a game, and yet their input was creative.

422
00:42:48,828 --> 00:42:51,150
This is where I met Danny Gorland, the creator of

423
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:53,411
Choplifter.

424
00:42:53,431 --> 00:42:57,893
This is a screenshot from his next game, Airheart, which he was in the course of developing and which he showed me.

425
00:42:58,353 --> 00:43:04,335
So you can imagine, like, what this meant to me, to meet these people who I had seen in the pages of Soft Talk magazine.

426
00:43:04,355 --> 00:43:06,275
I had seen their names on title screens.

427
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:11,017
Now I was actually meeting them and they were talking to me like normal people.

428
00:43:11,857 --> 00:43:12,937
I was completely starstruck.

429
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:21,180
One of the first things that happened was the other programmers at Birdobin kind of took me out for beer and pizza and they just

430
00:43:23,405 --> 00:43:27,946
told me how I'd missed the golden age, how things had been so awesome a few years before.

431
00:43:29,546 --> 00:43:36,588
You know, when Broderbund was a small company that cared about quality and cared about its employees, and now it was just a big corporation.

432
00:43:37,008 --> 00:43:38,028
It was all about profits.

433
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:43,849
And so this is the 1981 article that I'd read about Broderbund that made me want to work with him in the first place.

434
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:48,690
So by 1984, you know, that first round of programmers felt that, you know, those days were gone.

435
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:51,071
I wrote in my journal

436
00:43:52,152 --> 00:43:54,133
after I got back from that beer and pizza night.

437
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:55,514
Yeah, it was inevitable.

438
00:43:56,214 --> 00:43:58,815
Computers aren't just for hackers and hobbyists anymore.

439
00:43:59,656 --> 00:44:00,576
They're for the mass market.

440
00:44:02,457 --> 00:44:09,881
So for anyone here who feels like you were just born too late and you missed the golden age, don't worry.

441
00:44:10,221 --> 00:44:20,026
There will come a time when you'll talk about the game development adventures you're having now, and people will react the way that you're reacting now to this.

442
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:32,773
The Rubber Room is where Gene and Lauren kind of, Gene was a former Disney animator, and they had skills beyond anything that I had ever seen before.

443
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:41,038
Lauren animated a leopard, a running, leaping leopard that was going to be another enemy in the game to add to the villain's menagerie.

444
00:44:41,118 --> 00:44:42,199
It is like, OK, he's got a hawk.

445
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:43,459
He's also got a leopard.

446
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,561
And Gene drew that.

447
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:48,703
That was his first draft of the palace that's at the beginning of the game.

448
00:44:51,184 --> 00:44:52,205
The Rubber Room was a room that I

449
00:44:53,052 --> 00:44:53,132
is

450
00:45:12,733 --> 00:45:16,856
as literally the castle on the title screen as you see it.

451
00:45:17,196 --> 00:45:27,243
So my main job that summer was to add two more levels so that in the top you see my submission version where the game ends right after you enter the palace.

452
00:45:27,263 --> 00:45:30,185
There's just a room, you fight the bad guy, game over.

453
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:33,747
And then the bottom version where that room turns into a whole corridor.

454
00:45:34,228 --> 00:45:35,909
You have to fight a whole other series of guards.

455
00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:38,350
There's that gate trap at the end.

456
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,351
I'm sorry about that.

457
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:45,972
And then down below, there's another series of rooms and a dungeon before you get to the princess.

458
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:52,075
And I also should mention that that summer, Karate Kid came out.

459
00:45:52,655 --> 00:45:53,436
It was playing in theaters.

460
00:45:53,476 --> 00:45:54,276
It was a huge hit.

461
00:45:54,656 --> 00:45:56,017
Everybody was talking about karate.

462
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:57,118
Karate was in the zeitgeist.

463
00:45:57,478 --> 00:46:00,259
And I was terrified that, once again, I've missed the boat.

464
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,941
And there's going to be another Apple II karate game first.

465
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:05,722
And nobody's going to care about this one.

466
00:46:06,383 --> 00:46:08,984
So that sort of added to my sense of pressure to finish the game.

467
00:46:13,628 --> 00:46:14,628
So this is interesting.

468
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:23,570
This was one of the things that I learned at Berterbund, meeting real programmers for the first time, who explained to me better ways to do things that I'd never thought of before.

469
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:35,212
The lookup table, so simply, instead of calculating the position of every pixel, you just create a table of 192 values, because there's only 192 vertical lines on the screen.

470
00:46:36,012 --> 00:46:37,912
And then you just look up the one you want.

471
00:46:37,932 --> 00:46:41,373
That lets you animate much faster, because it's faster to look up than to calculate.

472
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:42,433
and

473
00:46:57,442 --> 00:47:03,764
So we went into Doug's office and showed him this version, and said, look, we can put this on the B side of the disk.

474
00:47:04,484 --> 00:47:11,046
So that if anybody accidentally puts the disk into the drive upside down, it'll be playing upside down, but they won't know what they did.

475
00:47:11,066 --> 00:47:11,987
And they'll be like, what?

476
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:12,487
What?

477
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:15,528
Is it something with the computer?

478
00:47:15,748 --> 00:47:17,828
And so they'll end up calling tech support.

479
00:47:18,448 --> 00:47:22,590
And then Birderman tech support can say, well, sir, have you checked the disk?

480
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:26,415
because maybe the disk is upside down in the drive.

481
00:47:26,876 --> 00:47:28,538
And so they, okay, thank you, that fixed it.

482
00:47:31,343 --> 00:47:35,149
And who knows, maybe then they would just go on thinking that that's the way software works.

483
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:48,413
We didn't really think Doug would agree to do it, because as the CEO, he has to be aware of profits.

484
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:54,516
And the cost of goods increased, because this meant that disks were duplicated on an assembly line.

485
00:47:54,556 --> 00:48:04,159
So somebody had to actually flip the disk over manually and press another button to record data on the B side of the disk, which normally was empty.

486
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:08,981
So we never thought he would agree, but he did for some reason.

487
00:48:17,003 --> 00:48:22,347
Another late change of the strength bars became discrete triangles.

488
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:25,329
And again, this was another step in the direction of simplicity.

489
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:31,173
Because I had this whole system of, you know, if you do this, this way, if the enemy's doing that, the blow does more damage or less damage.

490
00:48:31,513 --> 00:48:34,615
But all of that calculation, I finally realized, it's not adding to the player's enjoyment.

491
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:37,737
What does add to the enjoyment is a feeling of suspense.

492
00:48:38,058 --> 00:48:39,358
That, you know, OK, I'm one hit away.

493
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:41,280
If I hit him once, I win.

494
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,982
Or if you're down to one hit, if he hits me once,

495
00:48:44,702 --> 00:48:45,002
I'm dead.

496
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:50,907
So that suspense was more valuable than the subtleties of karate fighting.

497
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:56,992
There's so many forks in the road in the development over two or three years.

498
00:48:57,412 --> 00:49:01,015
Every choice you make, there's always reasons on both sides.

499
00:49:01,075 --> 00:49:09,502
But ultimately, in retrospect, I can see that I was just making the choices that would take this away from being a karate simulation and more towards being a kind of interactive movie.

500
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:15,285
At some point, you kind of realize what's the strongest thing about the game.

501
00:49:15,925 --> 00:49:17,988
What's the thing that you should just double down on?

502
00:49:18,508 --> 00:49:20,691
And for Care to Take It, it was that.

503
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,712
So package design.

504
00:49:26,952 --> 00:49:34,157
In those days, they still consulted programmers about things like box copy and how the game was going to be presented.

505
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:35,918
Or maybe it was just me.

506
00:49:35,978 --> 00:49:36,279
I don't know.

507
00:49:36,299 --> 00:49:40,301
I just kind of annoyed the marketing people by wanting to be involved in this process.

508
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:45,365
But there's an early box sketch, as you can see, clearly inspired by the Star Wars movie posters.

509
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:52,617
and the box copy, which, again, I didn't like the marketing department's version, so I kept trying to rewrite it.

510
00:49:58,658 --> 00:50:03,380
So by the time the game was finished, at some point, the summer ended, I had to go back to school.

511
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,621
Nobody thought I would.

512
00:50:04,981 --> 00:50:16,766
Most of the Broderbund other programmers had either gone there straight out of high school, you know, and some of them actually had not finished high school because they got a programming job and that seemed more important.

513
00:50:17,046 --> 00:50:19,867
So I think everybody kind of thought, ah, when September comes around, he's going to stay.

514
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:23,470
but for some reason I was determined to go back and finish university.

515
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,851
And so I did, although the game was not finished.

516
00:50:26,292 --> 00:50:31,936
So the final touches, the copy protection and all that stuff, had to do remotely, mailing disks back and forth.

517
00:50:32,517 --> 00:50:38,882
And here's a note from Roland Gustafson, the wizard who did the copy protection for all of Vertebran's games.

518
00:50:39,482 --> 00:50:41,964
Copy protection was like putting a frame on a painting.

519
00:50:42,685 --> 00:50:45,767
It meant that, of course, every disc was crackable.

520
00:50:46,267 --> 00:51:03,815
But trying to make it uncrackable or more difficult to crack, it was like this sort of fun competition between Roland and the pirates, who would then call him from Sweden or wherever to exult in the cleverness that they had found in defeating his copy protection mechanisms.

521
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:07,517
So it was definitely serious and also good fun.

522
00:51:07,537 --> 00:51:11,579
I want to see a GDC classic copy protection post-mortem.

523
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:15,440
And I want to hear Roland talk about that.

524
00:51:17,361 --> 00:51:23,164
The leopard, tragically, once I was back at school, I decided that we had to cut it.

525
00:51:23,284 --> 00:51:24,804
It just couldn't make it at the game.

526
00:51:24,844 --> 00:51:26,445
It broke everyone's heart, including mine.

527
00:51:26,805 --> 00:51:27,806
It was already animated.

528
00:51:27,866 --> 00:51:28,946
Lauren did a beautiful job.

529
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:37,030
This was echoed 19 years later when we had to cut the sand griffin from Prince of Persia, the sands of time, in order to ship by Christmas.

530
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,384
the villains biggest monster, biggest pet that you never get to fight.

531
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:53,259
The final box art was a beautiful painting done by Thomas Blackshear, who I recently found out, thanks to Twitter, is an incredible artist.

532
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:54,479
He has an amazing body of work.

533
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:55,400
He shows at museums.

534
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:00,061
And the original painting is at the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester.

535
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:03,982
I was really lucky to have an artist of this caliber do the art for Karateka.

536
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:09,784
And that note in the middle, that was Gene Portwood, who sent me the comp by mail, of course.

537
00:52:10,704 --> 00:52:12,344
It goes without no need to repeat.

538
00:52:12,364 --> 00:52:14,965
There was no internet, so everything was done by mail.

539
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:29,545
So when the game shipped, I was... It was kind of remote and kind of abstract to me because I was told... I knew that it was in stores, but there were no computer stores, you know, on campus.

540
00:52:30,386 --> 00:52:32,186
I'd gotten one shrink-wrapped copy in the mail.

541
00:52:33,847 --> 00:52:38,509
So, you know, I was kind of just waiting to hear, like, are people playing it?

542
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:39,250
Do they like it?

543
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:44,272
Occasionally, like, I would get some mail from BrÃ¸derbund with a, you know,

544
00:52:45,137 --> 00:52:45,357
a little

545
00:53:03,423 --> 00:53:13,734
This was about the time that I upgraded my Smith Corona portable typewriter to a Mac, 128K Mac, which Apple had a special deal with colleges for a student discount.

546
00:53:14,114 --> 00:53:19,920
So this was right about the time that computers, Macs, started to appear outside of my own dorm room.

547
00:53:20,441 --> 00:53:25,646
There was now a room in the basement which had Macs and printers so you could actually use them to write papers and so forth.

548
00:53:27,699 --> 00:53:31,620
Down the hall was David Pogue, who was one of the other first people to have a Mac.

549
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,541
And I remember we would exchange disks, fonts, things like that.

550
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:43,663
Veda Cook did the ports to the Commodore 64 and Amiga.

551
00:53:43,683 --> 00:53:54,166
So for anyone who played those versions and is curious about the differences with the Apple II version, the Digital Eclipse Making of Karateka has interviews with Veda and those versions.

552
00:53:55,026 --> 00:54:06,553
which really go into detail about the capabilities of those machines and the kind of the artisanal choices and craft needed to basically remake the game for a different machine that had different strengths and weaknesses.

553
00:54:06,633 --> 00:54:13,337
One of the strengths of both the Atari and Commodore was that you could play real music with chords, not just one note at a time.

554
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:16,299
And so my dad reorchestrated the music to take advantage of that.

555
00:54:20,201 --> 00:54:20,381
So,

556
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:30,776
Yeah, so I got my first letters from players, from people who had played Karateka and gave me feedback.

557
00:54:31,397 --> 00:54:42,381
And of course, before Twitter and the internet, that meant that the person had to put the letter in an envelope, put a stamp on the envelope, and mail it to BrÃ¸derbund, who would then mail it to me at college.

558
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:46,463
And one of the first letters I got was from John Romero.

559
00:54:48,206 --> 00:54:48,266
of

560
00:55:10,234 --> 00:55:13,496
And so when I got home, I still had the letter.

561
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:22,122
And sure enough, with this wonderful header font and everything, it was the second fan letter I ever got.

562
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:24,263
So John says I answered him.

563
00:55:24,823 --> 00:55:25,404
I hope I did.

564
00:55:25,424 --> 00:55:25,944
I'm glad.

565
00:55:27,065 --> 00:55:29,206
Maybe someday he'll find whatever I wrote back.

566
00:55:33,162 --> 00:55:40,426
Softtalk by now, sadly, had gone out of business a few months earlier, so I never, Karateka never made it into the Softtalk top 30.

567
00:55:41,206 --> 00:55:43,888
But Billboard magazine had started tracking software bestsellers.

568
00:55:44,688 --> 00:55:53,573
So in April 1985, I got the amazing news that Karateka was the number one selling game.

569
00:55:53,774 --> 00:55:55,955
My high school dream had been realized.

570
00:55:57,608 --> 00:55:59,089
That's how I became a published game author.

571
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:06,374
And this is where my making of Karateka journal ends and becomes the making of Prince of Persia, which is another story.

572
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:23,625
So if you need to run, my website has more info behind the scenes about making Karateka video and my graphic novel replay as well, which I'm now going to, I think we have a few minutes for questions, and then I'm going to head down to the GDC bookstore

573
00:56:26,164 --> 00:56:30,407
Starting at one, I'll be signing Replay, my graphic novel memoir.

574
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:38,193
This is the project that's consumed my last three years just as fully as making Karateka consumed me 40 years ago.

575
00:56:38,373 --> 00:56:53,344
It's my memoir of making games in the form of a graphic novel, and it's also the story of my family, including my dad, his childhood adventures as a refugee in World War II, long before he composed the music for Karateka.

576
00:56:57,509 --> 00:57:07,497
And I have to mention, if the little card that you found on your seat when you sat down has a smiley face on it, you have a free copy of Replay waiting for you at the GDC bookstore.

577
00:57:08,398 --> 00:57:10,280
Thank you.

578
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:13,422
Thank you all for coming.

579
00:57:25,334 --> 00:57:34,056
In 1984, you used to say, my goal for this summer is to finish Karateka.

580
00:57:34,116 --> 00:57:39,897
If it is as big as I dream it might be, it should be enough to launch me to the video game world.

581
00:57:39,977 --> 00:57:42,998
After 40 years, how do you feel about your sentence?

582
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:53,483
Well, I think it worked.

583
00:57:53,523 --> 00:57:57,006
I think Karateka launched me into the video game world, just as I was hoping.

584
00:57:57,847 --> 00:58:01,229
It's rare that we make a plan and it actually comes true.

585
00:58:08,115 --> 00:58:09,617
Thank you for a very interesting talk.

586
00:58:10,818 --> 00:58:13,520
I'm really inspired by your journaling skills as well.

587
00:58:13,801 --> 00:58:21,248
Do you have any tips, or after so many years of journaling, how you can keep it up over the years and anything else?

588
00:58:21,536 --> 00:58:24,297
Yeah, I think the key is to make it a habit.

589
00:58:24,898 --> 00:58:25,918
Habits are so powerful.

590
00:58:26,038 --> 00:58:30,020
You get the habit of picking up your guitar and strumming a few chords every day.

591
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,221
At the end of 10 years, you're an amazing guitarist.

592
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:40,085
I developed a habit of sketching, just drawing what I see around me at cafes and game developers conferences.

593
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:44,268
And somehow I learned to draw and ended up drawing this graphic novel.

594
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:50,672
With the journal, I just developed the habit that at the end of every day, I would just write a few lines.

595
00:58:51,172 --> 00:58:55,155
And once it becomes a habit, it's harder to not do it than it is to do it.

596
00:58:55,916 --> 00:59:05,783
And some habits can be negative, like reaching for that, whether it's the box of chocolate chip cookies that you pick up at the grocery store on your way home, or that fourth espresso.

597
00:59:07,705 --> 00:59:13,549
But journaling is a really positive habit that I'm really grateful to have started it so early.

598
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:16,487
I have a question.

599
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:20,630
Since it is GDC, I feel like the technical question is warranted.

600
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:24,334
This is before hitboxes or hurtboxes or anything.

601
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,335
So how were you actually calculating contact?

602
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:31,600
Like, what made you decide, okay, this aspect of the sprite is the hit and this is the hurtbox.

603
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,762
Like, what were you doing to calculate all the interactions?

604
00:59:34,242 --> 00:59:36,244
Well, the Apple II had no concept of a sprite.

605
00:59:36,764 --> 00:59:37,265
Right, exactly.

606
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:38,726
So they're just pixels on the screen.

607
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,948
So it's really up to the programmer.

608
00:59:41,288 --> 00:59:42,970
In this case, I had, like, I was tracking the

609
00:59:44,502 --> 00:59:49,666
you know, the distance, you know, the X and Y coordinates of the player and the enemy so I could tell how far apart they were.

610
00:59:50,226 --> 01:00:06,698
And I knew what frame of animation each one of them was on so I could say, okay, so this frame, like if you're fully extended and a kick and you're this close to the other character and they're not in one of these three poses that would qualify as a dodge, then it qualifies as a hit, therefore branch into the hit reaction.

611
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:11,421
And then, of course, as to what is the hit reaction, again, it's code.

612
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:17,244
So I could say, well, if you're in this position, like if you're in the midst of punching, then it cancels your punch.

613
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:20,146
But if you're already this far, then your blow is going to land as well.

614
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:26,770
But all of that was sort of hand-tuned and handmade, basically.

615
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:35,455
Mike actually asked at one point, when he was doing the Karateka remaster that's in the Digital Eclipse game, how exactly did the

616
01:00:36,676 --> 01:00:36,736
in

617
01:00:58,359 --> 01:01:03,282
I think now is probably a good time to wrap it up.

618
01:01:03,342 --> 01:01:07,045
It's going to take probably a few minutes to walk over to the North Hall.

619
01:01:07,365 --> 01:01:13,650
I hope some of you will come, and if you have somewhere to be and you can't come to the signing, maybe we'll run into each other later.

620
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:19,073
If you enjoy graphic novels or if you're curious, please check it out.

621
01:01:20,214 --> 01:01:31,933
If you hate graphic novels and have no interest, but you feel a little bit guilty for having pirated Karateka in your childhood, and you just want to support my current creative efforts, then there's copies at the GDC bookstore.

622
01:01:32,193 --> 01:01:32,494
Thank you.
