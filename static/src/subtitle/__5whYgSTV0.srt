1
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:08,783
This is something we decided to throw in here. Steve's idea. We

2
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:12,107
always talk about the really cool things that we do in AI.

3
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:15,972
And wow, we had great success using this architecture or this

4
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:16,573
technique.

5
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:21,024
What about when things get really horked up? Completely.

6
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:25,247
Because there's educational value in that. Those of you who have read Post Mortems in the past,

7
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:29,109
it's what went right, what went wrong, and what did we learn from it.

8
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:33,372
So I think it's time for a little bit of what went wrong and what we can learn from it.

9
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:36,435
So I'm not going to bother introducing these guys, you know most of them anyway,

10
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:38,156
but we're going to kick things off with Steve Rabin.

11
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:41,638
Tales from the Tent, Trenches, AI Disaster Stories.

12
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:54,709
the portable mic. Here we go. Okay. So I'm going to tell you

13
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:58,470
about Microsoft baseball 3D. What? Microsoft made a baseball

14
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,333
game? When did this happen? This happened in 1998. Actually I was

15
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:05,714
working for a small company called Whiz Bang and only about

16
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:09,236
ten people. And we made the code side and Microsoft did the

17
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:13,237
animation and the graphics for this thing. But in 1998 I gave a

18
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:18,580
game developers talk on the cooperation in this game,

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,221
the AI cooperation between the players,

20
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:24,443
and I'm actually still proud of that work today.

21
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:27,385
But it's interesting to come back 17 years later

22
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:30,046
and tell you all the horrible things that happened.

23
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:32,448
Okay, disaster number one.

24
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:34,649
Why were we making a baseball game?

25
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:37,337
I kind of know why we were making a baseball game.

26
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:40,300
Well, see, nobody at the company was that big a fan of baseball.

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,621
Why were we doing this?

28
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:44,503
But I know kind of why, because we just

29
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:46,025
had made Activision's Hyperblade,

30
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:48,146
and there just weren't that many companies in the world who

31
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:49,688
knew how to make 3D games at that point.

32
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:54,372
But this was a huge disaster, because me,

33
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,733
I was the sole AI programmer.

34
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,555
I didn't know baseball well enough.

35
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:00,298
and I didn't have that bullshit detector

36
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:03,519
so that when I made behavior, it looked reasonable,

37
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,579
but to someone who really knows the game, it's wrong.

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,460
And I was missing that.

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,841
And it's a huge detriment if no one in the company

40
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,081
has that detector.

41
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,262
Disaster number two was the program manager at Microsoft

42
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:19,222
happened to also be the game designer,

43
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:22,583
and his solution to telling me how to design the AI

44
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,563
was to hand me this book.

45
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:27,053
which had about 120 diagrams like this.

46
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:29,174
And so you can imagine that's a,

47
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:30,735
you know, there's no me, you know,

48
00:02:30,915 --> 00:02:32,896
you don't know why anyone's doing what they're doing.

49
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:34,797
It just says, yeah, go in this direction

50
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,258
if this thing happens.

51
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,280
So another ridiculous disaster.

52
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,981
And he wasn't even on site,

53
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,562
so I couldn't even talk to him easily.

54
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,884
He was at Microsoft, I was at this little company.

55
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:47,605
Disaster number three is what happens

56
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,668
when you combine a megalomaniac with an advanced degree

57
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:53,549
who's also one of the owners of the company?

58
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,861
The answer is you get a custom scripting language

59
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:57,642
is what you get.

60
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:58,202
And it was shit.

61
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,068
and I was the only one programming in it.

62
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:09,549
Like, the reason I have a scripting language

63
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,749
is maybe I have lots of designers using it or something,

64
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:15,851
but it's just the errors in it were non-existent

65
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:16,651
to compile errors,

66
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:18,752
and you couldn't debug it for anything,

67
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:20,793
and one of the benefits of a scripting language

68
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,514
is you could reload it while the game's running.

69
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,674
Well, it wasn't trustworthy enough to do that.

70
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:31,219
Probably took 10 times as long to do anything using this thing.

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,883
Disaster number four was a two year long project and for about the first year we had no 3D graphics.

72
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:41,387
And so I had to do all the AI on, this isn't it, I found this on the web, but something that looked like this.

73
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:43,409
I was making a 2D baseball game really.

74
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:49,754
And I was getting bug reports on how this wasn't right and so I'm fixing it, but I'm hyper-optimizing the damn thing to 2D.

75
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:52,936
And once we did get to 3D, oh my god, it was terrible.

76
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:55,818
people aren't facing the right way. The transitions look like

77
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,483
crap. Half of the AI really is making it look good. And it was

78
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:04,685
sort of just we've gone ‑‑ I made a great 2D baseball game is

79
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:08,948
what I did. So this was kind of horrible. The last thing, kind

80
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:13,551
of an animation thing, but AI is so hooked to animation. And

81
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:15,933
this was touted as a feature. Like our company had this

82
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:20,196
technology was the animation drives the motion. Notice how

83
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:22,558
his right foot is nailed to the ground.

84
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:25,563
Now this is a ridiculous example of it,

85
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,723
but as an AI programmer,

86
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:30,064
to get people to move somewhere,

87
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,345
I had to start an animation and hope the feet

88
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:34,025
would drive them in the right direction

89
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:36,646
and sort of twist the hips to get them steering right.

90
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:38,086
And when I got to the right spot,

91
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:40,526
I'd just slurp to a stand or something like that.

92
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,667
Another example is this guy who's rounding third base.

93
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,688
Kind of notice he doesn't touch the base.

94
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:50,268
That's sort of an important part of baseball.

95
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,265
But there was just nothing in the animation engine to make

96
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:56,925
this happen.

97
00:04:59,268 --> 00:04:59,809
Here's another.

98
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,012
Here's the pitcher walking up to the mound.

99
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,355
You can see it's kind of this stilted animation.

100
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,297
His ankles and stuff don't move right.

101
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:08,059
So walking looks a little weird.

102
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,743
And then he slurps at the end anyway, so his feet slide.

103
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:11,884
So like, what the hell?

104
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:15,937
Okay. Last thing I want to tell you about this is that something

105
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:20,301
actually very funny happened is one day we imported the batter

106
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:23,984
character and he came into the game as just a puddle of

107
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:28,367
polygons. He stepped into a teleporter as a fully formed

108
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:31,250
human being and he came out the other side as just tangled mesh

109
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,772
of polygons with a bat sticking out of them. Because he was

110
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,613
still holding a bat.

111
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:39,587
Well, this system was so robust that somewhere there were feet

112
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:43,470
in those polygons and this poor thing was trying to wiggle

113
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,953
toward the plate. And it was slowly making progress. And the

114
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,815
whole time this bat is like waving like a flag out of the

115
00:05:51,855 --> 00:05:57,578
puddle as he's walking up to the ‑‑ that was awesome. I wish

116
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:00,780
I had a movie. I'm sorry. Okay. Please learn from these

117
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,121
disasters. Thank you.

118
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:15,580
Does this work, too? Can everybody hear me? All right. I

119
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:20,705
have a couple of little, a couple of stories, actually. The

120
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:25,348
first one happened probably a little after you, probably like

121
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:31,553
2000, 2001. And it was a game. It was probably 15 levels or so.

122
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:34,656
I'm not going to name any names. I'm not that person. So...

123
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:40,849
This is not a screen shot of it even but it's very representative. It was a fairly realistic

124
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:47,212
world. There was a lot of stuff in it. And we were about, I want to say two weeks from going to a

125
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:53,856
wide beta. And this was somewhat early on when it was a PC game and it was when a lot of games

126
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:59,478
were having their editors released with the title itself. So it was, you know, you could

127
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:03,460
fuss with the levels and that kind of thing. And it was, like I said, it was a couple weeks

128
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,281
before open beta.

129
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:08,258
and there was some AI issue where the AI's couldn't get into

130
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:11,299
a particular spot and I figured what it was was the classic,

131
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:16,181
right? The, the, um, some object had a bounding sphere on it that

132
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,601
was too big and the guy couldn't squeeze by even though he

133
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:21,422
thought he could. So I went into the editor and I clicked on that

134
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:25,163
particular Coke machine and, uh, sure enough, you know, great big

135
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:27,884
sphere on it. So I'm moving it down and out of the corner of my

136
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:31,105
eye I just happened to like glance at the name of this

137
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:33,726
particular object. And it was,

138
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:38,208
quite possibly the most offensive thing I have ever read

139
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:43,292
in my entire life. And I was like, who is the level editor on

140
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:46,875
this game? Who is building these levels? Because I started

141
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:48,916
clicking around because it wasn't just this Coke machine.

142
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:53,800
It was every stupid little object in this level had a crazy

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,684
racist or offensive or some form of just ungodly name. Like

144
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:01,946
every single object in the game. And it turns out it was our

145
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:03,868
best level designer, he had had like

146
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:08,109
seven or eight of the 15 levels were just him. We counted it up.

147
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:12,893
I think there was over 4,000 like horrid things. Accordingly,

148
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,955
apparently over the course of this guy's career, this was his

149
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,497
thing. Like he was this very, you would never guess, very

150
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:21,739
quiet kind of hi, guys, how's it going? And what he liked to do

151
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,381
when he named levels objects was like just go berserk. Like that

152
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,764
was where he got rid of his anger, I guess. And so the

153
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:31,165
problem was, is that this was going to go out into the world

154
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:33,687
and anybody that wanted to could open the level.

155
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:39,587
never happened before apparently. So he was okay up until this

156
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:44,832
point. So what we ended up doing was we ended up using the

157
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:52,119
vulgarity filter in the editor. And it worked out well because

158
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,602
not only could we find all of the instances of, you know, we

159
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:59,406
also put him in a corner and said get to work, guy. But then

160
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:01,508
if somebody else using the editor out in the world.

161
00:09:02,204 --> 00:09:04,547
made their own map it wouldn't let you save it until you

162
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:08,651
changed anything that was vulgar or whatever. Anyways, that was

163
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:09,092
that one.

164
00:09:12,123 --> 00:09:16,925
The other one, this is later, this is when I was at Sony. I've talked about that giant engine I did

165
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:22,988
for the basketball game at Sony several times. And it was a huge hierarchical expert system.

166
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:27,271
And over the course of years, because it was a basketball game, we were iterating on it every

167
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:32,413
year. So content kept going more and more and more. And by the end, there was like 6 megs of

168
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:39,517
XML AI data in this engine. It was huge, right? So it was this huge tree. And we had shipped

169
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:44,895
And we were like, I want to say like a month or so into

170
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:48,716
pre-production on the next year. And one of the designers who

171
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:53,378
had had like a huge chunk of the tree kind of to himself the year

172
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,539
before, he came to me and he said, hey, you know, I'm having

173
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,440
problems with this one situation. It just won't seem to

174
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,242
fire. And so I go in there and I'm looking at him. And I said,

175
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:06,304
oh, oh, well, you know, this you've got this thing commented

176
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,745
out here. And he just went white.

177
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,193
And so basically if you think about he had wanted to test out

178
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:17,315
this particular part of the tree, let's say, and see how

179
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:21,458
it's a two branch right there over here is the other side. And

180
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:25,760
so he just didn't want the AI in any way to use that side. He

181
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,562
just wanted to test out the other one. So he just put a

182
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:32,605
comment out right there. Right? Well, when he went white, I

183
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:37,068
said, well, when did you comment this out? And he said, a few

184
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:37,508
months ago.

185
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:44,924
And so effectively this poor guy had commented out 75% of the

186
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:53,887
year's worth of work and we had shipped it. And tough noogies for

187
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:57,768
him. Now luckily the AI system was robust enough that it still

188
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,589
looked like basketball and luckily also he had been working

189
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,150
on ball handler types that were not in the top ten most played

190
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,891
teams. So nobody really noticed.

191
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:11,044
lucky for him. Not only that, but we got a nice feature that

192
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:18,889
was done for next year's game for free. But the thing to take

193
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:23,031
away from this is if you are, if you do have some ability in a

194
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:25,932
hugely data driven system to comment stuff out, especially in

195
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:28,113
a tree structure that you can just go way the hell up and say

196
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:31,815
oh, up here is fine, make sure that you turn

197
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,324
anything that's commented out bright green pulsing something

198
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,307
so that you can make sure that it's not that way when you ship.

199
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:38,967
And that's it.

200
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,505
All right, so the year is 2009, and I've just left the games

201
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,708
industry to work at a big military contractor

202
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:55,690
where I'm working on this character, who

203
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,855
is a tech demo to how we can do cultural training.

204
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,036
So this is a mixed reality character

205
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,297
she's projected on the screen.

206
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:04,360
The Marines are in this facility where

207
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,102
we've got live role players and all sorts of stuff

208
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:07,183
to make it feel really immersive.

209
00:12:09,322 --> 00:12:16,385
And, you know, she's supposed to help them learn how to win hearts and minds, make friends, not enemies, right?

210
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:22,628
Like, they're good at combat, but we need to teach them to do all the other stuff that lets us actually win wars and not just shoot people?

211
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,041
which is supposed to be why we're over there.

212
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:27,063
So the previous mixed reality scenarios

213
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,265
were combat training right there.

214
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,127
They're very fast, it's hard to see,

215
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:32,389
but there's an insurgent in the back there

216
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,333
who's holding a gun on the poor woman in the white dress.

217
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:37,395
So you shoot the insurgent, not the woman.

218
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,938
We wanted to move beyond this to more cultural training,

219
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:41,539
scenarios that would last a little longer.

220
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,682
you know, even 10 to 15 minutes. Non-kinetic scenarios, we call them. So kinetic is things

221
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:52,384
that shoot or blow up, right? So non-kinetic scenarios. And she needs to speak Pashto,

222
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:56,526
because the Marines are going to go to Afghanistan, and what people speak in the villages where

223
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:57,566
they're going to be going is Pashto.

224
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:02,294
So we got one of the role players who worked in the

225
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:06,395
facility there. We recorded all the audio in the mocap studio

226
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:09,376
that we had also built for them as part of this project. So we

227
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:11,837
had all of the animation and all the voice recorded together. So

228
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:13,737
you play a line of dialogue. You play the animation that goes

229
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:17,418
with it. I'd like to do better, fancier stuff like I was talking

230
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,499
about yesterday, but I've got three months to build this

231
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,220
character and almost no money. I've got an artist half time and

232
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,300
me, and that's it. But...

233
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:31,963
I found out when we sent it to the customer to let them see it

234
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,804
for the first time that she speaks Farsi. Which is what they

235
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:43,189
speak in Iraq. Not Pashtun. Fuck. So this one has a happy

236
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:45,730
ending, though, happily. So we re-recorded all of the audio

237
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,892
with a real actress. I mean, she was real, too. But another

238
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:52,314
actress who did speak Pashtun. At a better quality because we

239
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,595
did it in a sound studio instead of in a mocap studio.

240
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:58,378
Then we sliced all the animations into gestures that were,

241
00:13:58,398 --> 00:13:59,239
you know, about a second long.

242
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:00,460
So, you know, you've got a gesture like this

243
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,421
and a gesture like this.

244
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:05,024
And then you pick a gesture sequence randomly.

245
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:06,725
The gestures are tagged for the types of lines

246
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,406
that they're good for.

247
00:14:07,426 --> 00:14:08,887
The lines are tagged for the type of gestures

248
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:09,388
that they like.

249
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:10,829
You pick a gesture sequence.

250
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:14,012
So every time you go, you know, when you replay a gesture,

251
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,833
you're blending from a different gesture

252
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:17,054
and into a different gesture.

253
00:14:17,074 --> 00:14:18,316
And those blends are different.

254
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:19,757
So the motion is different.

255
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:21,158
So it feels like you're doing it again.

256
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:26,557
Stupidly simple. Worked much better than I would have thought. I was really worried about the

257
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:31,542
problem of getting the beats to synchronize on the emphasis of the speech. It turns out that

258
00:14:31,582 --> 00:14:36,447
didn't matter at all. In fact, I had people compliment how well that worked. Which really

259
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:39,470
surprised me. I don't know if it's because we started the gesture with the speech or if it

260
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,273
really just doesn't matter. That it happens to happen every once in a while and people see it

261
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:45,856
and think it's good and they don't notice when it doesn't happen.

262
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:49,436
And it breaks up the repetition really nicely.

263
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:51,737
Because when you play the same animation,

264
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:53,818
you get different blends.

265
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:55,759
When you play the same line of dialogue,

266
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:57,260
you get different animations.

267
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,481
So even though we had to reuse assets a lot,

268
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,122
because this was a very fast project,

269
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,303
it didn't get noticed nearly as much

270
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:05,063
as it would have otherwise.

271
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:10,005
Thank you.

272
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:11,046
Thank you.

273
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:11,946
Thank you.

274
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:12,366
Thank you.

275
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:12,907
Thank you.

276
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:15,328
Thank you.

277
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:15,508
Thanks.

278
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:22,759
I'm Mark Singer. I am currently a... where's the thingy? Ah, okay, there we go!

279
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:30,462
Currently working as a consultant freelance, but back in the day I worked at Red Storm Entertainment.

280
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:39,865
And this is from the very early days of our stuff. We, on top of making our more larger scale games,

281
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:42,946
we also had a number of very, very small games that were...

282
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:47,528
that were on like an eight, nine month release.

283
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:49,249
So we were just churning them out.

284
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:51,850
And it was in the PowerPlay series.

285
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,352
It started with Politica and Ruthless.com.

286
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:57,233
And our very last one, which I'm going to talk about,

287
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:58,034
was ShadowWatch.

288
00:15:58,714 --> 00:16:03,096
And it was designed to be a kind of top-down

289
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:07,499
orthogonal strategy, sort of X-com-y, syndicate-y,

290
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,440
Fallout-y sort of thing.

291
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:17,980
And there was sort of an onus on us in that it was coming out so damn quick to have some

292
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,424
really kick ass stuff, especially with the squad strategy AI.

293
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:30,738
We spent a lot of time on the AI, like lots and lots of time, like lots and lots and lots

294
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:31,018
of time.

295
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:40,406
But one of the things that we really wanted to do was have the enemy squads be intelligent

296
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:47,512
enough about their environment to recognize when they were pinned and double back on the

297
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:47,972
player and...

298
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:53,575
come through another door, sneak attack, everything's really cool.

299
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:57,477
And we managed to do this two ways, one that it was very, very room based, and this actually

300
00:16:57,537 --> 00:16:57,918
is the game.

301
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:06,182
So the, our enemies just had total knowledge of the whole level.

302
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:11,985
And we kept the player's knowledge both from them not knowing that and also by using a

303
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:12,706
fog of war.

304
00:17:14,987 --> 00:17:16,768
Did you mess with my slides, Dave?

305
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:18,629
Okay.

306
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:19,990
So it was a fog of war.

307
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:28,059
All right. It was a fog of war. And so they could not see ‑‑ so you would have your

308
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:36,381
enemy vanish. And it's turn‑based much like X‑com. So the guy would go around and come

309
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:41,123
out through the other door and stuff like that. And, you know, it actually ‑‑ for the

310
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:47,004
product it was, it actually did fairly good. And we were kind of proud of this. And, you

311
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,965
know, like a ton of time went into this. And ‑‑

312
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:57,384
This is back, this game released in 2000, so we had a slightly more, you know, smaller but more savvy audience

313
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,165
that kind of knows, you know, what the current state of games is.

314
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:05,286
So we were looking on the forums, and there was lots of stuff,

315
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:09,827
and we were particularly interested in what people were going to be saying about the AI.

316
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:15,509
And they remarked on that doubling back thing,

317
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:18,890
and they were amazed at how well we had faked it.

318
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:25,191
So their basic thought was, we couldn't possibly

319
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,752
be doing pathing like that.

320
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:29,473
So we must be pulling the guy off the map,

321
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:32,295
waiting a couple of turns, and then popping him back

322
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:32,775
at the door.

323
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,477
And it was kind of disheartening,

324
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:37,857
because we could have done that.

325
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,598
But instead, we did this really neat thing.

326
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,440
And this was very early in my career

327
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,481
and really informed my career in that when you're

328
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:47,843
doing really, really cool AI.

329
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:54,464
Make sure there's some indication of what you're doing because if you don't, then your

330
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:55,824
audience might think you're faking it.

331
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:57,485
And thank you very much.

332
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:14,963
My name is Rez Graham. I'm an independent. I was most recently at Maxis working on The Sims 4.

333
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:21,926
So this is going to be a story about a game that I worked on in 2010 called The Sims Medieval.

334
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:27,128
For a little bit of history, what The Sims Medieval is, is sending The Sims 3 back in time.

335
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:29,729
So that they can play in this fantasy world.

336
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,251
It wasn't just like Sims 3 with a new skin though.

337
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,342
We added things like professions. So we had a merchant, a bard, a monarch and so on. You

338
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:43,023
could play as any of these professions and have multiple sims and so on. We also had

339
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:49,425
quests. So what we really needed were NPCs that were smart. And I've given talks at previous

340
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:55,487
GDCs about how we accomplished the let's make sims constrained to a particular area or a

341
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:59,588
particular thing that they're trying to do. So you have quest NPCs and so on. So this

342
00:19:59,628 --> 00:20:01,369
disaster story takes place here.

343
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:08,213
I took this screen shot in a brand new game and this is an

344
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:10,614
empty world where in the very center there's a pit right

345
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:14,156
there. That's my nice little pit. And in this pit lives a

346
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:19,420
pit beast who looks like that. So this pit beast goes and you

347
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,041
can do all sorts of things. You can execute people so you have

348
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:24,343
the executioner here who is tossing someone down in there

349
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,884
and all sorts of things like that. The pit beast was this

350
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:29,246
really cool thing that added to the flavor of the game.

351
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:32,483
Now the guy there on the right with the axe is Ron the

352
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:35,945
executioner. Who's this guy? With his amazing Viking beard.

353
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:40,369
Ron the executioner's job is not only to execute people but also

354
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:45,072
to throw in gigantic hunks of meat to the pit beast who then

355
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:48,535
consumes them. That's our basic system. That's Ron. He's our

356
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:52,398
NPC and that's what he can do in this world. So of course this

357
00:20:52,438 --> 00:20:57,041
is a talk about bugs so we got a bug. The bug was basically the

358
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:59,483
executioner ran up to the edge of the pit and leapt in.

359
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,211
That seems bad. My first thought was okay. Is there some

360
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:11,032
kind of weird animation IK thing. Did he like sort of

361
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:16,394
tweak in there. No. He was in this pose. When we saw the

362
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:18,795
screen shot it was pretty clear. In this case this was a

363
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:20,415
screen shot of my player sim doing this.

364
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:25,876
Yeah, so this is the, what can happen is the player can click

365
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,397
on the pit and say jump in.

366
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:29,178
It's meant to be high level content.

367
00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:31,380
You're a, you know, maximum level character.

368
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,621
You go in, fight the pit beast,

369
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,382
and if you win, you get epic loot.

370
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:36,584
Standard role playing game mechanic.

371
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:39,426
It's not available autonomously.

372
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:43,289
No player or NPC sim should be able to do this autonomously.

373
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:44,850
So we're like, what happened?

374
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:48,073
Well, fortunately, and I gave this talk as well

375
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,374
several years ago about tools.

376
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:51,515
We have tools that let us see.

377
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,657
We got really, really lucky because this is one of those

378
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:58,220
bugs where it happened once and they never got it again. Well,

379
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,203
we managed to get it just through sheer chance. And we

380
00:22:03,243 --> 00:22:05,665
have really great tools, specifically this history down

381
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:08,166
here, that let's us go, oh, shit, what did he do? Why did he

382
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:11,548
choose this? And we got to walk into it. So we got to figure out

383
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:17,012
exactly what it was. It was the insane trait. On the Sims 3 this

384
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:19,473
was fine. So here's how the insane trait worked. And

385
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,878
I won't name any names either but this was rather crazy.

386
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:27,505
Basically what it does is if you have the insane trait it

387
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:28,627
ignores tests.

388
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,805
which somehow was fine on the Sims 3.

389
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:36,066
Because you don't have a lot of Sims

390
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,287
who need to be locked into places doing things.

391
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:41,588
In a fantasy simulation game where there's an RPG

392
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:44,189
and you need a quest Sim to stand there

393
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:45,470
with a big arrow above his head,

394
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,270
that becomes more important.

395
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:49,551
Or you have Ron the executioner

396
00:22:49,591 --> 00:22:50,932
who needs to be at a particular place

397
00:22:50,992 --> 00:22:52,112
doing a particular thing.

398
00:22:53,813 --> 00:22:55,294
This can also completely break the game, right?

399
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:57,415
If we have a constable or other certain NPCs

400
00:22:57,455 --> 00:22:59,015
that if they die, we're hosed.

401
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:03,798
the entire game breaks down. Now the cool thing is that the

402
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:07,203
designers came to us and like you know we like this. We like

403
00:23:07,243 --> 00:23:08,566
the idea of Ron the bad ass.

404
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,783
right? We just want to be able to control it. That's the thing

405
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:18,167
that we really want. And so we want to allow designers to have

406
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:22,130
this control over the game. Well, we fixed it by fixing the

407
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:24,672
horrendousness that was the insane trait to make it do

408
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:28,235
something more reasonable. And incidentally for the Sims 4, we

409
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:32,039
did the same thing. We made it so that it wasn't, that the

410
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,182
insane trait wasn't so insane. Cool. So

411
00:23:37,426 --> 00:23:38,646
What is the purpose of all this?

412
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:41,567
The first one seems really obvious to me,

413
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:44,429
my first conclusion point, but it is not

414
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:46,349
in my many years in the games industry,

415
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:48,190
which is don't bypass existing systems.

416
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,450
They're there for a reason.

417
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,812
There's a reason why we have autonomous tests in our game.

418
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:54,512
And if you completely bypass them,

419
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:56,353
if you just short-circuit stuff, then it breaks.

420
00:23:57,553 --> 00:23:59,834
Fixing this bug fixed all sorts of those

421
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,095
it-happened-once bugs all over the place.

422
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:04,556
The second one, which is slightly less obvious,

423
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:06,036
is use automated testing.

424
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:09,806
it was painful to try and find those. We got super lucky with

425
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:13,529
that one bug on medieval. On the Sims 4 we're like, you know, we

426
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:16,751
don't really want to have to fight this anymore. Let's do

427
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:19,914
automated testing. On the Sims 4 we had a huge massive automated

428
00:24:19,994 --> 00:24:23,857
testing suite that we just ran this smoke test basically over

429
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:26,259
and over and over that would find all of these little

430
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,261
annoying bugs. So do those things. Thank you.
