00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:09,213
I am Jean Leggett, this is Gabriella Logan and Jessica Fong,

2
00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:12,696
and thank you for coming to our session called Stories that Haunt and Heal,

3
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:14,658
Mental Health and Game Narrative.

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,161
We ask that you hold your questions and applause to your end.

5
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:22,425
We only have half an hour for this session and it is pretty deep.

6
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:25,728
We're going to have a breakout area, which is mentioned on the last slide,

7
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,071
for us to continue the conversation if you would like to join us.

8
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:33,064
We just want to talk to, to let you all know that we are going to be discussing some pretty

9
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:34,505
heavy subject matter here.

10
00:00:35,305 --> 00:00:42,807
It is some mental health issues, post-traumatic stress disorder, and domestic abuse, disordered

11
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:43,987
eating and sexual assault.

12
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:48,228
And one of the reasons why we need to talk about serious games is because we all have

13
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:50,508
a preconceived idea of what a game is.

14
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:57,030
In serious games, the primary purpose is to not just entertain, but also to explore

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,371
subjects that are different from us.

16
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:03,094
All right, so we're going to go in order.

17
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:05,495
It'll be myself, then Gabriella, and then Jessica.

18
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:06,896
So if you ladies would like to have a seat.

19
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:10,399
I'm going to be talking a little bit about our game called

20
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,741
Lily Bard, the Body in Shakespeare Park.

21
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:16,563
I run an indie studio north of Toronto,

22
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,585
and I focus on making narrative games for women over 30.

23
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:21,406
In fact, my target demographic are

24
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:24,028
women who enjoy reading more than they enjoy playing games.

25
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:26,906
and they all focus on female protagonists.

26
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,768
I often get asked why, why not, I have to say.

27
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,069
So our focus is on making impactful stories

28
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,491
that will make people cry, make people have emotions,

29
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:41,392
and most importantly, we have built a narrative game engine

30
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:43,553
to help empower storytellers.

31
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,294
We've worked with children as young as eight

32
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,595
and adults into their 60s and 70s.

33
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:50,957
So let's talk a little bit about the body in Shakespeare Park.

34
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:57,894
It is a point-and-click narrative game, and the center character, her name is Lily Bard,

35
00:01:57,974 --> 00:01:59,716
and she is a sexual assault survivor.

36
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:05,140
So quick story, when I first read the novel from, so this is based from Charlene Harris's

37
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,644
series, the Lily Bard series, and I remember asking, you know, we'd like to have the rights

38
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:13,527
to this, and I read the book, I'm like, wow, you know what, games needs a kick-ass woman,

39
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:20,313
and not to exploit, but to explore the subject matter of PTSD and sexual violence.

40
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:28,207
and how do we craft this game specifically to make sure that we are not re-triggering

41
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:33,909
survivors? What are the narrative devices that we use in the game? Who gets to write

42
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:34,430
this story?

43
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:39,009
Well, when you're an indie games company, sometimes you run out of money and then you

44
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:40,809
take the people that are willing to work on your...

45
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:42,429
Anybody ever had that experience?

46
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,830
Sometimes you take on people that might not be the best fit.

47
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,171
Well, we ended up having two guys starting to write this game.

48
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:52,751
That wasn't going to go very well because I felt like that would really not fit the

49
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:53,771
authenticity piece.

50
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,692
And we've gone through a couple of writers.

51
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:57,772
I am now writing the game.

52
00:02:58,252 --> 00:03:00,333
And I'm also a survivor of sexual assault.

53
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:05,857
So it's really important that we are mindful of who is telling the narrative of these atypical

54
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:06,317
stories.

55
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:12,960
So some of the elements in the game itself that we are trying to imbue the player with

56
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,042
a sense of what is the trauma, what is the anxiety that Lily is going through are the

57
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:20,523
use of her daily diaries.

58
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:25,625
So for those of you not familiar with the story itself, it opens up on a body in the

59
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:27,606
park, hence the name of the game.

60
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,992
And Lily has a choice that deviates from the novel.

61
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:32,792
So think of it as your choose your own adventure.

62
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:35,714
And every decision that she makes

63
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:39,036
does have a knock-on effect, including in her diaries,

64
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:41,417
in the flashbacks that she has.

65
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:46,559
Also, how do you craft the character relationships

66
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,881
between the players and the NPCs is heavily

67
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:52,722
stated by the kind of relationship

68
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:53,583
that she has with them.

69
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:57,605
Everything of her history and her past.

70
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:03,403
judges so there's slut-shaming in this book, which is kind of interesting.

71
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:08,084
There are complex relationships between Lily being an older woman and a younger man.

72
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:15,527
Now we could dive really deep into that, we don't have time for that, but it's Lily trying

73
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:19,328
to explore and understand her own relationship with her sexuality.

74
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,170
The idea being that by the end of this game,

75
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:26,272
she will have found her way through herself.

76
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:27,592
She will have healed herself.

77
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:29,833
Or the players will have a strong feeling

78
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:30,913
that she has done that.

79
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:34,375
So the artistic approach, I'm actually

80
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,315
going to be showing quite a bit of the art from the game.

81
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,397
And when we first started out, small budget, it grew.

82
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,137
The scale of the game grew.

83
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,739
And so we started off with full color.

84
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,139
And initially, our.

85
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:49,978
our trigger art was going to be in black and white.

86
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:51,398
And somebody had made a comment,

87
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:52,779
I think it was like an IndyCade judge,

88
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,780
and they're like, I don't like that.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,301
And I realized I don't like it either.

90
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,642
So I'm gonna show you the monochromatic instead.

91
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:01,083
And we tried to move away from this idea

92
00:05:01,123 --> 00:05:04,504
that PTSD was horrific because I think we can agree

93
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:06,645
that a lot of people are dealing with trauma

94
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:07,666
on a regular basis.

95
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:10,367
Let's normalize it rather than make it, horrify it.

96
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:15,004
I'm also going to talk a little bit about the intentional camera angles that we used.

97
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:21,907
And very importantly, even though in the book in Chapter 5 it explicitly details her abduction

98
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:26,930
and her assault by multiple people, we made a choice as narrative designers not to include

99
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,210
that.

100
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,373
We also made the choice not to include specific images, which I will be showing you, but I

101
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:35,975
will add a trigger warning prior to showing that to you.

102
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:39,677
Because we've all seen those images before in film and TV.

103
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:40,837
We do not need to see it again.

104
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:44,293
So this is when she first goes to the park,

105
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:47,434
she sees the hand if she chooses to unwrap the body.

106
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,935
This was originally the art style that we had,

107
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:51,475
which as you can sort of see,

108
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:54,336
is like this walking dead kind of zombie image,

109
00:05:54,877 --> 00:05:57,237
and we ultimately went to the monochromatic.

110
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:00,499
With this image, it's a flashback of her

111
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:03,500
when she hears a radio announcement about an abduction.

112
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,498
And if you notice where the barrel of the gun is aimed at,

113
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:08,919
it's not aimed at you, the player,

114
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,520
it's just slightly off to the side.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,581
So while you are playing as Lily,

116
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,682
you are not meant to be Lily.

117
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:16,763
It is not your experience.

118
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:20,725
You are experiencing a story outside of yourself.

119
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:23,566
The same thing with this, when Lily attacks,

120
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:26,568
somebody leaves a gun for her and she does kill her attacker.

121
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:29,049
You are seeing it as an out-of-body experience.

122
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,691
Just quickly, I was at the Grace Hopper Conference

123
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:34,072
as a speaker last October.

124
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,722
And I don't know if you'll recall the Christine Blasey Ford

125
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:40,563
testimony against the Supreme Court Judge Kavanaugh.

126
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:44,165
I was showing this slide the day that she was giving testimony.

127
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:47,768
It is a fantasy scene of Lilly's because she did not

128
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:51,550
get to testify against her kidnapper and assault people.

129
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,552
So it's very powerful, and I think

130
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,654
we have an opportunity in our games

131
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,355
to share powerful stories.

132
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:03,618
So the next slide does have the graphic depiction of rape

133
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:05,819
and I think I may have forgot to say

134
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,660
at the beginning of the talk,

135
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,181
if you feel like you need to leave the room

136
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:09,122
and take care of yourself,

137
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:10,923
we understand there's no judgment

138
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:13,004
because we will be diving a little bit more

139
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:16,066
into other topics that might be disturbing as well.

140
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,388
So this image specifically,

141
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:20,630
I chose not to include in the game.

142
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:24,573
You can see the 3D render at the top

143
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,595
and then the painted image on the bottom.

144
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:33,734
Again, as a woman who has experienced this, I didn't feel it was necessary to include

145
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:35,735
that in a game about sexual assault.

146
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,296
We have seen it time and time again.

147
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:39,657
We do not need to reinforce it.

148
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:46,640
And for me, it just, it doesn't need, it's damaging to survivors and it made me uncomfortable

149
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,761
and that ultimately is not the intent of the story.

150
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:54,443
So Lily, like many survivors, is haunted by her past and the narrative structure of the

151
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,564
game is meant to be the holistic approach.

152
00:07:57,212 --> 00:08:00,613
so that players can understand healing mechanisms and coping mechanisms.

153
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:05,374
We all have coping mechanisms whether or not we realize it or not, and I think having them

154
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:08,215
in game form is very healing for a lot of people.

155
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:14,036
So there are nods to therapy, cognitive behavior, physical behavior, and it also underlines

156
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,637
that we're all on our own journey and there's no specific timeline for healing.

157
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:20,458
So I'm going to pass this over to Ella.

158
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,473
Hi everyone, I'm Gabriella Logren, though if you decide you want to come and have a

159
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:31,055
chat to me later, please feel free to call me Ella.

160
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:36,540
So just a little bit about me before I move on to talk about shrinking pains is that I

161
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,904
am a communications manager by day and by night I run a small indie team and we focus

162
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,085
on making games that explore mental health issues.

163
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:46,808
Basically, our goal is to release these games for free,

164
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:49,250
because I don't want them to ever be pay-gated,

165
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,131
so that anyone can access them and have an experience.

166
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:54,793
Also, I believe that games are an amazing tool

167
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,115
to build empathy and understanding in players,

168
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:59,036
and that is my primary goal

169
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:01,117
when I make these mental health games for free.

170
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:03,919
The first game that we made is the one I'm going to be talking about,

171
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,020
and that is...

172
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,701
Oh, well, it's still here. We'll talk about shrinking pains.

173
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:11,865
So very quickly, I'll give you a brief rundown

174
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:12,626
of what it's about.

175
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:15,410
It is a semi-autobiographical visual novel,

176
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,654
and it is about disordered eating.

177
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:20,059
like specifically anorexia.

178
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,680
And one thing that is important to note

179
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
is that I wrote this very much from a place

180
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,141
of my own experience because I'm a recovered anorexic.

181
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:29,282
The visual novel itself is written in second person

182
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:33,022
because I think it's really important to explore the idea

183
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:35,423
and to show that disordered eating is not

184
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,124
an explicitly gendered mental illness.

185
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:40,304
It's actually something that affects a lot more people

186
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:42,765
and a lot, like a lot more diverse people

187
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:44,965
than the public is necessarily aware of.

188
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:50,613
and more and more men and people that identify as non-binary are actually seen having it

189
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:53,457
within the last five years there's been a significant rise.

190
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:58,949
I was also very interested by the impact of mental health issues on relationships.

191
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:04,673
It's almost like we frame mental illness sometimes as something that happens in a vacuum, as

192
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:09,877
if it has its own space, but the reality is when someone suffers, the people around them

193
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:14,580
have to pick up the slack and take on a lot more than they necessarily are able to at

194
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,283
a time if they also have issues in their lives, and I wanted to explore that in this game.

195
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,156
The game is also a series of snapshots.

196
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,076
It's not a fun game to play.

197
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:26,197
In fact, it can be quite harrowing.

198
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,397
It is a little bit disturbing.

199
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:31,819
I also believe that games don't have to be fun to be valuable.

200
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:33,799
And we can make these experiences

201
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,760
without exploiting them while also showcasing the reality.

202
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:40,725
of what someone is suffering or experiencing.

203
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,946
Also having these sustained little moments within the game

204
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:46,386
mimics what it's like to have an eating disorder

205
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,867
because stereotypically you lose time and you lose moments

206
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:52,308
and it keeps the game moving quite quickly

207
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:53,548
and the playtime short.

208
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,488
Because the game is not fun to play

209
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:56,649
and it can be quite triggering,

210
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:58,469
I didn't want it to be too long in length

211
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,410
so it'd be a bit more easily digestible.

212
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:06,881
So the artistic approach, I will go through this a little bit more quickly.

213
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:11,606
My art is not as beautiful as Jean's art, so just a heads up on that one.

214
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:15,449
Shrinking Paints is actually a game jam game that we then polished and released.

215
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:20,234
So all of the art assets were made in 48 hours, so just keep that in mind everyone.

216
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:23,497
There are a few things that I'm really happy with with the art,

217
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,618
and that is how it mimics having an eating disorder.

218
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:29,620
As we go through, you'll notice that a lot of key details

219
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,003
are dropped from frames as the protagonist and their illness

220
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:35,443
gets worse through the narrative.

221
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:37,985
You'll see that the field of vision closes in.

222
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:39,806
And though you won't be able to see it here,

223
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:41,727
there are sound effects that signal

224
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:45,409
when the player is engaging in destructive and risky behavior.

225
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:48,128
So this is from the beginning of the game.

226
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:50,369
This is one of the options for your partner.

227
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,970
You can choose the gender expression of your partner

228
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,410
as well.

229
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,051
It's all written in second person,

230
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:57,032
and the writing is not explicitly gendered.

231
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:59,293
So anyone that plays the game can

232
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,754
feel more attached to the protagonist

233
00:12:00,814 --> 00:12:03,335
and have a closer sense of what they're experiencing.

234
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:06,436
And as you play through, you'll notice, see, got some details.

235
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:07,697
Oh, now they're going away.

236
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:12,564
And then as you keep playing through, it gets spacer and spacer,

237
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:15,705
and they start losing more and more time between each of the snapshots.

238
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:17,325
You can see it here too.

239
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:20,486
A lot of people didn't realize that the detail was going away,

240
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:22,987
even though I purposely brought it back to the ceiling fan,

241
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:23,687
but that's fine.

242
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:24,748
It's all good.

243
00:12:26,602 --> 00:12:30,464
You can see it again here, there's food in the fridge which is already not very detailed

244
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:33,886
and then you can see it's nearly completely gone here.

245
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:37,849
One thing that I also want to note is that there are two options on this screen, there's

246
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:41,631
eat nothing or down here it actually says eat celery but it is completely blurred out

247
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:47,095
and when you go to click that bubble it actually gets smaller and smaller until you can't click

248
00:12:47,115 --> 00:12:47,535
it anymore.

249
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:51,318
And I wanted to do this to demonstrate the lack of agency

250
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:54,940
that people that have eating disorders suffer in their own life as well.

251
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,223
So this game has a lot of illusion of choice, but there are two possible endings.

252
00:13:00,423 --> 00:13:03,565
These are some Steam reviews, because I'm going to move on and talk a little bit about

253
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:07,248
the impact that it had on the players, as well as the impact that it had on me as a creator.

254
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,329
Steam reviews are an interesting place.

255
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:12,207
Okay?

256
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:14,150
I've just picked a few.

257
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:19,138
My favourite is the one on the top left that says, nine out of ten would depress again.

258
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:21,802
I thought that one was quite funny.

259
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:27,519
What I was really surprised by were the people that actually ended up playing this game.

260
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,861
I wasn't sure if it would be played by people that were more mentally healthy or people

261
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:36,042
that had suffered themselves, but what I experienced when I released this game, because I released

262
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:39,883
it for free, there was no marketing, I just put it out there, I wanted it to be as accessible

263
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:44,405
as possible, and a lot of people that ended up playing the game and then reviewing it

264
00:13:44,485 --> 00:13:46,665
said that it helped them feel closer.

265
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:52,205
to someone who was experiencing this mental illness, which I thought was very beautiful.

266
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:56,749
Some people messaged me privately as well to say that they had been shown by their partners

267
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,773
or significant people in their lives that had suffered, and it just helped deepen their

268
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:07,058
understanding and even for 20 or 30 minutes really empathise and understand what was happening,

269
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:08,720
which I thought was really, really beautiful.

270
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:12,663
So it's really used as a tool to help connect people.

271
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:16,697
Got a little bit more here.

272
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:18,598
So as I mentioned earlier, of course,

273
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:20,499
it helped build empathy in the people that played it.

274
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:23,020
One thing that is interesting too

275
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:26,563
is that this game had a much more significant impact on me

276
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:27,803
than I thought it would.

277
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:34,759
When I released this game, I had to sit down and think if I wanted to come clean about

278
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:36,400
the fact that it's semi-autobiographical.

279
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:41,884
Because a game like this is lent a lot of credibility when someone who is behind it

280
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:45,627
is actually standing up and saying, yes, this is something that I've suffered and I have

281
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:49,190
put my experiences into this game, and yes, I'm an authority to speak on this subject

282
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,891
because I have this lived experience.

283
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:56,312
However, I knew that doing that would mean that forever I would have to come to terms

284
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:59,233
of the fact that I had suffered from a quite severe eating disorder.

285
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:04,995
And I would be opening myself up to that discussion with so many people all throughout my life,

286
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:07,975
and that would just be something that everyone would forever know about me.

287
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:11,676
And I think that I finally came to the decision to...

288
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,942
like commit to it and to put that on the branding of the game,

289
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,843
because I want to destigmatise these issues as well.

290
00:15:18,403 --> 00:15:21,165
And it's okay to talk about them, and it's okay to recover from them,

291
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:24,166
and it's okay to share these experiences with others.

292
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:26,427
So, it was actually really good for me,

293
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,109
and it kept me really accountable for my own recovery.

294
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,610
So, releasing this game and making this game

295
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,292
actually helped with my recovery, which is not something that I expected,

296
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:38,453
but is something that I am extremely grateful for.

297
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:40,094
So, yeah.

298
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,011
That's the shortest spiel ever about shrinking pains.

299
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:45,812
I hope you enjoyed it.

300
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:48,493
And I'm going to pass it over.

301
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,763
Hi, my name is Jessica Fong, and I'm

302
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:07,025
an illustrator, co-founder of Only Egg Studio,

303
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,506
and game director of our first title, In the Keeper's Shadow.

304
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:13,007
To talk about our work, I'm starting from when I was young.

305
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:16,812
When I was little, my father was often away at work and traveling.

306
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:21,417
I was at home balancing my small world against my mother's unpredictable mood

307
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:22,899
and her tiger mother discipline.

308
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,023
To the outside world, she seemed kind and nice.

309
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:30,488
The mask that my mother wore was so convincing that few ever thought anything wrong.

310
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:33,760
I didn't talk about what happened behind closed doors,

311
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,261
with no other eyes watching.

312
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:38,984
I felt stuck in a limbo, resigned to the fact

313
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:41,185
that this is how things have been and always will be.

314
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,249
Early on, I had a primal need to draw.

315
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,591
It was a constant that I could control.

316
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:50,793
I drew characters that I liked or ones that I wished to be,

317
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:53,635
and a particular girl avatar started to form.

318
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:56,397
I could not draw well, but it didn't matter

319
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,299
because it made sense when nothing else did.

320
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:04,394
In high school, an art teacher saw something in the lines that needed to be expressed.

321
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:09,736
With a safe space and support, I began to build a visual library, drawing the things

322
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:11,737
that haunted me to have tangible evidence

323
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:14,018
that what I was feeling living with my mother was valid.

324
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:19,099
I did a collection of artwork and story notes of a girl forever wandering a city,

325
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,021
trying to find reason and purpose behind herself and her cluttered surroundings.

326
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,264
Eventually, an investigation into our life spread revelations among our family.

327
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:34,107
All of this led to my father, mother, and I having a confrontation around our dinner table.

328
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:40,271
Confessions of the years of mental and physical abuse my younger sister and I had endured were

329
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:44,734
met unapologetically by my mother who told my father, just be happy you were not there.

330
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:50,558
I recall the time she and I were the only ones at home arguing about my academics

331
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:54,001
and I found myself standing in the kitchen holding a knife to my stomach.

332
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:57,235
The impossibility of overcoming disappointment

333
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:59,215
and her wishing I had never been born

334
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:01,256
and telling me to go ahead and do it.

335
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:04,797
I had wanted to end my life so badly in that moment

336
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:06,637
to prove the lengths I would go

337
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:08,698
wanting her to be proud or satisfied with me.

338
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:11,619
In an incident where my father thought

339
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:13,759
he was having a heart attack after days of arguing

340
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,180
with our mother and high blood pressure,

341
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,940
telling her to call an ambulance

342
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,321
and she told him to call them yourself and left him alone.

343
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,102
His blood had almost turned white

344
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:23,562
when the nurse was able to see him.

345
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,240
Learning of my sister's past with thoughts of suicide,

346
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,201
all of this was terrifying to us.

347
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,002
Coming to terms with the things that we felt

348
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:33,362
we had needed to handle alone,

349
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:35,383
and how close we all came to losing each other

350
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:36,204
and no one the wiser.

351
00:18:37,544 --> 00:18:39,765
I asked our mother something I had never asked her before.

352
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,506
Do you love us?

353
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:42,946
And it was just silence.

354
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:46,488
Life is war, she tells us, and no one is on your side.

355
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:48,489
Telling me that when I am old,

356
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,589
I will remember and appreciate that I am here

357
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,590
because of her, as she had for her father.

358
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:56,661
People talk about moments where their life ended and began again.

359
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:57,842
That was one for me.

360
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:03,407
I committed myself to pursuing studio art in college, and I cut myself off from her.

361
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:07,050
The writings of Christine Ann Lawson taught me how children

362
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,873
of abusive parents can understand and manage in the aftermath.

363
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:14,136
I learned from Abe Arkoff's publications on the psychology of growth,

364
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:18,240
and art history became a never-ending stream of resources and inspiration.

365
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:21,263
The memories of people preserved by their artistry.

366
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,811
I had also grown up with games and I thought

367
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,812
that I could translate my visual expressions

368
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:27,873
that had once been a fairly lonely endeavor

369
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:28,934
into a shareable one.

370
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:33,116
I started developing concept art, game designs,

371
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:35,137
and story under the title Keeper and the Girl.

372
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:38,119
I scrawled annotations in every line and margin

373
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:39,039
in my class notebook.

374
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,001
The girl in my artwork had discovered a new place,

375
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:45,003
an experience with plant life and color

376
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:46,583
and one that I had not painted before.

377
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:48,765
She was there meeting other characters

378
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:50,105
and she wasn't entirely alone.

379
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:54,968
After college, I founded Lonely Egg Studio with my partner,

380
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:58,712
and we worked on In the Keeper's Shadow with a small team

381
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,533
where my previous Keeper and the Girl work

382
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,515
and personal experiences would be retold.

383
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,538
It's an intimate hand-painted adventure game

384
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:06,619
currently in development,

385
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,381
where you play as a young inquisitive girl named Emmy

386
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:11,823
as she explores the crumbling and war-torn city

387
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:12,664
that she's called home.

388
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,966
The narrative touches on themes

389
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:16,748
of parental relationship and legacy.

390
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:21,254
The game focuses on Emmy's inner dialogue, understanding

391
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:24,516
and grasp of her own agency as the player explores and pushes

392
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:25,937
the narrative momentum forward.

393
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:29,679
In the early concepting stage, my intention for the game

394
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,961
was for it to be a window into my experience of what I

395
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:35,002
remember and how I lived and survived.

396
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:38,404
But the creative team noticed uncertainty in the premise.

397
00:20:38,824 --> 00:20:40,445
They asked whether or not the game story

398
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:42,686
was a one-to-one reflection of what happened to me.

399
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:45,368
And to this, I was defensive and confused.

400
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:47,649
After a time to think though.

401
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:51,129
I felt that repeating the experiences was not the answer to me.

402
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,970
I don't want to just relive my past.

403
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:59,173
There were many nights that I broke down and debated with my partner over this question

404
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:05,135
because it was hard coming to terms with it because I felt that not portraying the experiences

405
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:09,397
as they were very close to it was somehow portraying my younger me or leaving her behind.

406
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:14,319
I realized I was still restricted by the story of what happened in that house with my mother

407
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,501
that I had trapped myself in what I knew because it was comfortable.

408
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:20,268
What was beyond the walls of that home,

409
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:24,090
I saw Emi, myself, going somewhere and becoming someone.

410
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,731
The story would draw from and evolve from my past.

411
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:31,872
Emi lives in a city, partially cared for

412
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:33,633
by a mechanical keeper named Idna.

413
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,234
Our team is focused on ways in which Idna

414
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:37,814
has a mental control over Emi.

415
00:21:38,415 --> 00:21:40,155
There are no graphic depictions of violence

416
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:40,975
to the main character.

417
00:21:41,396 --> 00:21:43,156
And even though those things may have happened to me,

418
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:45,557
we felt it did not serve to meaningfully portray

419
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:47,758
the depths of their relationship in the game's story.

420
00:21:49,757 --> 00:21:52,898
Our game uses dark surrealism, pulling from Lovecraftian

421
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,078
folkloric and cosmic horror, using

422
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:57,239
the idea of the terribly sublime, things

423
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:59,359
that hover between being beautiful and unsettling,

424
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,640
to push the appearance of it almost

425
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,601
being a psychological mindscape outside of a place or time.

426
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:07,701
These metaphors could translate my feelings to others

427
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:09,302
better than a true to life portrayal.

428
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,443
And the gameplay mechanics are tailored

429
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:14,283
around the narrative and symbolic context

430
00:22:14,323 --> 00:22:15,623
of each story arc or scene.

431
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,099
like using a moth to light the darkness,

432
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,641
or point and click style examination to find clues,

433
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:23,162
solving puzzles and learning more about the world.

434
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:25,783
But more important than any specific action

435
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:28,405
is EMI's blossoming confidence and growing agency.

436
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:32,647
We shared the game's progress at a local convention

437
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,208
and an attendee named Audrey,

438
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:35,929
a gamer and blossoming creator,

439
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,669
leaves this message for our team and devs.

440
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:41,047
I'm glad there are people brave enough to bring up the concept

441
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:43,669
of mental health into games, especially if it's driven

442
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:44,749
from personal experience.

443
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,151
To those who are unaware, it brings the issue

444
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:48,712
into a new light, and for those

445
00:22:48,752 --> 00:22:50,373
who find specific things familiar,

446
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:51,813
it tells them that they aren't alone.

447
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:56,316
I have looked hard at myself and found something beautiful

448
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,637
to pursue that grounds me while I battle with the things

449
00:22:58,697 --> 00:22:59,618
that wish to drown me.

450
00:23:00,718 --> 00:23:03,360
It provides a tangible way for me to connect with the world

451
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,981
and myself that I can understand.

452
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,518
I would not be here if not for the support of people in my life and people like our team

453
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:10,358
who strive for better.

454
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:14,979
But to those that do not have those privileges, the number of voices that we have lost or

455
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,079
may lose unsettles me.

456
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:21,020
I think back to when I was little with no platform to express or belittled for my work

457
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,500
and not truly listened to or even put down by peers.

458
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:26,721
The line between life and art for me is blurred.

459
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:31,362
And I cannot forget that the act of expressing a personal story can be equally if not more

460
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:33,362
important than the product that might result from it.

461
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:39,378
I want to support fellow creators as we not just make empathetic games, but strive together

462
00:23:39,438 --> 00:23:41,423
to build a more empathetic development process.

463
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:42,285
Thank you.

464
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:55,549
So I think you can get a sense that the three of us

465
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:58,491
are trying to tackle some pretty heavy stuff in our games.

466
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:01,214
And we are building in fun elements to our games

467
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,255
so that it's not a dour fest.

468
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:06,538
I'm particularly fond of really bad puns.

469
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,420
So you will laugh at least once or twice

470
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,281
when you play our games.

471
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:14,664
Why do we need to be talking about this kind of content?

472
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:15,765
It is time.

473
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:17,747
You know, we're seeing cultural shifts.

474
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:20,249
We're seeing the emergence of indie games

475
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:22,210
turning into a space which,

476
00:24:22,523 --> 00:24:26,546
tools that are easy for creators to use to tell biographical stories.

477
00:24:27,086 --> 00:24:32,830
We're coming on the edge of the wave of depression quest and that dragon cancer.

478
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,891
There's so many great stories out there.

479
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:39,333
Stories are what make us human, and digital media is the future.

480
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:45,147
One thing that makes it a lot easier to get these games out there and to have them respected

481
00:24:45,187 --> 00:24:48,869
is also that there is a really big push within video games right now, and I'm sure you're

482
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:53,592
all aware of this, but a lot of creators are really trying to get video games recognised

483
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:57,875
as an art form more so than just as a mode of entertainment, which is why we mentioned

484
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:58,996
serious games earlier.

485
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:02,443
and how an experience can be playable without the need to be fun.

486
00:25:02,823 --> 00:25:06,325
And we're seeing a lot of push and we're seeing a lot of results.

487
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:11,628
Like the BAFTAs just gave out heaps of awards for games which was fantastic and acknowledges

488
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:15,590
that it has a really important place in our societal consciousness as well.

489
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:21,233
Also there's a lot of research emerging about the empathy building power of games and how

490
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:25,115
unlike more traditional forms of media such as TV, television, radio.

491
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,765
where you're passively consuming a narrative.

492
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:33,388
In a video game, you are actively participating in a narrative, and you are that much closer

493
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:38,130
to an experience, and you can build empathy a lot more rapidly because of that.

494
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,492
When you're the one that is living the experience to a certain degree, you can get so much closer

495
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:47,694
than when you are just hearing about it or reading it or digesting something else that

496
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:49,435
somebody has already presented for you.

497
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,923
So if you're looking to find us, you can find us on our Twitter.

498
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:56,844
We're fairly active, the three of us.

499
00:25:57,926 --> 00:26:01,509
And we would invite you to come to the wrap-up area, which

500
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:02,530
is in the West Hall.

501
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,432
Overlook 3022 and 3024 is where we'll be.

502
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:09,552
If you have questions, please bring them to us.

503
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:10,653
We're happy to answer them.

504
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:14,796
And I hope that you enjoyed our conversation this afternoon.

505
00:26:14,836 --> 00:26:16,938
You will be getting your emails with your evaluations.

506
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:20,841
If you'd like to see us dive deeper into this next year,

507
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:22,963
please rate us accordingly so that we'll

508
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:24,124
be invited back to speak.

509
00:26:26,306 --> 00:26:28,187
We actually smashed through this pretty quickly.

510
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:30,750
We have a few more minutes than we'd realized.

511
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,432
I think we have like four whole minutes for questions

512
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:34,433
if anyone wants to.

513
00:26:36,614 --> 00:26:38,576
I'm assuming that you come to the microphone.

514
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:41,478
If you want to run to the microphone.

515
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:43,379
I see one.

516
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,100
Give it up.

517
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:50,765
Hello.

518
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:51,385
Oh, OK.

519
00:26:52,726 --> 00:26:55,108
So I noticed, amongst the three of you,

520
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:57,570
you guys had a really interesting range of,

521
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,313
I sound so weird on this, sorry, of artwork

522
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:03,595
being very literal versus being very figurative.

523
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:04,575
And I was wondering.

524
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:08,058
how do you kind of draw that line

525
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:11,080
and how do you think it affects the player

526
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,622
in terms of like, you were saying initially,

527
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:16,143
like you didn't want to show a lot of the images

528
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:17,704
because you found them too graphic and stuff.

529
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:21,047
Do you think that the more figurative showing

530
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,809
and illustrative style is a little better

531
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:26,210
at guiding the player toward like a healing space?

532
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,831
Or I just want to hear what you're.

533
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,363
I think for me, when we went with the art style, I was thinking about my target

534
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:37,185
demographic, women over 40, and the kinds of games that they're currently playing.

535
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:41,568
That's one thing that I love about being a developer and a publisher,

536
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:43,810
is seeing a lot of different art styles, but I felt like...

537
00:27:44,504 --> 00:27:47,506
This is a Nancy Drew meets Girl with a Dragon tattoo.

538
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:49,669
I need to stay in that realism space,

539
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:51,871
but one of the reasons why I wanted to speak

540
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:52,972
with these two beautiful ladies

541
00:27:53,412 --> 00:27:55,654
is because I'm madly in love with their stories

542
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:58,557
and I'm particularly obsessed with this woman's art.

543
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:02,962
I love that we can tell deep, meaningful stories

544
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:04,423
with such a range of aesthetic.

545
00:28:04,803 --> 00:28:05,945
You know, it's very effective

546
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:07,126
what she's done in Shrinking Pains.

547
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:13,644
Just on the note of shrinking panes quickly, I made one big stylistic choice aside from

548
00:28:13,744 --> 00:28:18,151
making the details disappear as you play through, and that is that we never show the player

549
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:18,953
character's body.

550
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:21,737
And I thought this was really important because we didn't want to...

551
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,330
like romanticize an eating disorder.

552
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,371
We didn't want to promote that.

553
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:30,332
You had to look a certain way or weigh a certain amount

554
00:28:30,372 --> 00:28:31,792
to have an eating disorder as well.

555
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:35,894
So it's not always just like the figurative versus the literal.

556
00:28:35,934 --> 00:28:37,375
It's also what you choose to show

557
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,816
and what you choose not to show, which

558
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:41,077
I think is something that is important to also consider.

559
00:28:41,097 --> 00:28:44,858
Do you want to add to that?

560
00:28:44,898 --> 00:28:44,998
No.

561
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,059
I'm in my time.

562
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,699
We still have a minute and a half.

563
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:50,621
I can't believe we got through three games in half an hour.

564
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:52,321
But we have time for one more question.

565
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:55,510
Oh, oh, please.

566
00:28:57,591 --> 00:28:58,491
That was all wonderful.

567
00:28:58,551 --> 00:29:02,353
Thank you very much for sharing such personal things.

568
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:05,574
And my question is sort of related to what you were just

569
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:09,596
talking about, but maybe more from either a research

570
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:11,857
or resources perspective.

571
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,778
How do you know what might be a trigger?

572
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:14,818
I mean, some is obvious.

573
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:19,120
But the more subtle of how much you should present

574
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,681
and how much.

575
00:29:20,573 --> 00:29:22,033
while still remaining creative?

576
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,934
Did you have consultants or was there resources

577
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:25,454
that you had available?

578
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:27,374
Thank you very much for asking that question

579
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:28,535
because as Ella was speaking,

580
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:30,215
I was thinking I forgot to mention that.

581
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:31,835
So specifically with us,

582
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,156
we are also speaking with other rape survivors

583
00:29:34,236 --> 00:29:35,896
and people who experience PTSD,

584
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:38,497
but as well we are working with counselors

585
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:40,197
to make sure that we're doing our due diligence.

586
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:42,018
Because I think it's very important

587
00:29:42,118 --> 00:29:44,738
when all of us are trying to tackle this content

588
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:47,339
that the people who tell the story is very important,

589
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:48,499
but that we're backing it up.

590
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,981
by knowledgeable resources when we are digging this deep to the human psyche.

591
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:57,262
That's something that I'm going to jump in here too.

592
00:29:57,822 --> 00:30:02,003
It's something that could have an entire talk unto itself is where is the moral line with

593
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:07,384
creators when we are going through these issues and talking about some really heavy subject

594
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:07,924
material.

595
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,465
And the reality is you do need to consult with people if you don't have lived experiences

596
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:14,446
and it is hard to know where to draw the line.

597
00:30:14,506 --> 00:30:15,886
I mentioned that shrinking pains is.

598
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:19,609
It's hard to play, it's harrowing, it's why it's short,

599
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:21,530
it's why I don't show the sufferer's body,

600
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,532
but it is something that is likely exceedingly triggering

601
00:30:25,612 --> 00:30:27,293
to someone who has had an eating disorder.

602
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:29,415
And a big part of that is being really up front

603
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:31,556
with your content warnings and being honest

604
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:33,697
about what is gonna happen in the game,

605
00:30:34,057 --> 00:30:35,759
and that might just be highlighting everything

606
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,279
like very quickly at the beginning of the game

607
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,680
or having a way that you can access

608
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,801
that information easily.

609
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:42,663
And it's really down to a case-by-case basis.

610
00:30:43,428 --> 00:30:45,871
And as I said, if you don't have lived experiences,

611
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:47,673
obviously consult with people.

612
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,556
Like personally, shrinking pains is something

613
00:30:49,576 --> 00:30:50,997
that has a lot of my own story in it,

614
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:53,240
but more than half the team had suffered

615
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,141
from disordered eating.

616
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:57,385
So it was a collective effort of our experiences

617
00:30:57,426 --> 00:31:00,810
and what we felt was like the core underlying issue

618
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,272
when you have an eating disorder.

619
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:07,368
So yeah, I think that it is a bit of a case by case basis, but as long as we approach

620
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:12,691
it with kindness, we can make experiences that are easier to digest, or we can make

621
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:16,333
experiences for art's sake that is harder as long as there is value in it.

622
00:31:18,214 --> 00:31:18,934
If that makes sense.

623
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:20,735
Yeah.

624
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,876
Just so well.

625
00:31:23,457 --> 00:31:25,958
All right, so if you'd like to join us for a wrap up, please do.

626
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:28,419
And please don't forget to fill out those evaluation forms.

627
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,540
They really mean a lot to us.

628
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,001
And thank you for taking the time to come to our talk.

629
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:33,127
Thank you.
