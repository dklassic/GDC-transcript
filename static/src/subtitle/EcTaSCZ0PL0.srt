1
00:00:04,956 --> 00:00:07,238
Why do this talk?

2
00:00:07,238 --> 00:00:10,862
So I think this was probably the best illustration I could find.

3
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:14,705
Suppose that two 30-year-old recent MBAs, a man and a woman,

4
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:16,407
receive job offers for $100,000 a year.

5
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:19,870
By negotiating, the man raises his offer to $111,000,

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,033
while the woman accepts the $100,000.

7
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:23,974
Because that's pretty good money, right?

8
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:32,498
Even if both receive identical 3% raises for the rest of the careers, by the time they retire at 65,

9
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:36,281
the difference between their annual salaries will have widened to over $30,000.

10
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:41,585
The man who negotiated will also earn more than the woman during every one of the 35 years in

11
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:44,367
which they work. If he invests that extra income,

12
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:50,485
into an account earning 5%, that initial $11,000,

13
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:55,008
the product of a single one-time negotiation,

14
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:59,930
turns into $1.6 million by the time he's 65 years old.

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,671
So in short, an absolute goddamn fucking shit ton of money.

16
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:05,812
Thank you, Cindy Gallop.

17
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:09,334
And we want you to get your absolute goddamn fucking shit

18
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:12,656
ton of money, both men and women.

19
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,456
And I get it.

20
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,022
This shit is intimidating.

21
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:19,163
Getting past that initial hurdle

22
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:21,504
and actually going to the table and negotiating

23
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:25,885
and not just taking what you're offered, that's hard.

24
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,166
So as part of this, we've assembled a panel

25
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:33,388
of amazing speakers, or two amazing speakers in my ass.

26
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:35,348
So Robin here is gonna be talking through more

27
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:38,570
of the kind of emotional hurdles behind

28
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,710
getting up to doing salary negotiations.

29
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:44,875
I'm going to talk through some of the tools, tips, resources,

30
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,517
and just kind of prep work that you want to do getting into negotiations.

31
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:52,201
And then Elizabeth's going to bring it home with the other side of the table,

32
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:55,263
the perspective of the hiring manager.

33
00:01:55,263 --> 00:02:04,289
So without further ado, I'm going to hand you over to Robin.

34
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,210
Hello. Thanks, Sarah.

35
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:11,675
All right, I would love to get a sense of who is in the room with us today.

36
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:15,078
So if you'll indulge me, could you raise your hand if you are currently looking

37
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:18,942
for or working in the first job in the game industry?

38
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,623
Wow. Oh, that's so exciting.

39
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:21,985
Give me a round of applause.

40
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:24,547
That's really, really exciting to see you guys here.

41
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:29,532
Raise your hand if you've ever tried to negotiate a job offer before.

42
00:02:30,573 --> 00:02:31,994
Okay, good, good, good.

43
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:35,356
Keep your hand up if you successfully negotiate a job offer.

44
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,597
What are you guys doing here?

45
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:37,457
Go see something else.

46
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,478
I'm kidding, you can stay.

47
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:41,839
Raise your hand if you were just thankful

48
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:42,880
to get a job offer at all,

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,320
and so you just didn't negotiate.

50
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,261
Yeah, all right, all right.

51
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:48,623
Those are my people, all right.

52
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,757
Hi, my name is Robin.

53
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:53,418
I lead product strategy at Code Combat,

54
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:56,040
where we make a game that teaches computer science.

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,520
We are in half a million.

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,022
We are played by over half a million players in the US alone,

57
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:02,003
and we are in over 15,000 schools.

58
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:09,566
And I've been in this industry for over 12 years.

59
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,668
I started my career as a news editor,

60
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:14,769
and eventually I moved into game production and design,

61
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:16,950
where I shipped dozens of web and mobile games.

62
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,171
Most recently, I ended up in user experience design,

63
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,913
which led me to join Code Combat, where I negotiated

64
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,233
a promotion to product manager.

65
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:29,355
And now I lead strategy for one of the best coding

66
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:30,435
games that's out there.

67
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:30,555
Thanks.

68
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:37,037
I'm getting slides.

69
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:37,898
All right.

70
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:42,167
Why is negotiation terrifying?

71
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,307
Let's talk about feelings for a little bit.

72
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,788
Let's imagine for a second being in that space.

73
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:49,548
So you found a job posting that you got really excited about.

74
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:51,149
You thought you met the requirements, right?

75
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:53,749
And you got a response from your application saying,

76
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:55,409
hey, we'd love to talk to you.

77
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:57,250
We think you might be a really good fit for this role.

78
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,930
So maybe you do some phone interviews.

79
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,831
Maybe you got brought onto an on-site.

80
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:05,012
You spent a lot of time getting real excited about this job.

81
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,472
You're really eager to hear back.

82
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:08,032
And then.

83
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:13,437
Yeah, you see this, this call or the female comes in.

84
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:15,939
Whoo, that is good.

85
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,140
I mean, I have a job right now, and I'm still

86
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,980
excited to see this, right?

87
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,682
We'd love to extend to you an offer to join our team.

88
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:22,843
It feels amazing.

89
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:25,844
Every bone in your body, every fiber of your being is like,

90
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:27,585
yes, let's friggin' do this, right?

91
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,567
And this is the last thing you want to do after all that

92
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:33,268
is to negotiate, right?

93
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:35,289
You want nothing to do with that conversation.

94
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:36,970
Maybe you weren't prepared, or maybe you

95
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,771
haven't researched the salary ranges.

96
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,732
Maybe you have no idea what to do next.

97
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:44,354
Because what if you ask and something bad happens, right?

98
00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:45,595
Like, what if you ask and?

99
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,869
you appear ungrateful or unreasonable.

100
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,371
All of those feels are terrifying,

101
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:54,072
and that's the reason I want to call that out.

102
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:56,534
There's a lot to recognize about the emotional components

103
00:04:56,534 --> 00:05:00,657
of negotiation, and I want to talk about all those feelings

104
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:01,738
that we get.

105
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:03,099
But I also want to call out that I

106
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:04,780
think all these things are swirling

107
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,663
around one big unspoken thing, specifically

108
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:09,224
in the game industry.

109
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:09,964
And it is.

110
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:16,049
that like why is it truly truly terrifying to make that ask when you're in the game industry?

111
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:23,014
Because this is my dream job, right? How many raise your hand if you have thought this to

112
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:27,037
yourself as you've like gone through a job interview process, right? This could be it.

113
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:35,784
This could be my dream job. So here's the secret. Our industry traffics in dream jobs.

114
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,028
You've heard this from friends before, right?

115
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:41,810
You are so lucky to be working in the game industry.

116
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,251
Wow, that must be so cool.

117
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:46,414
And you've thought this to yourself before, right?

118
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:46,814
You know what?

119
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:47,775
Things are really stressful.

120
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:51,097
I'm working 70, 80 hours a week, but you know, I'm so lucky

121
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,139
to be working in the game industry.

122
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,359
I should be grateful.

123
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,440
People would kill for this job.

124
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,083
And you've heard it from your peers, the hourly rates

125
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,245
that they settle for to work on the biggest franchises.

126
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:06,348
And I think we use the idea of a dream job

127
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:10,131
to use it as a bludgeon as a manner of all labor

128
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,653
complaints, compensation complaints,

129
00:06:12,653 --> 00:06:14,394
and any career development that you really want.

130
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:16,997
Because the message that we receive at the end of the day

131
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:18,378
is, sure, you can have your dream job

132
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,801
of working in the game industry, but only conditionally, right?

133
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:29,302
I think the industry is really poor for these dynamics, these stories that we have to give

134
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:32,246
up control, we have to give up agency in order to have dream jobs.

135
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:34,067
I think they stunt us, I think they burn us out.

136
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:38,832
And I think that this is the same dynamic that leads us to say yes to the first offer

137
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,956
that comes our way that causes us to believe that we shouldn't risk it.

138
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:48,995
We have to replace this belief in the dream job, right?

139
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:54,977
I think it's born from a place of fear, the fear of losing our chance to work at our like our favorite studio working on

140
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:59,459
our favorite franchises. I think we end up manifesting these fears and self-limiting beliefs

141
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,620
and it makes us feel like we can't negotiate because it's risking too much, right?

142
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,701
We have to acknowledge that these are the kinds of fears that are in place when we get to that moment when you see a

143
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,762
job offer land in your email inbox.

144
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:15,208
And I think we have to acknowledge that it's preventing us from shifting our mindset.

145
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:21,395
And so I want to talk specifically about three self-limiting beliefs that prevent us from

146
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,758
negotiating and how we need to change the way we approach them.

147
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:30,520
So self-limiting belief number one, I'm asking for too much.

148
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,261
Who's felt this when they were thinking about negotiating?

149
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:34,181
Super common feeling.

150
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:36,521
I think this one comes from the stories that we've

151
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:38,822
heard from other game developers getting shortchanged

152
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:40,162
or having to settle for less.

153
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,063
That may be true for them, but that doesn't

154
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:43,143
have to be true for you.

155
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,063
I think this feeling of asking for too much,

156
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:47,944
I think it comes from, oh, they must know more

157
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:50,465
about industry salary ranges than me,

158
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:52,605
or they must be offering me what I deserve.

159
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,306
Or maybe that's the way the pay scale

160
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:55,446
is at this particular studio.

161
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,291
there must be a reason the offer is where it is so if I can negotiate I'll

162
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:05,478
be seen as asking for too much. This is a huge self-limiting belief right because

163
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:09,563
we often gauge our self-worth on what other people tell us our worth is. So the

164
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:14,589
mind shift that we need to make here is I know my worth.

165
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:17,048
You have to know your market worth, right,

166
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:19,148
which is what Tara will cover in the strategies talk.

167
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,809
But I think you also really need to internalize this idea

168
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:24,869
that you are worthy, you guys are worthy of working

169
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:27,430
at a place that acknowledges and validates the values

170
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,810
and the skills that you're bringing.

171
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,671
I think we need to notice when this feeling comes up

172
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:33,291
of I'm not enough and realize that it's coming

173
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,172
from this kind of like unfounded fear, right?

174
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:37,553
It's not a reality and we can shift this mindset

175
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:39,453
and let go of judging our value

176
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,313
by what other people tell us it is.

177
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,834
And in this case, it may be that starting job offer.

178
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,703
So I think we need to shift our thinking to, I know my worth.

179
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:53,625
I deserve to earn a salary that is commiserate with the value

180
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,486
that I'll be creating for this company.

181
00:08:55,486 --> 00:09:01,150
All right, self-limiting belief number two,

182
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,131
I'm not good enough.

183
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:04,932
Who's felt this before?

184
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:05,592
I feel this every day.

185
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:08,714
I think this one is especially rough,

186
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,175
especially when we worked so hard

187
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,956
to get to this dream job because in a lot of ways,

188
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:18,327
Maybe we didn't believe we could actually get the stream job to begin with right? This is imposter syndrome like 101

189
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:23,293
This is imposter syndrome in its most insidious form and it's a sense that like maybe I'm not

190
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:29,479
You know experienced enough to ask for a better offer or to negotiate because like yikes maybe I tricked them into hiring me

191
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,424
And I really should just be grateful that, you know, and just like get away with it.

192
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:38,789
And so, you know, I shouldn't make any noise because what if they realize that and you

193
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:41,472
know, they realize that I'm not actually supposed to have this job.

194
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:45,696
I should just lay low, not give them any chance to realize the mistake that they've made here.

195
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:47,778
So that's one of the huge problem.

196
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,837
Instead, we got to think about this.

197
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:54,138
I earned this offer.

198
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:55,618
This is the shift that I want us to make.

199
00:09:55,618 --> 00:09:57,279
I already got this offer, right?

200
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,080
They made the decision already to hire you.

201
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,460
You crushed that interview.

202
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,321
You showed up and you showed them all the things

203
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:04,161
that you're gonna be bringing to this job,

204
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:06,402
your enthusiasm, your skills, your dedication,

205
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:07,462
your commitment to this game.

206
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:10,804
And if we can shift from feeling like I'm not good enough

207
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:13,244
and starting to let go of that imposter syndrome,

208
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:15,805
that self-belief, we can move towards actually

209
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:20,508
I already earned this offer. I can make sure it's truly what I want here.

210
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:26,110
So I think that this is an important shift to make because I think it starts

211
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,672
making sure that we're not only, you know, negotiating in service of getting the salary

212
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,953
that we want from a starting salary standpoint, but it's recognizing that you actually deserve

213
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:38,474
to be on this team, right? You've earned this offer and you deserve to work at this place.

214
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:41,095
And that's really important for this next one.

215
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:43,993
which is self-limiting belief number three.

216
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:45,594
They're hiring somewhere else.

217
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,255
They're gonna hire somebody else.

218
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:49,096
If I negotiate, they're gonna hire somebody else.

219
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,816
And this one is hard because you've already gotten

220
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,317
to this point where you have this job offer.

221
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:54,885
And this one's not just a mindset, right?

222
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,306
It's a rarity, but it's a reality.

223
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:58,989
We hear just enough that it kind of scares us

224
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:01,592
from asking because maybe this is the time that we're

225
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:03,535
going to get this happening to us.

226
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:05,197
So there's a lot here that strategy-wise

227
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,458
that Tara and Elizabeth will cover

228
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,500
about how to structure an ask so that you'll set yourself up

229
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,742
for success here.

230
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:11,704
But if you're letting your fear limit

231
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,307
trying to negotiate in the first place,

232
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:19,243
I think we're perpetuating a cycle that allows companies to continue this behavior on other

233
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:24,629
people. I think that this is like really, really damaging in that way. And I think that the

234
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:30,576
mindset shift that we need to make is that I can break this cycle, right? This is the mindset shift

235
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:30,996
we need.

236
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,592
Be the one to break the cycle.

237
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,334
Make it difficult for this company

238
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:36,695
to have to shoulder the burden of going

239
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,857
through the extra work of hiring another person

240
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:41,300
to potentially have to continue their search, right?

241
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,142
Again, you deserve to work in this game industry.

242
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:44,523
You have earned an offer.

243
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:46,505
And now you have an opportunity to break a cycle

244
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,847
that we know is being used to prevent other folks from getting

245
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:49,868
what they deserve.

246
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:52,130
Make sure that the next person that comes along

247
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,872
will be able to negotiate as well.

248
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:55,153
Break that cycle.

249
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:04,093
So the reason it's hard to negotiate is because we're led to believe this is our one shot at our dream job, right?

250
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:09,655
That's why all those fears are amplified. That's the notion that this is our chance.

251
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:11,396
Like this is how we're gonna make it.

252
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:16,958
But it's actually the same reason that we have to negotiate because if we don't negotiate, it's not actually our dream job.

253
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:22,080
I think we have to be willing to ask for what we deserve in service of making our dream jobs a reality.

254
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:27,758
And here's the real secret, negotiation begets negotiation.

255
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:30,184
I have a single slide with an image in this entire talk,

256
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,547
and that's how important this is.

257
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:35,908
If you give a mouse a cookie, they will ask for a glass of milk.

258
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:39,329
If you start your job with salary negotiation, you are setting yourself up

259
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,730
to be able to advocate for the things that will actually make this job

260
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,071
a dream job for you.

261
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:46,952
You're going to be able to advocate for the coworkers around you.

262
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:49,633
You're going to be able to ask for the support that you need.

263
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:50,914
You're going to be able to ask for that promotion

264
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:52,514
once you realize you've earned it right.

265
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:55,115
That's actually the creation of a dream job.

266
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:56,796
It doesn't happen when you accept the offer.

267
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:59,017
And it's not just about the starting salary or the benefits.

268
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:03,240
I think we gotta let go of this idea that the dream job is shaped in a package somehow.

269
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,603
We receive it and then we have to pretend that we have to hold on to it, right?

270
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:11,345
I think that when you realize that the dream job is something that you shape versus something

271
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:14,908
that is given to you, that's when you start to make the shift, right?

272
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:17,350
Negotiation begets negotiation.

273
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,210
Be the mouse.

274
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,692
Be the mouse that asks for the cookie.

275
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:22,053
This is your negotiation mantra.

276
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:24,775
I know my worth.

277
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:27,237
I earned this offer.

278
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:33,535
I can break the cycle.

279
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:34,216
You've got this.

280
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:35,316
Make the ask.

281
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,097
Shape your dream job.

282
00:13:37,097 --> 00:13:50,964
We believe in you, and you have got this, folks.

283
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:59,322
So my portion of the talk is going to be focused a little more on finding the resources and the tools that are going to help you feel

284
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:05,767
prepared for your negotiations. So briefly, my name is Tara J. Branigan. I'm the community lead at 5CA. We're a

285
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:09,950
customer support outsourcer in the Netherlands.

286
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,534
I'm pretty much on Twitter 24-7, so if you ever have any questions, or you just want to reach out,

287
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:16,595
that's the best place to get me.

288
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:21,279
I've worked at a whole bunch of different game companies and non-game companies all around the globe.

289
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,051
And this is pretty much me on any given day.

290
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:29,552
I am an anxiety-filled mess about 24-7,

291
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:32,353
I'd say, not when I'm sleeping,

292
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:34,814
but also while I am sleeping.

293
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:36,934
I overthink everything constantly,

294
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:40,755
and I mean shit that I did back in elementary school

295
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,876
still recycles.

296
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:46,817
So for me, it's really important to have a foundation

297
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:50,738
of facts and figures and tools at my disposal,

298
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:52,118
because those are the things.

299
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:58,134
that calm me down and make me feel like I'm standing on firm ground.

300
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:01,137
In short, I like to be prepared.

301
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:05,400
And welcome to that being stuck in your head for the rest of the time here.

302
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,923
So, what's in your toolbox?

303
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:13,547
What are the things that you know going into salary negotiations?

304
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:16,770
What are the scripts that you've practiced?

305
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,991
Do you know what this job is worth?

306
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:25,192
When you're starting out, your toolbox might look a little more like this.

307
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,474
And that's okay, because as with anything,

308
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:31,937
you build on this over time. And I'm gonna say, I don't have all the answers.

309
00:15:31,937 --> 00:15:36,461
I don't even have half the answers, but getting started is one of the hardest

310
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:39,103
things to do. So for me, one of the first steps is to

311
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:42,666
research and to ask. So there are tools out there, and I'll

312
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,608
I'll say like, treat things like Glassdoor and Payscale.

313
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:47,210
you know

314
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:52,048
You know, this is kind of the sad fact, and Robin talked about this a bit, is that

315
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:56,870
you have to kind of count on some game industry tax here, and that can be anything from 5 to 20%.

316
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:03,953
Community management, I use this one specifically because community managers in gamedev,

317
00:16:03,953 --> 00:16:09,435
we're all getting screwed. Like, that's the nicest way I can put it. If you compare the

318
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:15,937
community manager salary for the average community manager in San Francisco at a given tech company,

319
00:16:16,534 --> 00:16:19,795
versus, say, those two anonymous game dev salaries

320
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:21,316
both from the UK and the US,

321
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:24,677
you'll notice a substantial difference.

322
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:28,538
And part of that is, you know, understanding that

323
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:30,379
and pushing back against it,

324
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,399
because it doesn't actually change

325
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,560
until we start to push for our own value.

326
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,862
And if you have friends who have been in those roles

327
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:41,702
who will tell you their salary in a trustworthy environment,

328
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:43,803
do it. I'll tell you straight up,

329
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,344
when I started at PopCap some...

330
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:49,494
I don't even know how many years ago at this point.

331
00:16:49,494 --> 00:16:52,296
That was like seven years ago.

332
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:55,478
I was making $75,000 as a community manager with one year experience.

333
00:16:55,478 --> 00:16:58,000
It's gone down.

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,224
Fun thing about the state of California, so Californians.

335
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:07,998
you actually have access to an amazing law.

336
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:14,459
So this new law, AB 168, bars employers from asking about your salary history,

337
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,760
either past or current.

338
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,740
On top of that, if you ask them,

339
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,721
they must provide you with the salary ban for the role.

340
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:25,801
I highly recommend asking that.

341
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:29,282
And this applies to all job seekers.

342
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,502
It doesn't matter if you're entry-level or CEO,

343
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:33,563
you are able to take advantage of this.

344
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:33,683
Do it.

345
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:39,310
So for me, one of the things that was really useful, and I'll recommend to anybody,

346
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,312
after this talk, if you haven't already done it, go check out Tara Wheeler's

347
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:48,774
Minute Zero in the Gender Pay Gap. It's a free article. It's up on Medium. It's bloody brilliant.

348
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:52,695
She also did the Women in Tech book that actually goes into this in more in-depth,

349
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:59,538
but if you want to just get started right away, go for this. She outlines a lot of great scripts

350
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:04,660
that address some of the common problems in doing salary negotiations. So

351
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:08,702
Here's this is just one example. That's a great place to start.

352
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:10,944
I understand that you can't go outside of your salary band.

353
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:15,229
So let's work on finding other ways to get your offer.

354
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:18,233
I can't say that word. I'm sorry

355
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:20,435
with my others, because I love this company

356
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:22,217
and I really want to find a way to work here.

357
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:26,866
And this opens up the opportunity to look at things outside of salary as well.

358
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:29,628
Would you like to work from home a day each week?

359
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:31,089
That's worth a certain amount.

360
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,790
For me, I would absolutely sacrifice a little bit of money

361
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,491
to be able to work from home a day or two.

362
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:41,054
And you don't have to use these scripts one-to-one.

363
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,495
You don't have to practice these rote memorization.

364
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:46,457
That's actually going to come off a little robotic.

365
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:51,560
It's taking this idea and adapting it to your own way of communicating.

366
00:18:53,312 --> 00:19:01,895
A special note as somebody who has moved abroad, make sure to look at the cost of living comparison

367
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:04,836
because it's not a one-to-one.

368
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:10,978
You know, $75,000 in Seattle, you're not going to get 75,000 euros in Stuttgart, Deutschland.

369
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:16,251
The thing to pay attention to, like this is just numbeo.com,

370
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:18,433
and these are not like directly,

371
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:20,896
you know, it's not going to give you exact costs,

372
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:23,539
but it's going to give you a nice rough idea

373
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,841
of what the differential is.

374
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:28,143
The big one to pay attention here is rent price,

375
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:30,286
because that's going to be a large portion

376
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:31,847
of your monthly income.

377
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:33,449
In the case of Stuttgart and Seattle.

378
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:42,352
Rent prices are 97% higher in Seattle, so that helps frame what you should be asking for

379
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:49,957
if offered a job in Stuttgart. So negotiations. Sometimes we kind of think of those like this,

380
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:55,101
right? Really hostile, you're trying to win, it's about beating the other person, right?

381
00:19:55,101 --> 00:20:03,446
Well, not according to the FBI, actually. So Chris Voss was one of the top negotiators with the FBI.

382
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:07,298
He wrote this brilliant book, I recommend all of you check it out.

383
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:10,980
Even if you're not going into salary negotiations, this is great for day-to-day living.

384
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,162
It's called Never Split the Difference.

385
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:14,823
Negotiating as if your life depended on it.

386
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:17,726
And this is the sort of guy that they called in where, you know,

387
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:21,769
somebody's been taken hostage, they're going to kill him in seven days.

388
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:22,469
They're asking for $300,000.

389
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:22,950
What do we do?

390
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:28,915
This is not a situation where they're shouting.

391
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:29,855
Most of his.

392
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:34,572
Recommendations are actually about learning how to harness your voice,

393
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:38,837
learning the difference between an upward tone and a downward tone.

394
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:43,663
One suggests that there's more to be said and the other says this is the end of

395
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:48,088
the conversation. Learning how to mirror words selectively.

396
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:51,091
So this, I actually love doing this once I learned how to do this.

397
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:54,788
is mirroring words selectively is when somebody says something,

398
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:57,189
pick the last one to three words that they said and say,

399
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:01,590
it sounds like what you're saying is blah, blah, blah.

400
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,811
This is wonderful because one, it makes the other person feel like you are

401
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:09,172
genuinely listening to them and you genuinely understand them.

402
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:12,693
Two, it is a great stalling tactic for when you're frantically trying to figure

403
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:15,714
out the next thing to say because that actually doesn't take much mental

404
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:16,174
bandwidth.

405
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:21,013
Chris focuses a ton on empathy.

406
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,834
So a large part of negotiation is actually

407
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:25,735
about understanding the wants, needs,

408
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:27,555
and limitations of the other party.

409
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:31,416
It's not about a fight, it's not about who's going to win.

410
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,856
It's about learning how to find

411
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:34,377
where the win-win situation is.

412
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,897
And I can't get into all of this

413
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:38,438
because we only have so much time,

414
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:41,958
but I just want to say like the summary of this

415
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,719
is this is more about understanding other people,

416
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,040
the constraints that they are in,

417
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:53,295
listening to them as a human being, and finding a situation that works for both of you.

418
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:58,758
Again, it's not a battle. Your target is a win-win. A situation in which one person feels

419
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:06,121
cheated either direction is a bad way to enter a job. You do not want to enter a new role feeling

420
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:12,264
like you got screwed out of money. It will eat at you every single day. You will start to resent

421
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,084
your dream job.

422
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:20,680
And conversely, if an employer feels like you just went too far and they caved,

423
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,322
they're also not going to feel great about that situation.

424
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:31,367
So one of the things that always makes me feel good, and to be fair, I don't actually use this

425
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:34,089
in the negotiation. I'm not sure if you can even see that,

426
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:36,831
but I'll post a version of this up on the website later.

427
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:42,525
is I go through the process of writing out basically my hit list of like,

428
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:48,468
what is my goal? What is my current salary? What is the salary I want to get to? What are

429
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:54,492
the constraints around that? You know, is healthcare different in that state, that country?

430
00:22:54,492 --> 00:23:00,315
A summary, why I'm great. Like, this makes me feel really good going into negotiations. It's

431
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:04,117
just a reminder that like, no, actually I am, you know, I earned.

432
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:09,377
I earned my place to get to the negotiation stage.

433
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:13,060
What they want, do I fit that?

434
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,761
Yes, I do.

435
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:16,283
So let's keep going along here.

436
00:23:16,283 --> 00:23:17,864
Some calibrated questions.

437
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:22,187
Those are questions that are gonna pull out more information

438
00:23:22,187 --> 00:23:26,171
about the role, their constraints, their limitations.

439
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,012
Realistically, a lot of negotiation

440
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:30,614
is just asking questions and genuinely listening.

441
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:38,705
And sometimes it's just saying like, well, you know, I'm the sole breadwinner of my family at this point in time.

442
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:41,987
That's probably not going to change for the next six months.

443
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,509
How am I supposed to make this offer work in the city?

444
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:48,872
And just posing that as a question and saying that nicely and openly,

445
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:54,656
people will naturally go into a mode of troubleshooting like, oh, OK, well, maybe we can do this.

446
00:23:54,656 --> 00:24:00,840
Or, you know, would it be helpful if we gave your partner relocation assistance and job assistance?

447
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:05,679
These are all benefits that can be negotiated for as part of this process.

448
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,363
And again, I don't take this with me into the negotiation unless I'm able to do it by Skype,

449
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:15,105
and then I will totally have it open in another window for reference.

450
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:18,668
But I just look at this beforehand. It gives me a little more confidence on the next step.

451
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:23,391
And this is something that says a lot about me.

452
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:29,395
But sometimes it can be really useful to remember that it's not just about you.

453
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,642
When something's just about me, I'm really prone to just downplaying it,

454
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:35,683
like, oh, well, you know, it's not that big a deal.

455
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,964
It's just me. It's just me.

456
00:24:36,964 --> 00:24:40,866
Which I mean, that's a whole separate, separate talk about self-care

457
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:41,987
that we will get into.

458
00:24:41,987 --> 00:24:46,649
But for me, it can be really beneficial to just remember, like, look, me

459
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:49,571
negotiating means that it should be easier for the next woman

460
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,772
in the same situation in this company.

461
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,833
And I gotta say, there's nothing that made me more confident about negotiating

462
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,535
than being on the other side of the table.

463
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:07,117
So as a hiring manager, I learned very quickly what the wiggle room is,

464
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:10,219
what's acceptable, what's not acceptable.

465
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:13,881
And I'm not going to go in depth in that because that's all of Elizabeth's talk.

466
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,462
So without further ado.

467
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:24,495
Hi, everybody.

468
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:26,557
Before I get into my talk, I just

469
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:29,879
also want to put in a plug for the book,

470
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:31,180
Never Split the Difference.

471
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,180
It's really amazing.

472
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,823
I actually bought a copy for my studio,

473
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:38,205
and it gets a lot of circulation.

474
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,267
It's not just useful for salary negotiations,

475
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:45,290
but really any kind of trying to get to a consensus

476
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,051
that you will have to do in your work.

477
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:51,858
That said, hi, I'm Elizabeth Stampat.

478
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:55,320
I'm the studio creative director at Future Games of London.

479
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,182
We are an Ubisoft studio, and I just

480
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,804
want to let you know that we've just started pushing

481
00:25:59,804 --> 00:26:02,145
a huge hiring campaign.

482
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,707
Every single one of our studios all over the world

483
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:05,748
is hiring right now.

484
00:26:05,748 --> 00:26:08,750
So if you would like to get some experience with salary

485
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,813
negotiation, I strongly urge you to check out our hiring booth.

486
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:20,061
Before I was the creative director at FGAL, I was the game design department lead at Saibo Games,

487
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:24,644
and I was also one of the lead designers on Plants vs. Zombies 2 at PopCap.

488
00:26:24,644 --> 00:26:30,687
I've been deeply involved in hiring in almost every job I've had over the last seven years,

489
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:35,210
whether in an independent company or in studios owned by larger companies.

490
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:42,452
And to my detriment, it took me a while to realize something important, which was the

491
00:26:42,452 --> 00:26:48,980
ways in which I was getting hired were also the ways in which I was hiring other people.

492
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,906
The constraints that I was under as a hiring manager were often the constraints that people

493
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:55,868
trying to hire me were under as well.

494
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:02,789
I have friends with stories about how they tried to negotiate salary or benefits or something

495
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,591
else and instead of countering, the company did actually pull their offer.

496
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:11,835
If this has happened to you nine times out of ten, it's not because you said or did anything

497
00:27:11,835 --> 00:27:12,655
inappropriate.

498
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:16,277
But sometimes there are just requests that hiring managers can't fulfill.

499
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:20,440
And if you haven't phrased those requests correctly,

500
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,842
it's easy for a studio to believe that employing you wouldn't work out,

501
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:28,324
even if you would have actually been fine taking the original offer.

502
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:31,646
So, if you've ever sat at your computer

503
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:36,088
staring at an offer letter and wondering what the hiring manager was thinking

504
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,970
when they were drafting its contents,

505
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,290
let me let you in on the secret.

506
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:43,115
First of all, we really want you to take the job.

507
00:27:43,838 --> 00:27:46,419
Do you know how expensive hiring is?

508
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:49,539
A studio may be paying internal recruiters,

509
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,860
contracting with external recruiters,

510
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,741
paying to place job ads on job boards,

511
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:58,782
and a million other small things that all cost money.

512
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:01,703
Even small studios usually have someone whose job it is

513
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:04,564
to just go through LinkedIn while they're on the clock.

514
00:28:04,564 --> 00:28:06,784
Sometimes it's an HR representative,

515
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,985
but often it's just the hiring manager themselves

516
00:28:09,985 --> 00:28:12,086
when they get fed up about the role sitting empty.

517
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:17,418
But there's also the expense of just having the empty desk.

518
00:28:17,418 --> 00:28:21,702
Sure, the company's not paying a salary right then,

519
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:24,264
but if there's somebody in the office who's given notice,

520
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:26,286
every day without their replacement

521
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:27,687
is a day when there's no handover,

522
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:31,070
when some precious amount of institutional knowledge

523
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,511
is risking getting lost.

524
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:36,258
Or if there is actually a desk already sitting empty,

525
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:41,160
that's another day with somebody who has differing skills and responsibilities

526
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:47,483
having to cover them, adding additional stress and taking away from that person's original workload.

527
00:28:47,483 --> 00:28:51,765
Maybe they can't have anyone cover that role at all, and the role just isn't getting done.

528
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:54,887
Maybe it's holding up the timeline of a project.

529
00:28:54,887 --> 00:28:57,628
Maybe that means that a publisher is breathing down their neck.

530
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:05,409
So sure, there might be someone else waiting in the wings to accept if you turn the job down,

531
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:10,054
but while you're deliberating on whether this job is right for you,

532
00:29:10,054 --> 00:29:13,878
that runner-up may be out interviewing for their dream role.

533
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:19,604
And regardless, we already decided that person is the runner-up. We want you.

534
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:25,790
And if there's not a runner-up, that means we have to spend even more on recruitment,

535
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:31,858
starting over from scratch, pushing the timeline down the road by weeks or months, which is

536
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:33,701
a pretty shitty worst-case scenario.

537
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:38,556
We're not trying to insult anyone with a lowball offer.

538
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:42,178
Nothing about offering you a job is trying to make you feel bad.

539
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,239
We're just crossing our fingers that you take it,

540
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:48,501
and doing everything in our power to try to make the offer compelling.

541
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:52,323
We're trying to get to yes with you as quickly and efficiently as possible.

542
00:29:54,242 --> 00:29:57,125
But we're not in control of everything,

543
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,067
especially if you're applying to a studio

544
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:00,589
owned by a larger company.

545
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:02,611
There are salary bands in play

546
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:04,974
that sometimes we just can't go out of.

547
00:30:04,974 --> 00:30:06,836
I know this is a lot of people

548
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:09,139
trying to get into their first job in the industry,

549
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:11,622
so quick show of hands, who knows what a salary band is?

550
00:30:13,257 --> 00:30:13,737
OK, great.

551
00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:15,097
I'll do a really quick definition.

552
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:18,659
Basically, it means that the company as a whole

553
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:21,200
sets a salary range for each particular title

554
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,181
that the company has.

555
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:26,983
And they don't allow people to go outside of that band.

556
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,684
Sometimes we can get wiggle room there

557
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:31,145
by changing the title in order to get a little bit more

558
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:32,005
salary.

559
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:35,307
But in order to do that, we have to justify that title

560
00:30:35,307 --> 00:30:36,627
change for the role.

561
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,848
And the parent company may not authorize

562
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,069
changing that resource.

563
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,262
At a previous company, I once had a role sit open for months because the salary band we

564
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:51,443
were required to stay within wasn't compelling to the people who had the skills that we needed,

565
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:56,025
and it was difficult to get our parent company to change the role title on offer to something

566
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:57,045
with a better salary.

567
00:30:58,155 --> 00:31:02,981
Likewise, special requests are often a great way to get value when you can't get more of

568
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:06,807
a salary, but some requests are harder than others to grant.

569
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:11,934
Things that are visible to the rest of the studio, like regular work from home days or

570
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:12,955
extra vacation days.

571
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:17,249
are often suggestions that are made in articles and that kind of thing.

572
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:21,712
But unless the office already has a standing work from home policy

573
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:24,514
or a flexible vacation allowance,

574
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:27,536
studios can be really concerned that offering special treatment

575
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:30,658
could set a precedent and annoy veteran employees.

576
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:34,821
Maybe a company could afford to give you an extra week of vacation time,

577
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:38,524
but if they have to multiply that by 50 or 100 employees,

578
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,185
that gets hairy real fast.

579
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:45,569
We also don't want to hire you.

580
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:47,591
We want to retain you.

581
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:50,014
If you tell us that it is vitally important

582
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:51,956
that you make 20% more than we offered you,

583
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:54,238
and that takes it outside of the salary band,

584
00:31:54,238 --> 00:31:57,701
or that you need to work from home two days a week

585
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:59,323
in order to be happy and successful,

586
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:01,465
but the policy is one day a week,

587
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:04,748
then yeah, we might pull the offer.

588
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:05,709
Why?

589
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:06,750
Because we believe you.

590
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:14,099
If you decide in the moment to settle for a salary 20% less than what you told us you need,

591
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:19,680
that means your interest is going to be peaked by every single recruiter who contacts you on

592
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,342
LinkedIn. You'll rate your job satisfaction lower on every annual company review.

593
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:28,403
And you might get raises, and believe me, if you're doing your best,

594
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:32,324
we will advocate as hard as we can to get you those raises.

595
00:32:32,324 --> 00:32:37,185
But every time we do, we'll both know that you still believe you're worth more than you're

596
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:37,405
getting.

597
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,603
which means you have a higher likelihood of quitting,

598
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:43,688
which means that we lose the training and energy put into you,

599
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:49,115
and we have to go through the expense of hiring all over again.

600
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:52,880
We want you to be happy right from the jump, and if we think we can't give you

601
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,383
what you need to be happy, there's no moving forward.

602
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:58,679
I know, this sounds really depressing.

603
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:02,344
Everyone else is telling you to negotiate and it sounds like I'm just up here giving

604
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:03,846
you the company line.

605
00:33:03,846 --> 00:33:08,071
But really, I want you to know the lay of the land before we start talking about how

606
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:11,515
you can make this information work for you.

607
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:15,600
First of all, there is a salary band, not a salary.

608
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:20,601
This isn't true for every studio, but if you're applying someplace really large,

609
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:25,945
or at a company that owns multiple studios, it's almost certainly true in order to keep

610
00:33:25,945 --> 00:33:32,709
things equal and fair. So, when you feel it's appropriate, you can utter these magic words.

611
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:37,212
I know it's a bit early, but I'm in discussions with a few other studios and I just wanted to

612
00:33:37,212 --> 00:33:41,975
make sure we're aligned. I understand that compensation is more than salary,

613
00:33:41,975 --> 00:33:43,936
but what is your range for this role?

614
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:48,173
If they ask you what you're currently making, and you're not in California,

615
00:33:48,173 --> 00:33:52,657
say that you're just trying to ensure salary is competitive for the current market.

616
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:57,261
After all, it's not like they're competing against your old studio to hire you.

617
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:03,847
There's a chance that when you try to negotiate that first offer you're made,

618
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:06,670
you may be told that that's the top of their range.

619
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:08,986
That could be possible.

620
00:34:08,986 --> 00:34:11,847
If you hear that, it's because one of many things

621
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:13,587
could be going on.

622
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:16,008
Maybe you made your salary history and expectations clear,

623
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:19,129
and they knew it would be a stretch to compete if they

624
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:21,729
didn't start as high as possible.

625
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:24,190
Maybe you're more qualified than the other applicants,

626
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,890
so they're really afraid of losing you,

627
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:29,311
so they wanted to come out really strong from the gate.

628
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:32,772
Or maybe they're being foolish and risking

629
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:35,793
a relationship that should be built on trust by lying to you.

630
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:44,734
Look, most of the time, there is absolutely no reason for the first offer to be the best offer.

631
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:47,856
Not just because it's not financially responsible for the studio,

632
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:53,200
but it also could mean that there's less room for raises early on in your tenure,

633
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,543
because you're already at the top of that salary band.

634
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:59,545
But the main issue is this.

635
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:04,108
We live in a society where most people expect to be able to negotiate their salary offer.

636
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:11,417
Consistently offering the top of your range is a great way to lose candidates who assume you're just being stingy.

637
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:15,900
Recruiters in HR read the exact same hiring advice as everyone else.

638
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:23,044
If the candidate is never supposed to accept the first offer, the company has to leave some breathing room.

639
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:25,726
How much breathing room?

640
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:32,790
Not a ton, but usually enough to make a difference. If you're talking about a salaried role, I would not go more than 5k.

641
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:38,220
The tricky part is estimating where you are inside of a salary band.

642
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,284
It's rare that a company would automatically offer at the lowest part of their range, but

643
00:35:43,284 --> 00:35:47,608
it's also really rare that they would agree to offer a candidate that they did offer at

644
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:51,651
the lowest part of their range, the highest possible part of the salary band.

645
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:57,516
You might be able to negotiate more in special circumstances, but if you're trying to be

646
00:35:57,516 --> 00:35:59,158
safe, I would stick around 5K.

647
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:04,996
Also, if you can't get the salary you're looking for,

648
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:09,639
negotiate benefits that are unique to your specific situation.

649
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,201
If studios are rightly concerned with equality,

650
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:15,104
it may be difficult to get more of the things

651
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:18,427
that are standardized throughout all employees.

652
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,228
But when you're starting at a new company,

653
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:23,811
that's a great time to bring up ideas for unique benefits

654
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:26,833
that wouldn't necessarily apply to everyone in the first place.

655
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,405
If you're relocating for a job, it could be much easier to negotiate a higher relocation

656
00:36:32,405 --> 00:36:34,647
package than a higher salary.

657
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:40,334
When I first got my first job in Europe, I was terrified of getting stranded because

658
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:45,900
international relocation is a nightmare and I was uprooting my entire family just to take

659
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,021
a chance on this company.

660
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:53,144
I used my unique situation to negotiate a clause in my contract where if I left the

661
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:59,486
company for any reason in the first 12 months, they would then relocate me back to the city

662
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:03,808
of my choice in the United States, all expenses paid.

663
00:37:03,808 --> 00:37:09,790
So when I lost my job after 11 months, knowing that I could get my family home if I didn't

664
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:13,051
find a job that worked for me in Europe was a massive relief.

665
00:37:14,845 --> 00:37:17,747
I also have friends who have negotiated successfully

666
00:37:17,747 --> 00:37:20,168
for personal development days, basically

667
00:37:20,168 --> 00:37:22,350
being able to go to conferences on their own dime

668
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,271
without taking vacation time to go.

669
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:26,393
This is a great tactic to take if you're

670
00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:28,754
new to the game industry, because you can really

671
00:37:28,754 --> 00:37:33,017
spin that as wanting to get even more experience and even

672
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,659
more knowledge as quickly as possible.

673
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:38,441
Fewer friends have been able to get guaranteed paid access

674
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:40,343
to certain conferences every year,

675
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:42,084
but it never hurts to ask if you can make

676
00:37:42,084 --> 00:37:43,305
a really compelling argument.

677
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:47,141
Basically, when you're asking for these unique perks,

678
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:51,184
imagine a co-worker who gets paid exactly what you get paid

679
00:37:51,184 --> 00:37:53,626
coming to HR and saying,

680
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:57,068
why does this person get so much more than I get

681
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,970
when I've been with the company so much longer?

682
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:05,895
Give the HR person a really compelling argument to make.

683
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:09,998
Look, job hunting is basically like online dating.

684
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:15,476
When you start out, you're doing everything possible on your Tinder or your OkCupid profile

685
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:17,517
to seem broadly appealing.

686
00:38:17,517 --> 00:38:22,540
But once you're tired and jaded, your profile just becomes a list of shit you're not willing

687
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,923
to put up with any longer in order to weed out people early.

688
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:30,905
Don't be hostile or aggressive because you might put off people you could click with.

689
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:33,647
Instead, just be friendly and honest about what you're looking for.

690
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:40,132
I had a fantastic interview with a company whose work was incredibly exciting to me.

691
00:38:40,132 --> 00:38:46,413
They flew me to a totally different country, put me up in an amazing hotel, took me out

692
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:51,374
to dinner the night before my interview, and then I spent the entire day of interviews

693
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:55,855
being really excited and energized by all of the interviews and discussions.

694
00:38:56,475 --> 00:39:03,858
And then in the very last minutes of the very last interview with the head of the company at 6 at 6 p.m

695
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:07,859
He asked me what my salary expectations were

696
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,760
I said I didn't know what the cost of living was in that country

697
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,062
But I was more than happy to offer my last two salaries for reference

698
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:22,324
Yeah, a few days later. I got a very lovely email saying that there was no way they could afford me

699
00:39:22,324 --> 00:39:24,825
But if anything changed to please let them know

700
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,261
I'm actually really glad that I had that experience.

701
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:31,903
I keep in touch with a lot of the people that I met on that interview,

702
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,743
and it was a really lovely trip.

703
00:39:33,743 --> 00:39:37,365
But if either of us had brought up salary earlier in the process,

704
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:40,846
it would have saved them some money and me some jet lag.

705
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,753
If you know that you have particular needs or expectations,

706
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:48,575
it's worth figuring out a way to bring those things up

707
00:39:48,575 --> 00:39:51,638
politely and casually early in the process

708
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:54,139
in order to make sure that you're on the same page.

709
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:56,321
Otherwise, you could end up on a really long,

710
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:58,642
awkward first date, I mean interview,

711
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:03,226
without a way to make an excuse and leave.

712
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:05,767
In conclusion, it's worth remembering

713
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,609
that all of the advice about acting like

714
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:08,910
you're on the same team

715
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:14,614
works because at the end of the day, you really are all on the same team.

716
00:40:14,614 --> 00:40:20,118
No one wants a new employee who feels resentful or cheated or insulted by the hiring process.

717
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:25,762
But there can be a lot of external circumstances and constraints that can make it feel otherwise.

718
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:31,666
The only thing that can fight the stress of salary negotiations on both sides is transparency.

719
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:31,926
Thank you.

720
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:42,426
Just one quick note.

721
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:45,669
So we have actually put up a website, fragupayme.com.

722
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:48,972
There are not a huge amount of resources up there right now,

723
00:40:48,972 --> 00:40:50,654
and kind of a call to action for all of you

724
00:40:50,654 --> 00:40:53,776
is if you find some that you really, really like,

725
00:40:53,776 --> 00:40:54,637
please send them to me on Twitter

726
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:56,039
and I will add them to that page.

727
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,421
This is also all three of us on Twitter,

728
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,583
so we're gonna open up for Q&A.

729
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,967
Please wait for a mic to come to you, and yeah.

730
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:33,344
Hi, so I am currently about six months into my first major job in the industry.

731
00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:36,206
And at some point in time, I'm hoping to.

732
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:41,378
talk about promotions or salary raises, things like that.

733
00:41:41,378 --> 00:41:44,080
How do some of the things all three of you were discussing

734
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,922
apply when you are at a company and happy there,

735
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,803
but maybe approaching your one year

736
00:41:50,803 --> 00:41:52,484
or working on your second project with them?

737
00:41:53,152 --> 00:41:53,792
Thank you.

738
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:57,217
The number one piece of advice I would give you

739
00:41:57,217 --> 00:42:01,463
is every time that you do something that tangibly helps

740
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:05,309
the company, or every time that you get an email saying, hey,

741
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:07,692
great work on this project, save it.

742
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,974
Put it in a Google document.

743
00:42:09,553 --> 00:42:14,537
And that way, the big question that I would have if you came to me and you were like,

744
00:42:14,537 --> 00:42:19,342
I think it's time for me to get a raise, I would 100% be in your boat.

745
00:42:19,342 --> 00:42:23,745
But I would need things that I could bring to my boss to say, look, we really need to

746
00:42:23,745 --> 00:42:26,868
we really need to make this guy's pay a little bit better.

747
00:42:26,868 --> 00:42:29,150
Here's all of the great stuff that he's done for us this year.

748
00:42:30,357 --> 00:42:33,578
I'd also make sure that you have a good relationship with your manager ongoing, right?

749
00:42:33,578 --> 00:42:38,439
So make sure that you and your manager are on the same page about what it takes for you to get a promotion, right?

750
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:41,640
So what are the things you need to show? What are the metrics you need to increase?

751
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,062
What are the ways in which you're going to prove to your manager that you're actually meeting what their expectations for promotion are?

752
00:42:47,062 --> 00:42:55,225
And then once you get around that time, I'd use a lot of these same strategies about like doing some market research, putting a case together, and then making a proposal like, hey, like,

753
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:58,790
here I'm like I know we're talking about my promotion we're about to kind of come

754
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:02,195
up on it I want to get a sense of like where we are in terms of compensation

755
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:04,699
right and so just kind of open that up and be transparent so that

756
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:07,683
it's very clear that you expect a raise as part of that promotion.

757
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:10,716
Just a special note for folks who work on social media,

758
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:12,337
community management, et cetera.

759
00:43:12,337 --> 00:43:15,678
The second you join a job, put a file somewhere

760
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:17,779
that lists the number of likes, comments,

761
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:20,161
typical engagement rate, all of the channels.

762
00:43:20,161 --> 00:43:23,923
Over time, as you add channels, note when you do that.

763
00:43:23,923 --> 00:43:26,024
Basically, in a year, you want to be able to show

764
00:43:26,024 --> 00:43:27,564
this is exactly what I did.

765
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:28,985
And anybody who works in social media,

766
00:43:28,985 --> 00:43:30,906
you know that numbers aren't everything,

767
00:43:30,906 --> 00:43:32,987
but they are a really solid indicator

768
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:34,328
for these conversations.

769
00:43:37,307 --> 00:43:41,970
Hi, a lot of this was framed around negotiating after you get an offer.

770
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:47,053
But unfortunately, in my experience, salary usually comes up way sooner.

771
00:43:47,053 --> 00:43:49,774
I've often been asked about salary before I even know

772
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:52,656
what the requirements of the job are, the responsibilities.

773
00:43:52,656 --> 00:43:53,556
I've been asked on web forums.

774
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:57,839
Do you have any good tips on deflecting that until the time is right

775
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,381
to actually negotiate, especially with someone who actually has power?

776
00:44:01,381 --> 00:44:04,343
Just just like ninjitsu it back at them, right?

777
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:06,964
The thing that all.

778
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:13,822
that all job ads say is salary commensurate with experience, right?

779
00:44:13,822 --> 00:44:19,404
So if you have to fill out one of those forms, just put in TBD, or if you're in a conversation,

780
00:44:19,404 --> 00:44:24,066
say, you know, that's a really interesting question. For me, it really depends on the

781
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:28,528
whole package, but this is a really great time to dig into a little bit more of the

782
00:44:28,528 --> 00:44:33,330
responsibilities of this role and what your benefits package is like. Or just say, you know,

783
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,152
that's a really good question. What is the salary band that you're offering?

784
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,141
Yeah, go check out that article by Tara Wheeler.

785
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:42,123
She's got scripts for exactly that question.

786
00:44:42,123 --> 00:44:47,526
I have used them successfully over and over again to get them to go first.

787
00:44:47,526 --> 00:44:50,468
And they have always named a number higher than I would have.

788
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:58,352
I I have a friend and she's in a she's in a complicated situation.

789
00:44:59,258 --> 00:45:06,225
She knows that when you first get a job, that's when you have the most leverage because they don't have any information from you and

790
00:45:06,225 --> 00:45:09,569
you haven't said yes, so they want to hire you and retain you.

791
00:45:09,569 --> 00:45:14,133
But the challenge is is that she is an assistant art director and

792
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:16,435
the art director who is in charge of her is

793
00:45:17,037 --> 00:45:23,904
left the company. And so now her title has changed, but they haven't had any talks about

794
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:30,290
how her pay will change. And now she believes that she's getting severely underpaid. Perhaps

795
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:35,896
that person got double what she is currently making. And it's also a complicated situation

796
00:45:35,896 --> 00:45:41,802
because when she first joined, she was the only woman in her entire department.

797
00:45:42,195 --> 00:45:44,336
And even now, there aren't that many women.

798
00:45:44,336 --> 00:45:48,479
And so she's struggling to figure out how she can negotiate and advocate

799
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:52,122
for herself, even though she's already at the company and is very thankful

800
00:45:52,122 --> 00:45:57,446
for the job while navigating the interesting perception of women

801
00:45:57,446 --> 00:45:58,687
negotiating versus men.

802
00:45:59,602 --> 00:46:03,686
So I would give your friend basically three pieces of advice.

803
00:46:03,686 --> 00:46:09,631
The first one, to network and make friends with other art directors at other companies

804
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:11,773
in the same city.

805
00:46:11,773 --> 00:46:14,456
Get them to tell her what their salaries are.

806
00:46:14,716 --> 00:46:21,640
The second thing is after about six months is a really great time to say, you know, I've really proven myself in this role.

807
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,462
I think it's time to talk about are you rehiring for this role?

808
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:30,365
Was this an interim thing or am I being promoted to this role? In which case I've done my research

809
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:35,969
and this is the general salary it seems like is normal for this role in the in the city.

810
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:38,650
What do you think? Is my research correct on this?

811
00:46:39,617 --> 00:46:44,658
One particular thing I'd add there, especially for any time when you are kind of at a company and it's not clear,

812
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:47,539
it's a promotion, it's that you're taking over another responsibility,

813
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:52,300
make sure that you don't hinge your salary negotiation on a percentage based on your existing one.

814
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,141
Because if you're taking a new role, new responsibility, it's not based on, oh, you know, we, every promotion is 10% or

815
00:46:57,141 --> 00:47:01,482
whatever it might be. Make sure you start over, reset the expectation based on market value.

816
00:47:01,482 --> 00:47:08,604
I would also say just briefly, your friend should set some time frame in her mind, at which point this is no longer

817
00:47:08,604 --> 00:47:09,384
acceptable.

818
00:47:10,052 --> 00:47:16,903
and be looking for other roles because I almost guarantee she will find more money outside of the company.

819
00:47:16,903 --> 00:47:20,850
Unfortunately, that's my experience.

820
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:36,717
During the negotiation process from an HMR perspective, are there any

821
00:47:36,717 --> 00:47:43,161
questions that are basically red flags and or vice versa? Are there any

822
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:48,603
questions where you're like, oh wow, this person, that's a very good question, we

823
00:47:48,603 --> 00:47:55,047
really want them? I don't have any specific questions, but I will say when

824
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:56,648
it's clear that somebody has done...

825
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,631
zero investigation.

826
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:01,814
So I've had candidates, especially abroad,

827
00:48:01,814 --> 00:48:06,838
that did zero investigation into local cost of living.

828
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:09,420
And literally were asking for more money

829
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,462
than directors at the company made.

830
00:48:11,462 --> 00:48:14,104
You know, it's a really hard place to start.

831
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:16,846
One thing that actually the three of us

832
00:48:16,846 --> 00:48:19,048
were talking about before the panel started

833
00:48:19,048 --> 00:48:22,111
is especially because there are so many people here

834
00:48:22,111 --> 00:48:23,993
that are sort of looking for their first role

835
00:48:23,993 --> 00:48:24,973
in the game industry.

836
00:48:26,444 --> 00:48:33,531
A lot of times people will go in and they'll read very generic salary negotiation tactics online

837
00:48:33,531 --> 00:48:38,056
that are actually much more sort of tailored to people who are in the middle of their career.

838
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:41,058
So if somebody was coming, for example, right out of school...

839
00:48:41,596 --> 00:48:46,538
and decided to ask for a whole bunch more than what we offered them.

840
00:48:46,538 --> 00:48:48,818
And my first question would be why.

841
00:48:48,818 --> 00:48:50,599
And there could be a very good reason for that.

842
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:56,661
Maybe they have experience that would actually make them really valuable.

843
00:48:56,661 --> 00:48:58,441
But oftentimes the response is,

844
00:48:58,441 --> 00:49:03,283
well, you know, for my unique skills and my unique experience.

845
00:49:04,497 --> 00:49:07,419
to which I would say, okay, what are those?

846
00:49:07,419 --> 00:49:09,300
Especially if you just came from school,

847
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,701
unless you've done some really special,

848
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:14,023
really unique things while you were there,

849
00:49:14,023 --> 00:49:18,626
you don't necessarily have unique skills or experience yet.

850
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:23,229
So part of it is knowing that you are making an argument

851
00:49:23,229 --> 00:49:25,530
to hire you specifically,

852
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,511
and you should have really concrete examples

853
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:30,793
of why you specifically are worth what you're asking for.

854
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:37,364
I think specifically for kind of early career folks, something that I always find really

855
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:41,327
powerful is acknowledgement and confidence in the skills that you're bringing, but also

856
00:49:41,327 --> 00:49:44,149
really open mind to what you could be learning there, right?

857
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:46,951
So saying things like, oh, you know, I'm excited to bring my skills here.

858
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:50,154
And I'm really excited to learn from this team that has worked on this game or on this

859
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,154
product for a while.

860
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:55,358
That open mindedness and that ability to learn is something that I know we screened for a

861
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:56,999
lot in our early candidates.

862
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,121
Hi. For those of us who are not as early in our careers,

863
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:10,602
if you're in a very niche discipline, which I am, I'm in narrative design.

864
00:50:10,602 --> 00:50:14,443
And especially as you go up the ranks, I've been in the industry for like 13 years

865
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:17,184
now, and there's not that much information out there,

866
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:20,325
especially when you like know your market worth.

867
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:24,866
There's very, very little data that I can find from Glassdoor or whatever.

868
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:29,588
What kind of resources can you recommend for that sort of very niche?

869
00:50:30,218 --> 00:50:31,699
It's all about networking.

870
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:34,561
You got to know the people in your industry and you got to be

871
00:50:34,561 --> 00:50:37,143
willing to get intimate with them to be able to share your

872
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:38,363
salaries, which is scary, right?

873
00:50:38,363 --> 00:50:41,285
I think that's, I'm the, I'm the emotions person.

874
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:44,067
It's very scary because if you ask your friend who's also

875
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:46,488
working in narrative what your salary is, what you might hear

876
00:50:46,488 --> 00:50:48,429
is that it's a salary that's much higher than yours, right?

877
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:50,410
So that opens you up to a lot of vulnerability.

878
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,212
But I think that is the way forward, especially in those

879
00:50:52,212 --> 00:50:53,152
niche industries.

880
00:50:53,152 --> 00:50:56,154
It's like you need that you can get this information from peers

881
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:57,375
around you too.

882
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,431
And one of the great things specifically for narrative,

883
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:06,673
it's sort of like art this way, is that you have an incredibly unique portfolio.

884
00:51:06,673 --> 00:51:15,177
You have something that nobody else has that's applying for that job, which is your body of work.

885
00:51:15,177 --> 00:51:18,819
So it's especially with 13 years in the career, in your career,

886
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:22,400
you should go into that being like, you know who I am.

887
00:51:23,088 --> 00:51:28,031
And if they're like, well, why are you worth so much more than we were going to offer you?

888
00:51:28,031 --> 00:51:33,394
You should feel comfortable saying, well, did you read my samples?

889
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:37,117
Like, own your career. The fact that you have that kind of longevity

890
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:47,363
is something really unique and special, and that makes you more marketable.

891
00:51:47,363 --> 00:51:50,245
What would be your advice to someone who is...

892
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:55,773
a number of transferable skills who wants to move into the field.

893
00:51:55,773 --> 00:52:00,996
In some ways you have a lot of skills but you don't have the skills in this specific field.

894
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:04,317
So I would think that some sort of mentoring or something to catch up, right?

895
00:52:04,317 --> 00:52:07,358
What's your advice on how I approach that?

896
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:12,718
I think you kind of answered it for yourself a little bit there is getting those mentors,

897
00:52:12,718 --> 00:52:18,163
finding, you know, one or two individuals who are doing the thing that you want to do

898
00:52:18,163 --> 00:52:24,088
that will help coach you, you know, and mentorship is not this strict program where you, you know,

899
00:52:24,088 --> 00:52:27,631
have to have this meeting and then this meeting, this meeting, then it's done.

900
00:52:27,631 --> 00:52:31,674
A mentorship is like any other relationship. They may not have all of the answers,

901
00:52:31,674 --> 00:52:36,078
which is why it's good to have a couple people with their perspectives that can help coach you.

902
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,241
Yeah, but as long as you're outside of the field,

903
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:40,162
how do you get that mentor?

904
00:52:40,162 --> 00:52:44,423
So this is a question near to my heart,

905
00:52:44,423 --> 00:52:50,006
because I was actually 29 when I got into the game industry.

906
00:52:50,006 --> 00:52:53,807
My only previous non-freelance experience

907
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:58,669
was working at the Sears Portrait Studio for $7.95 an hour

908
00:52:58,669 --> 00:53:01,610
before I got my first salaried position in the game industry.

909
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,311
And I met my mentor on Twitter.

910
00:53:04,486 --> 00:53:07,788
really a mentor when you boil everything else down,

911
00:53:07,788 --> 00:53:09,889
is somebody who's interested in what you have to offer

912
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:10,950
and who believes in you.

913
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:13,552
So strike up conversations with people

914
00:53:13,552 --> 00:53:15,753
who are sort of in that sweet spot,

915
00:53:15,753 --> 00:53:20,857
in that area of the industry that you would like to go in.

916
00:53:20,857 --> 00:53:22,778
I've even helped out an artist

917
00:53:22,778 --> 00:53:26,821
who was looking to transfer out of medicine

918
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:30,063
just because she cold emailed

919
00:53:30,063 --> 00:53:31,744
a bunch of women in the industry

920
00:53:31,744 --> 00:53:33,525
and I was the only one who responded.

921
00:53:34,306 --> 00:53:39,749
A mentor doesn't even necessarily have to be somebody who is in your exact discipline.

922
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:48,773
It's really just somebody who wants to help you succeed and is willing to put in a little bit of time to ensure that you do.

923
00:53:48,773 --> 00:53:48,993
Hi.

924
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:55,397
When it comes to going from one job to another and obviously you're hoping your new job pays better than your previous one,

925
00:53:55,397 --> 00:54:00,159
if the company that you're interviewing with is aware of your salary history,

926
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:02,300
and you're also aware that your current salary is

927
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:04,975
on the low end of their salary band.

928
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,637
How far is too far or what's your limit

929
00:54:06,637 --> 00:54:08,538
when it comes to your salary requirements

930
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:10,060
trying to get to the higher end of their salary?

931
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:14,348
So obviously the first tactic is to try not to let the new company know about your new salary ban.

932
00:54:14,348 --> 00:54:14,909
So that's tactic one.

933
00:54:14,909 --> 00:54:18,670
But if they do know, I would try to reframe the conversation the same way that you would

934
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,711
if you were taking a different job at the same company.

935
00:54:20,711 --> 00:54:25,873
It's like, yes, this is, acknowledge what I'm currently making, the current salary ban.

936
00:54:25,873 --> 00:54:28,333
I'd like to talk about the responsibilities for this job,

937
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,934
this new job that I'm applying for and getting an offer for, right?

938
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,775
Just be like, just reframe, be like, I know I was doing this thing over here

939
00:54:33,775 --> 00:54:34,856
and I was making this money.

940
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:37,477
I'm doing this new thing now and here are my expectations.

941
00:54:37,477 --> 00:54:38,737
Let's start from scratch, right?

942
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:40,378
Let's start from market value discussion.

943
00:54:41,247 --> 00:54:45,872
I think Tara would probably agree with me from the hiring manager standpoint in that

944
00:54:45,872 --> 00:54:48,956
I've never chosen a candidate because they were the cheapest.

945
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:54,683
It's never like, oh, and we're going to get this guy for a steal, you know?

946
00:54:54,683 --> 00:54:57,006
So if people already want you.

947
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:02,124
they're open to whatever they were, whatever number they originally had in their head.

948
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:07,529
And so if you get to the offer standpoint, and they try to offer you something closer to what

949
00:55:07,529 --> 00:55:11,833
your salary was, you can just level with them and be like, you know, I felt like I was really

950
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:16,557
underpaid at my last job. And one of the reasons that I'm looking now is because I really hope to

951
00:55:16,557 --> 00:55:22,342
end up someplace that values me. And so this is a chance for us to figure out if if this is the

952
00:55:22,342 --> 00:55:24,604
place for me, because I really do want to feel valued.

953
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:31,033
That's a specific thing I want to point out is that you definitely don't want to get into a situation where you're saying is I want to be paid more.

954
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:35,175
What you need to say is I want to work at a place that acknowledges the value that I'm bringing.

955
00:55:35,175 --> 00:55:49,502
And I'll say kind of Elizabeth, oh my God, to Elizabeth's point, sometimes I, as the hiring manager, was literally sitting there going, oh, why did you not ask for more?

956
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:53,026
And this like this is intimidating as hell.

957
00:55:53,026 --> 00:55:54,848
So I understand why people don't want to do it.

958
00:55:54,848 --> 00:55:58,670
But if you can have that as a conversation one on one

959
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:02,233
with the hiring manager as a conversation,

960
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:04,615
they will have a little more wiggle room.

961
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:09,138
So I had a situation where somebody asked for 2000 more.

962
00:56:09,138 --> 00:56:13,481
I easily would have given them more if we'd had it as a conversation.

963
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:17,144
But with HRCC in that conversation,

964
00:56:17,144 --> 00:56:19,546
I am now limited to what I can do.

965
00:56:20,259 --> 00:56:28,926
I managed to bump it just a little bit to round it to an even number, but I couldn't, you know, have that conversation like

966
00:56:28,926 --> 00:56:29,806
You know, thank you

967
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:49,723
This is the last question, but we'll probably stick around for a couple minutes if you have additional so now some pressure for me

968
00:56:50,193 --> 00:56:53,996
Which is the value of the fancy titles, right?

969
00:56:53,996 --> 00:56:57,358
Because some position, I'm in the field of game design,

970
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:00,601
and then at some point you start like,

971
00:57:00,601 --> 00:57:01,942
but then you're like product manager,

972
00:57:01,942 --> 00:57:06,005
and there's like game leads, head of product,

973
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:09,648
head of design, director of design, creative director,

974
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:14,252
and it's difficult to map from one company to the other.

975
00:57:14,252 --> 00:57:17,274
Maybe some guy is head of design, but...

976
00:57:17,655 --> 00:57:22,140
has less responsibilities than a senior game designer in another company.

977
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:28,709
So I find it very difficult to understand which is the value of that and also in wondering

978
00:57:28,709 --> 00:57:31,011
which is the value for the hiring manager.

979
00:57:32,207 --> 00:57:34,289
You got to look at the responsibilities they list out.

980
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:35,890
And as part of your job interview process,

981
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,751
ask them specifically, OK, I'm going

982
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:38,852
to be responsible for this.

983
00:57:38,852 --> 00:57:39,993
OK, I'm going to lead this team.

984
00:57:39,993 --> 00:57:41,434
I'm going to manage these people.

985
00:57:41,434 --> 00:57:43,696
And then when you bring in the data that you're looking at,

986
00:57:43,696 --> 00:57:46,618
you'll be like, OK, this studio lead here

987
00:57:46,618 --> 00:57:48,439
is kind of like a creative director here,

988
00:57:48,439 --> 00:57:50,281
but they have the similar responsibilities,

989
00:57:50,281 --> 00:57:52,502
and therefore, you can look at that information.

990
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,944
Yeah, I once took a $40,000 pay cut

991
00:57:54,944 --> 00:57:56,625
to go from a senior game designer

992
00:57:56,625 --> 00:58:01,629
to a senior game design strategist.

993
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:05,225
I think, yeah, it's the fanciest title I've ever had.

994
00:58:05,225 --> 00:58:07,546
Was not worth the pay cut.

995
00:58:07,546 --> 00:58:09,407
But honestly, you've got to think about titles

996
00:58:09,407 --> 00:58:12,529
like when you're as a hiring manager,

997
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:13,809
they're like clickbait titles.

998
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:14,830
Like they really are.

999
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,050
It's something that makes me go, ooh,

1000
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:18,871
this person was head of production at a Google studio?

1001
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:19,672
You know what I mean?

1002
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:27,025
But ultimately what we actually give a shit about is everything you list under that is your responsibilities

1003
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:29,025
I got so much more

1004
00:58:29,025 --> 00:58:30,206
traction from

1005
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:39,548
Responsibilities where I was listed as a senior game designer than I ever got from the responsibilities listed when I was a senior game design strategist

1006
00:58:39,548 --> 00:58:39,648
so

1007
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:47,823
don't so you can get kind of screwed over if the work that you're doing is so far beyond what your

1008
00:58:47,823 --> 00:58:58,149
actual title is but anyone who actually reads your resume is not going to care about the title itself

1009
00:58:58,149 --> 00:59:00,570
good thank you all thank you so much
