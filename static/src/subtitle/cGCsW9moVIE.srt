00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:11,431
Hi, thanks so much for joining us this evening for GDC Summer.

2
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:12,671
My name is Emma Kidwell.

3
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,312
I'm a freelance narrative designer,

4
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:17,034
and I'll be moderating this session on behalf of Susan.

5
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:20,476
You can ask questions in the chat box next to the session

6
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:22,617
video, and I'll get to as many of them

7
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:23,938
as I can at the very end.

8
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:26,719
Before we kick things off, I ask that everyone

9
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:29,261
is respectful and mindful of our code of conduct

10
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,242
when participating in the discussion.

11
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:33,583
And with that, I'm going to hand it off to Susan.

12
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:35,164
Awesome.

13
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,247
Thank you, Emma. Hi, everybody.

14
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:39,828
Hello, invisible people. What's happening?

15
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:43,229
So I'm really excited to be speaking at GDC this year,

16
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,590
and I just want to get right into it

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,491
because I want to save a lot of time for Q&A.

18
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:50,472
So as you're listening, please keep in mind anything

19
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:52,373
that comes to mind you'd like to talk about at the end.

20
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,814
We'll try to get to as many questions as we can.

21
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,491
Okay, so my name is Susan O'Connor,

22
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:00,573
and for years I was a game writer,

23
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:02,174
and now I'm a story consultant.

24
00:01:02,254 --> 00:01:05,375
My job is to help writers and the teams they work with.

25
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:07,337
I have been at this for a while.

26
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:10,759
I've worked on, I stopped counting after 25 games,

27
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:13,500
mostly AAA, but some indie as well.

28
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:17,163
Way back in the day, I founded the Game Narrative Summit,

29
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,583
actually, here at GDC,

30
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:21,745
because I really wanted writers to have a chance to get together.

31
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,306
So I'm really proud of that.

32
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:28,670
and I also, in addition to working with studios and helping them with their stories, I also teach

33
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,792
a course in game writing over at UT here in Austin where I am where I'm at right now.

34
00:01:34,613 --> 00:01:38,576
So what are we going to learn today? So a couple of things we're going to be talking through today.

35
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:43,859
We're going to be talking about why understanding the medium and what's really special about games

36
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:49,022
helps you know what kinds of stories to tell. I'm going to talk about why a dance class will

37
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:50,123
make you better at your job.

38
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:51,454
I'm serious.

39
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,035
And I'm also going to share a couple of, like,

40
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:57,257
three really specific practical strategies

41
00:01:57,277 --> 00:02:00,298
that you can use to be more effective with your designer

42
00:02:00,398 --> 00:02:02,559
if you're a writer or more effective with your writer

43
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,199
if you're a designer.

44
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,020
And if you are both, you're going

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,220
to get along with yourself a lot better.

46
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,180
So here we go.

47
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:11,102
OK, so let's start by talking about what are games.

48
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:14,723
So every storytelling medium,

49
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,584
and games are a storytelling medium,

50
00:02:17,864 --> 00:02:19,105
like theater, like TV,

51
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:21,686
every storytelling medium kind of lends itself

52
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:22,906
to certain kinds of stories.

53
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:24,467
So for example, books.

54
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:28,728
Books are great at showing us the inner life of a character.

55
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:31,829
We can go in chapter four inside the head of a character

56
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:33,750
and listen to their thoughts for five chapters,

57
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,230
and we don't get tired of it.

58
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,831
It just is a natural expression

59
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:39,732
that books really lend themselves to.

60
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,853
So interior lives are in books.

61
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,194
Movies are really great for visual storytelling.

62
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:50,236
Big explosions, gorgeous actors, visuals,

63
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:52,236
pictures really do the job in movies.

64
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:55,217
TV is less about pictures.

65
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:58,318
TV really is a great place where if you are a writer

66
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,359
who is really good at creating relationships

67
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,280
between characters and then expressing those relationships

68
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,021
through dialogue.

69
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:08,002
So knowing what different mediums are good at

70
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:10,423
helps you know where you can do your best work.

71
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:15,009
So games have kind of their own thing, right?

72
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:19,212
And what makes games special as a storytelling medium

73
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:20,113
is really two things.

74
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:23,376
One, they allow us to create stories

75
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,577
that players can live in.

76
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:27,540
And for those of you that recognize this picture, yay,

77
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,962
this is Point Break Live,

78
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:32,224
which is a theatrical production

79
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:35,246
that someone took the Keanu Reeves movie, Point Break,

80
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:40,870
turned it into a play, hired trained actors, they perform every night, but right before they go on,

81
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,074
they take a volunteer from the audience, just some random person, and bring them up on stage,

82
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:50,417
and that person plays the Keanu Reeves role. Totally unprepared, doesn't know the lines,

83
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:54,780
has to just kind of figure it out as they go along. That is game writing in a nutshell.

84
00:03:55,781 --> 00:04:00,284
So it's something really challenging about storytelling in games, and it's also something

85
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:04,947
that's really special. So games let us live stories, and

86
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:08,139
Stories bring meaning to gameplay.

87
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:11,625
It makes what we're doing in a game matter when it's working.

88
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:14,811
So stories have a really special power in games.

89
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:17,596
And obviously, I'm a writer, so I'm biased,

90
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:18,818
but I think they're worth the effort.

91
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:22,741
You know, we have tools that other writers do not.

92
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,104
I mean, one of the strongest tools as writers

93
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:26,525
that we have is the gameplay.

94
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,808
Sometimes we think of it as getting in the way,

95
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:31,571
but it's actually like one of the most powerful tools

96
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:34,034
that we can use to make an emotional connection

97
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,236
with our players.

98
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:40,780
And the flip side is, to my designers out there, that story is one of your tools as well.

99
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,863
We don't always think of it this way. Sometimes designers think, oh, story's in my way,

100
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:49,826
and writers think, oh, gameplay's messing up my story. But in fact, they're actually really

101
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:54,529
powerful tools. The trick is we have to learn how to use them well. And that's what we're

102
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:56,510
going to talk about today. So

103
00:04:58,037 --> 00:05:00,298
If we're going to get these two peanut butter and chocolate

104
00:05:00,318 --> 00:05:01,919
together, then the writers and the designers

105
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,739
have to work together.

106
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,040
Duh, right?

107
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,721
And for people who are outside the industry,

108
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,682
they'll often think, well, it must

109
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:10,662
be pretty easy because you have a lot in common.

110
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:14,564
Writers and designers spend all day problem solving.

111
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,685
Writers and designers are both really

112
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:19,866
interested in things like setups and payoffs.

113
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,408
And both writers and designers really

114
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:25,308
want to create an awesome experience for the player.

115
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:26,929
So what's the problem?

116
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:30,685
Well, we'll talk about that in a second.

117
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,546
But I wanted to first share this awesome quote

118
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,328
from Jesse Schell, who is one of my favorite people.

119
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,088
He's amazing.

120
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:39,090
And he talks about this idea that it's really, for designers,

121
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,672
he argues, it's really not about the game.

122
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:45,194
It's about the experience the player has playing the game.

123
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:47,635
And you really could replace games

124
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:50,937
with stories and designers with writers in this.

125
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:52,758
And the same sentiment would apply.

126
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,614
So we have a ton in common.

127
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:56,835
So what's the problem?

128
00:05:57,516 --> 00:05:59,117
Well, let's talk about it.

129
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:02,920
So yes, we are all writers and designers

130
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,321
are both solving problems,

131
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,443
but we're solving very different problems.

132
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:09,025
Writers are sitting there thinking about dialogue

133
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,027
and character and relationship and structure.

134
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:15,431
And designers are thinking about things like this, right?

135
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,154
Both important problems to solve, both kind of unrelated.

136
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:21,774
Something else that gets in the way,

137
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,737
we've got the setup and payoff idea, right?

138
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:26,758
Which is true, both designers and writers

139
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:27,599
are thinking about it,

140
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:32,423
but writers tend to think of it in traditional story terms,

141
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:33,624
which is beginning, middle, end.

142
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:37,147
And that's because human beings are hardwired for story

143
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:38,388
to think of story in that way.

144
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:41,610
So writers are thinking in a linear fashion often,

145
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:44,733
whereas game designers are thinking in terms of maps

146
00:06:45,273 --> 00:06:47,055
and of spaces, right?

147
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:48,976
Story is linear, game is spatial.

148
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:52,920
And then as far as creating a great experience for the player,

149
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,441
this is the real zinger, I think.

150
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,623
I think when we, if you asked a writer, like,

151
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,025
what would be the ideal experience

152
00:06:58,045 --> 00:06:59,106
you could deliver to somebody?

153
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:01,488
They're going to talk about something like moving you

154
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:03,290
the way Shakespeare moves audiences.

155
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:05,192
And if you ask a designer, like,

156
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:07,475
what's the ideal gameplay experience?

157
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:09,236
They're going to talk about something elegant

158
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:10,778
and perfect, like Tetris.

159
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:16,431
So we're both are looking at different North Stars in the sky, right?

160
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:20,493
And so like the big question is, how do we get these things to actually start working together?

161
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:24,054
Because if we don't try to make them work, they're not going to work.

162
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:32,731
And I really think that the challenge in the working relationship is the perfect metaphor for it is the idea of silent disco.

163
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:41,696
So if anyone's ever been to one, it's where you like hang out with your headphones and you dance and everyone else is maybe dancing to the same music, but you're really kind of doing it on your own.

164
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:47,218
This is a lot of times how writers and designers end up working together.

165
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,591
Like they're in the same room and they're,

166
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:52,312
we think they're kind of thinking the same things

167
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:53,853
or kind of listening to the same music

168
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:54,834
as they create their stuff,

169
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:56,775
but they're not even looking at each other.

170
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:58,296
They're kind of doing what they want to do.

171
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:00,157
They're both expressing themselves.

172
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:02,618
One is expressing through gameplay and one through story,

173
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:05,299
but they're not really communicating with each other.

174
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,380
Right?

175
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,342
And part of the reason this happens in studios, I think,

176
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:10,842
is because both people are really busy.

177
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:11,803
They have to do their jobs

178
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:13,284
and it feels like it's going to be easier

179
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:15,245
if they just do it side by side,

180
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:17,026
but don't get in each other's way very much.

181
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:22,152
But the problem is that doesn't lead to awesome creative breakthroughs and

182
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:25,435
awesome innovations that bring story and gameplay together in new ways.

183
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:31,261
So I want to argue that instead of being at the silent disco,

184
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,123
we need to start thinking about partner dancing.

185
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:37,903
Specifically, honestly, the tango is like the best metaphor I can think of,

186
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:40,724
because the tango is an improvised dance.

187
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:44,185
And while the man technically is leading,

188
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:48,286
the dancers are really paying attention to each other and following each other's

189
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:51,187
cues. That's why when you watch people dance the tango,

190
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:53,747
the expressions on their faces are very intense.

191
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,808
And it's because they are putting all their energy on their partner.

192
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,432
to try to figure out what wants to happen next.

193
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:01,594
It's not about the woman or the man.

194
00:09:01,794 --> 00:09:03,756
It's about the dance that happens between them.

195
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:09,182
And that, to me, is the ideal that we all should be shooting for

196
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:12,585
in terms of bringing story and gameplay together in games.

197
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,127
So no silent disco.

198
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,089
Yes, Tango. How do we do it?

199
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,491
Let's talk about it.

200
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:22,885
So this is the very practical part of our talk today.

201
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:26,968
And like I said, I'm going quick because I want to have a lot of questions and answers.

202
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:30,750
You know, it's not about what I say, it's about what you hear.

203
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,491
So I'm here to help.

204
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:35,653
So let me try to unpack three strategies that I've been able to use at studios

205
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:37,935
that have really worked, that hopefully will help you as well.

206
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,756
Again, whether you're a designer or a writer, it'll work.

207
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:45,261
So the first thing I think is worth thinking about

208
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,203
is making sure that the story in your game

209
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:51,305
is really built around the way the player is

210
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,065
going to win the game.

211
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:53,586
And here's why.

212
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:58,810
Because the players, in a way, really

213
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,911
are the most important characters in your story.

214
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:02,932
They're not there, right?

215
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:03,753
They're on the couch.

216
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:07,035
But their opinions matter.

217
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:08,436
If they aren't engaged, they're not

218
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:10,877
going to continue to play the game slash play the story.

219
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,967
So we've got to factor them in.

220
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:15,228
What they want matters.

221
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:16,909
Their motivation really matters.

222
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,971
And a lot of times, players are not motivated,

223
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:22,072
especially early in the game, they're

224
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:23,312
not motivated by the story.

225
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:26,494
Players are usually motivated by the game,

226
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:27,975
meaning I want to win the game.

227
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:28,895
I want to beat the game.

228
00:10:28,955 --> 00:10:29,956
I want to finish the game.

229
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:35,478
For a lot of players, story is a game progression tool.

230
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:39,515
They'll go along with the story so that they can continue to play.

231
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:41,176
They'll say like, oh, do I have to save the princess?

232
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:42,216
Okay, that's cool.

233
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:42,916
Right.

234
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:43,796
And then off they go.

235
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:46,057
And then if halfway through the, like, no, you have to kill the princess.

236
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:47,757
They're like, oh, okay.

237
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:48,297
That's weird.

238
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:49,577
And then they keep playing.

239
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:52,598
Most players are not going to be like, that's ridiculous.

240
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,858
I said, I was going to save the princess.

241
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:54,338
I quit.

242
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:56,359
If they're into the game, they'll keep going.

243
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:00,519
So we have to, and this is something that like traditionally, when I worked on

244
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,600
projects, I would be siloed off with the story and I wouldn't know a whole lot

245
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:04,980
about like,

246
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,892
gameplay and player progression.

247
00:11:08,472 --> 00:11:10,194
And I think that was a huge missed opportunity.

248
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:12,696
You want these things to be in sync as much as possible.

249
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,138
So so let's say you want to do that.

250
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:18,921
Let's say you want to make sure that it's like the players win state

251
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:21,723
and the avatars desire line are in sync, right?

252
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:23,965
Like what the player wants, what the avatar wants are the same.

253
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,386
OK, so simple way to do it.

254
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:30,882
If you're the writer, go to the designer and say,

255
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:33,422
okay, so what are we doing in this game, right?

256
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:35,142
You can say, how do you win the game?

257
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:37,903
Or if it's like a really big, ginormous,

258
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:40,083
open world RPG that goes on for a hundred hours,

259
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,324
what's motivating the player, right?

260
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:44,824
Why, what's keeping them going?

261
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:46,024
What are they engaged with?

262
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:47,665
What are they trying to accomplish or do?

263
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:50,865
And then once you've got that information,

264
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:52,686
you go back to your story ideas

265
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,066
and you look at the player avatar.

266
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,196
and what the player avatar is saying.

267
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:59,617
And then you go, okay, what is that avatar saying

268
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:01,078
that she wants to accomplish or do?

269
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:02,459
What is she striving for?

270
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:05,720
And if it doesn't line up, you change it.

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,321
And I, you know, this one's a funny one

272
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,883
because it seems so simple, like who wouldn't do this?

273
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:14,184
But I have been brought in to consult

274
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:15,744
on multimillion dollar projects.

275
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:17,825
And one of the problems was this one.

276
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:21,287
The play testers were like, I don't understand the story.

277
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:22,227
I'm totally ignoring it.

278
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,868
And we took a look at it and it's like,

279
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:24,128
well,

280
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:27,701
What that avatar wants to do and what the player wants to do

281
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:28,961
have nothing to do with each other.

282
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,202
Of course, they're getting confused.

283
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:33,423
So this is a deceptively simple strategy,

284
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:35,945
meaning it's so simple that it often

285
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:38,806
gets overlooked and forgotten in the chaos of game development.

286
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,047
So simple is good.

287
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:42,928
If you're running into story problems,

288
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:44,289
this is one of the first things you can check.

289
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:56,986
Okay, so that was our first one. Second strategy that I've seen really work on teams is the idea of really embracing the idea of theme, which I know is a little bit English class, but bear with me.

290
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:08,089
So a lot of times in this industry, when we talk about story, we're talking about like plot beats, right? This is going to happen, then that's going to happen. And then that surprise is going to happen.

291
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:11,345
Which is great, except that a lot of times it ends up,

292
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:13,206
remember our silent disco?

293
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:16,588
It ends up going into a non-playable cut scene, right?

294
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:19,170
When we have cut scene gameplay, cut scene gameplay,

295
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,650
silent disco.

296
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:24,272
And that creates a big divide, right?

297
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:25,653
Between the designer and the writer

298
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:27,394
and between the gameplay and the story.

299
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:31,840
But if you talk about story in a different kind of way,

300
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,641
if you kind of get above the like day-to-day plot points,

301
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:38,741
and you get up into the 30,000 feet level of theme,

302
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:41,862
now both the writers and the designers

303
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,682
can rally around a shared idea

304
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:47,863
and bring it to life using their specific tool set, right?

305
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:49,704
The writers can use plot and character

306
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:51,844
and designers can use systems and mechanics,

307
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:55,145
but they're both driving towards the same goal of theme.

308
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:57,525
So what is theme?

309
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:04,572
So theme, you know, and it's a funny term. I mean, I do this for a living and even I am like,

310
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:09,576
what is theme? What am I talking about? But it's not subject matter, right? We're not talking about

311
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:15,760
like poverty or something like that. We're talking about a point of view on a subject matter.

312
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:20,003
And this is a tricky one to bring up,

313
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:22,083
because most games really don't take a point of view.

314
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:26,125
But think about stories that you've loved in other mediums.

315
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,746
There is a distinct point of view

316
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,447
in the stories they're telling.

317
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,168
And even in games, the games that

318
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:34,809
do take a point of view in their story

319
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,910
are often the games that we remember,

320
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,751
the games that sell really well, and the games that win awards,

321
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:41,732
because they're more interesting.

322
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:43,593
They actually are saying something,

323
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:44,973
but they're not saying it.

324
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:46,634
They're letting you live it out.

325
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:50,596
So, so theme is one of those things it's invisible.

326
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:52,396
It doesn't seem like it's that important,

327
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,857
but when you commit to making it a fundamental part

328
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:56,657
of your work, everything comes to life

329
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:58,157
and everything is elevated.

330
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,138
And your game design and your story are gonna mesh

331
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:03,558
in ways that you probably don't expect.

332
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:05,119
Like this can be the stuff.

333
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,739
This is the stuff that makes it rise.

334
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,080
So let's say you're like, okay, cool.

335
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,420
I wanna use theme in my work.

336
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:11,920
What do I do?

337
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,200
Well,

338
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:20,647
You're going to again every step of this is going to involve starting with the player slash designer. You're welcome designers

339
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:26,494
But it is where it starts right the player drives everything and the and the designer is the advocate for the player in a lot

340
00:15:26,514 --> 00:15:26,794
of ways

341
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:33,040
So think about what the player is doing. Like what are the verbs? What are the actions that we're doing then?

342
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:39,041
think about how that's going to feel, right? Because there's seven billion unique snowflake

343
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:42,985
souls on this planet, but we can take some educated guesses about how people are going

344
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:47,749
to feel when they play this game. You know, if it's a wild shoot-em-up, they're probably going

345
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:53,334
to feel pretty fired up, right? Pretty aggro, safe to say, right? So you can start to guess

346
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:59,860
where they're at emotionally. And then you take a second and you, and this is whether you're a

347
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,721
writer or a designer.

348
00:16:01,784 --> 00:16:05,867
Either one or both can do this and really think about what you care about.

349
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,910
Like what kind of a message would you want to deliver in what you're creating?

350
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,551
And if you're like, I don't know, that's tough.

351
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,533
I guarantee the answer is in the things that you already love.

352
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:19,877
So sit down and look at your five favorite games or your five favorite stories

353
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,380
and just do a little thought exercise and try to figure out

354
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,421
what they all have in common.

355
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,223
And that is something that's really important to you. Guaranteed.

356
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:31,378
So once you've taken a chance to do that,

357
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,279
kind of figure out where the player is at emotionally,

358
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:35,700
figure out where you're at as a person basically,

359
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,101
and then try to figure out how to bring them together.

360
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:41,542
What kind of a point of view could we deliver

361
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:43,142
that the player would be ready to hear,

362
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:44,623
would be in the mood to hear,

363
00:16:44,663 --> 00:16:46,884
would be in the mood to experience in this game?

364
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:49,085
And then...

365
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:53,461
Of course, it has to be a story that's lived, not watched.

366
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:58,424
So the final cherry on top of the sundae is that you find ways to express that theme

367
00:16:58,904 --> 00:17:02,886
through choices that the player makes. And then the choices become meaningful

368
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:06,508
because the story and the game you've created are meaningful,

369
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:08,690
because you've got a point of view behind it.

370
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,277
I hope this part is the most dense part of my presentation.

371
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:15,079
So I know I kind of gave you a whole bunch,

372
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:17,561
but I just wanted you guys to have enough to be able to,

373
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,403
like I said, go back to your studio tomorrow

374
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:20,864
and try some of these ideas out.

375
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:22,605
So I'm happy to talk more about this

376
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:23,546
for anyone that's interested.

377
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:26,749
But we're gonna come up on our third

378
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:28,090
and final strategy right now.

379
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:30,592
Yes, player choice, yay.

380
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:34,356
Okay, third and final one, follow the player's lead.

381
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:36,678
So what do I mean by that?

382
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,252
Well, I want to take another step back,

383
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:40,253
so I think it's going to help us.

384
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:42,795
This is something that I heard in a Jesse Schell

385
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:44,876
talk in 2013 at GDC.

386
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:47,798
And Jesse was quoting a professor at USC

387
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:51,241
who made this awesome prediction, which I've never

388
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:53,102
forgotten, obviously, because here I am talking about it

389
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:53,802
seven years later.

390
00:17:54,403 --> 00:17:54,903
So here it is.

391
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:59,002
He predicted that he took a look at the way film started.

392
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:03,366
And he's like, when film first came around, it was all silent films, black and white.

393
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:06,209
And everyone was like, this is dumb.

394
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:09,011
It's for kids. It's never going to amount to anything.

395
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:14,196
It's a fad. Right. People look down on movies when they were silent films.

396
00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:16,858
But eventually, movies learned how to talk.

397
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,861
and they grew and they evolved and they blossomed and they went on to become

398
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:31,106
the dominant storytelling model for the 20th century. So, okay, if we're going to say,

399
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:34,968
if we're going to argue that games are kind of next in line, if games are going to be the next

400
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:41,132
dominant storytelling tool for this century, well, they already know how to talk. Like,

401
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:43,873
that's not the problem, right? They talk plenty.

402
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:47,509
And Chris Swain says, we're not waiting for games

403
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:48,290
to learn how to talk.

404
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:52,272
We're waiting for games to learn how to listen.

405
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,736
And I don't mean in that creepy Siri Alexa eavesdropping

406
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:01,699
kind of way, but in terms of both game design and story

407
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:05,241
being extremely responsive to the player in the same way

408
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:07,343
that we are responsive to each other in real life.

409
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:10,565
And of course, Telltale has taken

410
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:13,481
or you know, pour one out.

411
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:16,662
Telltale, you know, made some great strides in this, right?

412
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:19,743
Using stuff that's not technically super complicated,

413
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:22,684
you know, putting a Kenny will remember that on the screen

414
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,265
is not like a major heavy lift for the programmers,

415
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:29,206
but it had a huge impact on the players who were like,

416
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:31,286
what, what does that mean?

417
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:32,206
Oh, am I in trouble?

418
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:34,347
Like, what's going to happen next, right?

419
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,028
This was a really simple and powerful example

420
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:39,068
of how listening to the player

421
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:44,447
deepens the experience and transforms it for the people who are playing your game.

422
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:48,612
So let's say you want to make your game a better listener,

423
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:52,958
whether through design or story, how can you do that? Well,

424
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:59,703
You really just look for ways for the story to respond to player behavior, really is all it is, right?

425
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:07,208
So obviously you can do big things like defeating a boss or like little things, like particular dialogue choices.

426
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:14,634
This is not so much like a specific set of tactics, so much as it is about like, I want to put this on your radar, right?

427
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:17,316
I want this to be on your radar, whether you're a designer or a writer.

428
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:23,340
thinking, how can we make this experience be more responsive to the player and brainstorm with each

429
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,003
other and with other people on the team to look for ways to make this happen? Like, that's an

430
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:32,326
interesting problem to solve, and a lot of people on your studio can help to make that happen.

431
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:38,090
It's just going to require a whole lot of talking, right? Not silent disco. Tango.

432
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,713
So, okay, guys, we have reached the end. Like I said,

433
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:46,455
time for Q&A. So what have we learned today?

434
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,191
We talked about the idea that games are uniquely positioned

435
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:56,273
to let us live stories, and also stories can make

436
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:58,053
your gameplay really matter.

437
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,814
And that's a thing that is worth embracing.

438
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:06,356
We talked about Boo Silent Disco, Yay Tango.

439
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,719
And I want to say also, I know that the idea of literally

440
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,139
doing the tango or metaphorically doing the tango

441
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:15,960
can be real anxiety producing.

442
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,720
And I get it.

443
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,120
It requires that you become more vulnerable,

444
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,601
and it requires that you become more reliant on the people

445
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:23,101
on your team.

446
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:27,162
So yes, it is scary, but it's worth it.

447
00:21:27,862 --> 00:21:28,783
It's worth trying.

448
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:31,863
And then we also shared three strategies

449
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:33,844
that you can use at work to bring

450
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:36,865
that story and that gameplay just a little bit closer

451
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:37,165
together.

452
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:41,294
And the three strategies were, just to remind you,

453
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,716
we talked about build a story around the way

454
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:44,857
that the player wins the game.

455
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:50,602
Really embrace theme for all of its 11th grade English class

456
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:51,082
glory.

457
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:56,066
And both design and story should be looking to the player

458
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,467
and following their lead.

459
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:03,005
Okay, so before we get to Q&A, I wanted to share with you guys,

460
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:07,088
one of the best things about being at conferences is that you get a chance to talk to each other

461
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:11,051
in real life, like after the talk, right? Like you get to catch the speaker in the hallway

462
00:22:11,091 --> 00:22:13,812
and have a chat with them and it's fun and it's awesome.

463
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:20,308
We can't do it in quite that way this year, but we can do it virtually. So I've put together

464
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:26,731
a web page and this is not on my main website. You have to go directly to this URL to get to it.

465
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:31,674
But for people who are attending tonight, you're welcome to go check it out and you can book a

466
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:35,736
call with me. And I would love to have a chat with you and we can just pretend like we're at

467
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:40,138
Moscone together. And you can tell me what you thought about the talk and ask questions. And

468
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:44,321
maybe you've got some ideas you want to share with me too. I would love to hear it. So I hope you'll

469
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:45,041
take advantage of it.

470
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:50,100
And that is my presentation, and I'd love to do some Q&A now.

471
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:54,283
OK, perfect.

472
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:55,545
Thank you so much, Susan.

473
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:58,587
We got quite a few questions, so I'm

474
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:02,871
going to pull from the very top of the list.

475
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:04,772
Let's see.

476
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:07,034
I wish I had a moderator in life.

477
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,016
This is so luxurious.

478
00:23:09,036 --> 00:23:09,736
I love it.

479
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:16,635
So Tori asks, can you give us examples of games that had a strong theme and how it benefited from that theme?

480
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:18,136
Sure. How about Bioshock?

481
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:21,459
That's a mic drop, right?

482
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:29,566
I mean, Bioshock really embraced Ayn Rand and objectivism and really, again, took a point of view on it, right?

483
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:35,832
Like, OK, what if we took objectivism to its ultimate, we sort of thought the whole thing through?

484
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,292
That's not the only example of a game that really embraced theme,

485
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:44,833
but that to me feels like the most overt and clear example

486
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:50,475
of putting you inside of something that feels very dry when you read about it.

487
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:51,496
Like, oh, objectivism.

488
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:54,677
I read about this my sophomore year in college and I slept through it.

489
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:56,858
But like nobody sleeps through Bioshock.

490
00:23:58,707 --> 00:23:59,828
That's a really good example.

491
00:24:02,431 --> 00:24:03,792
We had another question.

492
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,035
They said, hey, Susan, great presentation.

493
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,719
If the writer wants to add something to the mechanics

494
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:12,582
because it helps emphasize the theme and the story more,

495
00:24:12,642 --> 00:24:14,224
would that be crossing bounds?

496
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:16,807
If not, what are some tactful ways to approach it?

497
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:21,859
So sounds like, well, first of all,

498
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,080
like that's definitely the way to be thinking, right?

499
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,201
Like, you know, I think about,

500
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:29,122
I'm guessing you're a writer person.

501
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:33,144
So, you know, I think about our storytelling tools

502
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:35,506
almost like, you know how when you see a cooking show

503
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:38,447
and the chef show up and they've got their knife roll

504
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:39,628
and they like bust it out

505
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:41,368
and every knife's got a special job.

506
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:43,409
This is my fish knife and that's my paring knife.

507
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,032
And I think about the ways that we can tell stories in games.

508
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:48,933
And I think of dialogue, for example,

509
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:51,855
as the weakest tool we've got because players just

510
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:52,395
don't listen.

511
00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:55,097
And then environmental storytelling

512
00:24:55,137 --> 00:24:56,077
is a very strong tool.

513
00:24:56,498 --> 00:24:59,159
And mechanics is a super strong storytelling tool.

514
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,721
So I don't think it's overstepping bounds.

515
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:06,504
But I think it really speaks less to the craft

516
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:07,645
and more to the politics.

517
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:12,750
because it's got to be an idea that both you and the designer can get excited about.

518
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:20,935
Right? And so this is where being a really good team player comes into comes into play. Sorry.

519
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:25,578
Right. But like spending the time and this is also like

520
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:29,020
This is just career advice too. I've been talking to my friends who run

521
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,782
writing teams at studios, and I'm like, what do you look for in a writer?

522
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:34,784
And I was expecting a whole bunch of like, well, they've really got to know how to do

523
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:38,727
branching dialogue, or they really got to know R2C or whatever. And they're like,

524
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:43,451
they've got to be able to work with other people. That's what everybody says. And I was like,

525
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:48,495
really? Okay. And this is a perfect example, right? So let's say you have a great idea for a mechanic.

526
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:53,493
Then it just becomes a question of, like, how can I share this idea with a designer

527
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:56,636
in a way that doesn't feel like I'm telling that designer how to do their job?

528
00:25:57,497 --> 00:26:00,920
Right? And so that's where, like, if you've got a level of trust with each other that you've

529
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:07,746
established previously, then you can go and just throw some ideas around. And then, and here's

530
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,530
the trick, and this is the challenge too, honestly, listen to what they say.

531
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:19,782
like they might say no and and when people say no the temptation is to mount a defense like no this

532
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:23,765
is a good idea listen I'll explain it again but I'll be louder this time then you'll get excited

533
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:29,669
about it right but the smarter play is to just be quiet listen to whatever they say whatever

534
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:30,669
their objections are and

535
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,190
then go away and really think about it.

536
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,171
Because everybody that works in game development,

537
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,851
in my experience, is very smart.

538
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:40,031
And when people have an objection to an idea,

539
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:42,652
they usually have a pretty good reason for it.

540
00:26:42,732 --> 00:26:44,672
And that reason is usually, in my experience,

541
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:46,593
rooted in something that I don't know anything about.

542
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,133
Whether that's like an engine limitation,

543
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:51,914
or like, you know the publisher will never go for it,

544
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:54,214
or who knows, any of a host of reasons

545
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:57,295
that have nothing to do with your awesome mechanic idea.

546
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,416
but it's still going to be an impediment, right?

547
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:03,819
So I think embracing the possibility

548
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:05,801
of getting involved in game design as a writer

549
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,962
is really important, and vice versa.

550
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:10,364
I want designers to start getting really excited

551
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:12,186
about being involved in the story process.

552
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:14,888
And then it's a question of how do we do it collaboratively?

553
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,031
And that takes time, unfortunately,

554
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:19,993
but that's how it gets done.

555
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:21,754
Like with anything, right?

556
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:23,817
Like anything, right?

557
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:24,718
Exactly.

558
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:26,359
Let's see.

559
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,542
So Nathan asks, can any kind of gameplay

560
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:32,204
benefit from having a story and vice versa?

561
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:34,827
For example, can a mechanics-focused game

562
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:37,028
like Tetris be improved with a story that

563
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,069
matches it well enough?

564
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:41,352
So that's an interesting question.

565
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,373
I'll be honest.

566
00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:44,935
I do not want to see a story Tetris game.

567
00:27:46,218 --> 00:27:47,580
Like, Tetris is perfect.

568
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,001
Like, why would we add a story to it?

569
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:51,163
What's exciting to me, this is actually,

570
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:54,566
this will be a positive comment once I get around to it.

571
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:56,768
Games don't need stories.

572
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:59,691
Not in the same way that like movies need stories

573
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:01,533
and TV needs stories and books need stories.

574
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,496
Games are a storytelling medium, but they are not,

575
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:06,577
that is not their reason for being.

576
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:11,300
And so story is optional, and therefore, I think,

577
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,401
as an industry, as a bunch of creatives,

578
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,883
we should be being a whole lot more foolish

579
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:17,864
around story ideas.

580
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,705
We should be crazier and more creative

581
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,707
and try nuttier things because it's optional.

582
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,108
Like, if it doesn't work, just cut it, right?

583
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:27,349
I mean, not to be overly simplistic,

584
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:31,992
but I do think that not every game needs a story.

585
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:39,841
But when story and gameplay really work, there is something special and magical that can't

586
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:40,482
be replicated.

587
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:45,244
And the other thing about this too is that gamers are desperate for this stuff.

588
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:50,746
The Entertainment Software Association did a study of what motivates people to buy a

589
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:51,066
game.

590
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:52,746
What's your decision criteria?

591
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:56,108
And 57% of them are like, well, if it's got a good story, I'll buy it.

592
00:28:57,397 --> 00:29:00,661
Like that's a big number, right?

593
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:04,625
And so, and you know, all games out there

594
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:06,427
like have a really solid code base

595
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:09,190
and all games have great animation for the most part

596
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,112
and great music and great game design.

597
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:14,616
But the one place you can really stand out even now

598
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,559
is if you can deliver a great game with a great story.

599
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,211
It's hard to do, and so the ones that pull it off really stand out.

600
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:26,732
And so even though it's hard to do, it's worthwhile and it can be done.

601
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:30,412
And the reality is it's only going to get easier because we're going to, it's

602
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:32,713
going to learn more and more and more about how to do this.

603
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:36,314
It's, it's hard now, but it's easier than it was five years ago, which means

604
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:40,215
it's going to be easier than now, you know, five years from now, it'll be even easier.

605
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:45,168
I've just been nodding at everything that you've been saying, because you're making really good points.

606
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,510
I'm just sitting here like, yeah, she makes a lot of sense.

607
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:52,053
You know, I'm teaching, I'm teaching the writing for games masterclass right now.

608
00:29:52,113 --> 00:29:54,154
And like, we're just really going deep on all this stuff.

609
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:56,175
And like, yeah, it's really exciting to think about it.

610
00:29:56,215 --> 00:29:58,377
Like, absolutely.

611
00:29:59,618 --> 00:30:01,219
Let's see.

612
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:06,762
So Bradley asks, what are some strategies for communicating with team members who are not?

613
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:12,035
who are not as story minded to encourage them to value integrating narrative into their work.

614
00:30:13,315 --> 00:30:20,678
Yes. My boyfriend is a designer who doesn't like story, so I get it. I really get it.

615
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:28,820
So, I find that what really helps

616
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:32,126
And again, this is the long game, right?

617
00:30:32,146 --> 00:30:34,467
This is like investing in the relationship with that person.

618
00:30:35,028 --> 00:30:37,349
But even people who like, say like,

619
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:38,970
I don't wanna work on a story-based game

620
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,932
are gonna go home at the end of the day

621
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:41,973
and watch Game of Thrones.

622
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:46,596
Or like, everybody loves story, some kind of story, right?

623
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:50,699
And so I find a lot of times when I'm trying to talk

624
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:52,040
with someone who's kind of resistant,

625
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,401
I don't talk about the project at hand,

626
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:56,263
but I just ask them like, well, what are you,

627
00:30:56,543 --> 00:30:57,704
what stories do you like?

628
00:30:57,804 --> 00:30:57,944
Like,

629
00:30:58,884 --> 00:30:59,725
It doesn't have to be games.

630
00:30:59,785 --> 00:31:01,486
It can be, are there movies that you like?

631
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,966
Are there TV shows that you like?

632
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:05,608
Inevitably, there's going to be something.

633
00:31:06,108 --> 00:31:08,029
And then getting to know what they

634
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:10,690
like about those stories that they like and kind of digging

635
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,991
in without being intrusive.

636
00:31:13,512 --> 00:31:15,993
But you want to find some common ground with them.

637
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:20,035
And a lot of times, the things that other people love

638
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:21,536
can become the common ground where

639
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,297
you can start a really good conversation with them.

640
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:29,966
And the other thing, so that's like one tip and the other tip I would give is like, like,

641
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,192
be curious.

642
00:31:33,197 --> 00:31:38,458
Right? Like, like, instead of, instead of, and I've done this, I've been like, I can convince them,

643
00:31:38,578 --> 00:31:41,979
like, if I just say enough words, they're gonna, they're gonna, they're gonna bow down to me,

644
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:47,861
and they're gonna accept that story really matters. But instead, like, you know, be the read,

645
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:52,323
you know, like, like, just be, well, tell me why. Tell me why you think story's not good in games,

646
00:31:52,483 --> 00:31:57,564
and let them, let them make their case. And there probably is some nugget of insight in there that

647
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:58,625
will be really helpful to hear.

648
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,206
And then, like I was saying earlier, like going away and reflecting on it.

649
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:05,708
If you can, here's the trick. Here's what we're shooting for.

650
00:32:05,928 --> 00:32:06,969
You want to get to the point

651
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:10,311
where you can really see the problem from their point of view,

652
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,994
like legitimately, like not a patronizing kind of way, but like, wow,

653
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,855
they've got a good point. I see what they're saying.

654
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:20,678
And the trick is as writers, you guys, like this is actually

655
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:23,580
tapping into your superpower because writers.

656
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,062
One of their superpowers is that they've got a lot of empathy.

657
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,617
Writers have a real gift for putting themselves

658
00:32:30,677 --> 00:32:31,637
in someone else's shoes.

659
00:32:32,178 --> 00:32:34,018
So think about it in terms of like

660
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,179
making a power move as a writer,

661
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,440
like really getting to know that character,

662
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,761
which is that person at your studio

663
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:42,182
that doesn't want to do story and find out why.

664
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:44,183
And then, you know, then you,

665
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:46,664
if you can empathize with them, here's the thing,

666
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:49,025
you know, this is a marketing message,

667
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:50,786
which, but it weirdly applies to this,

668
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:54,828
which is you can't be seen until you learn how to see.

669
00:32:56,944 --> 00:32:59,685
And all that means is like you've got to understand them first,

670
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,785
and then they're going to be way more open to understanding you.

671
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:05,986
Now, that's again advice.

672
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:07,886
Yeah, it's longer.

673
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:11,227
It's more effort, but it's it's how you win.

674
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:13,547
Yeah, absolutely.

675
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:16,768
We have a lot of really good questions, so I'm very I'm very excited.

676
00:33:18,508 --> 00:33:19,088
So let's see.

677
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:22,449
Evan asks, What are some of your favorite methods

678
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:25,270
for avoiding unplayable cut scenes? Mm.

679
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,160
You mean like in terms of like when I'm working on a project, how do we keep from like defaulting to a...

680
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:40,943
Yes. I won't specify, but let's go with that. Yeah. If they want to amend their question, I'll get to that.

681
00:33:40,963 --> 00:33:44,804
Okay. Yeah, I'm being ridiculous. I'm like, what, you mean like when I play, do I skip cutscenes?

682
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:50,986
But I'm sure he means what I just said. Okay. Yeah, so...

683
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:57,079
Well, I'm not opposed to cut scenes as a blanket statement,

684
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,502
but I am opposed to story and gameplay being really separate.

685
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:06,284
So for example, if there's a real push on a project

686
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:10,847
for using cut scenes, what I want to do is use cut scenes.

687
00:34:11,027 --> 00:34:11,487
Here, you know what?

688
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,948
I'm going to be specific and use an example.

689
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:14,789
I'll tell you a game that I think did a great job

690
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:17,110
with cut scenes is the original God of War.

691
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:21,437
because when you play the God of War, Athena comes to you and says,

692
00:34:22,198 --> 00:34:25,699
Ares has gone mad and only you, the strongest Spartan, can kill the God of War.

693
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:30,060
Will you do it? And if you go back and you watch a cinematic on YouTube,

694
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,641
he doesn't say, hell yeah, I'll kill the God of War. I hate that guy.

695
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:37,122
He sucks. Like it's not a revenge story.

696
00:34:37,782 --> 00:34:42,303
What he actually says is I'll do it if you take these memories away from me.

697
00:34:44,157 --> 00:34:45,439
And this is the beginning of the game.

698
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:46,340
I'm like, what memories?

699
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,081
Did I miss something?

700
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:47,562
What memories?

701
00:34:47,582 --> 00:34:48,083
What's going on?

702
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,928
And so as the game progresses, we get to see more and more of his

703
00:34:51,988 --> 00:34:56,574
memories, which are revealed in bits and pieces, which are huge payoffs for me.

704
00:34:56,634 --> 00:34:57,816
I've been waiting for that.

705
00:34:58,782 --> 00:35:01,704
right, because this mystery was set up ahead of time

706
00:35:02,204 --> 00:35:03,725
and the cut scenes play out in such a way

707
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:04,906
that they give me just enough,

708
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:07,388
they close a loop and they open a loop at the same time.

709
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:09,750
They really keep me on the hook.

710
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,612
And so for me, and it turns out that what's happening

711
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:13,873
in the memories he's trying to forget

712
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:16,395
is tied to the gameplay in ways that become

713
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:19,177
not clear at first, but become clearer and clearer

714
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,137
as the game goes on.

715
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:22,699
So that to me is like a magic trick.

716
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:25,021
Like it is cut scene based storytelling

717
00:35:25,061 --> 00:35:26,762
but deeply integrated with gameplay.

718
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:32,931
And that's, you know, cutscenes are just a tool, a weak tool, right?

719
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,653
Dialogue is your weakest tool.

720
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,616
Second weakest tool is cutscenes.

721
00:35:37,257 --> 00:35:40,542
But they can be used well if they're just used carefully.

722
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:49,270
Right. It looks like they added to the question, and I think you may have answered it, but they

723
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:54,975
clarified and said, as in, how do you deliver large amounts of story without just turning it

724
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:59,719
into a movie? Right. Okay, fair. So I'll give a slightly different answer to that question,

725
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:02,101
which is really good. I think that, you know,

726
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,462
And again, I think we just want to sort of look at our tools,

727
00:36:06,522 --> 00:36:06,642
right?

728
00:36:06,682 --> 00:36:08,083
Like, how can we deliver a story?

729
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:10,345
Here's how you deliver a story in a game.

730
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:12,947
You figure out what the player is paying attention to,

731
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:13,968
and you put the story there.

732
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:20,192
So for example, players pay a lot of attention to the world.

733
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,004
Because that's where the trouble lies in terms of enemies.

734
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:26,665
And that's also where the treasure lies.

735
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,386
That's where the loot is.

736
00:36:28,546 --> 00:36:30,506
That's the map they're trying to navigate.

737
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:31,687
There's the bridge I was looking for.

738
00:36:32,027 --> 00:36:33,807
So they're real attentive to the world.

739
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,169
So environmental storytelling is really powerful.

740
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:43,090
And mechanics can be really powerful.

741
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:45,431
And I think also something else I want to say,

742
00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:47,232
every answer could go on for an hour,

743
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:48,432
but something else I want to say is

744
00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:53,944
You know, games are really, storytelling in games

745
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,244
are really counterintuitive.

746
00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:57,205
Like if you've got a big story that you wanna

747
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,926
really deliver to the player and it's real important to you

748
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:03,448
that they see it, the best way to deliver it to them

749
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,669
is to hide it from them.

750
00:37:08,189 --> 00:37:11,311
Like you wanna use what they call pull storytelling

751
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,491
versus like push storytelling.

752
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,513
So if the gameplay stops and I push a cinematic on you,

753
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:18,525
Like you just want to skip it.

754
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:21,227
Like it feels like an affront, like, hey, get out of my space.

755
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:21,507
Right.

756
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:23,468
But if you're playing a game and it's like,

757
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,850
you don't know what's happening in this world, but clearly something is.

758
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,091
And it's crazy.

759
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:30,032
And you want to understand you can't figure it out

760
00:37:30,052 --> 00:37:31,032
and you want to know more about it.

761
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:32,133
So you start exploring

762
00:37:32,153 --> 00:37:35,415
and then you find some notes here and there and whatnot. Right.

763
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,456
That's pull storytelling.

764
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:39,877
That's pulling you through the space

765
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,258
so that you can discover the story.

766
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:45,600
And if you turn story discovery into a gameplay reward,

767
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,341
like, that's when things really start clicking.

768
00:37:50,082 --> 00:37:52,444
So I say, if you've got a great big story,

769
00:37:52,544 --> 00:37:53,924
hide it like an iceberg.

770
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:56,966
That's a really good way of putting it.

771
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,627
It's a really good answer, too.

772
00:37:59,247 --> 00:37:59,907
Thank you.

773
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:02,049
Like, I do this for a living or something.

774
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:02,789
Who would have thought?

775
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,002
So Brian has a really good question and they ask,

776
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,084
what are your thoughts about writing tools

777
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:27,758
like Twine, Renpi, Final Cut Pro?

778
00:38:29,564 --> 00:38:31,105
Hi. Hi. Sorry.

779
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:34,148
I'm dealing with a little bit of rain and thunder on the East Coast.

780
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,809
Did you hear the question that I asked?

781
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:37,590
I heard the first part. I heard twine.

782
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,853
I did not hear the other two things. Sorry. Perfect. No, that's fine.

783
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:42,534
I'm glad we got you back. Well, I got you back.

784
00:38:43,235 --> 00:38:46,177
So Bryant wants to know, what are your thoughts about how writing tools

785
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:50,240
like twine, Renpi, Final Draft influence the way that story gets hammered out

786
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,822
in a game? Aha. Perfect. OK, so.

787
00:38:54,684 --> 00:38:56,685
I wrote a whole thing about this, I think, on my blog.

788
00:38:57,246 --> 00:38:58,587
But here's my thoughts.

789
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,410
I think Twine is awesome for a couple of different reasons.

790
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,772
It's great for your portfolio, and it's

791
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:08,456
great for prototyping ideas with your team, right?

792
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:10,117
It's because you don't need anyone else to do it.

793
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:13,821
It's interactive storytelling that only the writer

794
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:14,721
has to deal with it.

795
00:39:15,862 --> 00:39:17,964
So it's really good for rapid prototyping of ideas.

796
00:39:18,805 --> 00:39:21,267
I think I don't use Final Draft.

797
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,320
I think that it just gets me back into screenwriting mode.

798
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,222
And storytelling in games is just so different

799
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:29,202
in some ways than that.

800
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:31,723
I mean, it's great for cinematics, right?

801
00:39:31,844 --> 00:39:32,804
And that's the problem.

802
00:39:32,844 --> 00:39:36,466
If your favorite tool is good for,

803
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:38,627
your favorite software is good for creating

804
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:40,148
the weakest storytelling tool you've got,

805
00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:41,489
that's bad, because then your tendency

806
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:43,069
is gonna be to lean towards it, right?

807
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,670
Cutscenes are fun to write.

808
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,051
You've got so much control.

809
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:48,372
And it's also perfect on the page.

810
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,673
But if the player skips it, then it didn't happen.

811
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:50,733
So.

812
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:57,436
I think that like this, we still need, we are still lacking in tools, honestly.

813
00:39:57,456 --> 00:39:59,056
I mean, Twine's good.

814
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:03,437
I know that there are studios that use Articy, and I think they've had some good success with it.

815
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:07,658
But, you know, for writers who are outside the industry, I think it would blow their mind

816
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:11,900
if they heard that there is not some industry standard software for writing games.

817
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,585
Like that would make no sense to them.

818
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:15,426
And it shouldn't.

819
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:17,588
This whole industry is full of programmers.

820
00:40:17,628 --> 00:40:19,190
Can't we find some people to write a program

821
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,191
that'll work for us?

822
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,192
I mean, it's crazy.

823
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:25,036
But I know a lot of studios use homegrown writing software

824
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,537
and I don't know, we just haven't solved this.

825
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:27,758
Here's what's gonna happen.

826
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:29,059
Someone's gonna solve this problem.

827
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,281
We're gonna get some really great

828
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:31,502
industry standard software.

829
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,304
And then a year later, six months later,

830
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:35,866
the quality of storytelling in games

831
00:40:35,946 --> 00:40:37,227
is gonna make this quantum leap.

832
00:40:37,928 --> 00:40:40,891
and they're going to think it's because all the they hired better writers and it's not.

833
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:45,435
It's because they're going to finally have better tools. So please somebody do that. I'll pay you

834
00:40:45,455 --> 00:40:49,899
a million bajillion dollars. Thank you. I have to keep on that promise when it happens.

835
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:53,686
I've got it.

836
00:40:54,187 --> 00:40:54,647
Fill me up.

837
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:56,348
JD has a really good question.

838
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:59,711
They want to know, how do you process criticism

839
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,773
in this writer-designer relationship

840
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:04,855
and decide which hill you want to die on, if any,

841
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:07,777
without being confrontational and unproductive?

842
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,739
Yes, queen.

843
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:10,880
I love this question.

844
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,782
I know we're getting to the end, and I literally

845
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:16,684
could stay here till sun comes up talking about that one.

846
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:20,147
I'll try to give you a short answer.

847
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:27,960
So I think one of the things that's really important

848
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,500
about growing as a game writer

849
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,701
is figuring out which hills to die on.

850
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:34,282
It's really important to be collaborative.

851
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:37,183
Everybody gives a little on games, everybody.

852
00:41:38,604 --> 00:41:39,585
And we have to give as well,

853
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:41,825
but there are some things that are worth fighting for.

854
00:41:41,906 --> 00:41:42,706
So I'm gonna share with you

855
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:44,687
the things I think are really important.

856
00:41:45,447 --> 00:41:47,508
And here's what's not important.

857
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:49,429
Here's where I think it's really important

858
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:51,350
to be really collaborative, plot.

859
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:55,109
Plot is a shared endeavor.

860
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:57,750
You have ideas about the plot, so does the designer,

861
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,490
so does the programmer, so does the player.

862
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,310
And that is great.

863
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,891
It should be a group effort.

864
00:42:03,031 --> 00:42:04,231
Don't sweat plot.

865
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:06,231
Let it be, right?

866
00:42:06,612 --> 00:42:08,252
Throw out ideas, make suggestions,

867
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:10,332
but let it evolve however it's going to.

868
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:12,913
The place where you wanna put your storytelling love,

869
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:15,193
where you can be of greatest service to your team

870
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:18,074
is by really committing to the characters.

871
00:42:20,444 --> 00:42:23,046
Storytelling in games is about character creation.

872
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:25,808
And oftentimes, when I say character,

873
00:42:25,828 --> 00:42:27,089
I don't mean the player avatar.

874
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:28,410
Like when I work on a project,

875
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:30,612
I skip right over the player avatar.

876
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,313
Like I push that guy out of the way

877
00:42:32,354 --> 00:42:33,935
so I can get to the NPCs in the corner.

878
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:40,796
Because the player avatar is going to do whatever the designer and the player want to do, right?

879
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,998
I really don't have a whole lot of control over that.

880
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:46,522
And if I create a really fully fleshed out character for that avatar,

881
00:42:47,062 --> 00:42:49,985
that's probably going to get in the way of the player's experience, right?

882
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:53,068
Because it's no longer them in the game. It's this guy or this girl.

883
00:42:53,749 --> 00:42:54,930
But the NPCs...

884
00:42:56,178 --> 00:42:58,519
Like that, those are your actors.

885
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:00,920
Like those are the ones who are gonna read your lines

886
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,581
and believe your story and embrace your motivations

887
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,422
and live out the themes that you wanna describe, right?

888
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,903
Like what we wanna do as game writers,

889
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:10,744
and I'll maybe end on this note,

890
00:43:10,784 --> 00:43:15,325
like where we can do our best work as writers in games

891
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,706
is if we create characters who have inner lives,

892
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,667
who have like hopes and dreams and fears of their own.

893
00:43:20,727 --> 00:43:22,108
They feel like they are living a life

894
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:25,069
and that you just came along at a moment in their life.

895
00:43:26,072 --> 00:43:29,654
to either be their best friend or their worst enemy or somewhere in between.

896
00:43:30,114 --> 00:43:34,998
But we love living worlds and living worlds are full of interesting characters

897
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:39,901
and interesting characters are characters who are interested in something.

898
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:44,264
So like what I would say to you and what I wish I could get in a time machine

899
00:43:44,305 --> 00:43:48,047
and say to myself 15 years ago is like, let it be with the plot.

900
00:43:48,687 --> 00:43:50,108
Be a good team player around that

901
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:52,550
and give all of your love to the characters

902
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,111
because that's what's really going to have

903
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,311
the most impact on the player

904
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:56,532
and that's who you're trying to reach.

905
00:43:58,493 --> 00:44:02,996
I think we have time for maybe one more really quick question

906
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:03,817
with a quick answer.

907
00:44:03,837 --> 00:44:09,140
Kay wants to know, do you think there is such a thing

908
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,262
as too many game notes or audio diaries?

909
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:12,322
Oh.

910
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:24,154
Yeah, I could see that getting out of control, right? You want to have, I mean, really, and

911
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:29,500
that kind of comes down to, you know, my first thought about that would be, well, it depends

912
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,945
on gameplay, right? Like if the gameplay is a real, like run and gun manic kind of situation

913
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:39,890
where like probably the player is only going to pick up 20% of the notes, well, then go to town,

914
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,613
have a million of them because you want to make sure that the player gets at least some of them.

915
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:47,089
But if it's a real like creepy, crawly, slow-mo kind of a thing,

916
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,671
like be more judicious.

917
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:51,275
Because if there are notes falling out of the air ducts,

918
00:44:52,396 --> 00:44:54,779
and you're like, you're kicking up like a foot's worth of notes all the time,

919
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,981
they don't feel very special.

920
00:44:56,832 --> 00:45:02,214
Right? And so we want the we want the players ability to discover the story to feel special.

921
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:07,336
And so I think it's, it's really about tuning. Right? You just have to kind of like,

922
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:11,837
you got to be, you know, not too much, not too little. There's a sweet spot in between.

923
00:45:12,017 --> 00:45:14,718
And you don't know it, where that sweet spot is until you start testing.

924
00:45:16,367 --> 00:45:19,209
And that is all the time that we have.

925
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:21,630
That was a perfect, perfect timing.

926
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,412
Susan, I want to thank you for taking the time

927
00:45:25,512 --> 00:45:27,032
to speak with all of us tonight.

928
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:28,813
And I want to thank everybody

929
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:30,174
for their really great questions.

930
00:45:30,514 --> 00:45:33,536
And that is the end of GDC summer for us.

931
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:37,137
So thank you guys so much for hanging out with us.

932
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:40,039
Yay, pajamas GDC is over.
