1
00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:12,578
It's really an honor for me to be here today and to talk about the genesis of Another World.

2
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:19,883
This game was created 20 years ago and at the time I couldn't have imagined

3
00:00:20,723 --> 00:00:22,904
that it would stay in the heart of many.

4
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:31,790
My objective today is to give you a clear view of the origins of a game,

5
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:34,752
how things were done and in what order.

6
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:40,840
how ideas appeared, and very importantly, in what context.

7
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,662
We also consider the periods of doubt

8
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:48,583
and the obstacles I met along the way.

9
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:56,446
As curious as it seems, I started

10
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:59,987
to create the game without knowing what it would be.

11
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:04,608
The creation of this game was an improvisation.

12
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:10,163
And that was not clear at the time, but in retrospect,

13
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:12,864
20 years later, I can see a parallel

14
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:14,825
with theater improvisation.

15
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:17,986
Because in theater improvisation,

16
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:22,127
the actors have to follow predefined rules.

17
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:26,068
And they must respect them and play along with them.

18
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:30,149
For another world, I set some very strong constraints,

19
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:31,629
like using polygons.

20
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,230
And also, in improvisation.

21
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:42,753
we develop the story layer by layer without knowing where it is going precisely.

22
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:51,380
That is what happened for Another World. That's why I'd like to present the creative process

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,482
chronologically, if that's okay with you.

24
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:02,689
So

25
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,627
The talk will be like a diary divided in four parts.

26
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:13,490
First, I will talk about the ignition, the desire that

27
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,711
sparked the development.

28
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:19,394
Then, we will look at the technology behind the game,

29
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:23,676
how it shaped the design, and give a solid foundation

30
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:24,357
to create it.

31
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:28,680
Then, I will talk about the creation of the game itself,

32
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,442
gameplay, graphics, animation, and story.

33
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,161
than the publishing aspects.

34
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:39,302
As far as possible, I will describe

35
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:44,124
the context of the creation and how the flourishing of ideas

36
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:47,325
is as important as ideas themselves.

37
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:55,388
First, let's brush on the context.

38
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,749
We are in July 1989.

39
00:02:58,789 --> 00:02:59,469
It is.

40
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:03,920
the Amiga era.

41
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:17,467
I'm 22 years old, still living in my parents' house.

42
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:25,472
Okay, this photo was taken in 1991 at the end of the development, but in 1989, there

43
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:27,413
would be no less mess, unfortunately.

44
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:37,995
I had been creating various games since 1983 on various platforms like Oric-One, Amstrad,

45
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,537
and of course, Amiga.

46
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:48,161
The average time to create this game was from three weeks to six months.

47
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:52,583
None has been really successful.

48
00:03:55,365 --> 00:04:00,047
And I had just finished creating all the graphics and animation for

49
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:05,499
Future Wars, which is a game designed by Paul Cuisset.

50
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,243
And Dragon Slayer was just released on Amiga, and its huge animations really impressed me.

51
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,944
I was wondering how to do this.

52
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:29,888
This game was purely beatmap. It was running on eight floppy disks.

53
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,911
But it inspired me, technically speaking,

54
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:37,832
to base a 2D game on a polygon drawing technology.

55
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:39,232
Why polygons?

56
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:43,333
Polygons mean low memory usage.

57
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:47,614
And therefore, it can cover a huge part of the screen

58
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:49,115
with very few data.

59
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:52,656
It seemed very advantageous.

60
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:57,557
And I felt it could open new horizons.

61
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:09,510
Also, a new thing that came with the Amiga was the ability to connect a Genlock.

62
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:17,636
What's a Genlock? A Genlock is a hardware that enables you to put a video behind the picture,

63
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:22,600
and the picture which is displayed on the screen, of course.

64
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:30,006
And I had seen a demo of this in a shop, and this led me to a conclusion that

65
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:35,915
If I could connect a video camcorder to the Amiga

66
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:39,777
with this hardware, I could create realistic animation

67
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:43,019
with polygons by using the classical technique

68
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:44,000
of rotoscoping.

69
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:55,767
Well, an idea is an idea, and it needed to become real

70
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:56,828
to have any value.

71
00:05:58,449 --> 00:05:59,590
But there was.

72
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,360
One crucial question.

73
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,301
Was it possible to draw enough polygons at the right speed?

74
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,922
I hadn't coded for two years.

75
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,584
And my last experience with C language was a disaster.

76
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:17,745
Yes, I promise.

77
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,646
It was really depressing, almost.

78
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:26,027
So I chose to code in assembly language, which was familiar

79
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:26,347
to me.

80
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:32,895
And I prototyped a routine which drew a few polygons at 60 frames per second.

81
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:37,859
And I'm strengthening the system that reduced to 20 frames per second.

82
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,181
And that was good enough to go further.

83
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:48,387
So I decided that the graphics unit would be polygons and polygons only.

84
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,148
That was the constraint.

85
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,711
This was a major...

86
00:06:54,491 --> 00:07:01,473
turning point in the creation of a game. It was like a dogma. I was sure that polygons

87
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:12,237
were the greatest thing in the world. I was obsessed by these polygons, how this car would

88
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:24,281
look in polygons, how would a potato look in polygons, and how a quad would look in

89
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:40,292
in polygon. Well, something's wrong. Where the hell is this? Aha, okay. Pixygon! What's

90
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:50,220
a pixygon? It's a polygon so small that it has the size of a pixel. I was used to doing

91
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,962
some pixel art, but dealing with flat surfaces.

92
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:55,504
was something new.

93
00:07:56,645 --> 00:08:00,147
The first time I used polygons to create graphics,

94
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:07,770
I was spending hours and hours drawing pixels with polygons.

95
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:10,231
The clock was ticking.

96
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,253
And months later, I was still on the first level.

97
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:17,094
That was discouraging.

98
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,456
And after coding a third of a game,

99
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,756
I reverted to.

100
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,542
to using some bitmap when I needed details

101
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:27,602
for some backgrounds.

102
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:32,546
But finally, the whole game uses only 10 bitmaps.

103
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:42,134
As you see, this choice brought new obstacles, especially

104
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:44,236
for detailed backgrounds.

105
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:47,038
But it opened new horizons for animation.

106
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,660
Again, what I would create, I strictly didn't know.

107
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:10,122
I can tell you, I tried, and it was a nightmare because it was too difficult to design without

108
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,582
knowing precisely the technical limits.

109
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:24,045
I just knew that I wanted to create a game with a cinematic feeling on a science fiction

110
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,945
theme with the rhythm of a movie.

111
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:33,730
but not especially having a story. I mean a well-defined script.

112
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:45,637
I was thinking more in terms of mood, ambience, movie, but no story. Yes, because it was not the

113
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:52,382
story side that interested me the most, but the rhythm and the narrative tension which is connected

114
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:57,345
but different from a story. This is an important point.

115
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,266
I could have said, I want to create a game where a scientist is projected into an unknown

116
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:11,811
universe where he will meet a friend who will help him all along the game and sure, the

117
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:14,334
hero will have red hair.

118
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,876
And in the end, he will almost die.

119
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,539
But I had no idea of this at the time.

120
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:21,200
I was stuck.

121
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:28,927
It drove me to the conclusion that the only way to solve this situation was to produce.

122
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:34,608
But no specific tools for polygons existed.

123
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,470
And I had to create the whole game system from scratch, too.

124
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,611
Let's see the tools used to create the game.

125
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:47,012
There are two aspects.

126
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:51,953
One, a polygon editor to edit all graphics.

127
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:58,553
And the hover was a homemade editor for the homemade interpreted language.

128
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:03,315
This interpreted language was used to code all the game logic.

129
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:13,699
The tool was coded partly in GFA basic and in assembly language. Basic easy to learn was used

130
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:21,042
to create the user interface since I didn't need performance. The assembly language.

131
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:34,061
was used only for the core game engine. Let's see the graphic editor. On the bottom are

132
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:40,628
all the tools. It's possible to create an object, a polygon, add a point, move a point,

133
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:41,929
change its color.

134
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:55,305
The idea was to code a tool where every polygon can be grouped together so that it can be

135
00:11:55,425 --> 00:12:02,867
easily manipulated and where each group of polygons can be grouped together again like

136
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:03,967
Russian dolls.

137
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:13,830
Here you can see that Lester is made of several polygons, but his head is another group of

138
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,370
polygons.

139
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:24,589
there was a special color which enabled transparency.

140
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:28,010
Indeed, that was a color palette trick,

141
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,111
and it is how I added some light effects.

142
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,892
So that's for the graphic side.

143
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:40,773
And then just by hitting a key, I

144
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:43,774
was able to switch from the graphic editor

145
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,955
to the code editor, which

146
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:49,650
which lead us to the specific language of the game.

147
00:12:55,115 --> 00:13:03,342
I made the choice of an interpreted language because in 1985, I designed this for a game

148
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,803
called Infernal Runner.

149
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:10,929
This was, and this was really much easier to program than in assembly language.

150
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,631
The big advantage is that the game...

151
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:16,485
would be interpreted in real time,

152
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:19,908
so no compiling was necessary to run the game.

153
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:24,852
That was a key feature to be efficient during its creation.

154
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:31,378
What is more, the connection between the two editors

155
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:33,080
went even tighter.

156
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:39,185
What we see on the left is the visualization of a drawing code

157
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:39,886
on the right.

158
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:48,628
I could move the graphics and it would modify the code and vice versa.

159
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:00,839
Ok.

160
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,865
In the graphic editor, it was also possible to run step by step a part of the program.

161
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:23,351
The key feature is that the interpreted language has a special instruction to slice the code

162
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:24,452
into time blocks.

163
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:29,776
It is the break instruction.

164
00:14:29,896 --> 00:14:36,041
You can see the break instruction here, and this instruction pauses the code until the

165
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:37,142
next game loop.

166
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:43,287
And the draw function just draws an object from the polygon editor.

167
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:48,271
This way, the interpreted code itself

168
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:51,333
became also an animation sequencer.

169
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:55,356
And it was possible to associate more complex code

170
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:57,738
to manage all the gameplay interaction.

171
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:05,683
The language has few instructions, very simple

172
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:10,547
and minimalism, like the assembly language,

173
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:12,508
but more readable.

174
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:18,625
The problem was that no comments were possible.

175
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:25,589
And the variable name was like V251.

176
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:31,313
And it carried just a number and no description.

177
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:35,575
So the solution I used was to note

178
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:38,897
that each variable was on paper.

179
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:41,739
And I have a full documentation.

180
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,400
I still have it today.

181
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,743
And it works.

182
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:54,649
So without entering into details,

183
00:15:54,889 --> 00:16:00,354
the engine allowed to run small piece of interpreted code

184
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:02,556
sequentially on separate tracks.

185
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:09,582
A little bit like a clip in Flash, but without graphics.

186
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:11,583
So it was very easy.

187
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:15,550
to manage timing and sequence inside the code.

188
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:20,194
Hence, we have one track for character displacement,

189
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:22,896
one track to manage the pad control,

190
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,698
one track to manage the laser shot.

191
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,602
So I had my tools and the game engine.

192
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:36,726
I learned their limits, like frame rate, number of colors,

193
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:37,707
memory limits.

194
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:41,303
And regarding the improvisation process,

195
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:45,526
I accept these limits as a new constraint.

196
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:51,750
So now I was not lost, and I can build the game

197
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,892
with these limits in mind.

198
00:16:58,675 --> 00:16:59,496
What's wrong again?

199
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:02,718
OK.

200
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:05,360
No common data between levels.

201
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,061
Each time.

202
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,140
I started a new level.

203
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,363
I copied the previous one to keep the basics,

204
00:17:16,963 --> 00:17:21,285
like controls, characters, behavior, and graphics.

205
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:26,828
And indeed, it was a major failure in the game

206
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:29,109
development, since for every change

207
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:34,991
I was making on generic things, I had to do it on all files.

208
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:40,870
For example, each time Lester's behavior changed,

209
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,753
I had to change it for all five levels.

210
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:49,296
And later, when I did a lot of tuning,

211
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,977
this became a nightmare.

212
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,643
So let's go to the game creation.

213
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:11,160
The introduction was a landmark because it validated the use of polygons and the use

214
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,540
of the interpreted language.

215
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:17,382
And the whole thing took only 84 kilobytes.

216
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:33,102
It was a way, so this introduction was a way to explore the dynamic of pictures in a cinematic style,

217
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:37,024
and especially the transition between cuts.

218
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:46,749
And also, this was a way to immerse myself in the universe, which was not existing before.

219
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,992
And it was the first layer of the improvisation process.

220
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:53,553
Hence, the first layer of the improvisation.

221
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:57,109
I had the first stepping stone for the story.

222
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:07,172
I had too much belief in rotoscoping.

223
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:16,475
I created some great scenes with it, but in the end, there are only six scenes that use

224
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:19,256
the technique, this technique, in the introduction.

225
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:20,596
And the rest of the game...

226
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:20,857
I don't know.

227
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,881
In the rest of the game, only the gun sequence and the walk

228
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:30,243
and run of Lester was made with this technique.

229
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:35,406
I got the best result from unmade animation,

230
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:38,287
like the lightning sequence.

231
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:44,670
Anyway, this confirmed that polygon animation was great,

232
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,012
but rotoscoping itself was, well, a little bit too limited.

233
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:05,006
The main rule I followed during the creation of a game was to listen to my inner feeling.

234
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:10,027
What do I feel right now? What does it suggest to me?

235
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:16,729
That's why doing things in chronological order made things coherent.

236
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:20,650
At that moment, it was not clear.

237
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,371
But creating a game all alone brought a feeling of loneliness.

238
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:31,067
which you can also find in the game.

239
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,632
And I was always trying to consider myself

240
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:41,894
as a player of a game who knew nothing about it.

241
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:48,558
Each time, I was asking myself, what would I love to experience?

242
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:54,202
And then, as a creator, how can I surprise and break

243
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:56,603
my initial expectation?

244
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:59,994
Surprising the player was important.

245
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:04,602
Playing with the pacing was a top objective.

246
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:40,676
the hero just disappeared and from that point I just knew that he would be teleported into

247
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:52,118
another world. But where? I thought in VR, in Freefall first, but then I thought it would be

248
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:58,139
much more surprising and unearthly to make him appear underwater.

249
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:19,507
which gave another stunning moment when he emerged on the surface of a totally unknown place

250
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:24,609
that is clearly not Earth since there are two moons in the sky.

251
00:22:34,072 --> 00:22:34,973
Is Jordan there?

252
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:38,774
Okay

253
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:46,289
The choice to do a 2D game came naturally. I was a big fan of Karateka on Apple 2,

254
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:54,473
and that was a kind of game I felt comfortable to create, so I went this way.

255
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:57,574
So, what's the player doing?

256
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:02,377
All gameplay activity is very traditional in many aspects.

257
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:05,758
You fight, you run, you jump, you flee, you die.

258
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:15,170
But the environment suggests a narrative and gives more meaning to these basic actions.

259
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:29,297
The color palette. Only 16 in total and it was very difficult to define.

260
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:36,021
A whole week was needed to define the first color palette.

261
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:43,530
full one week full time for 16 colors, a determining choice for the atmosphere of the game.

262
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:54,377
Some colors are sometimes used both for the landscape and for the character. For instance,

263
00:23:55,738 --> 00:24:02,242
the hero's flesh color was also used to suggest the sunset reflected on the rock.

264
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:08,875
Having only 16 colors is very restrictive.

265
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:11,696
You could understand my need to optimize

266
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,397
the use of each color as each hue had multiple uses.

267
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:20,160
Giving Lester dark hair would have been an easy solution.

268
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,641
But I didn't want him to look too much like me.

269
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:29,784
Yes, because I was filming myself to create animation.

270
00:24:30,664 --> 00:24:33,565
And the hero was physically nearly identical to me.

271
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:34,966
It was disturbing.

272
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:42,005
So I didn't want to see myself running on the screen,

273
00:24:42,325 --> 00:24:45,586
being killed by a slug or whatever.

274
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:52,429
So I decided to choose a totally different color, red,

275
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,751
because I was sure that this color would be

276
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,591
very useful in many pictures.

277
00:24:58,232 --> 00:25:02,874
And I also wanted Lester to stand out

278
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:03,914
from the background.

279
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:10,022
and I will never have red hair.

280
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:13,665
Only blue hair sometime.

281
00:25:21,131 --> 00:25:28,638
So, during the creation of this part, I defined the vocabulary used through the whole game.

282
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:30,600
We will see this right now.

283
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:39,014
Creating a 2D game limits the gameplay to one plane,

284
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:43,797
but it gives the advantage of exploiting more freely

285
00:25:44,598 --> 00:25:48,981
the depth at the front and the back of the scene

286
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:49,821
for something else.

287
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:56,206
This in order to build narrative without interrupting

288
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,287
player activity.

289
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:02,530
Here, the black beast can be seen from the beginning.

290
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:05,964
so the player can start to think about it.

291
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:13,650
So it's really a suggestion of a story.

292
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:22,677
And what happens in the background suddenly becomes real for the player.

293
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:32,244
This cutscene is very short.

294
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:44,296
And it gets, this cutscene is very short and can be seen as punctuating, as punctuating

295
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:49,877
to give emphasis to a major event, which is a turning point in the pacing.

296
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:57,819
So I played with the rhythm of the action.

297
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:03,240
We go from a slow rhythm before the creature arrives.

298
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:07,354
to a fast and very stressful situation,

299
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:15,480
with a moment of suspension, when you have to backtrack.

300
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,813
Then, to reach the climax, where another punctuation...

301
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,406
surprise again the player.

302
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:56,943
Here we've reached the end of part one, which ends on a cliffhanger for the player, but

303
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:57,763
also for myself.

304
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:03,269
And regarding the improvisation process, after that point,

305
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:06,371
I didn't know what would happen next.

306
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:10,555
I just knew that the next scene would be in a jail,

307
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:15,759
but the idea of giving lesser a friend hadn't come to me yet.

308
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:22,225
How this guy looked under his costume, I did not know.

309
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:30,010
So in the jail, the first thing I did was to remove his clothes

310
00:28:31,191 --> 00:28:33,692
to know what he looked like.

311
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:50,623
And then I introduced the most important character

312
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:51,823
in the game, the friend.

313
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:59,367
He helps the player, but I was still not thinking about him being a focus of the game.

314
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:02,989
You will notice that this cut...

315
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:24,184
is the only moment where you can see the body in close-up.

316
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:27,547
And this picture is enough for the player

317
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:32,111
to project his face on the small-sized character.

318
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:38,416
As I say often, the real media is the player's memory

319
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:39,597
and imagination.

320
00:29:40,298 --> 00:29:44,541
So seeing once is enough to complete the mental picture

321
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:46,483
of the game universe in his mind.

322
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:12,717
Okay, I always loved the way they render laser beams in Star Wars movies,

323
00:30:13,657 --> 00:30:18,000
and they were very expressive visually with a lot of dynamism,

324
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,161
and I always wanted to see this in a game.

325
00:30:29,006 --> 00:30:34,149
Okay, here is how a nice idea can arise from constraints.

326
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:35,910
I was thinking more...

327
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,936
about the core gameplay.

328
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:43,318
Something around fighting, but also a means for protection.

329
00:30:44,618 --> 00:30:48,020
After the escape from jail, the initial idea

330
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,842
was to progress from one shelter to another

331
00:30:52,882 --> 00:30:56,204
to avoid shots fired by the guard.

332
00:30:56,364 --> 00:30:56,944
It was abundant.

333
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:06,951
because it was too complicated to manage the death.

334
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:12,173
In the end, the development of defense strategy

335
00:31:13,034 --> 00:31:17,076
brought me the concept of protective fields,

336
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:21,698
which are shelters generated by the player himself.

337
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:27,961
This creates very interesting gameplay combinations.

338
00:32:00,355 --> 00:32:06,657
which lead to a plasma ball, sorry, which lead to a plasma ball which is the third stage

339
00:32:06,818 --> 00:32:10,199
of weaponry, like a Swiss knife.

340
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,800
And we have this.

341
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,423
In retrospect, this is one aspect I'm very proud of,

342
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:35,505
because the player has to choose from different strategies.

343
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:38,967
The player can use a small shot immediately,

344
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:44,350
but without protection, or risk his life creating a shield,

345
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,172
and ultimately, even taking more time

346
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:52,455
to create plasma to destroy enemy shields or doors.

347
00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:57,611
So somehow, this became the building blocks

348
00:32:57,771 --> 00:32:59,732
to different types of gameplay.

349
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,376
After designing my weaponry, I needed

350
00:33:04,476 --> 00:33:08,480
to develop exploratory notions.

351
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,544
Everything up to this point was on a single level.

352
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:17,447
On a single level on the screen, I mean.

353
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:20,389
But I felt limited.

354
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,291
Having several stages.

355
00:33:23,987 --> 00:33:27,169
in a game screen would bring more tactics and puzzles.

356
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:32,171
But the difficulty was to create character animation

357
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:34,191
and collision on stairs.

358
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:37,653
How could I do this with little effort?

359
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:40,594
I was thinking of a real elevator,

360
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:42,355
but another idea came.

361
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:44,896
Why not create a kind of teleporter

362
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:49,558
to switch from level to level just

363
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:52,439
by drawing a few vertical polygons?

364
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:59,791
in Lester's color, I realized that I could create a very nice impression of motion.

365
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:02,132
Something that was inspired by

366
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:04,594
by Japanese

367
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:12,459
manga animation, in which we get an impression of high-speed movement just by stretching lines.

368
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,521
This is the end of the jail level, where Buddy and Lester are separated.

369
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:39,824
At this point, I realized that I couldn't let him go without finding him again.

370
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:42,244
I felt attached to him.

371
00:34:47,446 --> 00:34:51,907
Okay, I only did one third of the game.

372
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:53,608
And at this rhythm...

373
00:34:54,430 --> 00:35:00,075
I would have two more years of work, which was really depressing.

374
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:08,341
From that point, I decided to work more and to not get lost in details.

375
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:13,306
Some backgrounds were more flattened.

376
00:35:15,628 --> 00:35:22,854
So I got organized and created a set of graphic blocks I could reuse to create detailed

377
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:25,712
backgrounds fastened.

378
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:46,676
From that point, I focused more on puzzles, creating variations using the building blocks

379
00:35:47,256 --> 00:35:48,377
I had at my disposal.

380
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:54,321
and each time I was trying to bring a new idea.

381
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:00,408
The friend became the center of the story

382
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:04,072
with a succession of twists

383
00:36:04,853 --> 00:36:07,456
where Lester and his friend helped each other.

384
00:36:30,993 --> 00:36:37,175
I never wanted at the beginning to create a game about the relationship between two strangers,

385
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:40,937
but the improvisation led me naturally to this.

386
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:45,559
Producing is a source of inspiration in itself.

387
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:57,084
Then I extended the use of parallel action to the foreground.

388
00:36:57,844 --> 00:36:58,064
Here?

389
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:06,820
When the player leaves the jail, we can see the frame being chased by guards in the foreground.

390
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:14,984
This has the same effect as a close-up, but without breaking the player's activity.

391
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:37,557
On the first level, I discovered the pleasure of modulating the pacing.

392
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:40,719
But now, I was playing around with it.

393
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:49,705
For example, to modulate the pacing, I used laser beams to give different rhythms, enabling

394
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:55,428
me to modulate the tension, a little bit like music score.

395
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:03,000
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

396
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:36,274
Here is an animation with five friends.

397
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:40,656
The laser beam comes from the foreground,

398
00:38:41,496 --> 00:38:44,277
giving the impression of a raging battle.

399
00:38:56,323 --> 00:38:56,863
Ha, ha, ha.

400
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:00,865
OK.

401
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:02,726
Publishing.

402
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:11,061
It was time to see if a publisher would be interested in the game.

403
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:19,064
I met Delphine Software, who were interested, but I wanted to meet another publisher, which

404
00:39:19,184 --> 00:39:24,086
was in fact the French headquarter of Virgin Games.

405
00:39:26,787 --> 00:39:33,010
Here was a major fork during the creation of the game, the moment where another world

406
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,611
could have changed drastically.

407
00:39:37,468 --> 00:39:44,991
it could have become a point and click.

408
00:39:45,011 --> 00:39:50,294
I love point and click.

409
00:39:50,794 --> 00:39:54,656
And so the editorial director said,

410
00:39:55,276 --> 00:39:59,178
if you want to make it a hit, make it less difficult

411
00:39:59,478 --> 00:40:01,879
by transforming it to a point and click.

412
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,142
So it was the golden era of this kind of game.

413
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:09,445
And as always, being full of doubt,

414
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:12,167
he almost convinced me.

415
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:12,347
So.

416
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:30,233
Future Wars, the previous game I did, was a point-and-click.

417
00:40:30,754 --> 00:40:32,755
I love point-and-click, as I said.

418
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:36,177
However, I don't like doing things twice.

419
00:40:37,598 --> 00:40:41,440
And the effort to convert it would have been too huge.

420
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:46,203
Also, some friends who played the game really loved it.

421
00:40:46,923 --> 00:40:48,344
So I maintained my direction.

422
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:53,908
And finally.

423
00:40:54,594 --> 00:41:00,800
The game was published by Delphine Software, who were not an international publisher,

424
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:03,923
but were fully supportive of the creation.

425
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:11,190
They trusted their game creators and were not intrusive into the design process,

426
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:15,774
which was rare and extremely valuable.

427
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:30,491
time to think about the end. How would I conclude the game? I didn't know. And at this point,

428
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:42,698
I had an agreement for its release in November. I had done three quarters of the game. And

429
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:50,402
it was, yes, it was really the time to step back and review the game.

430
00:41:50,963 --> 00:41:56,604
the overall passing, how I wanted it to evolve to the end.

431
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:09,408
So, the idea was to envision the finished game so as to balance the later stage with the rest.

432
00:42:13,669 --> 00:42:18,270
I drew a curve of all major past events.

433
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,503
and activity for the player, and decided

434
00:42:22,563 --> 00:42:27,649
to play with contrasting situations and change

435
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:34,415
of pace, which lead to the arena scene,

436
00:42:34,716 --> 00:42:42,383
and which lead to an up and down rhythm.

437
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:43,465
So.

438
00:42:47,788 --> 00:42:54,250
And yes, the cover illustration, I have tales to tell about this.

439
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:59,351
Throughout my career, cover illustration

440
00:42:59,972 --> 00:43:05,133
has been a major issue and a huge source of disappointment.

441
00:43:05,973 --> 00:43:09,474
I always consider the cover as the continuity of a game.

442
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,735
And it's the first, as it is, the first bond

443
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,296
between it and the player.

444
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:22,833
the publishers of my previous games had the habit to impose artwork on me.

445
00:43:25,173 --> 00:43:30,435
Like this, or this, or even this.

446
00:43:33,115 --> 00:43:37,936
Well, those games were particularly bad, by the way.

447
00:43:40,177 --> 00:43:44,418
Over the years, I'd become passionate about illustration

448
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:46,398
to the point that...

449
00:43:47,512 --> 00:43:49,413
I actually wanted to become an illustrator.

450
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:58,918
So for another world, I didn't want to miss the opportunity of doing it myself.

451
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,941
Being published by Delphine Software was fortunate.

452
00:44:04,321 --> 00:44:06,843
They were fine for me to create the cover illustration.

453
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:08,824
But doing this...

454
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:18,009
while creating the game was really difficult as I was already under pressure to finish the game for Christmas.

455
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:23,650
It took me three weeks, but quite honestly, I didn't have.

456
00:44:33,973 --> 00:44:35,913
One of the big issues...

457
00:44:37,082 --> 00:44:40,922
for the first release in 1991 was the lack of playtest.

458
00:44:42,543 --> 00:44:46,723
Delphine Software were not doing a lot of playtesting

459
00:44:46,763 --> 00:44:47,244
at the time.

460
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:51,284
And we had only two test sessions.

461
00:44:52,865 --> 00:44:55,245
And that was for the beginning of the game only.

462
00:44:56,925 --> 00:45:01,006
I fixed some major issues, but the game was really unbalanced.

463
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:15,226
When Interplay became the US publisher, they did a lot of playtesting, and the game underwent

464
00:45:15,486 --> 00:45:16,387
a second polishing.

465
00:45:16,987 --> 00:45:22,211
I fixed a lot of bugs and removed some sources of frustration.

466
00:45:23,272 --> 00:45:31,377
However, they asked me to make the game longer, and some parts became more difficult.

467
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:41,446
OK.

468
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:46,328
Interplay wanted to replace the original music used

469
00:45:46,688 --> 00:45:51,051
on the Amiga version with new music for the Super Nintendo.

470
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:53,152
And I disagreed.

471
00:45:54,272 --> 00:45:57,514
This was a serious source of conflict

472
00:45:58,114 --> 00:46:00,536
as they were doing the porting for the game.

473
00:46:01,156 --> 00:46:04,118
And the situation drove me totally crazy.

474
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:08,640
The music matched so well the visuals.

475
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:09,901
This.

476
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:13,259
led to a big transatlantic fight by fax,

477
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,941
lasting several weeks.

478
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:22,422
And after exchanging a number of faxes,

479
00:46:22,442 --> 00:46:26,384
I decided I'd use a new strategy.

480
00:46:28,325 --> 00:46:33,367
This consisted in sending an infinite fax.

481
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:39,429
What an infinite fax.

482
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:48,272
It's a long strip of paper where the beginning is stuck to the end using an adhesive strip,

483
00:46:50,093 --> 00:47:05,785
such that it loops around the fax machine endlessly.

484
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:10,248
And of course, I sent it in the dead of night in Los Angeles.

485
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:20,256
So you could imagine their surprise when they arrived at work in the morning and found reams

486
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:26,606
of paper repeating the message, the message, keep the original intro music.

487
00:47:42,716 --> 00:47:43,416
This didn't help.

488
00:47:46,478 --> 00:47:53,102
They didn't change their mind until Delphine Software got involved and said that legally

489
00:47:53,802 --> 00:47:58,205
they had no right to impose their choice of music.

490
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:01,106
And the discussion was closed.

491
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,242
Having a game on console had its own constraints.

492
00:48:27,883 --> 00:48:29,603
One of these was censorship.

493
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:34,026
Another world could have ended up in a sex shop.

494
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,669
Yes, there is an extremely obscene feature in nudity.

495
00:48:39,229 --> 00:48:40,570
So you get the drift.

496
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:43,611
The alien women were totally naked.

497
00:48:46,873 --> 00:48:49,375
And here is the cause for concern.

498
00:48:52,201 --> 00:48:54,422
The butt crack was too explicit.

499
00:48:56,144 --> 00:49:02,528
So I considered using another infinite fax with the message,

500
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:05,029
keep the original crack on the alien ass.

501
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:11,594
However, the console manufacturer

502
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:12,975
gave me no choice.

503
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:16,357
I didn't send the fax.

504
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:28,263
So to limit the change, I had to remove only these three pixels to suggest a bathing suit.

505
00:49:41,827 --> 00:49:44,388
At the end of the development, I was exhausted.

506
00:49:45,168 --> 00:49:49,510
And this is probably the reason Lister was almost dying in the end.

507
00:49:55,153 --> 00:49:56,714
Thank you very much.

508
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,193
Okay.

509
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:18,973
So...

510
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:19,734
Thank you.

511
00:50:19,854 --> 00:50:19,914
And...

512
00:50:45,506 --> 00:50:49,568
We have seen the whole process from the origins to a finished product.

513
00:50:50,249 --> 00:50:53,550
How improvisation process was important in the creation of this game.

514
00:50:54,991 --> 00:51:00,854
And I didn't talk about the music and the sound because the timing was too short.

515
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:04,596
Well, the game has a...

516
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:13,141
lived on longer than I originally thought,

517
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:15,842
and has been released on many platforms.

518
00:51:16,442 --> 00:51:21,464
So I have a little surprise, as this is the 20th anniversary.

519
00:51:23,704 --> 00:51:27,085
The game will be ported to iPad.

520
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:27,766
So.

521
00:51:27,786 --> 00:51:27,886
Woo!

522
00:51:34,768 --> 00:51:34,888
Woo!

523
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:34,968
Woo!

524
00:51:34,988 --> 00:51:36,268
Thank you.

525
00:51:38,959 --> 00:51:42,120
There is a little prototype here.

526
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:50,504
And now, if you have any question, well,

527
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:56,747
I really want to answer to your question if you have.

528
00:51:56,767 --> 00:52:06,311
Thank you.

529
00:52:07,092 --> 00:52:07,912
Mario is coming.

530
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:13,679
to help me to answer.

531
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:17,780
He will translate your question in French.

532
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:19,960
If needed.

533
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,040
Yeah.

534
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,201
OK.

535
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:26,562
Do you have any question?

536
00:52:27,322 --> 00:52:27,842
I've got one.

537
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:28,702
Yes?

538
00:52:29,762 --> 00:52:30,402
Right in front of you.

539
00:52:32,723 --> 00:52:34,183
I'm Ryan from Untold Entertainment.

540
00:52:34,203 --> 00:52:35,703
And this was a really inspirational game.

541
00:52:35,904 --> 00:52:37,524
Your talk was awesome.

542
00:52:37,624 --> 00:52:38,344
This is awesome.

543
00:52:38,805 --> 00:52:43,729
So I understand you had no involvement in the sequel.

544
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:46,611
If it were up to you, would you have made a sequel?

545
00:52:46,651 --> 00:52:48,032
And if so, what would you have done

546
00:52:48,172 --> 00:52:49,233
with the story from that point?

547
00:52:49,253 --> 00:53:02,463
So you're talking about Art of the Alien, right?

548
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:11,047
I had a very short involvement.

549
00:53:11,948 --> 00:53:17,411
I was very little implied in this.

550
00:53:27,257 --> 00:53:31,720
I only gave the initial concept, which was to play again with a friend

551
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,102
and look at the game under another viewpoint.

552
00:53:48,104 --> 00:53:49,385
But beyond that, I wasn't...

553
00:53:49,485 --> 00:53:54,867
I was creating Heart of Darkness at that time, so I was quite busy.

554
00:53:54,907 --> 00:53:58,448
At that time, I was busy creating Heart of Darkness,

555
00:53:58,728 --> 00:54:02,870
and I remained rather distant from this sequel.

556
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:09,493
Hi, I speak French, so it will go pretty quickly.

557
00:54:09,573 --> 00:54:12,314
OK, I'll have to translate it into English afterwards.

558
00:54:14,206 --> 00:54:19,931
I would like to know what you think of the remake that has been made recently.

559
00:54:38,835 --> 00:54:40,076
It's on the web.

560
00:54:40,136 --> 00:54:44,980
Yes, I have been involved in it, yes.

561
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:56,910
So I think I'm happy with this.

562
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,390
Hi.

563
00:54:58,451 --> 00:55:01,914
So from what you said, it seems like the game

564
00:55:01,974 --> 00:55:05,296
was kind of your diary you wrote at the time.

565
00:55:05,537 --> 00:55:07,618
And how do you think the

566
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:13,444
game would change if you were to design the whole process from start to finish at the

567
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:17,867
beginning actually, you know, you kind of do it on the fly?

568
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:41,636
How do you think you will be?

569
00:55:44,939 --> 00:55:46,280
The game will be different.

570
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:48,001
Really different.

571
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:50,804
I think that typically...

572
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:54,507
...not to enter quickly into creation.

573
00:56:05,703 --> 00:56:07,884
wouldn't enter immediately in the creation.

574
00:56:07,904 --> 00:56:16,569
That means we're using a lot of the energy in theory and in designing.

575
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:44,165
But I think that it's a good thing to look for ideas while experimenting.

576
00:56:44,265 --> 00:56:49,749
And to want to freeze everything is dangerous.

577
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:51,370
Okay, thanks.

578
00:56:54,412 --> 00:57:02,557
Hi, I was wondering what other sci-fi inspirations you had or fantasy?

579
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:06,484
novels or movies that you were interested in when you were making the game?

580
00:57:06,504 --> 00:57:10,427
I've been influenced by comics

581
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:12,489
and especially by an artist called Richard Corbin

582
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:13,570
whose comics had an impact on me.

583
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:35,822
whose comics had really made an impression on me.

584
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:43,647
And more generally, all fantastic illustrations.

585
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:46,790
Michael Whelan.

586
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,391
Frank Frazetta, Don Makes.

587
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:50,252
Frazetta.

588
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:51,833
Bernie Wrightson.

589
00:57:52,314 --> 00:57:53,194
Bernie Wrightson.

590
00:57:56,117 --> 00:57:56,577
Okay.

591
00:57:59,199 --> 00:57:59,460
Yes.

592
00:58:00,621 --> 00:58:02,022
The main expression.

593
00:58:04,504 --> 00:58:04,864
Hello.

594
00:58:05,145 --> 00:58:05,705
Oh, hello.

595
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:07,727
You want to go?

596
00:58:08,307 --> 00:58:11,770
Could you please speak for just a moment about the sound effects creation?

597
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:12,170
Yes.

598
00:58:13,171 --> 00:58:18,556
The whole sound part arrives rather late.

599
00:58:27,249 --> 00:58:29,571
That all was done in the last six months.

600
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:35,495
It was easy enough and I approached it in a minimalist way.

601
00:58:35,515 --> 00:58:37,937
I just wanted the essential noises.

602
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:54,692
The more complicated part was the music.

603
00:58:55,092 --> 00:58:59,494
I had a clear vision of what I wanted in my head, but I couldn't translate it.

604
00:58:59,514 --> 00:59:02,495
So Jean-François Freitas, the composer,

605
00:59:02,515 --> 00:59:03,936
he iterated for six months.

606
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:30,749
He kept proposing different solutions regularly.

607
00:59:30,769 --> 00:59:34,652
And then came a moment when everything fell into place, crystallized.

608
00:59:44,507 --> 00:59:46,548
the introduction, for example, at the beginning of the game...

609
00:59:46,568 --> 00:59:48,670
the people who knew the introduction without saying it...

610
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,371
Yes, it completely changed the perception.

611
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:50,792
That's it.

612
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:51,332
I answered...

613
01:00:11,494 --> 01:00:12,134
At the fistrel?

614
01:00:12,994 --> 01:00:14,315
Did I answer your question?

615
01:00:14,535 --> 01:00:14,956
Or?

616
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:19,459
Yeah, make CS with the head.

617
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,180
Hello.

618
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,942
First, I just want to thank you for creating the game.

619
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:25,403
It is one of my favorite games of all time.

620
01:00:27,104 --> 01:00:28,304
A question was asked of you earlier

621
01:00:28,344 --> 01:00:29,345
about your inspirations.

622
01:00:29,365 --> 01:00:30,906
I want to kind of reverse that a bit.

623
01:00:30,946 --> 01:00:32,247
I know a number of games have been

624
01:00:32,287 --> 01:00:34,528
made after Another World that seem

625
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,470
to have drawn clear inspiration from it.

626
01:00:37,115 --> 01:00:41,417
Specifically, a lot of comparisons have been made between Another World and Flashback.

627
01:00:41,977 --> 01:00:49,000
And I was wondering if you had any thoughts about these comparisons, or if there are any other games you could think of that seem to have drawn inspiration from yours.

628
01:00:53,142 --> 01:00:54,963
Could you repeat your last sentence?

629
01:00:55,324 --> 01:00:55,624
Oh, sure.

630
01:00:57,204 --> 01:00:58,885
I was wondering if there were...

631
01:00:59,629 --> 01:01:02,172
In addition to Flashback, if you want to talk about that,

632
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:07,157
if there were any other games that you feel have kind of drawn inspiration from Another World,

633
01:01:07,337 --> 01:01:08,838
and any comments you might have about that.

634
01:01:09,018 --> 01:01:09,239
Ok.

635
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:15,104
Do you know of any other games that were inspired by Another World?

636
01:01:15,124 --> 01:01:16,045
What do you think about that?

637
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:29,530
I know that Iko was inspired by another one because Kumito... tell it.

638
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:29,710
Okay.

639
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:32,192
What I want to say is that...

640
01:01:37,824 --> 01:01:43,688
All I wanted to say was that different games were influenced by it, but I haven't really looked and identified it or listed them.

641
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:45,469
It's more the creators of the games that told me.

642
01:02:00,816 --> 01:02:08,941
And it was really a pleasure to see that this game could

643
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:10,162
influence other people.

644
01:02:12,403 --> 01:02:15,265
I never have thought of it at the start.

645
01:02:15,285 --> 01:02:17,166
Thank you.

646
01:02:18,006 --> 01:02:18,307
Hello.

647
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:21,228
First of all, amazing talk.

648
01:02:22,469 --> 01:02:24,831
Your game and just you as a person

649
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:27,192
is a great inspiration to myself and everyone in here, I'm sure.

650
01:02:28,393 --> 01:02:29,333
I was wondering your thoughts.

651
01:02:30,185 --> 01:02:33,147
on games as a form of artistic expression.

652
01:02:34,267 --> 01:02:37,029
Another World comes up a lot as an example of this,

653
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:40,091
how games can transcend the traditional.

654
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:41,292
Oh, you can't hear me too well?

655
01:02:42,673 --> 01:02:43,634
It gets really good.

656
01:02:43,674 --> 01:02:45,815
Could you come closer to that mic?

657
01:02:45,835 --> 01:02:51,519
I was just wondering your ideas on games

658
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,340
as a form of artistic expression.

659
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,221
Because Another World always comes up when

660
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:56,642
people talk about games as art.

661
01:02:56,662 --> 01:02:58,443
So I was wondering what you thought about that.

662
01:03:01,709 --> 01:03:05,752
So, what are your thoughts on the game as an inspiration in general?

663
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:10,876
Because every time, well, several times when we discuss the game,

664
01:03:11,336 --> 01:03:13,038
another world comes to mind.

665
01:03:13,058 --> 01:03:15,099
So, what are your thoughts?

666
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,060
I don't have that impression.

667
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,182
I don't have that impression.

668
01:03:19,202 --> 01:03:20,863
I don't have that impression.

669
01:03:20,943 --> 01:03:22,925
I don't have that impression.

670
01:03:24,226 --> 01:03:28,809
I don't have that impression that it's that important as an inspiration.

671
01:03:30,842 --> 01:03:38,106
I'm more focused on creation.

672
01:03:38,186 --> 01:03:43,310
I don't have that much to say about being an inspiration.

673
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:00,071
Hi, Eric.

674
01:04:00,151 --> 01:04:01,531
Thanks for the great talk here.

675
01:04:01,731 --> 01:04:02,691
Hi.

676
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,572
Can you tell us from your point of view

677
01:04:06,673 --> 01:04:09,173
which version you feel it's the best?

678
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:12,274
And if it will be the iPad version, please tell us.

679
01:04:16,095 --> 01:04:19,937
Well, the iPad version is not finished yet, so I don't know.

680
01:04:19,997 --> 01:04:22,858
But the version that was released,

681
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:41,376
five years ago, it was possible to play it in low resolution or with more enhanced graphics.

682
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:50,024
So I think it is the best version that has been released because before

683
01:04:51,524 --> 01:05:00,888
In the Amiga, a level was missing, and on the console, Super Nintendo, it was less...

684
01:05:02,209 --> 01:05:03,450
well, less...

685
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:05,151
moins maniable...

686
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:07,532
less playable...

687
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:10,113
Yeah, it was less manageable.

688
01:05:11,394 --> 01:05:11,694
So...

689
01:05:14,195 --> 01:05:20,179
But, yes, the iPad version looks really, really nice.

690
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:20,859
We'll see.

691
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:35,525
So, okay.

692
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:36,367
Okay.

693
01:05:37,168 --> 01:05:37,709
Thank you.

694
01:05:37,749 --> 01:05:38,630
Thank you very much.
