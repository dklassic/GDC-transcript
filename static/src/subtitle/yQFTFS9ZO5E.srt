1
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:09,358
Thank you all for coming here.

2
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:31,885
I know that there's a lot of other fantastic talks that are going on during this time slot, but the Cantina was something that was very near and dear to our developers and all the departments on our team, and we wanted to bring some of the insights and some of the learnings from that journey to you all, and hopefully you can bring some of your insights as to how you execute some of your robust narrative hub spaces back to us.

3
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:34,246
A couple of reminders before we dig in.

4
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:40,330
If you could please silence your noise makers, so your phones and air horns and kazoos.

5
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,454
Just hold that off until I guess our QA session that's going to be extended across the hall.

6
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:50,337
And there's also going to be a survey that is sent out after this via email.

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,780
All right.

8
00:00:55,001 --> 00:01:07,745
So, before we dig in to today's talk, we just wanted to give you a brief introduction to both of us, so you understand our background, our experience, and the perspectives and different angles that we hit this pretty complex problem at.

9
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,547
So I'm Cheyenne Poulani-Morin.

10
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,968
I'm a senior game writer on the Jedi team.

11
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,650
I've been in the game industry for about nine years.

12
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:25,797
I started off in the mobile and indie space before I moved into AAA, where I focused mostly on dynamic and state-based and non-linear narrative structure and storytelling.

13
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:36,385
That primed me pretty well to move on to the Jedi Fallen Order team, where I implemented our narrative hub spaces, which were much smaller in scale, mostly Mantis Landing hub pads,

14
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:50,046
And all of that pipeline and tech and approaches fed into what eventually was going to become our next evolution of our narrative hub spaces, which is the Cantina.

15
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:52,595
and I'll hand it off to Cole now.

16
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:53,756
Thank you, Cheyenne.

17
00:01:54,136 --> 00:01:55,336
Hi, I'm Cole Sweeney.

18
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,757
I'm a senior narrative designer at Bit Reactor right now, but I worked with Cheyenne on Survivor.

19
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:12,779
I did a bit of sliding around between narrative design and writing, but a lot of it was very hub-focused and making sure that the design and tech side of things was very hand-in-glove with the writing end of things.

20
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:20,701
And in this talk, I'm going to be focusing more on the design implementation pipeline side of the Cantina.

21
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:21,441
Thank you.

22
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:24,983
All right.

23
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:35,649
So we're going to be covering how we approached and tackled and executed all of this content for our state-based narrative hub space, Pyloon Saloon, which is our version of the cantina.

24
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:39,232
A brief roadmap before we dig in.

25
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:47,696
We're going to do an overview as to how we initially approached this larger fantasy of how do we deliver on a Star Wars cantina.

26
00:02:49,265 --> 00:03:00,193
Cole is then going to take us through how we mapped out and created some event targets to give us some guardrails and some goals for our writing room and for the rest of the team to rally around.

27
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:13,562
We're going to take a detour into the writing room process and talk about the types of topics and the ways in which we tried to get some specificity as well as match the broader tone of the game.

28
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:23,031
We're going to revisit our pipeline for a bit and talk about how we modified sort of in-flight based on how development was unfolding.

29
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:25,612
Then we're going to touch on DEI.

30
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:36,816
Inclusive storytelling was always a fundamental goal and tenet that we used to realize a really robust and wild and engaging cast for the Cantina.

31
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:42,138
But there were a lot of hurdles that came along with that ambitious goal, so we wanted to

32
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:54,307
take a brief detour and mention and call out some of those so that if you want to infuse your own spaces with inclusive storytelling, you'll have a little bit of a map to understand some of the pitfalls and some of the challenges.

33
00:03:55,088 --> 00:04:10,400
And then Cole is going to take us away with a final wrap-up where we talk about what we actually delivered and some of the ways in which maybe we would have done it differently and some of the targets that we maybe overwrote for, underwrote for, and how we might do it differently the second time.

34
00:04:15,094 --> 00:04:26,611
Alright, so for those of you who are unfamiliar with the Jedi franchise, we wanted to show a little bit of a primer in terms of the main gameplay experience and what the player really experiences most of the time.

35
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:31,618
So, in the Jedi franchise, it's a third-person action-adventure game.

36
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:38,821
It's heavily inspired by Soulsborne combat, as well as Metroidvania-inspired traversal and exploration.

37
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:53,686
So, the player is on the sticks quite a bit, they have a lot of agency to explore these worlds, and the narrative team had the challenge of also trying to balance out the darker tones of this specific chapter in galactic history.

38
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,143
It is one of the darkest periods in the Star Wars universe.

39
00:04:57,903 --> 00:05:06,125
You play as Cal Kestis, one of the last surviving Jedi, and the Empire is quickly closing in, and he's trying to find a home.

40
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:20,829
So, Star Wars itself as an IP has a lightheartedness that we also wanted to capture, but didn't fight against that broader sort of story goal of really bringing the player to these darker spaces.

41
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:33,705
All right, I think we got a good idea of what you can expect in the game.

42
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,407
So that brings us to the larger cantina fantasy.

43
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:48,429
When you think about Star Wars as just a broader universe, what are some of the things that come up in your mind?

44
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,780
Okay, well for us, the cantina was a big one.

45
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:10,711
The cantina that's featured in episode four has just left such a sort of cultural imprint in our imagination, and when we were thinking about how to evolve our narrative spaces, we felt that delivering on this fantasy would be a huge step in the right direction.

46
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:20,239
This led us to breaking down that fantasy into two different buckets, and that was our narrative pillars and our design pillars.

47
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:30,792
So starting with our narrative pillars, we pulled some of the exact language that we used in our original Cantina design doc that dated back to April of 2020.

48
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:49,597
We wanted to share this language because this is how we rallied a lot of resources and a lot of developers to become excited and willing to put in their energy, love, resources into making this goal a reality and delivering it to our players and to the best of our ability.

49
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:54,977
So number one, we wanted this space to house evolving tales.

50
00:06:55,037 --> 00:07:05,141
We wanted there to be meaningful narrative progression in individual character arcs, and we also wanted to reward the player for repeated engagement.

51
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,273
Number two, we wanted a diverse cast.

52
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:19,679
The original Cantina was filled with all sorts of aliens and humanoids and rogues and bounty hunters and everyone under the galactic sun.

53
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:28,864
And we felt that if we used inclusive storytelling and tried to align this with some of our DEI goals, that we would realize that to its fullest.

54
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:51,808
And finally, because the events of the main campaign bring the player to some pretty dark places, there's a lot of twists and turns and tragic losses, and we even have a more tragic flyback structure, we wanted to make sure that this was a narrative space that would be a welcome respite for Cal during his dark journey, as a kind of light in the dark.

55
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:57,405
That brings us to our design pillars.

56
00:07:58,506 --> 00:08:03,169
So just to mention, the narrative did not come necessarily before the design pillars.

57
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,431
They evolved very much in tandem, hand in hand.

58
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:07,752
But this is what it led to.

59
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,355
Number one, we wanted to reflect the world state.

60
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:18,240
So as the events unfolded in the main campaign, we wanted to make sure that this space was also evolving in step with it.

61
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:26,380
So every time the player comes back, we wanted to have updated, fresh content that felt like it was evolving along with Cal's journey.

62
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:34,683
Number two, we wanted this to be the primary hub space for various side content systems to be housed.

63
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:38,765
So the main planet that you're traversing in Jedi Survivor is Kobo.

64
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,207
It was one of our first semi-open world planets.

65
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:45,109
It is a sprawl of hidden and side and optional content.

66
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:51,512
And so we wanted to feed the player back into one space so they didn't feel like they're getting whiplashed just trying to check in on systems on different planets.

67
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:59,181
Number three, we wanted this space to grow over time and we wanted the player to be actively driving that.

68
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:06,566
And number four, we wanted to design the space so that the player was being routed through it as often as possible.

69
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:15,673
There was a lot of resources that went into all of these hub states and so we wanted to make sure that the player was visiting it and actually getting exposed to some of that content.

70
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:23,730
So, that's very ambitious high goals and all well and good, but what did we actually ship with?

71
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:32,617
So, Pilon's Saloon, which is our cantina, did indeed become the primary narrative hub for Jedi Survivor.

72
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:40,543
It has 18 distinct NPCs with their own conversations and storylines, and this is outside of our core Mantis cast.

73
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:46,608
They possess over 5,000 lines of fully recorded VO dialogue.

74
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:57,859
In addition, we also have 17 main, very distinct world states, and countless permutations layered on top of that to account for optional player engagement.

75
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:12,385
This also became the unified space for multiple narrative and side gameplay systems to intersect, and that included our bounty hunter system, fishing, gardening, hollow betting, rumors, and to some degree, even our legendary beast system.

76
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:23,460
So to demonstrate the evolution of this narrative hub space through the course of the game, we have these two GIFs.

77
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,521
One on the left is a very early visit into the cantina.

78
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,622
It's kind of a dilapidated dive at this point.

79
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:37,324
There's not too much narrative content that is available because the player hasn't tapped into any of these NPC relationships.

80
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:42,106
They haven't invested too much into either of the side content systems either.

81
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:54,275
we don't really see the aquarium in a really good state, and it's kind of more sparse in the types of interactions that are offered to the player.

82
00:10:55,496 --> 00:11:00,179
On the right, this is our cantina in a mid-game full swing state.

83
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,183
So a lot of these NPC relationships have been tapped.

84
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,324
You know a little bit about their background.

85
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:10,428
You may have invested in a lot of these side content systems.

86
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,990
An entire second floor of the cantina has opened.

87
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,432
You've recruited some optional NPCs out in the world.

88
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:18,994
And so we have the music system online.

89
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:22,636
And the aquarium is looking like a real aquarium now.

90
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:37,946
So now that we've talked about how we initially approached this and kind of broadly conceptualized the cantina, I'm going to hand it off to Cole to talk about how we mapped out and tried to plan this massive sprawl of content.

91
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:40,009
Thank you, Cheyenne.

92
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:46,231
So, yeah, I'm going to talk a little bit about how we set targets for all of the dialogue that we'd need.

93
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,552
And a lot of this came down to questions like, how much writing do we need?

94
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,213
What sort of writing do we need?

95
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:55,214
How do we apportion that content and how do we present it to the player?

96
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:59,076
And then how do we prioritize this massive bucket of content that we have?

97
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:05,898
We had a lot of different kinds of dialogue events from walking up to characters and initiating straightforward conversations to

98
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,664
eavesdropping and hearing ambient dialogues playing out in the background as you walk past.

99
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:19,536
And we wanted all of these to reflect the progression of the player, the progression of the main story, and also to reward repeated engagement with all of the side content here.

100
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:35,774
So just to sort of conceptualize for a moment what this problem looks like when we're looking at it, this sort of represents the rise and fall arc of the cantina, which is mapped onto the five-act structure that Cheyenne alluded to for the main story of the game.

101
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:45,441
So you have this sort of initial rise in the first three acts culminating in sort of a false victory and climax in the middle, and then you have these darker states at the end of the cantina.

102
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:56,224
What this meant for us was that in the early states the cantina was filling up, there was this sort of groundswell and the feeling of community as the player had more opportunity to rope in other NPCs to the space.

103
00:12:57,224 --> 00:13:11,128
There was this sort of Mardi Gras moment where we think we've ding-donged the witch that's dead the whole thing and then at the end it falls off, the jackboot of the empire descends and the cantina starts to thin out and we're left in this sort of somber reflective

104
00:13:15,372 --> 00:13:26,242
So when we're thinking about how is the player going to experience this content, one thing we could count on is that right at the beginning of the game, when they were first introduced to the cantina, we knew they had to visit the cantina twice.

105
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:30,906
And this was our opportunity to jam as much onboarding as possible into those visits.

106
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:32,435
of the game.

107
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,280
But from here, there's quite a lot of variance in the narrative experience.

108
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:53,343
So maybe our ideal player might have sort of sampled the cantina a few times throughout the game.

109
00:13:53,363 --> 00:14:00,565
They would have gotten some interesting pulse checks, and they could sort of chart this rise and fall of the cantina arc over the course of the game.

110
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,786
They might see it at one of the heightened states, and then

111
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:09,149
They might kind of see it during one of the emptying out states at the end, and it would sort of resonate with what's happening in the main plot.

112
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:10,069
That was the goal.

113
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:18,113
But, just as valid, and certainly just as possible, the player could visit as soon as they had to, and then as soon as they were free, never see it again.

114
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:21,755
And if they did, maybe they'd come back after they'd finished the main story.

115
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:26,678
Which is certainly a big departure in terms of the experience of that player.

116
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:35,163
And again, just as validly, we could have this piece of work right here who insists on visiting the cantina constantly throughout the game.

117
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:44,190
And we want to make sure as well that this person isn't turned off and hearing a lot of repeated lines and whatnot, but is rewarded for sort of taking this path throughout.

118
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,593
So again, there's quite a lot of divergence in the player experiences that we're designing for here.

119
00:14:51,218 --> 00:14:55,843
if you'll permit me to take a slight philosophical detour on this.

120
00:14:56,844 --> 00:15:05,614
A lot of the problems that come here are sort of the ways that we interpret the way that we should be writing these stories in very interactive spaces.

121
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:06,936
So sort of the

122
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:28,883
kind of father of what we understand as narrative theory and narratology was the old huckster called Aristotle who essentially said anything that doesn't, anything that you could take out of a story and the story is still there and still works doesn't belong in the story because a story is a unity and a story should be one thing and anything that it's not shouldn't be in the story.

123
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:35,585
That really doesn't hold in the interactive space because we don't really have the luxury of saying the player has to experience these things.

124
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,145
There are a lot of

125
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:39,826
bits of narrative content that can be taken or left at will.

126
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:48,572
So we have sort of this filler content or optional content that we need to conceptualize and that means kind of changing the way that we're thinking about writing this content.

127
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:54,155
Well, along comes Roland Barthes and says, hang on, I'm not so sure about this.

128
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:58,519
Actually, there are kind of a lot of ways, a lot of ways to interpret a story.

129
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:05,305
Sure, we're stacking all the words in order, but there are a lot of entrances and exits to the way that everyone encounters the story.

130
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:11,230
So really there's not one way that everyone is experiencing a story, but there are a lot of ways that the story is permuting throughout.

131
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:33,892
and this sort of explodes into a bunch of possibilities with more modern narratologists who are focusing on digital media like Janet Murray and Espen Arseth who are saying actually we can have structures like the rhizomatic structure, this root system of narrative content where you can loop back on yourself and go off in a direction, hit a dead end, come back and

132
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:46,154
Again, forgive me for jumping into all of this, but this is all sort of to say that we're in a sort of sloshy space when we have a very linear story happening on the main path, CALS, sort of main arc.

133
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:51,756
And then we have a very non-linear set of stories that are sort of supposed to be a reflection of that.

134
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:59,357
So in a way, we have to sort of balance between those two and try to provision for both ends of the spectrum here.

135
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:03,058
So to jump back towards the concrete end of things,

136
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:04,752
Let's take an example.

137
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:10,621
These are Dana and Grok, two of the characters in the cantina, who you can meet early on.

138
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:18,253
There are a couple of prospectors and treasure hunters who have come to Kobo, the planet on which the cantina is based, in search of treasure.

139
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:19,014
And these are

140
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:20,152
truly

141
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:35,933
Grok

142
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:59,946
ultimately perishes and pays the ultimate price for both of them when one of the jobs go awry and an imperial patrol takes them out.

143
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:07,370
And Dana is left in this sort of reflective space where she's stewing a bit in it, and it's not really clear whether she's learned the lesson or not.

144
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:16,455
So again, with our little lines, we can see it would be really nice if the player experienced this in sequence and they would get a sense of the entire story.

145
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:20,898
But it's entirely possible that they will skip the beginning, jump in at the middle, hit the end.

146
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:33,051
And of course, possible as well, that they could just hear the end of the conversation here, which the end of this arc would mean they'd never meet Grok, they don't really understand what's going on, and Dana's sad for no reason.

147
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:44,434
So some of the ways that we try to provision for these alternate paths would be, we wrote different on-ramp interactions depending on when in the story you first met Dana and Grok.

148
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:50,415
So if you met them at the beginning, you get sort of the standard introduction to them as a duo, and then you can follow their arc throughout.

149
00:18:50,775 --> 00:19:02,142
But if you meet them for the first time in the middle, we write a different dialogue where they get introduced, which onboards the players to all the facts that have happened in their arc beforehand, and then we can proceed with what's going to happen there.

150
00:19:02,802 --> 00:19:06,264
We can also leverage elements outside of just dialogue in the narrative space.

151
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,400
kind of

152
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:33,106
These are some of the ways that we were starting to conceptualize telling sort of linear plot arcs through a lot of the non-linear systems.

153
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:39,211
And again, all of this is kind of part and parcel in what it means to tell interactive stories.

154
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:41,713
So yeah, these were some of the questions we had.

155
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:49,580
So back to our standard question, how much writing do we need per state, per character, per dialogue type?

156
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:54,105
we found a lot of these could be sort of divided along two poles.

157
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,850
On the one end we had heavily state-based dialogue.

158
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:04,618
This dialogue was authored, it was sort of deterministic, it was going to be the same every time, and it focused on Cal's story.

159
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:09,724
So in the later parts of the game, Cal experiences a great personal tragedy

160
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:15,218
When you go back to the cantina, you want to see that reflected in the interactions Cal has in the space.

161
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:18,900
You don't want him to go and crack a joke and leave turtle rolling on the floor.

162
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:21,783
That would be a great discontinuity in the narrative.

163
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:24,164
So we're trying to avoid those kinds of moments.

164
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:28,148
On the other end of things, though, we have more engagement-based dialogue.

165
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:30,269
And this dialogue is evergreen.

166
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:33,171
We're not throwing it away once it's no longer relevant.

167
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:38,816
And it's more focused on the NPC stories, getting to learn more about

168
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:44,318
Moran the smuggler or getting to listen in on someone else's dialogue and learn a bit more about their life.

169
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:50,081
And these sort of play to some of the different fantasies that Cheyenne took us through very early on.

170
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:58,224
So on the one end of things we have our light in the dark story, we get to see Cal's story reflected through this space.

171
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:00,645
On the other end of things though we have that

172
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:10,153
of just being a fly on the wall in the Mos Eisley Cantina and seeing a bunch of wacky aliens doing their thing and getting to walk up to them and learn more about them.

173
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:15,458
As far as how we prioritized this content when presenting it to the player,

174
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:21,212
The ultimate approach we used was we prioritized state-specific content.

175
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:36,098
So if you've just gone out, finished a level out in the world, and ignited a giant space laser that's now shooting across the sky, it feels nice to go back to the cantina to walk up to someone and they ask you, what the heck is that big laser that's now shooting across the sky?

176
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:39,059
So we wanted that level of reflectivity.

177
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:44,161
But to reward repeated engagement, the evergreen content was lower priority, but

178
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:48,265
If you came back and you continued to listen, you would get through this content as well.

179
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:57,552
And this proved to be the main paradigm that we used, with a few exceptions, to sort of stratify the different types of content that we were presenting to the player.

180
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:06,819
Cheyenne's going to talk a bit more about how we broke down the game writing needs into these states and how we approached the writing itself.

181
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:14,124
But broadly, we broke the game down into five macro states, which roughly mapped onto the five acts of the main story.

182
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:16,783
And then we broke all of those down into substates.

183
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:25,028
And these were individual player visits where NPCs were standing in deterministic locations, or some of them were standing in random locations.

184
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:30,032
So this is, again, the main paradigm we used when thinking about this content.

185
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:35,195
So going back to the GIFs we presented earlier, the one on the left is macro state one.

186
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:38,157
The cantina is dilapidated and ramshackle.

187
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:40,038
And it doesn't look like much.

188
00:22:40,838 --> 00:22:43,640
And then in macro state three, the cantina in full swing.

189
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:55,493
We spawn a lot more random NPCs, we have a lot more ambient dialogue that we've written to keep it firing, and this all is in furtherance of selling that main arc of the cantina across the game.

190
00:22:56,634 --> 00:23:01,339
When we were looking at individual substates, some of the questions we were answering were

191
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:05,339
where is it most interesting for characters to stand in a given substate?

192
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:15,025
If they'd just been in a cut scene where they were interacting with each other, it'd be great to position them next to each other in the cantina so that if the player is interested, they can follow up on that relationship.

193
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:31,416
So for every substate in the game, we placed characters very specifically on the floor of the cantina and this gave us very accurate dialogue targets because we knew if we're gonna have these people standing next to each other, we might as well have them interact and we might as well write some ambient dialogue for them to share.

194
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:40,709
One of the other main elements and probably the final thing I'm going to hit on the dialogue end of things would be how we conceptualized these character arcs.

195
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:51,197
It was ultimately pretty tricky to string a lot of these character arcs in a very linear sequence when the player can be encountering the cantina in a very non-linear way.

196
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:58,302
So one of the ways that we simplified the work on our end was we reduced these into what we called inflection buckets.

197
00:23:58,923 --> 00:24:01,225
So probably best illustrated by example.

198
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:07,111
So Moran, again, is this very frosty smuggler who you meet early on.

199
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:10,234
And when you first meet him, he's very critical.

200
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:12,096
He doesn't really want anything to do with you.

201
00:24:13,617 --> 00:24:21,084
But as you chisel through that lovable piece of granite, you eventually get him to warm up to you, and this sort of unlikely friendship forms.

202
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:21,685
So

203
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:36,035
Instead of having a completely linear set of conversations that take Moran from beginning to end there, we had one bucket of conversations where Moran doesn't like you, we had a second bucket where Moran does like you, and they were connected by an inflection event.

204
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:40,338
One sort of high value conversation where there's a very perceptible turn

205
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:43,319
and the state of affairs between these two characters change.

206
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:53,984
So we were able to write a lot of different content without tracking a whole lot of the narrative overhead that would come with very specifically trying to plot these out in a non-linear way.

207
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:59,927
So, for instance, we could also then include state-specific dialogue in these two buckets.

208
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:08,951
So Moran can now not like you, and there could be a giant laser in the sky, and we can write a conversation for that that doesn't have to adhere to a strict narrative sequence.

209
00:25:09,912 --> 00:25:14,174
We used this inflection arc planning for a lot of the side characters in the cantina.

210
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:26,799
For instance, Mosey was the owner of the Legendary Beasts system, so instead of rewarding repeated engagement with Mosey, we were rewarding increased engagement with the system.

211
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:31,221
The more Legendary Beasts you hunted, the further you got in Mosey's inflection arc.

212
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:39,903
And similarly with Cage, our hard-boiled bounty hunter, the more bounties you hunted, the more you learned about Cage as you went back and interacted with her.

213
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:54,746
So I'm going to hand the mic back to Cheyenne now, proverbially, and then we're going to look at more about the writing process specifically and how we approached all these buckets of content which we've now sort of loosely outlined and how we started to fill them in.

214
00:25:57,318 --> 00:25:57,959
Thank you, Cole.

215
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:03,467
So a brief overview of what our writing room looks like on the Jedi team.

216
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:12,561
For Survivor, we had anywhere between three to six writers who were expected to write in any given character voice for the Cantina for any given world state.

217
00:26:13,897 --> 00:26:19,882
This evolved into more of a TV writing room style of review and table reads.

218
00:26:21,444 --> 00:26:24,927
And this gave us the following routine.

219
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:36,437
First, we would brainstorm in the room and we would break the larger macro state and then move into more specific, more granular topics with character breaking.

220
00:26:36,497 --> 00:26:39,620
So how are those characters actually responding to these world events?

221
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:49,756
We would then assign out some conversations to each of the writers, take a few days to draft them, and then we'd throw them back at the writing room for a table read.

222
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:57,245
We were all expected to try on every voice, even the ones that we were not so comfortable with, had to experiment with a lot of accents.

223
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:59,566
to really make it believable and punchy.

224
00:27:00,226 --> 00:27:04,929
And then we would get some either live edits or we would get some feedback from our writers.

225
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,751
Sometimes we would change the topic entirely.

226
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:13,654
And we would keep going with this process, rinse and repeat until the conversation was to a ship quality.

227
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:24,021
All right, we're gonna walk you through a mini exercise in terms of how we populated these buckets and the types of conversation topics that usually fell into these.

228
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:29,061
So, the first step was situating the room with macro state brainstorming.

229
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:36,465
So, we're looking at the broader world events, like a laser going off in the sky, or maybe you just took down the leader of the Bedlam Raiders.

230
00:27:37,946 --> 00:27:50,974
This also roughly mapped onto our five acts, so if Cal is feeling hopeful, that's gonna be kind of the tonal backdrop, or if Cal just experienced tragedy, then that's also going to dictate some of these conversation topics.

231
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:57,587
This is more of our evergreen topic, bucket of topics, because they are sub-state agnostic.

232
00:27:57,627 --> 00:28:00,129
They can play throughout a range of different sub-states.

233
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:07,584
So some of the usual topics that we would draw on would be individual NPC backstories.

234
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:11,848
So this would be along the lines of when did Grease and Monk link up?

235
00:28:12,668 --> 00:28:15,190
What's the story behind them naming it Pilon Saloon?

236
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:26,300
When did the town matriarch, Doma, get into Kobo and any backstories that she might have of events that have occurred over the last 50 years since she's been on planet.

237
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:30,570
We also fit in some relevant slice of life topics.

238
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:35,434
So this is like a day in the life, a day in the ordinary life of one of our wacky characters.

239
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:37,096
Like what was Tergal up to today?

240
00:28:38,397 --> 00:28:41,419
How has his priorities changed based on some world events?

241
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,542
That was a nice kind of filler flavor kind of topic.

242
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:51,259
And then we also used this bucket for calling out environmental or feature improvements.

243
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:54,700
So there's a huge difference between macro state one and two.

244
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,001
The second floor of the cantina has opened up.

245
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:02,142
And for some of the resident patrons who've been here for a while, that's a huge seismic change.

246
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:03,703
And so they're going to call that out for the player.

247
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:08,064
And it's also used to point the player up to these newly accessible features.

248
00:29:10,888 --> 00:29:22,993
So once we had that broader tone, we would add some reactivity and specificity by breaking down the substates and doing less of this evergreen content and more of this state-based content.

249
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,504
This led to the following topics.

250
00:29:27,944 --> 00:29:30,704
Things like NPC reactions to Critical Path updates.

251
00:29:31,184 --> 00:29:40,126
If you just took down Ravus, a character like Tergal who has been enmeshed and entangled with that faction for a while is going to have a very personal reaction to that update.

252
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:47,048
This also doubled as a way to remind the player of their current objectives and some newly opened content.

253
00:29:49,352 --> 00:30:00,567
Whenever a new Cantina NPC would move into the space, or a NPC relationship hit an inflection, we also use this bucket to call that out and prioritize those changes in relationships.

254
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:05,073
Cage is a really good example of someone that we use as sort of a spokesperson.

255
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:08,214
for calling out new NPCs in the space.

256
00:30:08,735 --> 00:30:21,277
As a bounty hunter who has her eye on the door constantly, she's checking out whoever's moving into the space and determining whether or not they are someone she can manipulate, if they're a threat, if they could be a potential ally, what have you.

257
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:33,119
And finally, we also used this bucket to update the player on any side systems that have evolved and to remind them of any rumors that will direct them back out into the world.

258
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:41,722
A good example of this is Scuba Steve will have a high priority conversation if you just collected enough fish and you've updated the aquarium.

259
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,071
So this brings us to one of my favorite parts of the talk.

260
00:30:47,632 --> 00:31:05,042
We wanted to demo what our table read process is like and how some of these characters evolved from an earlier state and an earlier understanding that the room had of these characters and how further in the game they have a little more depth and nuance and maybe a little more personal stake in the events of the game.

261
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,284
So we're gonna do a live table read.

262
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,006
I will be playing Moran and Cole will be playing Turgle.

263
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:12,647
Very apologetically.

264
00:31:14,943 --> 00:31:15,563
Hey, Moran.

265
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:17,123
Oh, please, no.

266
00:31:17,364 --> 00:31:19,804
You wouldn't turn down the opportunity of a lifetime, would you?

267
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:20,444
Stop it.

268
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:24,205
Because I have a business proposition that will make your eye stems spin.

269
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,446
Let me make this eminently clear.

270
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:31,947
I have, in my time, struck deals with every flavor of unsavory scamp you can imagine.

271
00:31:32,147 --> 00:31:32,487
Uh-huh.

272
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:36,908
I have funded ventures so risky they would make a hot skip breakfast.

273
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:37,308
Uh-huh.

274
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:41,969
But I would sooner feed my credits to a monkey lizard than go into business with the likes of you.

275
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,810
with a small one-time investment.

276
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,151
No.

277
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:54,673
So that's one of our early, almost like characters of each of these characters, very quintessential Tergal, quintessential Moran.

278
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:58,214
This could probably play during a range of early substates and macrostates.

279
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:03,695
And now we're going to move on to a conversation that takes place more in the middle of the game.

280
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:08,696
And Cole will be reprising Tergal, and I will be playing Kal.

281
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,057
Kal, is it true?

282
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:12,417
Is Ravus really gone?

283
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:14,547
Yeah, you relieved?

284
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:15,947
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

285
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,168
But I'm actually sad.

286
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,649
It almost feels like I killed him.

287
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,129
He did try to kill you.

288
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:21,430
Oh yeah, a few times.

289
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,591
But none of this would have happened if I wasn't trying to make a quick credit.

290
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:25,512
I'm a murderer.

291
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:30,434
Hey monk, what's it take for an amphipod with blood on his hands to get some service around here?

292
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:57,337
So these two conversations, again, they demo a simpler caricature version of Tergal, and then later in the game, once you've had enough time and you've been exposed to the dynamics of the cantina and how some of these NPCs relate to the broader game world, we turn Tergal, who was initially just an agent of chaos up to irrelevant antics, into someone who has a stake into what Cal's doing and how he's affecting the world.

293
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:04,471
So I'm going to wrap up this segment with a little bit of writing room etiquette that we landed on.

294
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:10,053
First of all, the writing room requires a lot of mutual trust and willingness.

295
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:13,874
We do these table reads, and we have a lot of fun and silliness with it.

296
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:20,257
But we also need to accept that your fellow writers start off with an initial intent.

297
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:23,098
And if it's not landing for you, you've got to build off of it.

298
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:29,761
And you need to use the classic improv rule of, yes, I accept the premise, and let's build on it.

299
00:33:30,703 --> 00:33:50,143
this kind of leads into the second rule which is you can't be precious with initial drafts because we had a really quick turnaround and we would often throw our first drafts and some really wild swings at the room and sometimes it was a really good initial idea but it wasn't quite landing in the way that we wanted the player to experience this character

300
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:52,084
So that's more of like a yes but.

301
00:33:52,104 --> 00:34:01,352
So accept the initial premise, but be willing to pivot and shift directions based on writing room feedback so that we deliver the best representation of this character.

302
00:34:02,613 --> 00:34:05,355
And lastly, you gotta have fun and be silly.

303
00:34:05,715 --> 00:34:10,419
And another reason why we did those table reads, we did those weekly, sometimes twice a week.

304
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,683
And that was maybe the highlights of that project, at least in my experience.

305
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:22,236
I'm gonna hand it back to Cole to talk about how our pipeline kind of changed along the way.

306
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:24,296
Awesome.

307
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:32,204
Yeah, so I'm going to take us a bit more into some of the specifics of the ways that our narrative decisions were informed by our pipeline.

308
00:34:33,025 --> 00:34:40,131
And I think that ultimately this was not sort of a one directional process where the narrative was conceived, written and implemented and then it was done.

309
00:34:40,552 --> 00:34:43,354
It was being implemented as we were writing it.

310
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:49,220
So we got a lot of feedback over the course of the writing process that allowed us to sort of steer the ship very slowly

311
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,162
and lay track in front of the train, and we could make some corrections as we were going.

312
00:34:53,782 --> 00:34:58,044
And so ultimately the pipeline played a lot into the decisions we were making as a narrative team.

313
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:08,889
So at a very high level, the four main tools that went into the writing process were Miro, the virtual whiteboard tool that you saw earlier, WriterDuet, our screenwriting software.

314
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:18,913
We used a dialog matrix in Google Sheets, and then we had our content management system, a tool called Heckle, which certainly deserves its own talk, but for right now,

315
00:35:19,273 --> 00:35:25,417
essentially takes all of the, all of the dialogue lines, hooks them up to Y's events, we tag them up and it sends it into the engine.

316
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:36,905
So, as far as how the process, as we moved through this went, um, at first we would brainstorm these seeding charts in Miro and we would send that information into the dialogue matrix

317
00:35:37,947 --> 00:35:49,031
The matrix would use that information for a given state to calculate, okay, we have these character adjacencies, you know, Turgle's standing next to Moran in this state, so we need to write an ambient between them.

318
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:55,073
We wanted to have one conversation for every character for every substate, okay, then we need 18 different conversations.

319
00:35:55,393 --> 00:36:07,203
and it would generate a blank template which we would send back into WriterDuet and this ensured that we weren't constantly cross checking with the spreadsheet but we knew we were going to hit our baseline targets if we just filled in all the blank events in the WriterDuet script.

320
00:36:08,564 --> 00:36:16,311
On the WriterDuet end of things we would take these conversation ideas that we've been brainstorming in Miro and start to drill down into the actual language

321
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:26,901
do voice explorations and then ultimately arrive at the dialogue events that we would use in the game and we would send them into the database where again we would tag them up and they'd be ready to go.

322
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:35,969
Some of the information though would flow back the other way so for instance every time we made a push into the database and got all the content tagged up

323
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:43,473
It would update the dialogue matrix, which had a big metrics readout showing what we'd written versus what we said we were going to write.

324
00:36:43,593 --> 00:36:50,677
So there would be big red blocks all over the place if we hadn't written something that we had established and set out to do in our dialogue targets.

325
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:58,361
Another reason this was valuable is because ultimately these dialogue targets weren't meant to be high watermarks, what we want the final product to be.

326
00:36:58,581 --> 00:37:00,042
They were just meant to be baselines.

327
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:11,403
and then ultimately the goal was to empower the writers to, if they had a great idea for a certain conversation in a certain substate, the system would be capable of taking those facts and putting them into the game.

328
00:37:12,124 --> 00:37:23,034
But since the writing process was a little more diffuse like that, it was very useful to have a metrics tool where we could see, oh, we're kind of overwriting a lot in this substate, or shoot, this character doesn't have

329
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:27,062
Any conversation dialogue, we need to fix that.

330
00:37:27,082 --> 00:37:28,505
Something might be broken, we overlooked it.

331
00:37:29,187 --> 00:37:31,632
So that was just a very useful tool as we were steering the ship.

332
00:37:32,762 --> 00:37:40,528
And then finally, this allowed us to change our planning on the Miro end of things, and that completes the cycle.

333
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:57,061
Some of the decisions that arose from this process would be, we realized that one of our characters had no ambient dialogue in the entire game, and that made us realize, oh shoot, Tulok, our soothsayer, isn't actually standing next to anyone, she isn't standing close enough to anyone over the course of the game, so we were able to

334
00:37:57,501 --> 00:38:04,586
move some characters over to her in given substates so that they can have fun little interactions and we get to showcase some more of the character.

335
00:38:05,822 --> 00:38:10,967
And so that's just an example of how the pipeline here really was a critical feedback tool.

336
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:19,355
And of course, it must be said, there is no feedback quite like jumping into the engine and playing it on the sticks and seeing how it feels.

337
00:38:19,395 --> 00:38:22,638
And that was also a great tool that we used to shape the writing process.

338
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:29,385
I'm going to hand it back to Cheyenne now, and she's going to take us through some of our inclusive storytelling approaches in the cantina.

339
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:39,588
All right, so inclusive storytelling in DEI was always a fundamental premise and goal that we had for the Cantina.

340
00:38:40,368 --> 00:38:54,273
We felt that that was going to deliver the most robust Cantina experience, and we wanted to make sure that that was supported not only by our character concepts and our voice explorations, but also very intentional player interaction models.

341
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:14,406
So you'll see a lineup of many of our underrepresented identities who display a range of different voices, visual representations, and each of them also have pretty distinct and specific player interaction models.

342
00:39:16,014 --> 00:39:34,078
Just a caveat, this talk isn't going to cover why DEI is so important or how to do it perfectly, but it was a big problem that we approached and there's a lot of production hurdles and challenges in the pipeline in terms of scoping and getting the appropriate resources to authentically represent these identities.

343
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:44,040
And so we wanted to flag some of those learnings for you so that you can infuse your own spaces with some inclusive storytelling and hopefully bring those learnings back to us in a future GDC talk.

344
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:51,854
All right, we're gonna first step through the standard character creation pipeline.

345
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:55,436
For those of you who've been in Gave Dents for a while, this is probably pretty familiar.

346
00:39:56,737 --> 00:39:59,699
First, art and writing would collaborate and pitch a concept.

347
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,842
Lots of back and forth, really just trying to explore voices and how that would best be represented visually.

348
00:40:06,723 --> 00:40:13,268
After we landed on a concept that we were really satisfied with, the writing room would then hone in on the voice and create some casting sides.

349
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:22,742
These are some quintessential character scenes where we get to see who they really are and how they might perform.

350
00:40:24,443 --> 00:40:29,424
Once we get the auditions back, we'd have key stakeholders weigh in and choose their favorite performers.

351
00:40:30,284 --> 00:40:34,806
This usually involved more directors and leads and people who are gonna be very hands-on with that character.

352
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:39,547
And then we'd hand it off for the rest of the in-game translation pipeline.

353
00:40:41,823 --> 00:40:46,906
And to contrast this, the DEI casting pipeline had a few more steps that we had to build into the process.

354
00:40:47,726 --> 00:40:50,948
The first one being we did a lot more preliminary DEI research.

355
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:56,792
So this involves consulting internal ERGs, employee research groups,

356
00:40:57,512 --> 00:41:00,733
This involved looking at internal DEI primers.

357
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:12,998
It also involved polling our internal dev team to see if any individuals were willing to share any experience that was relevant or wanted to weigh in on this kind of representation.

358
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:19,600
This is also the step where if we felt that we were really treading in unknown waters, we could bring in a cultural consultant.

359
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:23,987
Then we'd go into the art and writing concepts phase.

360
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:29,736
There's a few more rounds of back and forth, and we may have the key stakeholders start to weigh in even at this early stage.

361
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:34,713
Then we would produce a enhanced casting side.

362
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:51,978
So the writing room wanted to be a lot more clear on what this character's backstory was about, what their voice was like, and give at least two scenarios or two casting sides to make sure that we were getting a couple of different performances from each of the potential candidates who might eventually play this role.

363
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:57,746
This led into potentially additional casting rounds.

364
00:41:57,786 --> 00:42:01,607
I think for most of our DEI characters, we had at least two rounds of casting.

365
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:04,647
And that's more of an industry-wide problem.

366
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:08,528
There's a pretty limited pool of underrepresented talent.

367
00:42:08,808 --> 00:42:16,650
And so make sure that you may have to build in some extra time to make sure that you're casting a broad net and getting as many performers as possible.

368
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:36,298
Then we would do an enhanced stakeholder weigh-in, so anybody who was called out during that preliminary research round, any internal devs who wanted to share their experience and weigh in gets to be a part of this step, and we have a slightly more diverse council who is evaluating our potential performers.

369
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:48,003
Then we would do in-game translation as usual, and we built in one extra step where we would do additional review, where we'd set up internal Slack channels and get some more team feedback.

370
00:42:51,454 --> 00:42:55,983
All right, so that is how we landed on the concept and the initial explorations for these characters.

371
00:42:56,364 --> 00:43:01,415
But we also wanted to support their representation with very intentional design interactions.

372
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:13,525
So we are going to walk through a couple of different characters who represent a fully inclusive story, Winnie and Zig on one side, and Ash, who is more of a light inclusive story.

373
00:43:14,146 --> 00:43:32,198
And what I mean by these terms is we had a fantastic race and sexuality expert come in and talk to Respawn internally and brought us these terms to describe how much of that character's identity is playing a primary role and really being exposed to the player and how much that's actually driving their story.

374
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:34,848
So we'll start with Winnie and Zig.

375
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:39,630
Winnie and Zig represent a lovely, adorable, queer romance.

376
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:55,121
And the way that we approached this is we were faced with the problem of wanting to expose the player to their content, but not making the player feel like they were playing matchmaker, and that they were controlling this romance and how it unfolded.

377
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:58,423
So we employed a state-based inflection arc.

378
00:43:59,224 --> 00:44:02,766
So what that means is the player has the opportunity to recruit Winnie early,

379
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:10,572
earlier on in the game in an earlier macro state, and then she'll come back to the cantina and their romance will start to unfold.

380
00:44:11,372 --> 00:44:20,318
But if the player doesn't recruit Winnie early at a certain state, Winnie will find her way into the cantina and their romance is still going to play out.

381
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:30,885
So for players who are really invested in that kind of storyline, they get exposure to some earlier content, but regardless, these characters are still going to have this romance play out.

382
00:44:32,148 --> 00:44:41,890
On the other hand, Ash, we felt as a room was a character, even though they were non-binary, the main feature we wanted to focus on is their profession and their craft.

383
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:49,931
They are the galactic producer, music person, with their little DJ droid, and that's what we wanted to focus on.

384
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:52,492
And so we employed a system-based arc.

385
00:44:52,712 --> 00:44:59,373
So if the player isn't interacting and not investing in this additional side content, they might not get a lot of their story.

386
00:45:03,171 --> 00:45:08,274
All right, so we're just gonna recap on some of the takeaways for building in inclusive storytelling into your pipeline.

387
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,335
You gotta plan a lot of time.

388
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:25,985
There's a lot of pre-work that goes into addressing potential biases, and there are gonna be some hiccups along the way that you may not have expected, like having a limited casting pool and requesting extra rounds of casting and casting that broader net.

389
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:37,162
Try to build in as many sources of feedback as possible, so ERGs, focus groups, in-house devs, and build those in early and often throughout the character creation pipeline.

390
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:43,869
And then finally, explore a range of light to fully inclusive character storylines.

391
00:45:44,469 --> 00:46:02,416
If a character is only obsessed with this one aspect of their identity, even though it's quite critical, it could come off as sort of one note and just try to experiment with a whole range of characters who have different conflicts on their mind and different involvements and want to show different facets of themselves to the player.

392
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:10,388
And now I'm going to hand it back to Cole to wrap us up with some key Cantina takeaways.

393
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:11,329
Awesome.

394
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:12,010
Thank you, Cheyenne.

395
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:21,820
So yeah, I'm just going to speak a little bit to some of the main takeaways, especially on the design end of things from how this sort of the way that we approached and apportioned all of this content.

396
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:25,004
how it all turned out from our perspective.

397
00:46:25,885 --> 00:46:33,110
So ultimately, we had talked about these sort of two poles between the engagement-based dialogue and the state-based dialogue.

398
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,433
And at the end of the day, we ended up moving more towards the state-based end of things.

399
00:46:37,473 --> 00:46:42,937
So we filled in our macro states and sub-states with dialogue that reflected what Cal was doing throughout the story.

400
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:52,920
and then later in the process we went in and filled in a lot of the additional characters and worked to reward repeated engagement.

401
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:57,022
So the majority of our content was state specific and

402
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:09,205
Because it's state-specific, if you'll recall, that poor red line player who ignores the cantina for the entire game, that means we have hundreds of dialogue events that are very missable, including some critical ones for side characters.

403
00:47:10,206 --> 00:47:17,729
And telemetry indicated that 70% of our players continued completing side content after the story, and the majority of those for multiple hours.

404
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:27,013
So we had a lot of players who did leave the cantina for the end, and that meant that a lot of the writing that we put into the state-based end of things wasn't as visible for them.

405
00:47:28,074 --> 00:47:32,076
So, ultimately, the takeaway here is not just to write less generally.

406
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:50,483
The takeaway would just be to keep your eye on the ball as far as how the player is going to experience the content and try to, through playtesting and as much data as you can get, figure out where players are spending the most time and then put a proportional amount of effort into building those areas out.

407
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:56,059
Another aspect of the game was we wrote a ton of characters.

408
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,908
Eighteen was a lot of characters to be just completely optional, but to have their own stories in the cantina.

409
00:48:03,003 --> 00:48:16,229
Ultimately, this landed well with a lot of people and we've definitely, we've had instances of pretty much every one of those 18 players has someone who's online saying that's their favorite character, who's that character's number one fan.

410
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:29,055
So that reflected the success of our diversity goals and a lot of the inclusive storytelling approaches that we took because that meant that a lot of people saw themselves reflected in the content and people were able to

411
00:48:29,455 --> 00:48:32,282
find things to engage with across the spectrum of characters.

412
00:48:33,304 --> 00:48:33,745
That said...

413
00:48:34,488 --> 00:48:41,990
we ultimately kind of had to sacrifice some depth for breadth at this point, because with 18 characters, you definitely have to cover a lot of ground there.

414
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:57,014
And if we had been a little bit sharper with our unique selling points for each of those characters, there were opportunities to maybe combine characters or cut characters that ultimately weren't adding something new to the roster, and then spend that extra scope to deepen the characters who are already there.

415
00:48:57,654 --> 00:49:00,855
So ultimately, I think while a lot of these characters landed really well,

416
00:49:02,396 --> 00:49:05,780
the goal in the future would be to continue refining the balancing act here.

417
00:49:07,522 --> 00:49:08,403
And I'll hand it back to Cheyenne.

418
00:49:09,723 --> 00:49:12,384
Yeah, so we just wanted to wrap up with some credits.

419
00:49:13,305 --> 00:49:23,329
The Cantina was one of the features that we started digging into as a development team and collaborating from the earliest stages of the production on Jedi Survivor.

420
00:49:23,529 --> 00:49:32,533
And so we wanted to do some special call-outs for all of the folks and departments who poured their heart and soul into making this an interdisciplinary reality.

421
00:49:32,773 --> 00:49:34,874
So big thanks to all of the writing room.

422
00:49:35,954 --> 00:49:39,516
Narrative and design teams were in step with us all along the way.

423
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:46,579
Concept art drove so many of these like wacky initial ideas that the writing room just went wild with.

424
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,860
Animation brought it all to life.

425
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,021
Environment art, audio, music, tech design, code, everyone.

426
00:49:53,161 --> 00:50:03,426
UI, UX, lighting, QA, and of course our partners at Lucasfilm really helped us evaluate our characters and how we were adequately representing some of these DEI goals.

427
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:19,127
It looks like we've got about nine minutes for questions if anyone has any.

428
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:25,824
Hi, that was a fantastic talk, thank you.

429
00:50:27,145 --> 00:50:28,826
Thank you for such an incredible game.

430
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:49,740
I'm very curious, since your work involved so many different teams, like mission design with what side content you introduce, narrative, ambient tech design, do you have any advice for collaborating with basically every single team on the game?

431
00:50:51,983 --> 00:51:00,525
Yeah, so the question is, given that this is such an interdisciplinary effort, do we have any advice for cross-department collaboration?

432
00:51:00,545 --> 00:51:03,765
Do you want to start?

433
00:51:03,785 --> 00:51:04,886
Sure, absolutely.

434
00:51:05,266 --> 00:51:17,548
And I think one of the things that Cheyenne mentioned was that so many of the great ideas for this idiosyncratic rogues gallery of characters came from different places on the team and there were

435
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:22,909
There were several pieces of concept art that everyone on the team latched onto originally.

436
00:51:23,229 --> 00:51:26,230
It's like, okay, we have to write that and figure out who that is.

437
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:36,932
I think probably the planning and dialogue targets end of the spectrum was where we tried to build in a lot of those supports for other departments.

438
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:41,973
So trying to interface with design to figure out what are rumors exactly going to look like.

439
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:47,555
this character needs to have four rumors to correspond with four pieces of side content they need to send you to.

440
00:51:47,655 --> 00:51:52,877
So we need to ensure that we've got room for all of that in their dialogue targets and that sort of thing.

441
00:51:53,457 --> 00:52:09,102
So this is probably a circular answer to the question, but just like the communication and kind of trying to front load as much of that as possible so that when it comes time to turn the crank on the content mill, you know you're going in the right direction and you're not leaving a bunch of grass unwatered.

442
00:52:12,947 --> 00:52:26,292
And just to add to that, even though we dove into how the writing room would kind of pitch some of these concepts and start with some voice explorations, a lot of these character concepts originated with concept or someone else on the team who just had a wild pitch for a character.

443
00:52:26,872 --> 00:52:30,874
And so it just took a lot of willingness and a lot of conversation and communication.

444
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:35,657
between the writing team and whoever is pitching that concept to really realize that.

445
00:52:36,337 --> 00:52:46,124
I remember that our first batch of characters came from concept, like this one really wacky, amazing concept piece that included most of our alien characters, actually.

446
00:52:46,324 --> 00:52:57,971
And then we went and kind of looked at what some of our design goals were and narrative goals were, and then tried to match up some of these personalities and hone in on how they're going to be translated and experienced by the player.

447
00:52:59,992 --> 00:53:00,373
Awesome.

448
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:00,813
Thank you.

449
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,560
Time for one more?

450
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,461
Yeah.

451
00:53:04,501 --> 00:53:04,781
Totally.

452
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:06,562
I guess this is a two-parter.

453
00:53:06,902 --> 00:53:07,182
Sorry.

454
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:10,844
Do you have a sense of, like, prioritized conversations?

455
00:53:10,884 --> 00:53:14,906
Like, could multiple conversations match a current sub-state?

456
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:17,607
And if so, is there, like, a priority you'd put them in?

457
00:53:18,087 --> 00:53:27,391
And then my, this may be related, is do, would one conversation be governed by one, like, set of state, or did it branch inside the conversation?

458
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:28,472
That make sense?

459
00:53:29,136 --> 00:53:39,880
Yeah, so the question was, what did our concept of dialogue prioritization look like, and then within a conversation, how did the branching work, if that reflects it?

460
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,940
Okay, awesome.

461
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:53,224
On the prioritization end of things, every conversation the game had had a weight on it, and it was always pick the highest weighted conversation, and that was proportional to

462
00:53:53,624 --> 00:53:55,546
the number of facts that were attached to it.

463
00:53:55,586 --> 00:54:00,410
So if something was super, super specific, only going to be valid for one state, we'd better make sure that's top of the stack.

464
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:00,750
Totally.

465
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,271
Yeah, we did the same thing on Firewatch.

466
00:54:02,411 --> 00:54:03,112
Oh, OK, awesome.

467
00:54:03,132 --> 00:54:03,512
Just curious.

468
00:54:04,673 --> 00:54:05,013
Perfect.

469
00:54:05,594 --> 00:54:09,557
And there, we did have some light branching inside of given dialogues.

470
00:54:09,657 --> 00:54:15,342
So when you walked up to a character, it would pick for you the most, the highest priority dialogue.

471
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:22,689
But once you were inside the dialogue, there were some little choices that you could make to sort of just flavor your experience.

472
00:54:22,729 --> 00:54:29,617
And then there were a few cases where we would set a conditional tag on one of those, and then you'd get a conversation that called back to a choice you made.

473
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:34,502
So you compliment someone on something here, and then later they say, thank you, actually, that meant a lot to me.

474
00:54:35,122 --> 00:54:36,003
Those were all pretty

475
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:44,715
surface layer and mostly just wanted to like get the player doing more than just like setting their controller down on the coffee table when a dialogue starts to play.

476
00:54:44,775 --> 00:54:46,636
Like they can, you know, engage with it.

477
00:54:47,236 --> 00:54:51,938
But we tried to keep the branching pretty light there to reflect just the linearity of Cal's story.

478
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:53,099
Cool, thanks.

479
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:53,679
Thank you.

480
00:54:56,749 --> 00:55:05,671
I was wondering your sort of like writer tech stack was really interesting.

481
00:55:06,051 --> 00:55:15,453
How much of that was like emergent or how much of that was sort of predetermined or like you know how do you get writers on board for like what is ultimately a pretty technical process.

482
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,334
Yeah I would just love to hear a little bit more about that.

483
00:55:21,604 --> 00:55:22,665
I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?

484
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:23,526
Oh yeah, for sure.

485
00:55:23,566 --> 00:55:31,712
Like your flowchart regarding writing and just how did that sort of process emerge or was it established prior?

486
00:55:31,812 --> 00:55:33,553
It was just an interesting concept.

487
00:55:33,573 --> 00:55:34,254
I'd love to hear more about it.

488
00:55:35,074 --> 00:55:35,995
Yeah, for sure.

489
00:55:36,055 --> 00:55:45,743
So I think the question had to do with the flowchart of the different tools and how information flowed through and then kind of how we onboarded the writers onto that process.

490
00:55:46,863 --> 00:55:56,089
I think it was definitely designed with, and this is kind of a thing people say a lot, but designed with our specific writing team in mind.

491
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:02,653
Our writers, a lot of them have narrative design backgrounds and what not, so it was definitely

492
00:56:03,233 --> 00:56:06,597
they were ready to engage with some of the non-linearity of the system.

493
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:15,205
But there were definitely steps built in to try and really streamline things for the writers so that they could really just focus on homing in on the characters.

494
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:22,112
So for instance, the auto-generation of the scripts so that they're not having to tab over and say,

495
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:23,173
you

496
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,231
sort of the broad planning.

497
00:56:39,891 --> 00:56:57,819
At the same time, I don't want to make it seem like they were siloed to that because a lot of, I think they, especially as the process went on, did a really great job of looking for opportunities to enhance interactivity and to take advantage of some of those systems there.

498
00:56:58,779 --> 00:56:59,659
Hopefully that answered your question.

499
00:57:04,431 --> 00:57:04,771
Hello.

500
00:57:06,192 --> 00:57:13,257
I'm curious what your favorite conversation or interaction is that required hyper-specific criteria that most players might have missed.

501
00:57:13,637 --> 00:57:17,300
What are some Easter Egg-y type of conversations that you want to highlight?

502
00:57:24,104 --> 00:57:27,687
There was one where... Oh, sorry.

503
00:57:31,046 --> 00:57:52,758
I do remember one where there's a state in which Turgle is enthusing about this seashell that he's found somewhere, and the order in which you encounter dialogues in the hub about that determine the things that people say.

504
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:56,900
So, for instance, if you go to Monk first and Monk says, listen, this guy Turgle is

505
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,463
just railing on about this shell.

506
00:57:59,763 --> 00:58:05,210
If you go to Tergal, Tergal will start to tell you about the shell and Cal will say, okay, I already heard about this, please shut up.

507
00:58:05,511 --> 00:58:08,034
And so there are little kind of like funny gags built in.

508
00:58:08,535 --> 00:58:09,796
I think that was a highlight for me.

509
00:58:10,297 --> 00:58:10,698
If you have one.

510
00:58:12,425 --> 00:58:18,748
Yeah, I think some of Moran's later conversations, once you've hit their inflection event, shows a very different side of them.

511
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:26,172
So it requires a lot of player engagement, and it's a very subtle, inclusive storyline, if you will.

512
00:58:26,432 --> 00:58:33,496
And if you're not keyed in to that storyline, and you haven't been investing visits to him frequently, you might miss that.

513
00:58:33,616 --> 00:58:41,760
And so when you actually get to see the other side of Moran, it's a lot more soft and vulnerable, and a really good contrast to that frosty smuggler we see at the beginning.

514
00:58:45,919 --> 00:58:46,220
All right.

515
00:58:46,881 --> 00:58:48,184
I think we're right about at time.

516
00:58:48,264 --> 00:58:49,426
Thank you guys so much.

517
00:58:49,987 --> 00:58:51,731
We're going to continue some Q&A across the hall.
