00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,830
Hi, my name is Chris. I am really excited to be at GDC. We are talking about trolling.

2
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:09,595
Trolling is very important.

3
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:12,209
It is the basis of the game economy.

4
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,669
Hey, what are we doing? We're doing a video?

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,550
Oh, this is the GDC video, right.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,031
Okay, yeah, hi, guys, hey, I'm Chris.

7
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,812
Can't wait to be joining you, everyone, at GDC.

8
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:22,793
It's gonna be huge. Biggest parties ever.

9
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,574
It's gonna be great. We're all gonna have a great time.

10
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:28,095
Game industry rocks, except for we have this problem with trolls.

11
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:30,576
Trolls, toxicity, they're always annoying us.

12
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:33,917
We're trying to get stuff done, we're trying to make awesome products, have fun,

13
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,379
and there's this one person that just keeps bugging us and driving us crazy.

14
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:39,761
It's like they have like this mighty sword,

15
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:41,504
the mighty sword of Alhara!

16
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:43,706
That they can go and they can yield it all they want

17
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:46,089
and they destroy the atmosphere every single time

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,192
and we need some kind of defense to go against them

19
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:50,575
otherwise the game is unbalanced and we lose all our money.

20
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:50,835
Whoa!

21
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:54,460
But all we need is just something to get rid of them.

22
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:59,202
And then maybe then we can actually have some more success to this whole thing.

23
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:04,125
Our games can be profitable and we can have tons more fun and it'd be well-balanced and all that cool stuff.

24
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:05,625
And all that jazz.

25
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:07,186
Hey, is there jazz music anywhere?

26
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:14,069
What happened to this guy? ðŸŽµ

27
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:22,273
Ever feel like you're surrounded, bold-type, by trolls?

28
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:26,481
Come to the talk and you'll find out how to get rid of them.
