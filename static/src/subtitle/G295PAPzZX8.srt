1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,852
I think the official title of the talk is lessons from VR

2
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:08,372
prototyping.

3
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:10,453
I'm going to try to give you 50 lessons in 30 minutes,

4
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:12,754
so it's going to move a little bit quickly.

5
00:00:12,774 --> 00:00:16,416
The title says 80 plus VR and AR prototypes.

6
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:17,616
We've done about 90 so far.

7
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:18,276
We're currently on our 90th.

8
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:22,760
My name is Rob. I'm a software engineer with the Daydream team over at Google.

9
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:25,983
We do both VR and AR prototypes. Lots of prototypes.

10
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:29,566
Usually we work in pairs. We try to move as quickly as possible.

11
00:00:29,586 --> 00:00:33,169
We kind of started doing about a prototype per pair every one to two weeks.

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,972
It's getting a little slower now as we're moving into the social space

13
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:38,214
and co-presence is a little bit harder to prototype for.

14
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:44,481
but we try to move as quickly as possible and learn what we can. This is going to be my

15
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:49,928
attempt to distill our wisdom down into the top 50 lessons that I've seen. Some of these are

16
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:55,275
probably going to be familiar to a lot of you. So I maybe apologize. Hopefully I'm not too

17
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,796
elementary in the lessons that I'm giving.

18
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:01,779
also some of these rules are really flexible and I've seen them broken to great effect. So

19
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:06,401
don't think that these are the ground truths. Not only that but today's kind of best

20
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:12,124
practices may be tomorrow's bad ideas. So we understand this system is evolving quickly. I'm

21
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:14,064
just going to tell you what we think we're working with right now.

22
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:19,249
and I hope there are at least a few new things in this deck for everyone. So let me get

23
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:23,933
started. My first category is audio. Which might already come as a surprise to you. Why audio?

24
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:28,657
Because my audio engineer would be really happy to see this listed first. We usually put it

25
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:34,382
last in our VR experiences and our experiences suffer as a result of just like thinking about

26
00:01:34,422 --> 00:01:36,584
that second. So, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so,

27
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:41,848
This brings me to my first point which is great audio is absolutely critical to immersion.

28
00:01:42,128 --> 00:01:45,871
Especially in VR, it just can't be an afterthought. It's absolutely essential to the

29
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:50,754
experience. Number two, spatial audio is more than just dynamic volume. I think a lot of

30
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:55,097
people don't really understand what's at play when we talk about spatial audio or volumetric

31
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:59,100
audio. Oftentimes people think, oh, okay, so if there's a sound source over there, I'm going to

32
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,681
play it louder in this ear than in this ear.

33
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:03,677
That's kind of like the first step to spatialized or

34
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:06,917
localized audio. But the next step is delaying that sound

35
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:09,518
signal so that it arrives at this ear ever so slightly later

36
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,798
than at this ear, which is another cue that the brain uses

37
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:14,699
to tell you where that is in the room. Really great spatialized

38
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,900
audio is also taking into account whether that thing is in

39
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,680
front of you or behind you. Because you know what? Your head

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,501
and your ears are big sacks of liquid, basically, and they

41
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:25,922
change the way that your ears receive the sound. And if you do

42
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:28,522
it right, if you process those sounds right, you'll be able to

43
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,663
distinguish between what's in front of you and what's behind

44
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:30,783
you.

45
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:34,384
the next step in spatialized audio is taking into account the

46
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,785
physical properties of the room to get a little bit of echo or a

47
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:39,585
little bit of dampening. When all these things are done right,

48
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:43,927
the immersion really gets multiplied. Also, it's easy.

49
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,708
Google has an SDK that makes it easy to just drop into unity or

50
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:49,168
drop into your C++ project and it just works. So there's really

51
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,449
no excuse not to do it. Just use the spatialized audio plug-in.

52
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:53,830
Next up, process.

53
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,932
process is really important to me because we're trying to run through these crazy prototypes

54
00:02:57,952 --> 00:03:04,575
so quickly. So the first thing that we do, a whole lot of iteration. You know, I mean, I think

55
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:09,478
most people in this room kind of have been in VR long enough to have some idea about what's

56
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:10,678
good in VR and what isn't. But...

57
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:14,088
you know when I talk to people who are new in the industry their first instinct is

58
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:18,809
roller coasters, racing games, flying games. Now I've seen some of these done well but for

59
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:24,451
the most part these experiences make you really sick and nobody has ever, nobody's first

60
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:29,813
instinct was tilt brush, right? So what you need to do is iterate. And you know tilt brush was

61
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:33,255
kind of a happy accident. Iterate, find out what's interesting.

62
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:38,074
Incidentally I give a lot of credit to the playful team who

63
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:40,575
spoke yesterday. They were doing five to nine ideas a week which

64
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:45,717
is quite impressive compared to my team's one or two. Next up,

65
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:48,739
test in VR as soon as possible. There are so many things,

66
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,720
especially with user interfaces, when you sketch them out on

67
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,101
paper they seem like a good idea, you put them in VR and

68
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:57,803
they just don't work. Get that thing into unity as quickly as

69
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,283
possible.

70
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:04,399
Next up scope. Ask yourself what you really need to do to test

71
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,141
that hypothesis that you're really after and just do that.

72
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:10,524
It's so easy to get distracted. Something that I call nerd

73
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:14,067
sniping in reference to an XKCD comic. It's just like where are

74
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,949
the types of people who are interested in everything and

75
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,811
want these little technical challenges. It's so easy to get

76
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:21,574
distracted in nerd sniping. So just try to scope it as small as

77
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:21,974
possible.

78
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,842
Number six, not every experience is going to be better in VR.

79
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:29,767
There are just things that are going to suck.

80
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:33,192
You know, we spend a lot of time taking existing game genres

81
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:34,294
and porting them into VR.

82
00:04:35,315 --> 00:04:38,079
But there are so many things to still discover in VR.

83
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,300
Focus on those new things.

84
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:43,178
Number seven, don't be constrained by reality. I think

85
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:46,000
our first instinct is to try to recreate the experiences we love

86
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,361
in the real world. People like puppies. Let's make a game where

87
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:51,744
you play fetch with puppies. It's VR. You can play fetch with

88
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:55,667
a T-Rex or whatever. Don't feel like you have to be constrained

89
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:56,767
by reality. Think bigger.

90
00:04:57,753 --> 00:05:00,956
Number 8, design from the ground up specifically for VR. I'm

91
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:03,678
going to talk a little bit about this at the very end as well.

92
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:06,840
The best VR experiences that we're going to see aren't going

93
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,943
to be adaptations of existing media forms. They're going to be

94
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:12,525
experiences that really understand the strengths and

95
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:15,267
weaknesses of VR and are going to be built from the ground up.

96
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:17,009
I'll talk a little bit more about that later.

97
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:23,541
motion. It's really hard to get away from motion in VR. A lot of new experiences we're

98
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:28,430
trying to avoid motion with teleporting or keeping you in a single physical space. But it's

99
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,231
hard to get away from.

100
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:34,410
So let's talk a little bit about why emotion is such a challenge. When your eyes and your

101
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,894
vestibular system disagree, that's when you get sick. This is why roller coasters are such a

102
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:42,737
bad idea. Your eyes are telling you one sense of acceleration, your ears are telling you

103
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:45,960
another sense of acceleration. The time when those things tend to disagree is when you've

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,104
been poisoned or drunk and so our body responds in the same way as when you've been poisoned

105
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:55,789
or drunk. One of the things you can do is minimize problems either with constant velocity.

106
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:59,712
or by using blink teleportation. I'm going to dig into this more

107
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:03,855
deeply. Typically when we're designing motion curves for a

108
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:08,258
game experience in 2D or a website, whatever, we apply a

109
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:09,239
constant acceleration.

110
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:16,655
and this gives us a velocity curve like this. So you have your positive acceleration, you

111
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:20,518
increase your velocity, you have your negative acceleration, you decrease your velocity and

112
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:25,442
it gives you this nice smooth S curve of your position, looks about like this. And the thing

113
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:31,887
to note about this is that your acceleration is always non-zero. So in this kind of situation

114
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:36,811
your eyes are the entire time disagreeing with your inner ear about what your acceleration

115
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:36,971
is.

116
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:39,813
So instead, what we found in many cases is the best

117
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,694
practices for VR.

118
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:42,715
And again, I've seen these rules broken to great effect.

119
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:46,177
But generally speaking, what we try to do is apply a

120
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:49,299
constant velocity, which gives you an ugly looking position

121
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:50,000
curve like this.

122
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,021
But here's the key is that it gives you an acceleration

123
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:52,902
curve that looks like this.

124
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,403
You have this instantaneous impulse of positive

125
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:57,725
acceleration, this instantaneous impulse of

126
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:01,447
negative acceleration, and most of the time, your eyes

127
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:03,769
and your inner ear agree about what the acceleration is.

128
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,410
So this tends to work pretty well.

129
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,993
The other thing you can do is blink teleport. So basically

130
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:10,175
just like an instantaneous transportation from one

131
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:12,658
location to another location gives you a position curve like

132
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:12,859
this.

133
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:18,540
Number 11, just be creative with teleportation preview and other types of motion. There are

134
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,082
games out there like budget cuts that let you see where you're going before you teleport. I've

135
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:26,185
seen all kinds of interesting things where fantastic contraption, you pull the dark helmet

136
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:28,947
onto your head and you're in another world. There are all kinds of really cool ways to

137
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:33,371
teleport while maintaining your spatial presence. So, you know, play around with those

138
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:38,114
sorts of things. Yesterday the playful team talked about their success with swing arm

139
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:41,917
locomotion. I've seen the developers of hover, HVR, talk about...

140
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:46,922
how he addressed motion sickness by keeping the camera rig always

141
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:49,925
rotationally locked in all three axes and these things work

142
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:53,208
pretty well. Experiment. Take a few minutes to spend some time

143
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:56,111
on that crazy idea. The other thing you can do to minimize

144
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:58,954
motion sickness is narrowing the FOV while you're moving.

145
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:03,358
generally speaking we're not likely to get motion sick when we're watching a television

146
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:07,681
because there's a small region of motion but we have the room around us to anchor us in space.

147
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:13,445
So some of the experiences you might have seen narrow the field of view and bring in this ring

148
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:17,708
of black around you while you're moving forward and then slowly move that out again when you

149
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:22,212
stop. And the reality is most people don't even notice this or maybe they notice it at first but

150
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:25,755
then they just get used to it and it really doesn't bother them but it allows them to anchor

151
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:26,635
themselves in space.

152
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,517
In Google we're using some applications where rather than

153
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:32,960
bringing in black, we actually bring in a gray grid that's

154
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,383
locked to the frame of the room to give you that sense of

155
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:41,285
spatial coherence. Next, when you're teleporting, make sure

156
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:43,567
you're teleporting to a psychologically safe location.

157
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:46,349
It really sucks when you teleport and you have like a

158
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,711
wall right in front of you. Especially in a lot of our

159
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:50,752
experiences where we don't even have textures on these walls,

160
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:51,693
it's just like...

161
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:57,580
you're like where am I? It can be very disconcerting to sort of like teleport that way.

162
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,763
Next up, my next section is interaction. Players love experiences that allow for creativity.

163
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:08,585
And, you know, tilt brush is an obvious example here, but we've built some other prototypes at

164
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:14,288
Google that allow very simple ways of just like being creative and expressing yourself. The

165
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:19,450
idea behind this prototype was let's make it as easy to create an animation as it is to play

166
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:19,910
with dolls.

167
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,432
the first thing you do is you grab an item from your inventory and place it in your scene. If

168
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:28,773
you grab the item again, you are now animating it on a timeline. That timeline is simple

169
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:33,395
enough that you can layer a bunch of animations on top of it and create just really, you know,

170
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:37,817
the mechanics are so simple for this application. But I've seen people literally like rolling

171
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:42,778
around on the floor and waving things over their head, making these crazy animations. You know,

172
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:45,820
just let people, give people an opportunity for creative outlets.

173
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,224
number 15, let them throw it. Anybody who has been in VR enough, you probably tried that

174
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:55,987
experience where you grab something and you're delighted that you're moving it and you go to

175
00:09:56,027 --> 00:10:01,691
throw it and it just sticks in space. It's just kind of underwhelming. You really want it to

176
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,092
behave like it would in the real world.

177
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:06,993
you know, this brings me to the next point which is think about gestures. One of the things you

178
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:11,514
can do with throwing it is like make that your discard gesture. You throw it off the edge of

179
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:16,175
the cliff and you're done with that item. In terms of other gestures, fantastic contraption,

180
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,897
another example where you can use your tool box or you can reach over your shoulder or over

181
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:24,758
your head and pull items out of your inventory that way. Especially when those gestures

182
00:10:24,878 --> 00:10:27,518
really make sense for the context of the experience that you're creating.

183
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:32,159
think about how you can use those gestures to make the user interface simpler or eliminate

184
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:38,060
the user interface altogether. Next up, let sloppy actions have structured results. This

185
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,201
will be a little bit related to my next point. Oftentimes there's enough context, let's see

186
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:49,123
if I can get this playing here. No, that's not it. Let's try this. Messing it up again.

187
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:53,323
Just bad with technology. Ironic, right? All right. So, I'm going to show you a little bit

188
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,272
So oftentimes there's enough context in an action and throwing something or picking

189
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:02,254
something up or scooping something up that you can guess algorithmically what the user

190
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:09,778
wants to do. Go ahead and just do that. Figure out what the user's intention is and take

191
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:12,220
advantage of that. Take advantage of that context and make a structured result.

192
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,303
from that otherwise sloppy action. And this brings me to number 18, this sort of feels like

193
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:23,665
you're giving your player super powers. So spawning objects into the virtual world, picking

194
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:28,468
up huge items, pulling in distant items with magic attraction, or just like I was saying

195
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:33,150
before, like throwing something against a wall and having it grow to an enormous size or

196
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,272
align itself appropriately. All of these feel like super powers and your users really are

197
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:39,754
going to love that. Controllers, this is a tricky one.

198
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:45,140
I think we've all had the frustration where we're in

199
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,363
Photoshop and we're trying to crop something to exactly 500

200
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:51,709
by 500 pixels and getting X and Y at exactly 500 by 500 is just

201
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:52,870
a big pain in the butt.

202
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:57,441
When we're in VR, we're working with six degrees of freedom

203
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:58,402
simultaneously.

204
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:01,784
And that's just too much to get all those numbers right

205
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:03,105
at exactly the same time.

206
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:06,168
So I strongly suggest thinking about ways

207
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:09,270
of snapping both in position and also in rotation.

208
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,112
In this example, what you do, you

209
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:14,534
see the ghosted item in your actual position,

210
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:17,276
but it snaps into the closest orientation and position.

211
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:20,763
Keep interactions in a comfortable space. This is a

212
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,924
pretty typical one. Users don't want to have to spend a lot of

213
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:27,005
time reaching to areas that are uncomfortable around their body.

214
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,705
So just keep, when possible, keep the key interactions

215
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:32,586
nearby. Some of the things you can do is scale the user or

216
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:35,507
scale the world as appropriate to make that happen. With the

217
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:37,827
dollhouse application that we were just looking at, you can

218
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:41,948
scale between being big or being small so that you can both

219
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:45,349
experience the dollhouse in an appropriate scale, but then when

220
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:47,409
you're building it, you can also build at the appropriate scale

221
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,530
and don't have to walk around a lot.

222
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,351
When it doesn't make sense to scale yourself or to scale the world, think about mapping

223
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:58,313
controls in a non one-to-one manner. This maybe, I don't think this has occurred to a whole lot

224
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:03,255
of people yet, but think about, you know, it sounds strange, like if I reach out, my hand

225
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,715
goes way off to the back of the room.

226
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:09,597
The reality is the motor cortex is very plastic and the brain adapts very quickly to these

227
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:13,899
kinds of ideas. We even played around with experiments where when you're close by

228
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:18,241
everything is one, is scaled one to one, but as you reach beyond a threshold you basically

229
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:21,603
get go go gadget arms and they like extend out to the other side of the room and you can grab

230
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:26,065
things. And this, or they kind of like turn into laser pointers. These are great ways to

231
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:30,627
allow you to access a larger physical space or maybe I guess a larger virtual space without

232
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,028
moving beyond that useful physical space.

233
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:40,710
Next up, use haptics. One of the rules we try to operate by is when visuals, audios and haptics

234
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,535
all come together, that's when the feeling is really magical. That's what really completes

235
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:50,800
the feeling of immersion. I know haptics aren't available on every platform, but when they're

236
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,382
there, please take advantage of them.

237
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,915
Next up, this category is environments. Simple thing. We

238
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:59,558
love huge spaces. This is another one where you don't need

239
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:02,302
to be limited by reality. You have vaulted ceilings and

240
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:06,066
infinite stairways and towering ruins. These places are so

241
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:08,629
compelling to humanity. But, we have to be careful. We have to

242
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:14,613
with those large spaces, still divide up your world into smaller spaces that fit into your

243
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:19,815
sort of physical tracking space. So if you can divide up your world in such a way that within a

244
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:24,798
typical tracking space for one of your users, you can teleport into that space and do all the

245
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:28,560
interactions that you need within that space, it's going to make it a lot easier for you to

246
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:33,283
teleport around that space. We've even divided up some worlds in interesting ways where...

247
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:36,625
maybe on, we'll think about our tracking space.

248
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:37,967
On that corner of the tracking space,

249
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:40,969
if you enter that space, you get into a tramway.

250
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:43,451
That tramway takes you up to a different corner,

251
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,693
or I guess it has to be exactly the same corner

252
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:47,174
in another tracked space.

253
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,656
By laying out these transformations

254
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:51,398
between tracking spaces creatively,

255
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:53,660
you can really make your world feel enormous

256
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,022
and your user will never have to leave,

257
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:58,284
they'll never even feel like they need to leave

258
00:14:58,744 --> 00:14:59,905
the tracked space.

259
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:03,696
Next, place objects in a way that keeps the player in the

260
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,678
physical space. This is kind of what I was talking about before.

261
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:08,719
So here's an example one. Let's say you're playing a game of

262
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,481
golf. So you hit the golf ball, it's over there, I want to

263
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:15,524
teleport to my golf ball. The typical thought process is, oh,

264
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:17,925
I'll teleport such that that ball is right in front of me.

265
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:22,268
Now, if you modify that ever so slightly and instead teleport

266
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,910
the ball to the center of the room, you might need to take a

267
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,271
couple steps to get in front of that ball again, but you're

268
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:29,293
never going to leave your tracking space.

269
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:33,874
In contrast, if you teleport the ball to right in front of you, you're building up small

270
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:36,574
amounts of error over time and eventually you're going to run into your physical wall.

271
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:41,735
So just think about that. These are subtle differences. Number 26, texture everything,

272
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:45,456
even if it's just subtle noise. I think we've all had the experience where we have false

273
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:50,517
convergence on a chain link fence or something, a repetitive pattern where you sort of have a

274
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:52,318
hard time figuring out the depth of something.

275
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:54,639
In VR, when we have untextured surfaces,

276
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,281
we almost never encounter these untextured surfaces

277
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:57,822
in real life.

278
00:15:57,842 --> 00:16:00,023
There are always fingerprint smudges or scratches

279
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:00,544
or something.

280
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:03,166
Give everything a little bit of a subtle noise texture

281
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:04,887
just to allow your eyes to focus.

282
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:10,427
Number 27, show the physical bounds in the virtual world. We all know when we're using

283
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:14,090
something like Vive, we can see the edges of where the world is. We have that little glowing

284
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:19,194
rectangle. When we get close to the wall, we have our chaperone grid. Don't make the user

285
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:23,458
have to get that close to know where they are. That information is generally exposed by the

286
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:27,881
API. Put something in your virtual world that represents that and nobody will even be tempted

287
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:28,882
to go beyond those bounds.

288
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:34,426
This is an easy one. Number 28. Everyone loves particles. Just put them in everywhere because

289
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:39,090
they're freaking awesome. I've seen so many experiences that we spend weeks on and

290
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:44,195
somebody will just say, oh, man, I love the rain. It took like ten seconds in unity. Just

291
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:49,000
put particles everywhere. All right. Scale. Scale is such an incredibly powerful tool in

292
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,502
VR that I wanted to have a whole section on it.

293
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:54,866
Number one, accurate scale really matters. This is one of the reasons to start prototyping

294
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:59,831
in VR immediately. Because if that door is 20% shorter than it's supposed to be, you

295
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:06,338
immediately notice. And there are also very powerful things that you can do to use scale.

296
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,341
Scale can convey power or vulnerability.

297
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:13,564
So, you know, whether you're Godzilla size and marching through the streets of Tokyo or you're

298
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:17,247
tiny and you really feel, you're feeling what it's like to be, for instance, at the side of a

299
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:23,331
blue whale, scale can be used to convey very powerful emotional experiences. And even very

300
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:27,634
subtle changes can have an effect. We found that if we have two, if we're doing a co‑

301
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:32,538
presence situation where we have two vibes in different rooms and the rooms are calibrated

302
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:36,481
ever so slightly off so that one floor is a little higher than the other floor.

303
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:41,543
those two players, if they know each other in real life, will immediately notice the height

304
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,444
difference in virtual reality. You can use this in really interesting ways, too. You can make

305
00:17:45,504 --> 00:17:49,246
everyone the same height, you can deliberately make someone taller, you can make it so that

306
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:56,369
somebody's, their virtual head is a little bit, a little bit on top of where their physical

307
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,650
head is, which means everyone looks taller to you.

308
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,972
or you can make everyone look shorter to you.

309
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,174
There are all kinds of interesting things that you can do

310
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:04,836
that shape the social,

311
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:07,018
like kind of the social shape of the world

312
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:07,639
that you're working in.

313
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:12,949
And then use scale as a tool. This is a little bit of an extension of the dollhouse example

314
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:16,111
that I showed earlier. One of the pieces that we have in this dollhouse is what we call our

315
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:20,214
little chess piece. You can put that into the dollhouse, teleport down and shrink down and

316
00:18:20,254 --> 00:18:24,877
see that dollhouse from a doll's size and walk through that. It really just gives you a

317
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:29,120
really powerful feeling of being able to manipulate and then see from the inside.

318
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:36,313
32, when you change scale, don't forget to change other things around scale. Physics and

319
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:41,879
audio. Physics is a really tricky one. If it's a single player experience and you're

320
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:46,144
teleporting between different sizes, you sort of expect physics to behave, for acceleration

321
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:51,329
to be at 9.8 meters per second squared regardless of what size you're at. So it should be relative

322
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:52,030
to your size.

323
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,732
Now this isn't always possible. If you're in a co-presence scenario and you have one giant

324
00:18:56,772 --> 00:19:01,754
player and one tiny player, physics is going to have to be different for those two players. My

325
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:07,616
suggestion would be to anchor physics to seem correct for the smallest player. Because it's a

326
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:11,857
lot less disconcerting to be that giant and see things kind of moving slowly through the air

327
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:16,679
than to be that tiny player and see things moving incredibly quickly. You know, 980 meters

328
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:19,000
per second squared just doesn't feel right.

329
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:26,733
Audio also, if you have a little tiny player, pitch up their audio. It just feels right to

330
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:28,095
people. It feels more immersive that way.

331
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,944
All right, co‑ presence. This is a tricky one. Number one, players expect something to

332
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:38,525
happen when they touch. Anyone who has experimented with co‑ presence scenarios and

333
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:42,266
created some prototypes in this area, they've seen a lot of these same behaviors. The first

334
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:46,807
thing players do when they get into co‑ presence is they try to touch each other. So

335
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:49,508
something should happen. A shower of sparks, a high five.

336
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,390
But there's also, like, you know,

337
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,731
there are some negative consequences

338
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,293
that come from this desire to touch each other in VR.

339
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:58,895
And we need to figure out better ways of dealing with those.

340
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:01,798
One of those is that we don't want to reward bad behavior.

341
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:03,859
So this is an example where we have

342
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,000
a couple dogs playing poker.

343
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,382
And we, you know, this is,

344
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:09,304
poker, there are very specific rules

345
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:10,405
about how things should work.

346
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,808
And here we have, you know, we have the opponent win.

347
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:17,673
and the other one kind of walks over to take retribution.

348
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,213
And we have very simple things here.

349
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:22,455
The world fades to gray, the audio dims down,

350
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:24,496
there's a glowing sphere that tells you

351
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:25,717
where you're supposed to go back to,

352
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:27,198
and you disappear from the world.

353
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:28,859
Now, none of these are terrible punishments.

354
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:30,460
It's not like a flashing sign that says,

355
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,660
please return to your seat.

356
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,261
It's just enough to say,

357
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:34,762
you're playing this experience wrong,

358
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,343
please go back to where you were supposed to be.

359
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:37,924
And that's really all that it takes.

360
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:40,946
So just very slight negative influences

361
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:41,986
for antisocial behavior.

362
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:47,613
On the flip side, of course, do reward pro-social interactions. If you reward pro-social

363
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:52,278
interactions, a shower of sparks when you do a high five but not when you punch the face,

364
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:56,864
people will do the pro-social interactions and not the negative interactions.

365
00:20:58,353 --> 00:21:00,475
Number 36, enforce social boundaries.

366
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:02,396
So people, and this is, you know,

367
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,019
people will do this thinking that it's a very innocent thing.

368
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:07,661
The first time people go into a co-present scenario,

369
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:09,382
they'll say, I wonder what it feels like

370
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:10,743
when I stand inside your body.

371
00:21:10,824 --> 00:21:12,225
Because you know, this is something you can't do

372
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:13,005
in the physical world.

373
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:15,287
This can be really uncomfortable.

374
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,850
It is completely innocently intentioned,

375
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,452
but it can feel very uncomfortable for the other person.

376
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:22,073
So we just need to anticipate this.

377
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:27,275
Especially right now at the beginning of VR, a lot of people are having their very first VR

378
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:31,696
experiences. If a lot of those experiences are bad, we are shooting ourselves in the foot. We

379
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:36,597
need to be the ones responsible for creating a healthy ecosystem. So simple things, you

380
00:21:36,617 --> 00:21:41,879
know, make the opponent's body disappear as they enter your personal space bubble. Let people

381
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:46,620
define their own personal space bubbles. Allow someone to ban someone from a room or make

382
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,661
them invisible. We really need to think about, you know, innocent behaviors are bad enough.

383
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:53,943
or can be bad enough, we really need to think about

384
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:57,006
when people are intentionally trying to be

385
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,309
negative antisocial behaviors in VR.

386
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,452
Number 37, this is an easy one.

387
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:04,273
Voice chat really multiplies immersion.

388
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:06,696
We find that if you have two people in different rooms,

389
00:22:08,434 --> 00:22:13,201
other people who are not in the vibe can still continue a conversation with those people until

390
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:17,267
they're connected with each other by voice. At that point, the rest of the world just falls

391
00:22:17,327 --> 00:22:22,595
away. Everything else becomes noise. Voice chat really, really increases immersion.

392
00:22:24,597 --> 00:22:28,639
38, put shared objects at the center of the space. We did a couple different versions of a

393
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,600
co‑president's music making scenario. In one, all the instruments were on the outside of

394
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,481
the room. And what we found is that people would kind of just like do their own thing. Like

395
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:39,543
they could hear their friend behind them doing something else, but they weren't playing

396
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:39,923
together.

397
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:43,365
Some of this has to do with the field of view that you have in VR.

398
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:46,987
If that other person isn't within your field of view, you kind of just feel like they're

399
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:47,527
somewhere else.

400
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,009
If you instead put all those instruments at the center of the room so that if you're playing

401
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:54,491
one and your friends are playing another, you're forced to face each other, people

402
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:55,571
start making music together.

403
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:57,592
It was just a complete difference in behavior.

404
00:22:58,486 --> 00:23:02,989
Number 39, think about asymmetric experiences. This is more of a thought experience. When we

405
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:07,252
get started in VR, there aren't going to be a whole lot of VR devices out there. What we're

406
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:11,334
going to need to do is find a way to involve the people who aren't in the headset in the

407
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:15,837
experience of the other people. So we've done some pretty crazy experiments where we have

408
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:20,000
maybe one person in a daydream, but everybody else can be on their phone and be connected to

409
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,660
that experience.

410
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:25,524
and maybe they're talking by voice. We did one last week where the person in the Daydream

411
00:23:25,544 --> 00:23:29,546
headset is a cat trying to brush its teeth but it has no control over its arms. It can only

412
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:33,909
turn right and left. The person on the controller is actually the one controlling the arms

413
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,433
with forward kinematics and they have to grab the toothbrush and get it to the mouth. I know

414
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:42,475
this is crazy but these kinds of experiences are going to be really important for bringing

415
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:46,458
people into the fold in VR. All right, next up, avatars.

416
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:52,414
full body avatars, I mean avatars are tricky. This is the place where I know people are going to

417
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:57,578
disagree with me. That's totally fine. In our experience what we found is that full body

418
00:23:57,618 --> 00:24:02,002
avatars, they can work very well if you're looking at another full body avatar. But when you

419
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:06,325
look down at your feet and you see them oriented in a different way than your physical feet are,

420
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:10,408
people find it uncomfortable. And the further down you go on your body, the more

421
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:14,512
uncomfortable that gets. So maybe you can find a good way to simulate the elbows, but when

422
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:15,352
you get down to the legs,

423
00:24:16,113 --> 00:24:19,396
There's a good chance you just want to make those disappear when you're looking at your own avatar.

424
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,238
They can be visible to everybody else, that's okay.

425
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:29,288
41. Eyes are so important. Forward staring non blinking eyes are so creepy. They're really

426
00:24:29,388 --> 00:24:33,371
simple things you can do to give those eyes a little bit of a brain. We literally call it the

427
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:39,076
eye brain plug in on our side. These eyes are really simple. They blink randomly. As you start

428
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:44,580
to turn your head, the eyes move forward. They accelerate that motion to anticipate the

429
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,063
direction that they're going. It just makes them more lively. There are some other great

430
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,844
demos I saw yesterday where people were

431
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:56,229
creating, they were setting up the third party or their NPCs to look, basically what was

432
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,133
appropriate to look at, kind of action. So you don't want them to just stare, but you might

433
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:04,256
want them to kind of move their eyes between areas of interest in the space.

434
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:11,407
Next up, when you pick up an item, that item can become your controller. This is a simple one.

435
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:17,069
I've seen this done pretty well. Rather than crowding your visual space with both your

436
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:20,830
virtual hands and also the item you're picking up, just make that item that you've picked up

437
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,491
your controller and make everything else disappear.

438
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:28,913
beware of the uncanny valley. We all instinctively know this rule. But the thing is, it's so

439
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:33,975
easy to follow in VR. The reality is when you're in co‑present situations, you don't need a

440
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:39,777
particularly realistic head or hands to convey a ton of emotion. So here you can just see,

441
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:45,418
like, the emotion of these players comes through so clearly. You don't need gesture. It just

442
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:48,880
comes through. Just send a couple of transforms over the network and you're golden.

443
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:55,760
All right, user interfaces, another really tough area in VR. Simple one, avoid user interfaces

444
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,424
that require you to turn your head. A lot of people think, oh, we're in VR, especially when

445
00:26:00,464 --> 00:26:03,546
you're first getting into VR. They're like, we basically have infinite screen real estate.

446
00:26:03,566 --> 00:26:09,571
We'll put stuff all around us. So overwhelming. You need to really focus it right up in front

447
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:09,771
of you.

448
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:15,294
It can be just so overwhelming. Number 45, not too close, not too far. This is kind of a

449
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:20,716
tricky one. It depends on what the scenario is and what your headset is that you're using.

450
00:26:21,256 --> 00:26:24,838
You know, we can think about the way that we render in VR, we think about our eyes as two

451
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:30,040
separate cameras. There are two ways to focus cameras. You have convergence, so where

452
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,922
those two lines meet going forward. And then you also have focus. So just like turning the

453
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:35,842
focus knob on a camera.

454
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:42,327
most VR headsets are designed with a very specific distance at which convergence and focus

455
00:26:42,427 --> 00:26:48,371
are the same. So the focus will basically be set at 1.5 to 3 meters, somewhere in that range.

456
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:53,655
If you're spending a lot of time in particular in the UI, if you can put most of your stuff at

457
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:58,538
that location where your headset is designed for focus and convergence meeting together,

458
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:01,941
you're going to be able to spend the most time in that experience and keep your eyes

459
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:02,361
comfortable.

460
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,301
46, keep the text big. Big is subjective. Right now in this first generation or maybe second

461
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:14,842
generation of VR headsets, we don't have a whole lot of pixel density. Generally speaking,

462
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:20,444
you should sort of assume that you can get a lot less information into your UI than you could

463
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:24,565
if you were designing for a typical mobile phone screen. Think about that as a constraint.

464
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:29,546
A couple points on smartphone VR. This is sort of like its own little challenge here.

465
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:36,713
number 47, a well designed elbow model can make interactions feel natural. There are a lot of

466
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:41,636
ways, sometimes we think with our daydream controller coming out soon, you think all we

467
00:27:41,656 --> 00:27:46,519
really have is a laser pointer. That laser pointer, first of all you can get a little bit of

468
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,763
acceleration information out of there. But also if you think about rather than that laser

469
00:27:52,783 --> 00:27:54,664
pointer being attached to your belly button or something,

470
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:59,687
If you assume, let's say your player is right handed or you let them choose their handedness

471
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:06,611
and you take that orientation information and assume that that controller is attached to a

472
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:12,375
rigid surface like an elbow, you can get a pretty good estimate of where that hand might

473
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:13,776
actually be in physical space.

474
00:28:14,176 --> 00:28:16,338
And this is kind of just an example of where we're using

475
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:18,600
those sorts of heuristics that we call an elbow model.

476
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,122
Some of you are probably already familiar

477
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:21,443
with the neck model as well.

478
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:24,165
Like we generally in VR, we sort of assume

479
00:28:24,225 --> 00:28:26,928
that this is not the center of where we're pivoting our head.

480
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:28,209
It's actually somewhere back here.

481
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:29,550
We take that into account.

482
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:32,153
It's the same kind of idea applied to your elbow

483
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:33,134
instead of applied to your neck.

484
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:36,709
So just take that into account. Number 48, performance matters.

485
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:39,612
I mean, performance matters for everything. We really need to

486
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:44,218
keep our frame rates 60fps, 90fps, 120fps. But with

487
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:47,522
smartphone VR, we just have a much smaller CPU and GPU budget.

488
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:52,763
All right. A couple of minutes left. Let's get into the final takeaways. Number 49, check out

489
00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:58,244
what others are doing. You don't have to go down all these dead ends yourself. Like, you

490
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:02,125
probably know this, which is why you're here, right? Check out other people's successes.

491
00:29:02,185 --> 00:29:05,325
Check out other people's failures. Talk about what people have done. Share your

492
00:29:05,365 --> 00:29:10,027
prototypes. Encourage other people to share their prototypes. We're not in it alone. And I

493
00:29:10,107 --> 00:29:14,067
really give credit to Valve for establishing a very much like a culture of openness and

494
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:17,768
transparency from the very beginning in a lot of the design of the hardware and software.

495
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:24,874
And number 50, finally, you're a pioneer. Think big. This is just the very start. And we have

496
00:29:25,234 --> 00:29:29,878
barely scratched the surface of what's going to be done in VR. So don't just iterate on

497
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:34,622
something that you've seen or tried already. I really want to encourage you to have the

498
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:38,786
courage to take a big step in a totally new direction.

499
00:29:39,587 --> 00:29:44,631
And I really believe that the best VR experiences aren't going to be evolutionary offshoots of

500
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:49,554
other forms of media. They're going to be experiences that can really only exist in VR.

501
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:56,339
Rather than thinking how can we adapt game X for VR, think about what new doors have been

502
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,383
opened by this hardware that weren't opened before. And with that, I'll open it up for

503
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:02,204
questions. Thank you.

504
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,278
So I think we have time for maybe one or two questions.

505
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:14,280
And please use the mic.

506
00:30:16,262 --> 00:30:16,342
Hi.

507
00:30:16,803 --> 00:30:19,126
You talked a little bit about the VR,

508
00:30:19,346 --> 00:30:20,728
like the Daydream controller.

509
00:30:20,828 --> 00:30:22,470
Could you give more details about that?

510
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:29,653
The details are out there online. The basic idea is you're sending orientation. So it has a

511
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:35,154
magnetometer and accelerometer and gyros. So you have access to acceleration and

512
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:40,175
orientation. So it's a 3DOF controller. But just because it's 3DOF doesn't mean you can only

513
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:44,396
get orientation. You can get a lot of data out of that controller. We've even done some

514
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:48,376
experiments where, for instance, by moving forward or backward, we sort of try to guess.

515
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,618
of circular spaces in front of the user and try to guess which

516
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:56,140
one you're in to get a little bit of 6DoFness out of that

517
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,481
controller. So we're looking forward to a lot more

518
00:30:58,521 --> 00:31:03,823
experiments there. Google has released a thing called the

519
00:31:03,843 --> 00:31:06,964
playground. I think that's its external name. Where we basically

520
00:31:07,004 --> 00:31:11,366
give 8 to 10 different demos of how you can use that controller

521
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:16,028
for interesting applications. Other questions?

522
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,375
I think we might have one more there.

523
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:32,272
Okay, so you've made like 80 plus prototypes now.

524
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,176
Are any of those becoming real things?

525
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:42,279
I sure hope so. I mean, definitely a lot of this knowledge we are putting into our various

526
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,600
products across Google. There are lots of little prototypes that we've done where a team

527
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,961
will say, hey, we want to test out this particular user interface model or this particular

528
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:56,562
interaction, but it's just like, you know, working on our first party tools with rigorous

529
00:31:56,582 --> 00:32:00,303
code check-ins, we can't do it quickly with what we have. Can you try that out and then we'll

530
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:04,644
take those gems that you figured out and put it into our products. But there are some

531
00:32:04,704 --> 00:32:05,124
products.

532
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:08,045
that I'm really excited, for instance, that animator system,

533
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:11,066
currently we're working on making that a multiplayer

534
00:32:11,086 --> 00:32:15,027
system, which has a whole new level of complexity that gets

535
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:18,449
added on top of that. Mindshow has already done an amazing job

536
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:21,030
of this. I'm really looking forward to that being out. But

537
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,731
I'm hoping that some more of these will become real products.

538
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:28,132
Me too. Thanks. I think that's all we've got time for. It's

539
00:32:28,152 --> 00:32:30,453
about 10.02, but I'll be around if other people want to ask

540
00:32:30,493 --> 00:32:31,553
questions after. Thank you.
