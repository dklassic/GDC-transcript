1
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:08,969
What successful product managers do differently in free-to-play games?

2
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:16,932
Well, this was actually the question that I asked myself some six to seven months ago

3
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:20,434
when I was offered a role as a head of product management at Rovio.

4
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:24,136
And the thing is, even though I had the experience,

5
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:26,537
so I worked as a product manager first at Digital Chocolate,

6
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:29,938
then at Supercell and Rovio, and then in more of a...

7
00:00:30,723 --> 00:00:33,865
game leadership roles as an executive producer at Zynga,

8
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:35,346
and then studio lead at FunPlus.

9
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:38,549
So even though I had the experience of working as a

10
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,791
product manager, hiring product managers, and managing

11
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,174
product managers, I never really sat down and

12
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:49,677
conceptualized what makes a good, successful product

13
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:52,139
manager, and most importantly, what do those successful

14
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,120
product managers are doing differently.

15
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:01,911
So I approach this in the typical core loop.

16
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:06,155
What I mean by that is in order to really find out what

17
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:10,819
the successful product managers are doing differently,

18
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:13,662
I first talk to my friends, my colleagues, and people I know

19
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:17,065
from various amazing companies like Facebook, Zynga,

20
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:21,248
Wargaming, Natural Motion, FunPlus, EA, you name it.

21
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,570
And I ask them two questions.

22
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:27,555
Firstly is, what makes a great product manager?

23
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:31,739
And the second question was more detailed.

24
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,081
And that was, can you tell me about a situation where a

25
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:38,224
product manager was succeeding, when they did more

26
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:38,844
than you expected?

27
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:43,147
Based on these questions and based on the multiple answers

28
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:46,070
that I got from my friends and colleagues, I sort of

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,491
deconstructed the information.

30
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,441
and conceptualize it into different themes.

31
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:54,762
And with those themes, I got back to my colleagues

32
00:01:54,762 --> 00:01:57,503
and friends and got more feedback,

33
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:00,984
again, deconstructed our feedback, and so forth,

34
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:03,204
and so forth, until this place.

35
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:08,446
So as a result, I got five elements

36
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:10,647
that successful product managers do differently

37
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:11,587
in free-to-play games.

38
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:17,941
But before we jump in into those five elements,

39
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:21,304
let's talk about what do product managers actually do.

40
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:24,227
And the first thing that you might think of

41
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,130
is they animate a lot their presentations.

42
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,433
And you're absolutely right.

43
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:31,354
But in addition to that.

44
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:37,838
What product managers do is actually tasks of both highly creative elements,

45
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:40,459
like defining, designing, and managing key features,

46
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,640
discovering and creating growth levers,

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,441
but also very many analytical tasks,

48
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,742
such as building quantitative models,

49
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:49,063
owning and analyzing game metrics,

50
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:51,524
and overall just managing the business performance.

51
00:02:52,977 --> 00:02:55,578
But the role is actually even more complicated, because it

52
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:58,960
changes not only based on these tasks, but it also

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,321
changes based on the lifecycle of the product, whether in

54
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,742
pre-production, production, soft launch, or live

55
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:08,783
operations, as well as the culture and the organization

56
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:09,263
of the company.

57
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:14,526
So the way I see it, and the way I like to present it, is I

58
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:17,107
would say product managers have two key goals.

59
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,988
The first goal is owning the business side of the game.

60
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:25,610
And what I mean by that is that in the internal battle of CPI

61
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,131
versus LTV, the product managers definitely

62
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:29,272
represent the LTV side.

63
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:33,554
And they focus on the metrics of growth, of retention, and

64
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:34,594
the monetization.

65
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:37,455
And their design thinking and their overall goal thinking

66
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:38,876
starts with those metrics first.

67
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:41,817
And they make their decision based on that.

68
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:45,619
The second key goal that I feel product managers have is

69
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,595
Helping the leadership make decisions.

70
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:52,797
And why I have an image of a hit man is,

71
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:58,241
okay, product managers don't really have the,

72
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:03,184
we don't have the ability always to pull the trigger.

73
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:05,146
But because we do the analysis,

74
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:07,507
because we do the due diligence,

75
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:09,349
and because we do a lot of the designs,

76
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,990
we essentially have the power to adjust the aim.

77
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,012
And that's why product managers' goal

78
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:16,333
is to support the decision making.

79
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:22,939
All right, let's go to the details.

80
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:26,120
The first thing that I feel successful product managers do

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,981
differently in free-to-play games is they use data to find

82
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,922
the low-hanging fruits.

83
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:35,123
And what I mean by low-hanging fruit is something that

84
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:38,985
requires minimum amount of engineering work, minimum

85
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:41,606
amount of work actually from art, perhaps, but has a

86
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:42,206
significant impact.

87
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:46,308
Let's start by talking about what isn't a low-hanging fruit.

88
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:50,755
So the normal process of product management or feature

89
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,697
updates, it goes through basically this cycle.

90
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:55,119
You start off with the analysis.

91
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:57,721
You end up in a hypothesis or design.

92
00:04:57,721 --> 00:05:00,323
Then you prioritize that design based on the cost of

93
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:03,205
the work and based on the impact.

94
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:06,068
And the next step is execution of that design, after which

95
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:06,948
it's further analyzed.

96
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:09,631
And then more hypotheses arise.

97
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:10,992
Pretty standard approach.

98
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:12,673
To give a more of a

99
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:17,485
clear example of this type of approach would be, let's say,

100
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:20,127
League Update and Clash of Clans.

101
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:23,269
So as you probably are well aware of this game and have

102
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:26,712
played it before, the way the leagues function and the way

103
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:30,195
the update would have come is the analysis shows that

104
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:33,218
players were abusing the matchmaking system by dropping

105
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:34,339
their trophies.

106
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,721
And that sort of created a double whammy in the sense

107
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:40,124
that those players abusing the matchmaking systems were able

108
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:40,164
to.

109
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:45,675
be matched against weaker players, they were able to raid them quite easily and thus get

110
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:48,377
resources and progress faster through the content.

111
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:53,722
On the other hand, the players that were raided by much stronger opponents were feeling a

112
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:57,766
little bit discouraged and that would probably affect their retention quite significantly.

113
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:04,256
Based on this analysis, that derives both from quantitative metrics as well as qualitative,

114
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:10,422
the hypothesis or the design is made to reward players to stay at certain trophy level and

115
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:14,426
most importantly push them to acquire more trophies and thus be matched against even

116
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:15,467
harder opponents.

117
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:16,848
Because this design...

118
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:21,324
has a big effect and it solves a big question in the game.

119
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:22,785
It gets prioritized high.

120
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:23,585
It gets executed.

121
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:26,587
And then with further analysis, the numbers are being tuned.

122
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,068
And the leak feature is getting improved and improved

123
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:29,628
with every update.

124
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:31,849
So this is not a low-hanging fruit.

125
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,950
This is what you're expected to do.

126
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,971
So let's talk about a low-hanging fruit.

127
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,072
A game called Dragons of Atlantis.

128
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:41,693
I don't know how many of you are familiar with this.

129
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,495
But just to remind you, this was a Kabam game.

130
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:51,818
It could be described as Game of War minus key social features

131
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:53,719
plus dragons.

132
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:56,880
At the time, it was fairly successful.

133
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,742
And the product team and Kabam were having a good time.

134
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:04,302
But the game had some problems.

135
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:07,284
And the key problem was that they

136
00:07:07,284 --> 00:07:11,185
were experiencing a churn of players between citadel levels.

137
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:12,485
So the way it worked is.

138
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:16,424
you upgrade your citadel or your city hall,

139
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:18,566
and that unlocks several more upgrades,

140
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:21,288
both for your troops, your research, your buildings,

141
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:22,869
and then you grind through those,

142
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,530
and then you can upgrade your citadel level again,

143
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,611
and so forth and so forth.

144
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,793
The problem was that they didn't have

145
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:30,935
as much levels for those citadels.

146
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:33,357
And because of that, the citadel levels were...

147
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,543
quite far away from each other, and they were getting further and further away.

148
00:07:37,543 --> 00:07:39,243
And players were honestly just turning out.

149
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:42,965
The metrics were going down as they were progressing through the games, and then players just felt

150
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:44,926
it was too big of a grind to go to the next level.

151
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:51,469
Based on the normal approach of analyzing, hypothesizing, prioritizing, and executing,

152
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:54,631
the product team would have come up with a suggestion of doubling the content of the

153
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:57,092
game, implementing that, and so forth and so forth.

154
00:07:57,705 --> 00:08:00,246
But that's a very slow approach.

155
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,327
So instead, the product team on the game

156
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,148
did something much more simple and more effective.

157
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:09,189
They simply doubled the amount of Citadel levels

158
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,810
without it really touching the amount of level ups there are.

159
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,411
So instead of unlocking 10 new things when leveling up

160
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,472
to level 6 of Citadel, you just unlocked 5.

161
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:19,872
And then on the seventh level, you

162
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:21,053
unlock the rest of the 5.

163
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:23,566
As a result, with this small update,

164
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:27,548
they were able to increase all the metrics from retention

165
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,290
to engagement to monetization.

166
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:35,594
Let's go through another example of an easy low-hanging fruit.

167
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:37,976
And it's a game called Angry Birds Match.

168
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,937
And if you haven't played this game,

169
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:43,560
I would describe it as Candy Crush Saga with Angry Birds

170
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,040
and events.

171
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,043
And events is actually the important part of this game.

172
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:52,015
Let's talk about... yeah, sorry.

173
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:54,355
So events are an important part of this game.

174
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:56,036
And there's two types of events.

175
00:08:56,036 --> 00:09:00,297
There's the seasonal events that last for two weeks or three weeks.

176
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:02,637
They're pretty large and visually they're very different.

177
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:07,639
And then there's the small events that are happening between the bigger seasonal events.

178
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,739
During their latest... not latest but...

179
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:15,107
A couple of events ago, when they were running the Valentine's Day event,

180
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:20,289
what they did differently is, at the end of the event, they added a leaderboard.

181
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:23,270
So as the players went all through 70, 60, 80 different levels,

182
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,932
instead of finishing the event, they ended up in a leaderboard.

183
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:29,973
And that leaderboard was active for as long as the game was active.

184
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:33,484
The product manager on this game, Matteo Speri,

185
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:34,505
analyzed the data.

186
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:37,266
And what he noticed that adding the leaderboard actually

187
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:38,988
significantly increased the engagement.

188
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:42,830
Because it kept those highly engaged players progressing

189
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,911
through all out event.

190
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:45,732
And instead of them finishing the event and waiting for the

191
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:48,174
next one to start, they actually stayed in that event.

192
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:50,275
And that brought a significant increase, not only through

193
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:53,017
engagement, but also through retention and

194
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:54,298
monetization elements.

195
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:58,160
So based on this finding, as the event ended,

196
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:02,179
He made a hypothesis, and that was that when running our

197
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:05,200
smaller events, those who last between 24 to 72 hours, what

198
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,142
if we make a little change?

199
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:11,523
And that change was that after you finish the event, you can

200
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:12,484
finish it again.

201
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:15,305
So you can get double the price, and that's it.

202
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:16,906
It's just a small data tweak.

203
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:21,548
As a result, the KPIs, or the baseline revenue, pretty much

204
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:24,210
increased 20% with a small data change.

205
00:10:25,783 --> 00:10:29,605
So successful product managers are able to look at the data

206
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:33,367
and make quite significant changes without big use from

207
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,308
engineering team.

208
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:39,571
But even though the small hanging fruits, even though

209
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:42,433
we're always looking for those, that's always not the

210
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,295
case, because sometimes you just can't find them, or

211
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:48,396
sometimes the target is just too far off.

212
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:52,238
And that's when breaking down those bigger goals, that's

213
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:53,859
when working on bigger features.

214
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:54,780
You're supposed to.

215
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:58,008
And the successful ones are able to break it down

216
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:59,689
to smaller targets.

217
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:02,429
So let me give an example of how not to do it.

218
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,630
And this is my personal example.

219
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,810
So this is an old game.

220
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,371
It's a Facebook game called Army Attack from maybe eight

221
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:11,672
years ago.

222
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,112
And I was running this as a lead product manager.

223
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:16,953
And I had the goal of increasing the baseline

224
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:17,513
revenue by 20%.

225
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:23,977
And instead of taking the smart approach of really breaking down where the revenue comes

226
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:30,799
from, maybe thinking about adding some core features, increasing the retention, I went

227
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:36,381
with a much straightforward approach, which was this.

228
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:40,803
As a result, yes, the revenue increased and the leadership was very happy, but not for

229
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:41,583
a very long time.

230
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:46,705
Because what I ended up doing is I just changed player behavior, player purchasing behavior.

231
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:51,906
created more work and created cycles in our sales.

232
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:54,108
And overall, just wasn't very smart.

233
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:57,850
So let's talk about a smart example of breaking down big

234
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,351
goals, a game called Dawn of Titans.

235
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,853
I'm sure all of you played it.

236
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:04,915
And those of you who have played it probably know that

237
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:07,016
it's a highly event-driven game.

238
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:14,122
A PM on this game, her name is Kim Gelderbaum, not anymore a PM on this game, but when she

239
00:12:14,122 --> 00:12:20,266
was, she was given a similar goal than I was, and that is increase the revenue, increase

240
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:22,167
the revenue of events by 20%.

241
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:25,549
And her approach was significantly smarter than mine.

242
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:28,173
First, she looked at the low-hanging fruit.

243
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:30,795
Can we increase the funnel for the event, the DAO of the

244
00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:31,375
event, by 20%?

245
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,297
Because that would basically do it.

246
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:34,598
And the answer was no.

247
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:36,960
So what Kim started doing is she started

248
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,261
looking at the data.

249
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:40,663
And more importantly, she started looking at how the

250
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:42,544
best players in the events are behaving.

251
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:45,606
And she found out that the best of the players were the

252
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:48,729
most engaged, that had made the most sessions.

253
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:50,150
They were the most active.

254
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,971
They spent the most time in the game.

255
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,673
And most importantly, they were very active in chats.

256
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:58,630
Based on that, she tweaked the event structure in a way

257
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,696
that the next event was really designed to push players

258
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:04,358
to act as those engaged players.

259
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:06,662
And those highly engaged players were

260
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:10,427
pushed to act just in that way, or even becoming more engaged.

261
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:18,144
Next, she built levers in order to push players to act in the way that was designed.

262
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:23,388
And after that, she created a custom dashboard together with data scientist team that will

263
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:28,030
allow her to follow the event structure, the event progress in real lifetime in order for

264
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,592
her to pull the triggers at the right time.

265
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:35,034
As a result, Kim was able to hit her target to a T at the right time.

266
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,364
and just overall broke down a big goal into smaller,

267
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:42,585
actionable targets and did her due diligence.

268
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:49,588
So, third thing, turning numbers into a story.

269
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:53,990
And as I tried to show in the slide before with the gun,

270
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,130
it's basically saying that.

271
00:13:57,706 --> 00:14:02,307
As a PM, you have a power of affecting the aim, affecting the decision making.

272
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:07,128
And as a game lead, I mean, this is often what you experience.

273
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:11,149
There's constantly new ideas coming in left and right, and they're just dropping on you.

274
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,850
The quest, the raid bosses, everything that you should be doing, and this comes both from

275
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,872
external and internal, and you know, you need to prioritize your roadmap and you need to

276
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:22,272
make the right decisions.

277
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:23,253
And sometimes...

278
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:26,583
it feels like the right decisions aren't

279
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,703
made in the right time.

280
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:30,465
So the successful PMs are able to turn those numbers, turn

281
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:34,748
those analysis more of a story and sell it through that.

282
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,070
As an example, let's get back to Dawn of Titans.

283
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,854
Before there were events for Kim to optimize and grow,

284
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:46,635
there were actually no events in the roadmap at all.

285
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,797
The two PMs working on this team.

286
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,730
Mr. Anil Dasgupta, who's probably in this room, as well

287
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,891
as Lawrence Clark, they created a hypothesis that by

288
00:14:57,891 --> 00:15:01,052
adding events to the game, they would be able to increase

289
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:02,693
the baseline.

290
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,373
They showed the examples from App Annie, like games like

291
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:08,954
Puzzles and Dragons in the east, as well as Grease games

292
00:15:08,954 --> 00:15:13,135
in the west, such as Crime City and War of Nations, I

293
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:14,276
believe, they were all.

294
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:19,423
increasing their baseline by running very good events constantly.

295
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:23,548
But that wasn't enough to convince the leadership that events should be done.

296
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,910
So instead, this happened.

297
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,052
It's a pop-up of a sale.

298
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,154
But it's actually not just a sale.

299
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:34,500
So what the guys did is they created an event by themselves.

300
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:40,296
They tweaked the gotcha a little bit so that the likelihood of getting a very rare titan

301
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:46,819
was increased by tenfold, and that event would run for about three days.

302
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:50,981
They added a pop-up to the game, and they added also a message to the Facebook community,

303
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:54,783
just informing players that this kind of event was going on.

304
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:59,785
As a result, they were able to get some numbers for the story, and the numbers were good because

305
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:03,267
the game hit its highest ARPDAUS during that time.

306
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:09,606
it ended up in the game, in the roadmap being prioritized with the events

307
00:16:09,606 --> 00:16:12,048
and the game running through the event cadence.

308
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:15,611
Example number two.

309
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:19,354
Clash of Clans and Japan.

310
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,676
So, sometimes...

311
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:25,688
So why telling a story through the numbers is important?

312
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:27,730
Because sometimes we just don't have enough data.

313
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,691
We think that something is really important, and we just

314
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:30,952
don't have enough data to show it.

315
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:34,855
And it's great to have A-B testing, it's great to have

316
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:36,396
sequential testing, it's great to have the analysis.

317
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,797
But sometimes you see something else being done by

318
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,919
others, and you're trying to pull that data, but it's just

319
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,760
not as concrete.

320
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,382
And that's when telling a story is important.

321
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:49,144
And that was kind of the case of the launch of Clash of

322
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:49,865
Clans in Japan.

323
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:55,142
So before the game was launched or relaunched in Japan.

324
00:16:55,782 --> 00:17:00,804
The KPIs were very good for the audience, but it wasn't localized or culturalized.

325
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:06,607
The normal approach when you're seeing good KPIs is basically you contact your localization partner,

326
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:09,048
you set up the order for that localization, it comes in, there's a QA,

327
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:12,569
and then it goes to the next update and hopefully it'll increase your number a little bit.

328
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,730
But the story of Japan was a little bit different.

329
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:24,214
At that time, Puzzles & Dragons alone was making more money than Clash of Clans in Japan than Clash of Clans in Japan.

330
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:29,159
At that time, the Puzzles and Dragons were making more money in Japan alone than Clash

331
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:30,420
of Clans throughout the world.

332
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,221
So that meant that there was a big market.

333
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:38,563
The second part of the story was that highly successful Western games such as Farmville

334
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:42,684
and Candy Crush Saga were not that big of a success in Japan, despite going through

335
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:47,326
the normal localization route, despite doing the marketing, despite doing their due diligence.

336
00:17:47,326 --> 00:17:51,367
So the team looked for a way to be big in Japan.

337
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:58,583
a plan was created and that plan would take actually three to four times longer to implement

338
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,091
than to simply pushing out a new localization update.

339
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:06,760
Yet the story behind it was that it really put the game

340
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,502
into a position where it could be successful in the

341
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:10,683
Japanese market.

342
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:13,605
And thus, the leadership decided to go through this

343
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:15,687
slow, more riskier route.

344
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:18,629
And as a result, the game was actually, I believe, first

345
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:21,371
Western mobile game that hit top 10 grossing in the

346
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:22,032
Japanese market.

347
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:30,958
Four, leveraging the knowledge of the peers.

348
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:39,877
This is an interesting topic, and it's actually...

349
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:43,579
OK, so leveraging knowledge of the peers.

350
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,140
There's two elements in the knowledge leveraging.

351
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,461
The one is that there's so much information coming both

352
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,621
internally and externally that a product manager needs to

353
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:51,982
handle at all time.

354
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:54,102
By external information, I mean the information that is

355
00:18:54,102 --> 00:18:56,223
coming just through the market change.

356
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:57,323
You're looking at the market.

357
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:58,384
You're looking at what's going on.

358
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,964
You're looking at your own category.

359
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:02,805
You're looking at the games, what kind of

360
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:04,145
updates they're doing.

361
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:05,906
And then there's the internal information.

362
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:08,147
As a product manager, you're pretty much expected to know

363
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:13,447
not expect it, you have to know what's going on with your game, you have to know how your

364
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:16,848
cohorts are behaving, you have to know how your updates are influencing them.

365
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:20,829
And that knowledge is constantly increasing as well.

366
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,550
With all the new A-B tests, with all the new game launches, it's almost impossible to keep

367
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,231
the track of that yourself.

368
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:30,072
And that's why leveraging knowledge of your peers, of others, is important.

369
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:34,653
A good example of a culture of knowledge sharing is Zynga.

370
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:40,036
At Zynga, the knowledge sharing is being run by the team called Central Product Management.

371
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:44,438
And the knowledge sharing is actually divided into three different categories.

372
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:49,960
First is the numbers reviews, and sort of a general business updates that are done every

373
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,801
three to four weeks.

374
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:55,403
During those updates, basically PMs together with GMs go through their game, kind of update

375
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:59,344
what's going on on the business side, what have been done, how that affected, and what

376
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:00,825
is being done in the future.

377
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,666
Then you have a more...

378
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:08,327
intimate setting of knowledge sharing, and that is product launches.

379
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:13,470
So during product launches, the product managers actually show what kind of different A-B tests,

380
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,332
what kind of different analysis of the new features have been launched, and share that

381
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:19,814
detailed information with their peers.

382
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:26,218
And thirdly, there's the knowledge sharing of competitive insights, where there's a specific

383
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:29,200
team just looking at different type of games that have been launched and deconstructing

384
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,522
those games and providing product managers with that information.

385
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:38,109
Now you might ask, what this has to do with a successful product management?

386
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:40,150
I mean, this is just a description of a process.

387
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:40,350
True.

388
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,751
But it sets up this next example.

389
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:47,913
Angry Birds Evolution, or more specifically, the lead product manager

390
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,413
in this game, Dylan Tredere.

391
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,611
What he did was really interesting.

392
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:55,012
So as the game launched, as he went through soft launch and

393
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:57,073
launch, there was constantly more and more

394
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:58,414
need of information.

395
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:00,835
People were asking him both internally, as well as outside

396
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:02,636
the team, what's going on, what has he been learning,

397
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,917
what are the A-B tests, and so forth and so forth.

398
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:07,198
So instead of being a sort of a

399
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:13,836
reactive knowledge share, he set up a meeting every Friday at about 2 p.m. that lasts between

400
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:19,222
five minutes to 35 minutes. This meeting was called Numbers Review and everybody was pretty

401
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:24,247
much invited to this meeting and it turned out from kind of like a reactive knowledge

402
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:28,772
sharing to proactive knowledge sharing. And instead of him trying to answer those rapid

403
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:31,855
questions, he would have people come in on that specific day.

404
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:36,250
But it didn't just do that, it did something more.

405
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,194
So the meeting was really successful, and it's successful

406
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:41,797
in terms of you went there and actually learned more about

407
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:42,158
the game.

408
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:45,081
And what we decided to do is we actually pushed it forward,

409
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:48,566
and now it's something that we do company-wide, where we

410
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:48,906
have

411
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:53,429
a one numbers review meeting where product managers and product leads are invited and

412
00:21:53,429 --> 00:22:00,352
we go quickly in about one hour through the key updates as well as key A-B tests and sequential

413
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,655
tests and analysis of the different features and that kind of grew up into a knowledge

414
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:05,775
sharing meeting.

415
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:11,058
So what Dylan essentially did is he created a knowledge sharing group where that wasn't

416
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:11,838
really before.

417
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:20,932
Another example of knowledge sharing is this blog,

418
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:22,933
Deconstructor Fun.

419
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:27,094
Actually, do you mind raising your head for a second if

420
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:28,875
you've ever heard about it?

421
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,536
OK, that's crazy.

422
00:22:31,536 --> 00:22:35,658
So Deconstructor Fun, I started writing this blog

423
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:36,538
about six years ago.

424
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:39,679
And it was honestly just something that I did in order

425
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,820
to improve my own learnings.

426
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,641
And it's still something I do just to learn.

427
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:43,981
And

428
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,763
Throughout the time, there's just more and more games that were launched, more interesting

429
00:22:49,763 --> 00:22:54,806
games, and the games got deeper, and it's almost impossible for one person to really

430
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:55,546
cover those.

431
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:59,909
At the same time, there were great people who started writing their own blogs, such

432
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:04,372
as Anil S. Gupta with Both Guns Blazing and Adam Telfer with Mobile Free-to-Play.

433
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:06,633
And it's kind of turned into this weird...

434
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:11,375
I don't know for them, but it turned for me into this weird kind of competition where

435
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,417
I was trying to write better deconstruction instead of learning.

436
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:14,737
It's just, it was weird.

437
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:21,261
So what I tried to do with them is I asked them like, would you like to learn together?

438
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:23,503
Would you like to work together?

439
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,864
And happily, they said yes.

440
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:29,166
And I learned that I didn't know anything.

441
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:33,320
So by surrounding myself with really smart people that I

442
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,542
truly respected, it really leveraged the knowledge.

443
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:41,324
And in short, what I'm trying to say is, you might think you

444
00:23:41,324 --> 00:23:44,165
know something, but until you surround yourself with people

445
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:47,547
you respect, who are able to criticize, who are smart, you

446
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:49,188
actually don't know shit.

447
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:56,171
And final one is understanding why different people like

448
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:56,832
different games.

449
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:03,547
Quite often, surprisingly often, I've talked to product

450
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:05,529
managers, and they weren't that interested

451
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:06,550
about games, per se.

452
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,414
They were doing this for something that they felt would

453
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:13,457
progress their careers and progress them to become

454
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:17,821
somewhat service managers, e-commerce people or app

455
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:21,164
people, but the most successful ones are the ones

456
00:24:21,164 --> 00:24:21,905
who are actually.

457
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:23,916
who actually like games.

458
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:27,542
And it's not just about liking games, because everybody in

459
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:28,523
this room loves games.

460
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:31,829
There's Fortnite players, League of Legends players,

461
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:34,292
Candy Crush Saga players, you name it.

462
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:36,836
But what really separates a successful product manager

463
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:37,898
from others is they're able to

464
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:43,541
to get deeper into the games and actually understand why do different people like them?

465
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:48,123
Not just playing always Candy Crush Saga or always Fortnite or always League of Legends

466
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:52,886
and not just outsourcing this question to the qualitative research team but actually

467
00:24:52,886 --> 00:24:54,787
attempting to answer it yourself.

468
00:24:54,787 --> 00:25:02,991
That ladies and gentlemen concludes my presentation and please open for questions.

469
00:25:11,738 --> 00:25:20,104
Hello. You mentioned Clash of Clans had a strategy to go to Japan and that they were really successful.

470
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:23,646
I'm really curious to know what was that strategy?

471
00:25:23,646 --> 00:25:30,731
So the strategy, like in details of what the strategy was?

472
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:33,133
Yeah, as detailed as you can be.

473
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:33,873
I'm a bit brief.

474
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:39,580
I'll be very brief and I'll just say that the strategy involved creating a lot of partnerships

475
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,723
with local partners in Japan as well as focusing on culturalization of the game and getting

476
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:49,746
the stamp of approval so that the Japanese players felt that this game was made by Japanese.

477
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:50,686
Okay.

478
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:59,311
I expect somebody to ask the question of what's the difference between designer and product

479
00:25:59,311 --> 00:25:59,671
manager.

480
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:05,069
Hi, great talk.

481
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:09,171
I am a data scientist who's working with the PMs oftentimes

482
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:13,174
about how to improve the monetization and the metrics

483
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:15,395
that we really care about.

484
00:26:15,395 --> 00:26:20,238
I was wondering if you can give us any tips about how

485
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:23,560
to communicate with the PMs from a data scientist

486
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,782
perspective, and especially when talking about the

487
00:26:26,782 --> 00:26:29,904
statistics and numbers.

488
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:30,724
Yeah, for sure.

489
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:35,558
I'll tell you what the data scientist told me.

490
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:39,099
And that was basically the question of why.

491
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,520
Like why are you looking at this specific number?

492
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,162
And instead of answering always to what the product

493
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:48,363
managers are asking you, ask them why are they asking that.

494
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:50,704
And then you get to the root of the problem.

495
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,101
Hey, great talk, thank you.

496
00:26:58,101 --> 00:26:59,322
Thank you.

497
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:02,606
Quick question, where do you see the lines being drawn

498
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:04,668
between design, product, and production?

499
00:27:04,668 --> 00:27:11,995
Okay, so it all depends on the ownerships.

500
00:27:14,572 --> 00:27:15,472
Let's put it this way.

501
00:27:15,472 --> 00:27:17,732
So if you have to break it down into very clear

502
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:20,873
ownerships, I would say that the product manager would have

503
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,674
the ownership of the business side of the game, so making

504
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:26,815
sure that it's a successful product, per se.

505
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:29,036
It doesn't mean that the product manager is the only

506
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:31,256
person who makes those decisions, but he owns that

507
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:35,198
part. The design owns the part that the players like, love,

508
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:37,378
and just enjoy the game.

509
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:41,199
And the producer owns the fact that the updates are coming on

510
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,480
time, that they're not.

511
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:47,160
that they're not filled with bugs and that the production is going forward as planned.

512
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,605
So that would be a very high level divide of those three.

513
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:51,026
All right, thank you.
