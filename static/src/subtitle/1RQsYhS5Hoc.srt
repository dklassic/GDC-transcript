1
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,062
What up, what up, what up everybody?

2
00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:12,884
It's your boy, DJ Rockman.

3
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:16,127
One part of the Maverick Hunters with your boy MegaRan.

4
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:17,968
I'm just going to play a quick tune real quick.

5
00:00:17,988 --> 00:00:19,590
We're going to just start it off just like this.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,391
Get some Mario love in here.

7
00:02:55,383 --> 00:03:00,905
I am DJ Rockman, but I'm going to go ahead and hand it off to my partner in crime.

8
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:31,609
Yo, yo, yo, I can't see you in the chat. I can't feel you in the chat, but

9
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:37,126
I want to make sure that we are making a connection beyond camera and space.

10
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:40,228
So if you could in the chat, give me whatever your favorite emoji is.

11
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:43,871
Yeah, didn't have to wear a tuxedo to touch people.

12
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:46,913
Never moved rock, wasn't trying to see Judge Ito.

13
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:49,035
If it don't fit, you must have quit it.

14
00:03:49,135 --> 00:03:50,976
And if it do fit, you must have did it.

15
00:03:51,137 --> 00:03:51,837
I wasn't with it.

16
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:53,598
Focused on my love for hip-hop.

17
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,400
Went and flip-flopped to get props.

18
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,381
Try to keep it fresh like a Ziploc.

19
00:03:57,982 --> 00:04:02,265
Similar to the games of yesterday, I blow the dust away, they still fresh today.

20
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:06,088
Reminisce to the first time I set it up, way past bedtime.

21
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:08,070
Wouldn't stop playing till we leveled up.

22
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,814
Fingers blistered, suffering from fatigue, while teachers wonder why I got a bad attitude.

23
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:18,758
Headed to class like Hessman in 86, regrettably passed the freshmen that gave me fits.

24
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:23,922
See they all come back, glad I taught em, I support em, although they seem to fall like autumn.

25
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:25,904
Back in the 80s when it begun.

26
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:28,546
Recall in DC, rockin' the T to say,

27
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,467
Run, Jesse, run.

28
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,309
Galactus tactics require straight jackets

29
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:34,691
To skip the viruses, we installed the patches.

30
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,133
Took the scenic route to find the fundamentals.

31
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,156
Inc is my drink too, so this ain't coincidental.

32
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:42,758
K. Murdoch made the call to Magaran.

33
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:45,440
We veterans, goin' strong til forever, man.

34
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,043
Might not be real, who knows what's real.

35
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:55,469
But they will never know what keeps us together.

36
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,933
I know we're young, I know we're young.

37
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:06,800
But if we come this far, we'll be here forever.

38
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,340
Pause.

39
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:12,084
Oh yeah, let me continue, this game don't stop, another day, another venue.

40
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:16,368
And if they make it a game of everything I've been through, that joint'll probably be rated

41
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:21,413
M. I say again, first they drop you in the middle of the hood, no communication skills

42
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:22,814
so you couldn't be understood.

43
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:28,079
Only one life, no save slots, yeah, enemies and party members that live on the same block.

44
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:31,841
And your HP and MP are dang near empty, huh?

45
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,563
And you can't max out, no battery backup.

46
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:38,005
If you back out, gotta start it all over again fresh.

47
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:41,107
You'd probably be impressed how I managed to cheat death

48
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,328
and take it out the hood with no regrets.

49
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:46,830
But I gotta thank that little gray lights with the red lights

50
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:48,311
there right in front of you.

51
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,512
I spent every night.

52
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:53,154
Might not be real, who knows what's real?

53
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,236
But if we never know.

54
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:59,396
We'll be here forever.

55
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:12,303
I know we're young. I know we're young. But if we've come this far, we'll be here forever.

56
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:16,466
A little earthbound to start it off. Thank you very much. Oh, let me adjust the lights here.

57
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:21,909
All right. Remember, I can't see you, so I only got to feel you. That's what I need. I need to feel you.

58
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,790
and your energy and your presence.

59
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,691
So, my name is Mega Ran.

60
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,113
Thank you. Big shout out to DJ Rockman,

61
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:29,614
my Maverick Hunters partner.

62
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:31,815
We travel up and down these roads where we used to,

63
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,257
back when people did concerts, and we used to do our little

64
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:35,717
one-two-thang, rappin',

65
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:38,179
DJin', and providing entertainment.

66
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,180
And now, we come right to your living room.

67
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,402
We are busting through your TV on this Thursday night.

68
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:46,443
Hope you've enjoyed GDC for the summer.

69
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:47,424
I hope you learned something.

70
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:49,044
Hope you got some great entertainment.

71
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,986
My friend 88bit, who actually played on that song

72
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:54,847
that we just heard, he played yesterday.

73
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:56,028
So I really hope you enjoyed it.

74
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:59,269
So I'm gonna get all my, what they call,

75
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,410
fan service tracks out of the way.

76
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,212
Like the tracks that if you don't know them,

77
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:06,053
you know the game that they came from.

78
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:08,854
So I should start with this one

79
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:10,155
from a good friend of mine, Will Roche.

80
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:12,739
Let's go to some Mortal Kombat.

81
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,500
Test your might.

82
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,201
Test your might.

83
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:19,761
Test your might.

84
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:20,361
Test my might.

85
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,222
Are you ready for a fatality?

86
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:24,843
Give me a fire emoji in the chat.

87
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:26,304
And somebody scream, Mortal Kombat!

88
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:26,744
Mortal Kombat!

89
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:27,264
Mortal Kombat!

90
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:28,604
Mortal Kombat!

91
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:31,826
Mortal Kombat!

92
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:36,507
You ready for combat?

93
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:37,848
Are you ready for combat?

94
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:38,388
Ah!

95
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:44,163
I'm at the helm, never break and I never bend.

96
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:47,384
Netherrealm, give and take, never let them win.

97
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:50,624
Never ran, never will, this is in my skin.

98
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:53,825
In my blood for the love, this will never end.

99
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:56,886
Eleven years, lost peers, I can recommend.

100
00:07:57,246 --> 00:08:00,247
When death's knocking at the door, never let them in.

101
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:03,448
Through the breaks, through the cruises, and through the cracks.

102
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:06,489
Do your worst, do your works, man I'm coming back!

103
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:11,830
Do you jerk universe bow when I spit a rap fatality on every track?

104
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:18,332
It's a rap anytime anyplace. They ready for any attack. You'll aspire to a back in a style

105
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:23,693
That's the fact I've been ready for war ready for this is the day I was born. I said it before

106
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:25,773
I never let a competitor score

107
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:32,135
Bring on the core cuz I'm gonna get mine you better get yours like never before you coming at me. You better be sure

108
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:45,051
This is Mortal Kombat, we take it to the limit and we go beyond that.

109
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:56,902
This is Mortal Kombat, we take it to the limit and we go beyond that.

110
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:05,900
Man, thank you so much for that.

111
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,402
I, um, when I first heard that track, I was playing it and I was like, man,

112
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:12,484
that sounds like a rap beat. And then very many months later,

113
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,887
I get a phone call or an email phone calls, more dramatic.

114
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:19,509
So I'll pretend it's a phone call. I get a phone call and it's Will Roger.

115
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:23,451
He's like, Hey man, uh, do you know a rival? I'm like, yeah, I do.

116
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:27,934
He's a great guy. Uh, super square. Yeah. Great guy. Um,

117
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:30,136
well I want to have him in you rap.

118
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:35,832
on the Mortal Kombat ending theme and I was like wait Mortal Kombat you mean like that Mortal Kombat

119
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:40,917
you mean like the Mortal Kombat I've been playing ever since I was a little kid Mortal Kombat from

120
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:50,166
1992 blood code a b b a a c a c or a b a c yeah a yeah you know it I know it I was like yeah 1992

121
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:53,826
Heck yeah, I wanna do it.

122
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:55,966
And then, dream came true.

123
00:09:56,226 --> 00:09:57,587
So, big shout out to WorldWallJ.

124
00:09:57,607 --> 00:09:59,067
I hope you caught his panel.

125
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,188
This guy, genius.

126
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:04,809
I loved his music before I even knew what he did.

127
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:08,710
Because he did Medal of Honor Underground.

128
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,531
Y'all know nothing about that.

129
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,672
But if you do, I'm not gonna hate on you.

130
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:17,193
Anyway, let me continue my fan service portion of the set.

131
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:17,393
So,

132
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:20,474
bounty hunting.

133
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,979
A very, very intense profession.

134
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,660
So you get in and you get out.

135
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:30,701
And you don't play no games.

136
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,242
So I want you all to type, this is the way.

137
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:34,802
It's easy. Everybody type it.

138
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:35,863
This is the way.

139
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,743
In the guilt we follow the code.

140
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,184
I can bring you in warm or I can bring you in cold.

141
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:40,865
This is the way.

142
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:45,455
No revisions or edits, first we set it on the target, then we divvy the credits.

143
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:50,343
It's the way, 20 bars of best guard steel, new armor, respect our guild, chill.

144
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,987
This is the way, stop anyone who get in the way.

145
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:56,112
No escape, no getting away, cause this is the way.

146
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,353
Man, though, keep unlimited ammo.

147
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:01,153
Roll like a commando, the danger is ample.

148
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:03,834
Banished from the surface, we slip in the shadows, man.

149
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:05,974
I come again, so we sit on the mantle.

150
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:06,234
Hey!

151
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,675
Armor shining like the sun's on Tatooine.

152
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,376
Heart knows no fear, runs on gasoline.

153
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:14,396
I'm like the wind, no noise when I deploy, y'all poised.

154
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,277
Just don't team me with no droids,

155
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:18,877
cause I can't trust them involving with no plans.

156
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:21,418
I can't expect anything that could be programmed.

157
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,818
That's the cast of the guild if I close the deal.

158
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,259
So for real, only take a noble kill.

159
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:26,399
You.

160
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,079
You know the deal.

161
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,101
Hold the steel just to forge it.

162
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,361
Fortify like a fortress.

163
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:31,742
The drip is just gorgeous.

164
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:32,983
Techniques and swordiness.

165
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:34,263
Activated in audience.

166
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:35,524
New republicans onto us.

167
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:36,785
Thingam this like a scorpion.

168
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:39,326
Maybe it was my gaudiness and the will of a warrior.

169
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:40,647
The Mandalorian.

170
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:42,068
And this is the way.

171
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:43,489
And again we follow the code.

172
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:45,250
I can bring you in warm or I can bring you in cold.

173
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:45,350
Jump.

174
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:45,670
Jump.

175
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:45,790
Jump.

176
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:45,910
Jump.

177
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,110
Jump.

178
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:46,230
Jump.

179
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:46,390
Jump.

180
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:46,550
Jump.

181
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:46,690
Jump.

182
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:46,851
Jump.

183
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:46,951
Jump.

184
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:47,051
Jump.

185
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,151
Jump.

186
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:47,271
Jump.

187
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:47,511
Jump.

188
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:52,222
No revisions or edits. First we set it on the target, then we divvy the credits.

189
00:11:52,923 --> 00:11:56,329
Hey! 20 bars of best guard steel, new armor, respect our guild.

190
00:11:56,469 --> 00:12:01,658
Man, this is the way. I'll stop anyone who get in the way. No escape, get in the way. You know?

191
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:07,400
Five years after the fall of the empire, the most precious targets acquired that inspired

192
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,362
a chase across the galaxy for an interesting prize, like a 50-year-old adorable alien child

193
00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:14,943
with special powers beyond our comprehension.

194
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:20,945
Telekinetic with sensory perception, so intense I smitten, something special suspected, unconventional

195
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,586
methods, the child must be protected.

196
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:25,068
Load up the weapons cause we got problems to solve

197
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:27,690
Stormtroopers and hunters get demolished and dissolved

198
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,930
It's all a part of the job

199
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:30,412
Snipers making me targets

200
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:31,672
Never taking the office

201
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:32,953
They be taking me hostage

202
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:33,914
Enemy of the state

203
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:35,275
For the chances that I take

204
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:36,596
Many think that you got me

205
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:37,817
You're planning for my escape

206
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:39,358
Back in shelters departing

207
00:12:39,378 --> 00:12:40,659
Then bring the search party in

208
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,900
Forgive me for my tardiness

209
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,221
Like Red Thyrum going in

210
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:44,482
Never will my story end

211
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:46,043
You know who I am man

212
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:46,964
The Mandalorian

213
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:48,465
And yo, this is the way

214
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,426
And Nicky O, we follow the code.

215
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:53,066
I can bring you in warm or I can bring you in cold.

216
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:53,486
Yeah!

217
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:55,627
No revisions or edits.

218
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,027
First, we set it on the target.

219
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:58,207
Then we divvy the credits.

220
00:12:58,227 --> 00:12:58,907
This is the way!

221
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:00,848
20 bars of best guard steel.

222
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:01,648
New armor.

223
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,608
Respect our guild.

224
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:03,808
Yeah, this is the way!

225
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:05,729
I'll stop anyone who get in the way.

226
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:06,609
No escape.

227
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,689
No getting away.

228
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:09,109
This is the way.

229
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,650
Right where you are, I want you to say it.

230
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,030
This is the way!

231
00:13:16,203 --> 00:13:17,304
Act like you're a bounty hunter.

232
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:19,145
Everybody say, this is the way.

233
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:23,207
Everybody get your jet pack on and go crazy.

234
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:23,447
Go.

235
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:24,308
This is the way.

236
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:29,350
Act like you're holding a cute little 50 year old child in your hand and go, this is the way.

237
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:39,115
This is the way.

238
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:40,196
Hey, thank you.

239
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:44,116
Alright, y'all. So, a little bit about me. My name is MegaRan.

240
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:47,498
Yeah, you would imagine a name like MegaRan.

241
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:53,241
You can probably guess my favorite game of all time by my name being MegaRan.

242
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:54,242
It's very obvious.

243
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,964
Tetris, y'all. That's correct.

244
00:13:58,765 --> 00:13:59,965
Tetris. That's my jam.

245
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:06,249
Second favorite, though, is probably this game called MegaMan.

246
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,230
Yeah, you heard of it. You heard of it.

247
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:09,931
So I want to play that jam for you.

248
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:11,212
This is a song about...

249
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:20,098
A doctor, an evil doctor, who always has a plan and always gets away, but he's pretty smart and he has great music.

250
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:21,498
This is Dr. Wily.

251
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:29,842
So like, imagine if I asked Dr. Wily and all his super geniusness to sit down and write a rap about why he keeps trying to get one over on Mega Man.

252
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:30,942
This is what he'd say.

253
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:32,983
They'll turn up the beats.

254
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:35,944
Dr. Light could never do this.

255
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:37,905
Mwahahahaha!

256
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:39,485
And that's how it goes.

257
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,057
Feel free to throw up a W, whoever you are.

258
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:43,857
Know what I mean?

259
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:46,738
They used to say it would sound for Westside, but today it sounds for Wally.

260
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:48,099
One of the smartest in the world.

261
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:50,740
Amazing advancements in the field of robotics.

262
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,781
And money was no object, but he never felt the need to make a profit with projects.

263
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,362
He had a best friend, Dr. Light.

264
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:58,683
They could've changed the world if they had stayed together.

265
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:02,785
But is it during a bit of rivalry but what day it changed forever?

266
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:06,787
Why they thought he done enough and no matter how giddy was he was always runner-up

267
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:10,749
He got sicker sicker place built like it was Wily's turn to start coming up

268
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:14,771
See the school had a contest the shit wall technology and shot our progress

269
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,294
While he and Light collaborated, but Light got all the accolades while pressed.

270
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:18,854
Like, yeah!

271
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:21,396
Then he had enough of that, he started acting up,

272
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:23,478
and then he packed his stuff, and though his act was tough,

273
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:24,458
we weren't buying it.

274
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:26,440
See, that's the beginning of a man's science,

275
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,542
that's who might win some, but he just lost one.

276
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:30,523
Light kept building, the Ward's got one.

277
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,525
A table for one, well that's no fun,

278
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:34,546
so he built a robot to call his son.

279
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:36,548
Rock, named for his love for music,

280
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,589
a lab assistant who fleshed his toolkit.

281
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,572
Teenage boy, clumsy, clueless, always amusing.

282
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:42,713
That was the blueprint.

283
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,494
Didn't want him to live all alone.

284
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:46,596
He put another robot named Roll.

285
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:49,438
Life was grand, but little did he know that Wally was coming back.

286
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,559
So, yo!

287
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,761
I was beat, I was played, I was lied to.

288
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:54,722
Unappreciated for all the good I do.

289
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:56,243
They told me chill and I tried to.

290
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:58,705
And I was bothered by survival, crushing my rivals.

291
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:00,667
I'm taking over, nothing can stop me.

292
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:02,689
I'm taking over, nothing can stop me.

293
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:04,630
Stop Wally, do not try me.

294
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,793
It's Doc Wiley, do not try this.

295
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,716
I was beat, I was played, I was lied to.

296
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:10,659
Unappreciated for all the good I do.

297
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:12,221
They told me chill and I tried to.

298
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,705
Not myself, I'm a survival, crush of a rival.

299
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:18,971
I'm taking over, nothing can stop me.

300
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:19,652
Doc Wiley.

301
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:22,696
Do not try me, it's not wily, do not try me.

302
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:26,802
All was well in the city of robots, peace and love, no shots, no cops.

303
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:30,828
Guess who comes back to the block and when danger comes it's likely that it won't knock.

304
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,734
In a lab like a repo man, left all his robots reprogrammed.

305
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:34,954
so

306
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:37,375
he puts on a blue suit and helmet and the arm cannon so he's not

307
00:16:59,006 --> 00:17:02,727
They were not there to be doubted They were there to be so bad, so selfish

308
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,668
Destructus is only objective But if only we'd know he respected

309
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:10,749
Maybe he wouldn't act so reckless I guess his bro is just man respected

310
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:14,570
Can't let him win this fight Time to get equipped, minds get sliced

311
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,570
Rock has Wily in his sight, but he can't bring himself to end his life

312
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:22,551
Well he likes to dock in the caves where they think he'll spend the rest of his day

313
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:27,433
But I heard the other day he is doing Stosen chat saying doctor Wily

314
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:28,633
He was played, I was lied to

315
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:29,559
The Wiley

316
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:40,691
Dr. Wiley. Dr. Wiley, yeah. I'm taking over. Nothing can stop me. Dr. Wiley. Do not try me.

317
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:46,032
It's Dr. Wiley. Joe. Joe. I was beat. I was plead. I was lied to. Unappreciated for all

318
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:50,173
the good I do. They told me chill and I tried to. And that was all about survival, crushing

319
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:54,714
my rival. I'm taking over. Nothing can stop me. I'm taking over. Nothing can stop me.

320
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:58,595
Dr. Wiley. Do not try me. If you're at home, do this dance with me. Go.

321
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:09,449
uh slide uh just slide clap clap clap and then slide with it and then slide with it

322
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,453
and then throw some hips in it and on that last one gotta pause it like

323
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,092
Yeah, boy.

324
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:22,893
Thank you so much.

325
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:23,933
Yeah.

326
00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:27,036
So let's get my name is Mega Ran and now you know why I'm a guy

327
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:28,617
who does Mega Man songs.

328
00:18:29,037 --> 00:18:32,000
So a long time ago and again only because phone calls are

329
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,620
dramatic.

330
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:33,841
I got a phone call.

331
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:37,544
I made this album that had that song on it and 11 more bangers

332
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:38,264
about Mega Man.

333
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,027
Put it out on the internet.

334
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:43,488
This is back in the MySpace days.

335
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:44,309
None of you remember this.

336
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:45,970
This is a really dark time for the internet.

337
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:47,411
Put it on the line.

338
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,623
And then, uh, everybody liked it. People were like, man, this album is so great. So good.

339
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:58,587
Oh man, you're doing your thing, man. You make great music. And then, uh, one day, a bunch of

340
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:06,132
people were like, yo, I really liked this song. And then, um, Capcom heard it and I was like, oh shoot.

341
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:14,317
Capcom called me and was like, hey, are you MegaRan? And I was like, uh, who wants to know?

342
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:17,299
And they were like, it's Capcom. And I was like, yeah, he's not here.

343
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:21,091
But then I felt like, you know what? I can't lie.

344
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:24,453
So they were like, you know what, is this you? And I was like, yeah, it is.

345
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:28,235
And they were like, so we wanted to talk to you about this Mega Man album.

346
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:31,978
And I was like, what about it? And they were like, look,

347
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,058
I don't know if you knew,

348
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:36,221
but it's kind of illegal to do the thing you did where you just like sampled our

349
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:40,143
stuff and didn't tell us. And I was like, I didn't know you couldn't do that.

350
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:44,446
I, I, I kinda, I kinda knew, I knew, I had an idea.

351
00:19:45,955 --> 00:19:49,399
That's not important. So I was like, Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't know. And they were like, well,

352
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,703
we got some even, even crazier news for you. And I'm like, Oh God,

353
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:57,268
the lawyers are outside my door right now. He's like, no silly. We love it.

354
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:02,909
We love it so much that we'd love to have you work with us on some songs.

355
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:03,750
And I was like, what?

356
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,073
So that was my first experience in the gaming industry.

357
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:09,896
I got invited to San Diego Comic-Con.

358
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,197
I got invited to E3.

359
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:12,638
I got invited to Evo.

360
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,502
I got so many cool things I started going to, and it just opened my life.

361
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,125
And GDC was one of the places I went after that.

362
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,101
It was like my first year doing this full time.

363
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:25,523
So for that reason, GDC is super special to me.

364
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:29,184
So it's awesome to have come full circle almost 10 years later

365
00:20:29,204 --> 00:20:32,646
and be now doing a show with GDC.

366
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:33,387
So this is cool.

367
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,648
I was supposed to do an after party during GDC.

368
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:43,361
Uh in way back when it was supposed to happen in March, um, I had like three after parties in San Francisco planned

369
00:20:43,762 --> 00:20:48,226
And like i'm not an after party dj kind of guy but like I am when money's good

370
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:53,070
So what happened was the money was really good and I was like, absolutely. I want to do after parties

371
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,853
And so I started I was like i'm that kind of dj now and I was like yo

372
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:59,955
My schedule is packed with all these cool events

373
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:01,997
And then kovid was like

374
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:08,615
F your plants, F your life.

375
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,157
And here we are at home.

376
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:11,757
But you know what?

377
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:15,680
At home though, it's allowed me to watch a lot of good TV.

378
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,761
And here's a song I wrote about a good TV show.

379
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:23,585
Have you heard of the witcher?

380
00:21:24,046 --> 00:21:26,907
His name, Geralt of Rivia.

381
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:29,789
I saw him one day,

382
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,591
and I have a crazy story to tell you about him.

383
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:33,131
Yeah.

384
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:38,192
I saw him with my own two eyes as he cut a monster down twice his size.

385
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:42,313
So let me tell you about what I've learned and paint you a picture of the witcher.

386
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,873
You ain't heard of Garoth or Rivia, let me in there.

387
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:46,714
Reason that monsters speak, living and fair.

388
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:48,234
You'd rather be scared than rather in here.

389
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,255
The fright got him turned to white like they rid of this air.

390
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,355
After last experiment, so plenty of years.

391
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:54,356
Death in the air. Evil, the lesser the pair.

392
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,376
The beef refused to lose, so the lesser the pair.

393
00:21:56,596 --> 00:21:57,896
But the tavern, they give him a beer.

394
00:21:58,597 --> 00:21:59,737
For you to understand.

395
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,498
If you have a scar on his heart that can never be paid.

396
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:04,539
Now that goes to his road to everywhere.

397
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:04,999
Yeah.

398
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:07,060
And I've become like a week that we put his chair.

399
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,840
I'm just a bar trying to make my rent.

400
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,922
But I've seen cats cross and get played like went by the butcher of Blaviken for the right

401
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:13,282
price.

402
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:14,542
Bring him a man party.

403
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:15,362
He'll drag a man.

404
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:17,663
Toss a coin to your witch.

405
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:19,924
A valley of plenty.

406
00:22:20,284 --> 00:22:21,925
Oh, valley of plenty.

407
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:26,107
Toss a coin to your witcher,

408
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:28,508
Valley of plenty.

409
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:30,489
Do you have a coin you can toss?

410
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:32,790
Hee!

411
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,470
Thank you.

412
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:34,631
Ha!

413
00:22:35,151 --> 00:22:36,752
So, if you ever want to toss a coin

414
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:38,613
to your friendly neighborhood rapper,

415
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:40,414
I have plenty of ways to do that.

416
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:43,640
I have songs that I put out every month on Patreon.

417
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,902
So this is the shameless plug section of the show.

418
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:50,086
I do two songs a month on Patreon, patreon.com slash mega ran.

419
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:52,869
I do band camp stuff all the time.

420
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:55,591
I've got a big sale coming tomorrow actually.

421
00:22:55,912 --> 00:22:58,274
Once it hits midnight, something cool is going to pop up on my band camp.

422
00:22:58,554 --> 00:23:01,417
That is random.bandcamp.com.

423
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:03,619
All right.

424
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,122
So anyway, let's continue on with the fan service.

425
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:11,223
Have you ever heard of this game called Final Fantasy VII?

426
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,545
I heard like it's gonna be a big deal one day.

427
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:16,826
Maybe. I don't know.

428
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:19,607
A couple people like it. A few of my friends.

429
00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:23,929
I heard it sold like a hundred copies, man.

430
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,030
It's gonna be big.

431
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,291
Let me change my glasses.

432
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:34,835
We are now ready to go to war.

433
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:36,856
I need you all with me in the reactor. Let's go.

434
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:39,833
Don't be scared.

435
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:41,295
I'm Barrett Wallace.

436
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:42,996
Gang on Barrett Wallace!

437
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,599
Got money on the mind, no fear in my eyes.

438
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,341
Avalanche the squad, so it's time to rise.

439
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:52,183
I'm just going forward, no time for going backwards.

440
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,946
The mission, destroy the Mako reactors.

441
00:23:54,986 --> 00:23:57,468
They brought it on themselves, so they gotta take them out.

442
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:00,250
All in, but we might not all make it out.

443
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:06,037
Ending the Shinra and closing the chapter. The mission, destroy the Mako reactors.

444
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:10,003
I never got their names, and I didn't really care to. I just want the money.

445
00:24:10,063 --> 00:24:16,812
So the mission I adhere to is simple. Join some resistance clique. Blow up the reactor, then we split. That's it!

446
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:22,175
Well, they go on about saving the planet, all the precious resources we've been taking for granted.

447
00:24:22,455 --> 00:24:26,298
But I'm doing me. It's not that I don't understand it, but I'm trying to carry the

448
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:30,821
job out just how we planned it. Well, in my line of work, there's no time for softies.

449
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:35,003
These treat huggers better wake up and smell the coffee. Been around the block now,

450
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:39,026
far from a beginner. I've been to reactors back when I worked for Shinra.

451
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:44,589
And they don't blame me, and I don't like them, and they don't trust me, and I ain't like them,

452
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,553
war they ain't built for it. Troubles like my wallet, I only find it when I'm never looking

453
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:54,916
for it. So as I hit the bomb, I start to get a premonition, some kind of feeling shouldn't be a

454
00:24:54,956 --> 00:25:01,061
part of my mission, but I do it. Ten minutes remain before reactor one is going down in flames.

455
00:25:01,621 --> 00:25:06,464
And so we out to the train to rest. Part one of the mission is a complete success,

456
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:09,066
but for now it seems that the good guys are winning.

457
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:12,029
This ain't the ending, it's only the beginning.

458
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:14,851
Got money on the mind, no fear in my eyes.

459
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:17,573
Avalanche to squazz, so it's time to rise.

460
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:20,476
I'm just going forward, no time for going backwards.

461
00:25:20,516 --> 00:25:23,218
The mission, destroy the Mako reactors.

462
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:25,681
They brought it on themselves, so they gotta get them out.

463
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:28,483
All in, but we might not all make it out.

464
00:25:29,124 --> 00:25:31,506
Ending the Shinra and closing the chapters.

465
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:34,348
The mission, destroy the Mako reactors.

466
00:25:38,923 --> 00:25:39,984
Now you're coming with me or what?

467
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:42,065
Come on y'all.

468
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:44,206
I'm gonna tell you about this crew called avalanche that we

469
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:46,868
rolling with this one is the hypest song of my set.

470
00:25:47,108 --> 00:25:49,089
So usually this is the time I get everybody to get up and

471
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:49,430
get hype.

472
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,331
So if you are sitting down wherever you sit and get up

473
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:54,393
get up because I'm gonna be moving around and I'm 300

474
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:54,913
pounds.

475
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:56,214
Hey, hey.

476
00:25:56,894 --> 00:26:01,577
Hey, hey, come on. Hey, fist up one, two, three, we beat em!

477
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:08,502
Insurgents, not a bit nervous, encouraged, gotta be further to go.

478
00:26:08,562 --> 00:26:11,604
By any means, getting rid of my enemies.

479
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:15,286
A-V-A-L-A-N-C-H-E-E, that's who we be.

480
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:19,508
Insurgents, not a bit nervous, no lip service.

481
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:23,292
You gotta get further to go through what we gotta get.

482
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,634
Who want that problem with AV?

483
00:26:25,914 --> 00:26:27,716
A L A N C H E.

484
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:28,617
That's who we.

485
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:30,038
There's a metal company called Shinra.

486
00:26:30,498 --> 00:26:33,621
I don't know exactly what they into, but they really gonna get trouble in my life stream.

487
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:35,242
And I just can't let that continue.

488
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:36,984
They don't care who they hurt, who they injured.

489
00:26:37,224 --> 00:26:38,686
Gonna turn my whole planet against us.

490
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:42,089
So it's simple, you join the resistance or you wind up going against us.

491
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,730
My name is Barrett Wallace.

492
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,392
I'm known for paralyzing.

493
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:48,795
But the rising points into submission, not fantasizing.

494
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:50,457
Wish this world wasn't violent.

495
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:52,159
Get worse if we allow it.

496
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:55,522
Hot head with a kenny for an arm and a mind with a number of visions inside it.

497
00:26:55,763 --> 00:26:55,903
Uh!

498
00:26:56,564 --> 00:26:58,746
Avalanche man, I just don't have a check.

499
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:00,988
Watch them scatter man, we never barren.

500
00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:02,190
Slayin' those battle planes.

501
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,671
My people beside me, team from behind me with a better voice of reason

502
00:27:05,931 --> 00:27:09,052
There's bigs and wedges, just seeing anybody in my way, we're squeezing

503
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:12,474
Behind me, I'm Lee, and I'm the bomb in the region, it's gotta be the highest treason

504
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:15,655
We came too far to back down, and I'm not leaving till we even

505
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:17,555
Bigger to everyone, you can get equipped

506
00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:19,336
Not a president, a shareholder's door fits

507
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:20,977
And it's hard when I can't get control of it

508
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:23,258
Okay, fists up, come on now, hey!

509
00:27:23,938 --> 00:27:29,562
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, got a bit further to go.

510
00:27:29,642 --> 00:27:32,665
By any means, getting rid of my enemies.

511
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,866
A-V-A-L-A-N-C-H-E.

512
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:36,247
One more time, y'all.

513
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:39,050
Hey, hey, not a bit nerved.

514
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,631
Hey, no lip service.

515
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:43,053
Hey, got a bit further to go.

516
00:27:43,113 --> 00:27:44,414
Do what I gotta get.

517
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:48,397
Who want that problem with A-V-A-L-A-N-C-H-E?

518
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:50,278
Yep, that's who we be.

519
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:52,980
Thank you very much.

520
00:27:55,122 --> 00:27:56,001
Because you know, that's who we be.

521
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:04,959
B-A-R-R-E-1-T, they gon' have to come get me if they want me.

522
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:08,740
I don't bend, I don't break, I don't care about much.

523
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,161
Just my daughter, Marlene, and my peoples being free.

524
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:16,102
See, you gotta understand, son, I don't have the answers.

525
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:20,043
I just keep the faith, and I always keep a handgun.

526
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:24,484
No, I mean it literally, cause I got a handgun.

527
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:28,225
I call that a gun arm, so I'm never.

528
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:33,895
You're unarmed!

529
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:36,620
Thank you. Yeah, I got this thing for you.

530
00:28:37,488 --> 00:28:38,448
characters with gun arms.

531
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:41,090
But that's my song called Avalanche.

532
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,791
So on this album that I made about Final Fantasy VII,

533
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:45,212
it's called Black Materia.

534
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:46,132
I thought that was catchy,

535
00:28:46,613 --> 00:28:47,733
because, you know, I'm black.

536
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:50,815
But anyway, enough about me for a second.

537
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:53,096
I want to bring in my Maverick Hunters partner,

538
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:56,078
tag team partner, the hawk to my animal,

539
00:28:56,298 --> 00:28:57,618
the axe to my smash,

540
00:28:57,979 --> 00:29:01,040
the Tully Blanchard to my Arne Anderson,

541
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:04,542
and several other wrestling references.

542
00:29:04,902 --> 00:29:06,783
I'm gonna tag in DJ Rockman.

543
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:12,637
Hey, yeah, OK, that's how we do it right there.

544
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:14,718
I guess we don't just warm it up, then.

545
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:17,699
Let me warm it up with some video game remixes.

546
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:18,879
Let's go.

547
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:23,681
I am the host of Nerdcore Nights here in the lovely place of Texas.

548
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,902
But what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and throw on some tunes.

549
00:29:26,922 --> 00:29:28,323
So let me go ahead and just get y'all started.

550
00:29:52,027 --> 00:29:52,908
See you.

551
00:31:07,912 --> 00:31:13,641
Liked this transcript? Let us know in the comments!

552
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,404
Everybody sing this song.

553
00:33:03,924 --> 00:33:04,545
Yes, sir.

554
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:06,666
Just waking up in the morning.

555
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:07,867
Gotta thank God.

556
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:10,589
I don't know, but today seems kind of odd.

557
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:12,390
No barking from the dog.

558
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,350
No small.

559
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:15,272
And Mama cooked the breakfast for Noah.

560
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:21,286
Finally got a call from a girl I want to dick out

561
00:33:21,326 --> 00:33:24,009
Booked it up for later as I hit the dope

562
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,471
Thinking will I live another 24?

563
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:29,333
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top

564
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:31,515
And if I hit the switch I can make that

565
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:35,933
had to stop at a red light looking in my near

566
00:33:35,993 --> 00:33:39,615
not a checker in sight and everything is all fright

567
00:33:39,955 --> 00:33:43,357
I gotta be from Kim and she could do it all night

568
00:33:43,617 --> 00:33:46,139
called up to homies and I'm askin' ya'll

569
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:49,201
which part are ya'll playing basketball

570
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:51,602
get me on the court and I'm troubled

571
00:33:51,702 --> 00:33:54,064
last week messed around and got a triple-double

572
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:56,946
freakin' brother's every way like MJ

573
00:33:57,046 --> 00:33:58,406
I can't believe today

574
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:15,350
I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe.

575
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,651
But yes, I do live streams throughout the week.

576
00:34:21,073 --> 00:34:22,934
Twitch.tv slash DJ Rockman.

577
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:28,997
This one right here from Jet Set Radio.

578
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:39,027
Called Malpoish.

579
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:40,968
From my buddy Kazoo Beats.

580
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:11,782
Once again, I am DJ Rockman.

00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:15,723

00:39:18,364 --> 00:39:21,644
I'm a Melee head though.

584
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:34,775
Hi-yah!

585
00:39:55,391 --> 00:40:00,293
Haya! Haya!

586
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:03,874
Haya! Haya!

587
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:09,415
Haya! Haya!

588
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:10,696
Haya!

589
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:12,136
Haya!

590
00:40:15,537 --> 00:40:16,738
Haya!

591
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:17,438
Haya!

592
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:18,198
Haya!

593
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:37,057
Thanks for watching!

594
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,054
So this right here is gonna be the last track for me.

595
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,824
You know, we bring it back to Mega Man once again.

596
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:22,732
But let's go!

597
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:04,295
Checkmate!

598
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:10,801
What do you want to do tonight?

599
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:23,125
The same thing we do every night, Pinky.

600
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:24,646
Try to take over the world.

601
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:43,225
This trailer shows how the game will function on the NES.

602
00:43:17,965 --> 00:43:26,347
Okay now we're in the transitune of the final day of development, and we're gonna be doing

603
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:27,448
our final wrap up.

604
00:43:27,528 --> 00:43:32,789
And one last thing that we're gonna be talking about today is the final premonition.

605
00:43:48,687 --> 00:43:51,089
Yes sir, once again I am DJ Rockman.

606
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:56,292
One part of the awesome group of Maverick Hunters, me and MegaRan.

607
00:43:56,912 --> 00:43:57,813
Love to tag team together.

608
00:43:58,793 --> 00:43:59,874
Play some dope tracks.

609
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:04,677
Let y'all hear some new music that we like to call Nerdcore and some video game remixes.

610
00:44:05,117 --> 00:44:07,518
But like I said, follow me on stream on Twitch.

611
00:44:08,419 --> 00:44:09,420
Slash DJ Rockman.

612
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,710
All my other social media is DJRockMan48.

613
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,514
And also, if you do want to contribute, and I'm going to spoil a little bit of myself, too.

614
00:44:17,874 --> 00:44:20,956
If you want to show some love, you can follow me on Vimeo.

615
00:44:21,817 --> 00:44:22,497
That's DJRockMan.

616
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:25,640
Support a brother, you know, doing the same thing.

617
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,861
We just try to take care of one another.

618
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:30,123
But I'm going to hand it back off if he is ready.

619
00:44:30,904 --> 00:44:31,604
Give it to the boy.

620
00:44:31,624 --> 00:44:33,686
Hey, you're the partner in crime.

621
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:36,048
Hey, you know, you're the king of the master blaster.

622
00:44:36,828 --> 00:44:38,430
Aha. Hey. Hey.

623
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:45,828
Yes sir.

624
00:44:50,469 --> 00:44:51,530
Guess you gonna wait a second.

625
00:44:55,011 --> 00:44:56,672
Do you want me to get one more track for you buddy?

626
00:45:00,873 --> 00:45:02,754
I'm gonna play one more track while we're waiting for my buddy.

627
00:48:45,773 --> 00:48:51,355
Yeah, yeah. Check, check. There we go. What's going on? Hope y'all enjoy DJ

628
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:55,777
Rockman. Thank you so much for holding it down. Thank you. Always.

629
00:48:55,797 --> 00:48:58,758
Brother. You heard. Keep an eye out on the streams. We'll be

630
00:48:58,798 --> 00:49:01,179
popping up doing some more stuff together very soon. But

631
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:04,700
now for this part of the set, I want to bring it somewhere down

632
00:49:04,981 --> 00:49:10,283
but unfortunately to to a real place which is where we are

633
00:49:10,343 --> 00:49:12,323
today. So, let's get started.

634
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:17,730
Every day I watch the news, it's like a rerun.

635
00:49:18,211 --> 00:49:20,653
Land that are free, can't believe what it's become.

636
00:49:21,114 --> 00:49:23,277
They say it's broken, but I say it's going fine.

637
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:26,140
But a system in effect that works the way it was designed.

638
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:29,164
Plans get devised, this land isn't mine.

639
00:49:29,404 --> 00:49:32,568
We stand it, I pray we get the answers in time for the youth.

640
00:49:32,968 --> 00:49:35,391
That's why we put our hands to the sky, tell the truth.

641
00:49:36,052 --> 00:49:37,633
The way got a chance to survive.

642
00:49:37,693 --> 00:49:38,973
So we shift the paradigm.

643
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:43,035
We heard the battle cry hit the front lines from Arizona to

644
00:49:43,076 --> 00:49:43,736
Palestine.

645
00:49:44,216 --> 00:49:45,157
I had no disguise.

646
00:49:45,217 --> 00:49:45,657
No verdict.

647
00:49:45,677 --> 00:49:46,357
No alibi.

648
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:50,480
I would rather galvanized and pacify cats apply reasoning.

649
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,581
I see the power weakening dedication.

650
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:53,081
We can win.

651
00:49:53,161 --> 00:49:56,743
That's why I'm screaming BLM can't think you can't eat can't

652
00:49:56,783 --> 00:49:57,083
breathe.

653
00:49:57,463 --> 00:49:58,584
I do this for my family.

654
00:49:58,884 --> 00:50:00,425
So that means there ain't no plan B.

655
00:50:00,585 --> 00:50:02,466
Yeah, so.

656
00:50:03,548 --> 00:50:05,129
I'm going to talk, I'm going to play a new song.

657
00:50:05,689 --> 00:50:06,809
I have never played it before.

658
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:07,490
I'm excited.

659
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,650
This track's called Afraid of the Dark.

660
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:11,911
Hope you can hear the music.

661
00:50:13,031 --> 00:50:13,851
Oh, oh, mm.

662
00:50:15,052 --> 00:50:17,612
Super new, super new, fresh off the,

663
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:20,373
fresh off the brain, basically.

664
00:50:20,613 --> 00:50:20,833
Hey.

665
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:22,094
Yeah.

666
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:24,795
Yeah.

667
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:26,055
Yeah.

668
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:27,355
Yeah.

669
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:33,281
I get scared when I'm driving and I hear sirens, which is strange, because my tags are up to

670
00:50:33,301 --> 00:50:33,561
date.

671
00:50:33,862 --> 00:50:34,522
I ain't quite afraid.

672
00:50:34,963 --> 00:50:36,144
You ain't done nothing wrong.

673
00:50:36,204 --> 00:50:38,686
You ain't got no reason to run.

674
00:50:38,706 --> 00:50:39,626
You don't have a gun.

675
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:41,368
You ain't breaking any laws.

676
00:50:41,388 --> 00:50:42,189
You ain't talking back.

677
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:43,910
You ain't giving no probable cause.

678
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:44,871
You won't step aside.

679
00:50:45,351 --> 00:50:46,372
Why are you so petrified?

680
00:50:46,392 --> 00:50:47,453
You ain't obstructing justice.

681
00:50:47,853 --> 00:50:51,977
You ain't got nothing to hide, so why am I surprised when situations escalate and black

682
00:50:52,037 --> 00:50:52,477
men die?

683
00:50:52,857 --> 00:50:54,158
Seems like it happens every day.

684
00:50:54,238 --> 00:50:55,019
Something goes awry.

685
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,742
I'm going to investigate, but they don't even try.

686
00:50:58,022 --> 00:51:00,344
It's like our lives are second-rate, so I'm terrified.

687
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,685
But not as much as you are.

688
00:51:02,046 --> 00:51:04,248
Worried that I'm gonna make a scene, maybe take it too far.

689
00:51:04,588 --> 00:51:06,870
See me riding, playing music loud in my new car.

690
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:09,453
Disturbing the peace of your community when you work too hard.

691
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:11,995
Understand you got a house and I'm just rentin'.

692
00:51:12,456 --> 00:51:14,518
Treating me like a menace, a gender relentless.

693
00:51:14,898 --> 00:51:20,063
Man, I'ma let you finish, but calling the cops on black folks in 2020, it's like a death sentence.

694
00:51:20,103 --> 00:51:24,767
So let's talk about it. Why are you so frightened? Why is my advancement threatening so many white

695
00:51:24,787 --> 00:51:28,771
men? And when it comes to black matters, why are you so silent? I need to know the answers.

696
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:34,337
Can you provide them? Yeah. Is it my style? The way that I walk? Am I too proud? The way that I

697
00:51:34,397 --> 00:51:39,562
talk? Why does my existence cause so much pain in your heart? Ask yourself, are you afraid of the

698
00:51:39,602 --> 00:51:39,802
dark?

699
00:51:40,762 --> 00:51:42,883
Do you want to see me broken with my head down?

700
00:51:43,223 --> 00:51:44,964
Or maybe six feet under the ground?

701
00:51:45,244 --> 00:51:46,104
Am I a threat to you?

702
00:51:46,945 --> 00:51:48,145
I'm just out here playing my part.

703
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:50,086
Why are you afraid of the dark?

704
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:52,468
Man, is it my style?

705
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:53,348
The way that I walk?

706
00:51:53,628 --> 00:51:54,328
Am I too proud?

707
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:55,269
The way that I talk?

708
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:58,450
Why does my existence cause so much pain in your heart?

709
00:51:58,771 --> 00:52:00,371
Ask yourself, why you afraid of the dark?

710
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:03,568
Now do you want to see me broken with your head down?

711
00:52:04,328 --> 00:52:05,609
Six feet under the ground?

712
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,770
Let me talk to you.

713
00:52:07,571 --> 00:52:08,752
I'm just out here playing my part.

714
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:11,354
Ask yourself, why you afraid of the dark?

715
00:52:11,654 --> 00:52:14,997
Yeah.

716
00:52:15,157 --> 00:52:16,818
This is a track called Cry of the Planet.

717
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:21,342
It's Final Fantasy VII inspired but it definitely, to me,

718
00:52:21,842 --> 00:52:24,504
means a lot more because it's coming from a place where

719
00:52:25,465 --> 00:52:27,526
they have a really important message about saving the planet.

720
00:52:30,903 --> 00:52:35,028
And we're getting our planet destroyed daily by so many other things.

721
00:52:37,591 --> 00:52:43,377
Yeah, yeah.

722
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:47,021
Close your eyes.

723
00:52:49,444 --> 00:52:49,804
Listen.

724
00:52:50,948 --> 00:52:52,029
Yo, yo.

725
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:56,990
Sometimes I feel I died in 2016, and this is just a simulation.

726
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,931
Maybe that's just extreme, but as I'm sitting midstream,

727
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:03,572
hoping kids don't dox me or swap me because I'm stating what's obvious.

728
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:06,933
Every statement that's faulty, they using despair as the jet fuel

729
00:53:07,213 --> 00:53:08,634
to drive racist practices.

730
00:53:08,654 --> 00:53:10,074
This ain't checks and balances.

731
00:53:10,134 --> 00:53:11,795
It's just creating balances.

732
00:53:11,835 --> 00:53:12,235
You hear it.

733
00:53:12,515 --> 00:53:14,796
Tax cuts, witch hunts, strong borders.

734
00:53:14,896 --> 00:53:18,157
I hear fear-mongering and dividing and conquering.

735
00:53:18,177 --> 00:53:19,357
We let a monster in.

736
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:22,018
And that's simple and plain. All we did was complain.

737
00:53:22,038 --> 00:53:23,999
These tweetin' threats like this was the game.

738
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:26,440
Straight negligent. Inflating estimates.

739
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:28,982
Trade deficit. Mis-education.

740
00:53:29,022 --> 00:53:30,883
Plus fear creates negligence.

741
00:53:31,063 --> 00:53:34,044
Hate imminent. Now to misplace evidence.

742
00:53:34,324 --> 00:53:37,366
As a planet, we all stand to the great detriment.

743
00:53:37,406 --> 00:53:40,967
Jobs take benefits and make medicine unaffordable.

744
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:41,768
It's horrible.

745
00:53:42,008 --> 00:53:46,191
I hear the lies in every sentence and I thought it through and though I still want to feel

746
00:53:46,211 --> 00:53:51,096
resentment for everyone that believed in you and thought this dream was feasible and thought

747
00:53:51,116 --> 00:53:55,079
that you were speaking to their problems but now I believe you're beatable and it seems

748
00:53:55,099 --> 00:54:00,323
we got the bottom but it seems we got to blossom like linden jasmine we blossom standing stronger

749
00:54:00,383 --> 00:54:06,128
united by our desire and defiance I've seen over the horizon my people are out of hiding

750
00:54:06,168 --> 00:54:09,111
yeah and we refuse to go silent but now

751
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,614
Listen, you can hear the cries of the planet.

752
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:17,676
But for now,

753
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:21,860
listen, you can hear the cries of the planet.

754
00:54:32,542 --> 00:54:37,043
You can hear the cries of the planet, even scientists can't understand it.

755
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:40,004
We all know the disadvantage, impossible to manage.

756
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:43,105
So-called experts, they calling us a hoax.

757
00:54:43,465 --> 00:54:46,405
But it's time for the networks to try a new approach.

758
00:54:46,445 --> 00:54:51,267
They talking greenhouse gases, natural disasters, unexplained phenomena.

759
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:53,567
Time to wake up out of the monstery.

760
00:54:53,927 --> 00:54:56,668
But we can't change things, this world is changing.

761
00:54:57,088 --> 00:54:59,388
How many times we gotta see the same things?

762
00:54:59,628 --> 00:55:01,649
Hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions.

763
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:02,429
Time to wake up out of the monstery.

764
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:09,156
We need more action and much less discussion and probably less corruption before we all go on us

765
00:55:09,176 --> 00:55:16,965
Somebody inform us mother earth is trying to warn us what we worry about the trivial the superstars interviews millionaires drama people

766
00:55:17,185 --> 00:55:18,366
What's gotten into you?

767
00:55:18,426 --> 00:55:24,953
Temperature be rising like the co2 levels unsettled, but sooner or later. We'll see the true devil, but for now

768
00:55:27,544 --> 00:55:31,447
Yeah, listen, you can hear the cries of the planet.

769
00:55:32,268 --> 00:55:41,375
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh, but for now, yeah, yeah, yeah, you listen,

770
00:55:42,155 --> 00:55:48,880
you can hear the cries of the planet. Yeah, yeah, I hear them, I see them, you know,

771
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,182
and I cry for the planet. Thank you.

772
00:55:53,774 --> 00:55:57,517
Right, my name is MegaRan. I'm gonna try to end off this show with a little bit of hope.

773
00:55:57,817 --> 00:56:02,761
I don't want to end it all doom and gloom. Big shout outs to DJ Rockman. Big shout outs to 88

774
00:56:02,801 --> 00:56:09,106
Bit and Saint in the Rain. I appreciate GDC so much. Shout out to GDC for having music as a big

775
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:14,090
part of this because as my shirt says, video game music is music and to me it's not just music,

776
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,971
it's life. It saved my life.

777
00:56:16,772 --> 00:56:21,793
So many times. So I just try to give back to it. So this is a little gem from a game that I love

778
00:56:21,853 --> 00:56:27,634
called Little Nemo the Dream Master. So for this hook I'm just gonna say hey hey all right. Now if

779
00:56:27,654 --> 00:56:36,557
you could post all right in the chat that'll be cool. Hey hey all right. Once upon a time before

780
00:56:36,617 --> 00:56:42,478
beats and the rise and before there was ever any random there was a boy in the hood who always did

781
00:56:42,538 --> 00:56:45,059
good so the bullies of the block couldn't stand him

782
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:48,103
And on Christmas and birthdays he got mad presents.

783
00:56:48,123 --> 00:56:50,386
So many he didn't know what to play with.

784
00:56:50,746 --> 00:56:53,791
He had Transformers, He-Man, Ninja Turtles, Star Wars.

785
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:55,713
But the G.I. Joe's were his favorite.

786
00:56:56,174 --> 00:56:57,375
He was so creative.

787
00:56:57,736 --> 00:57:00,940
That if they didn't make the toy, like he decided to create it.

788
00:57:01,341 --> 00:57:05,204
He put Storm Shadow's legs on Snake Eye's body till it popped.

789
00:57:05,224 --> 00:57:08,207
Then he duct taped it. He made spaceships.

790
00:57:08,227 --> 00:57:11,770
Then the big kids hung out on the block playing hide and seek and riding bikes.

791
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,092
They used to try to get involved but they told them,

792
00:57:14,212 --> 00:57:14,993
Get lost!

793
00:57:15,153 --> 00:57:17,015
And that's when they started getting high at night.

794
00:57:17,495 --> 00:57:20,096
And I heard he made a friend that was as nerdy as him.

795
00:57:20,316 --> 00:57:24,857
When he had about all he could withstand, he collected comics, cards, studied.

796
00:57:25,197 --> 00:57:28,158
Read the Star Wars script like the back of his hand.

797
00:57:28,218 --> 00:57:29,979
And in school he made A's and B's.

798
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:32,639
Teachers complimented his amazing feats.

799
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:38,481
And all the while he wondered, if I'm so amazing, geez, how come nobody won't play with me?

800
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:43,122
He said, hey, hey, alright, hey, hey.

801
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:48,674
Hey, hey, alright, hey, hope you got it.

802
00:57:48,774 --> 00:57:57,384
Somebody say hey, hey, GDC say hey, hey, alright, hey, hey, alright, hey.

803
00:58:00,257 --> 00:58:05,019
So to say this kid looked funny in school, that would be a colossal understatement.

804
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:10,481
He had high water pants and Coke bottle frames and a mouth full of armadada gracious.

805
00:58:10,762 --> 00:58:13,123
His first girlfriend was named Christina Perez.

806
00:58:13,183 --> 00:58:17,485
He took her everywhere. Now the boy was so cool, but she dated him on a dare.

807
00:58:17,805 --> 00:58:21,106
Left him standing there without a clue. Man, kids can be so cruel.

808
00:58:21,647 --> 00:58:26,588
At the time when he couldn't love him any less, but at the same time sure he got an A and a S

809
00:58:26,608 --> 00:58:30,249
Cause his mom felt this was the best way to keep him out of the street

810
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:34,391
Although they were penniless, only child didn't want an emptiness

811
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:38,452
And it's a healthier addiction than cigarettes, and so it began

812
00:58:38,532 --> 00:58:42,734
How did he escape the scene? He sat in front of that screen and chased his dreams

813
00:58:42,794 --> 00:58:49,096
He went, hey, hey, alright, hey, hey, alright, hey, hey

814
00:58:52,156 --> 00:59:02,066
Hey, somebody say hey, hey, all right, hey, hey, all right, hey, hey, all right, hey.

815
00:59:03,102 --> 00:59:04,103
Hey!

816
00:59:04,143 --> 00:59:07,026
Fast forward a couple years, he gains a couple peers

817
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:09,489
and sucks up game like a vacuum.

818
00:59:09,529 --> 00:59:12,031
Then he went off to college and sorts some knowledge

819
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,594
and develops the heart to make rap tunes.

820
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:17,577
Vowed to stay true and he dropped his debut.

821
00:59:17,697 --> 00:59:20,140
And, yeah, he's got his little name up here.

822
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,843
There was money in the bank, but money drew a blank.

823
00:59:22,943 --> 00:59:25,005
Every time his second LP came up.

824
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:29,806
He thought back to childhood and how he survived in such a wild hood.

825
00:59:30,226 --> 00:59:32,327
Then he realized they didn't hate him.

826
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:35,488
And whatever didn't break him, that's what made him.

827
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:39,350
So, never knew he'd stand for this love for his games and rap.

828
00:59:39,691 --> 00:59:41,051
Open his soul and let him in.

829
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:44,933
Then he chopped up some 8-bit sounds, put it down and ran them.

830
00:59:45,053 --> 00:59:46,554
It's now Lotus Megarand.

831
00:59:46,974 --> 00:59:49,275
And his name's all over that internet.

832
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:51,737
Girls who didn't care were kinda interested.

833
00:59:51,917 --> 00:59:54,818
And the best part of the story comes at the end.

834
00:59:55,379 --> 01:00:00,444
But that part hasn't been written yet.

835
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:05,049
Thank you so much. My name is Mega Ran. You guys have been

836
01:00:05,089 --> 01:00:09,114
amazing. DJ Rockman on the ones and twos. Y'all are so cool.

837
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:11,876
So, we're gonna end it off church style. That's how we do

838
01:00:11,977 --> 01:00:14,219
a church style. We go like this. We do the soul clap.

839
01:00:58,652 --> 01:01:03,995
Thank you.

840
01:01:04,515 --> 01:01:09,698
Always keep your Mega Buster charged because you just never know.

841
01:01:10,158 --> 01:01:10,939
Peace and blessings.

842
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:11,799
Be safe out there.

843
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:12,820
Everyone wear your masks.

844
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,241
