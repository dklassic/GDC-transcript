00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:11,366
Hello and welcome to this sort of virtual GDC presentation

2
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:13,228
beyond games as a service with LiveOps.

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,650
We're going to get started right away.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,293
One of the benefits of doing this virtually.

5
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:22,335
So we'll start. I'm going to introduce myself.

6
00:00:22,415 --> 00:00:24,237
My name is Kristen Cox.

7
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:27,820
I've been making games for a little over 17 years.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,843
I've mostly worked as a game designer and a game director.

9
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,535
And I've spent pretty much my entire career making large scale MMOs.

10
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:39,137
So I worked at Walt Disney Internet Group,

11
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:41,559
on the Pirates of the Caribbean Online.

12
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,241
I then worked at Nexon America,

13
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:47,123
where I operated the global version of MapleStory.

14
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:50,566
And then I worked at ArenaNet.

15
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:54,889
And I came on to ArenaNet to help develop, launch,

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,371
and launch Guild Wars 2.

17
00:00:57,275 --> 00:00:58,976
and then I stayed with Guild Wars 2

18
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:01,778
through to large scale expansions

19
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:04,941
and then also the launch of Guild Wars 2 in China.

20
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:08,443
A little over a year ago, I left ArenaNet

21
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:12,427
and I came to join Microsoft at Xbox.

22
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,689
Currently the director of live operations

23
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:17,811
for Xbox Game Studios Publishing.

24
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,513
And one of the biggest reasons I stepped away

25
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:23,735
from development and more into publishing

26
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:25,957
was that I care really deeply about live games.

27
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:31,720
and the way that the industry is moving forward with live games,

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,121
especially in the AAA market,

29
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:36,382
and I wanted to take on a role

30
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:39,882
where I would have a larger purview and touch more games.

31
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:42,543
So at XGS Publishing,

32
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:45,164
I actually work with a lot of different game teams

33
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:48,985
on helping them understand how to do great live games

34
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:52,266
and how to make their games successful after they're live.

35
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:53,586
So...

36
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,757
Today I'm going to talk largely about LiveOps,

37
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,259
like what it is, how you do it,

38
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,401
and also some of my own personal experience

39
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:03,163
designing games around it.

40
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:07,146
But mostly this talk is about why LiveOps matters

41
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:09,848
and what it can teach us about designing games

42
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:12,610
for modern audiences and how I think it can help us

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,032
break through the limitations of games as a service.

44
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,694
And I'll talk a little bit about what I see

45
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:20,577
as the limitations of the games as a service

46
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:21,958
ideology for design.

47
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:23,579
But before I dive...

48
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:25,311
into all of that.

49
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:27,933
I'm gonna start with some context.

50
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:29,734
So we're all on the same page.

51
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:34,038
So this is some fancy numbers about the games industry.

52
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:37,240
Basically, the games industry today is really, really big.

53
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:42,444
Last year generated about $140 billion in revenue.

54
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,826
That makes it really one of the biggest

55
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:47,667
entertainment industries in the world,

56
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:50,449
far outpacing things like film and television

57
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:52,371
and most other traditional media.

58
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:54,994
There's two billion gamers in the world.

59
00:02:55,355 --> 00:03:00,838
What that means is two billion people touch games on a regular basis in the world.

60
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:04,000
So that also, of course, expands to being global.

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,501
Games are everywhere.

62
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:07,383
Pretty much everywhere you go in the world,

63
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:10,685
you're going to find games and even more specifically,

64
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:12,266
video games of some kind.

65
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:14,848
Now, you're all in the video games industry,

66
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:16,569
so you probably know this already.

67
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,371
This may seem like, yes, of course,

68
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,152
games are a big deal. Of course, they are.

69
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:27,800
This, if you've been in the industry for a while, you know that this has not been true up until

70
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,702
pretty recently actually, and games have changed a lot in the last 30 years. So this is just a

71
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:40,204
graph looking at the size of the industry. We're just sort of using revenue as one thing to look

72
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:45,266
at the size of the industry, but it's, I think, tells a pretty compelling story. The industry has

73
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:48,647
seen exponential growth in the last 20 years.

74
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,978
So, you know, there's a little up and down starting in the 70s and 80s,

75
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,579
but really it starts to explode right around the turn of the century.

76
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,002
And that growth in gaming is intrinsically linked to the growth of connectivity in the internet.

77
00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:09,765
And that sort of led to this big boom in gaming, which also subsequently led to this big explosion

78
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:13,646
in mobile games, which is sort of see that part of the industry get bigger and bigger and bigger

79
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,469
as mobile games and internet, you know, internet connectivity, even in our pocket,

80
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,489
goes up and up and up.

81
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:24,102
So this reality that games industry growth

82
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:27,583
is intrinsically connected to the growth of the internet

83
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:30,704
has led to this narrative about the games industry

84
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:32,585
that's really deeply impacted

85
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,585
the way that we approach game design,

86
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:36,586
especially in the last 10 years.

87
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,387
And that narrative is that this growth was unlocked

88
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:44,288
when we shifted our design focus from games as a product,

89
00:04:44,548 --> 00:04:46,569
right, these are discrete packaged goods

90
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,009
that are designed to be consumed,

91
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:51,507
And instead we started thinking of them as services.

92
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:54,349
So evolving applications that are designed

93
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:56,971
to be engaged with over and over and over again.

94
00:04:58,412 --> 00:05:01,374
So this narrative is pretty compelling, right?

95
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:03,655
When we look at the industry today,

96
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,497
we do see that this shift has happened.

97
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:09,679
And when we look at the most successful games today,

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,501
they're very rarely product style games.

99
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:15,483
And so that also makes sense with this narrative.

100
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:20,891
If we look at the top grossing games worldwide from 2017 to 2018,

101
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:26,136
we see a list full of games that have service components.

102
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:30,399
And I think what really drives this point home is when we look at the fact

103
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,862
that these games are actually very similar in 2018 as they were in 2019.

104
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:36,465
And we're still kind of sorting out the details of 2019, but I think it's...

105
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:49,321
Fair to say that almost certainly 2019 will share many of the same games as well.

106
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:53,142
And this really speaks to the idea that these games are not consumed media.

107
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:56,404
They are really meant to be played over and over and over again.

108
00:05:56,424 --> 00:06:01,866
And in fact, every single game on this list has a service component.

109
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:07,188
And many of them are also mobile, which sort of speaks to the state of the industry today

110
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:09,589
and the way that the industry is composed today.

111
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:12,797
So that all seems to make a lot of sense, right?

112
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:15,298
So this growth really does come from this shift

113
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:18,799
in design focus, from product to service.

114
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,179
My problem with this narrative

115
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,740
is that it isn't really about design.

116
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,161
Even though a lot of times design gets cited

117
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:29,422
in this narrative, in our shifting focus,

118
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:31,262
it isn't a design narrative.

119
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:33,723
This is actually a business narrative.

120
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:37,324
This is a story of how our business focus changed

121
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,664
over the last 20 years.

122
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:43,906
And you can see that when we look at these two approaches, right?

123
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:47,448
And we look at what it really means to be games as a product,

124
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:49,569
and then what it means to be games as a service.

125
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,091
These philosophies really speak to how games are delivered,

126
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,032
not how they are designed.

127
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:58,354
The two approaches definitely suggest things about design,

128
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:01,816
and I think we can all imagine games that really only work

129
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:04,898
in one category or another.

130
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:08,320
But they're more...

131
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,372
about the way the game is sort of delivered to players

132
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:16,295
and the kind of business you're going to do with the game

133
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,977
and a lot less about really what the game is.

134
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:25,341
Even so, more and more game teams are being asked every day to

135
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:29,804
make games as a service games. Even design teams are told

136
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:34,367
design a game that's going to be a games as a service, design a game that's going

137
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:38,870
to last forever. Things like that are being asked of these teams.

138
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,512
because there's this idea that games as a service

139
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,314
tells us all kinds of things about design,

140
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:47,915
but there's a huge limitation

141
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:51,737
to trying to apply a business strategy to game design.

142
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,598
And I think we're starting to see that,

143
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:56,119
a little bit of friction happen there

144
00:07:56,619 --> 00:08:00,001
between sort of player expectations,

145
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:04,403
disconnects between what the game delivers

146
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,883
and what sort of players expect.

147
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:07,884
And a lot of that I think can be traced back

148
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:08,905
to attempting to sort of.

149
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:12,868
force design through this business lens.

150
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,089
When we look at games as a service,

151
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:18,249
they tell us, it tells us a lot,

152
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:19,950
games as a service has a lot to say,

153
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,750
but it's primarily focused on good service quality

154
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,331
and optimizing experiences through iteration.

155
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,031
What it doesn't really have is a lot to say

156
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:31,352
about what those experiences should be.

157
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:33,592
We don't really get a lot of clues

158
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:35,712
about how to design the game

159
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:37,172
by looking at games as a service.

160
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:38,873
Right, games as a service says.

161
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:41,731
Be reliable, deliver valuable services.

162
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:43,692
Awesome, that's a really great message.

163
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:46,294
But what services should be delivered?

164
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:47,155
We don't really know.

165
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:49,776
Then it says polish and iterate those experiences.

166
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:52,318
Again, a fantastic thing to try to do.

167
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:53,239
It's a good process.

168
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:55,340
But what experiences are we polishing

169
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,302
and what are we iterating towards?

170
00:08:58,362 --> 00:08:59,583
And then it says, you know,

171
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:02,425
drive towards KPIs or key performance indicators, right?

172
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,927
Pick targets of things you want to drive towards.

173
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:06,908
Great, we should all do that.

174
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,630
But which ones and why?

175
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,683
You know, design has to ask these questions.

176
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,843
These are fundamentally the questions of design.

177
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:18,064
What services, what experiences, why are we doing this?

178
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:19,224
What are we driving towards?

179
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:22,625
And games as a service just doesn't really have the answers.

180
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:25,185
It has processes, but it doesn't really tell us

181
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:26,726
what we're trying to do.

182
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:30,606
Besides, really successful game designs

183
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:32,507
are not centered around services.

184
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:33,827
I think we all know that.

185
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:35,727
They're supported by services,

186
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,648
and they're supported by this kind of thinking

187
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:38,548
and this kind of process.

188
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:41,346
but they're not built around those services.

189
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:43,467
If design puts service first,

190
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:46,109
it can result in really polished,

191
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,551
but often soulless games, or even worse,

192
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:53,153
coldly efficient engagement extraction machines

193
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,954
that don't really connect with players

194
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:57,916
on any kind of deep emotional or motivational level.

195
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:01,198
Games as a service just doesn't provide designers

196
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:02,939
with what they need to understand

197
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,380
how to make great live games.

198
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,442
It's just missing a lot in that area.

199
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:09,862
If we look back at this list,

200
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,423
it is true that all of these games

201
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:14,564
use a games as a service business model,

202
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:16,645
and that's great,

203
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:19,006
but what's more important for designers

204
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:20,907
looking at this game is not their business model.

205
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,268
What's more important is that all of these games

206
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:25,809
are designed around intrinsic motivations,

207
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,710
rich experiences that evolve and change over time,

208
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:30,871
and long-term engagement that can become

209
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:32,032
a part of a player's life.

210
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,693
That's what we should really be taking

211
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,714
from these games' success.

212
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:40,659
the ability to become more than just consumed media.

213
00:10:40,979 --> 00:10:43,360
That's what keeps these games at the top of this list

214
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,381
from the player's perspective, year over year.

215
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:49,041
And some of these games like League of Legends

216
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:51,662
or Dungeon and Fighter Online,

217
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:53,703
they've been at the top of this list

218
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:56,003
long before we started talking about

219
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,024
games as a service at GDC.

220
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,825
They've been doing this with a sort of different approach

221
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:05,266
before we started categorizing things

222
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,327
as games as a service.

223
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,851
This might seem like a fine line that I'm drawing here,

224
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:13,091
this difference between this business approach

225
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:15,512
and this design approach,

226
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:18,992
this difference between focusing on optimizing service

227
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:21,673
and focusing on long-term player experiences.

228
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,553
That might seem like a really fine line,

229
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:26,074
but in my experience, it can be incredibly striking.

230
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:29,394
So as an example, I just wanna talk a little bit

231
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:32,215
about some of the things that we saw in Guild Wars 2.

232
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:35,275
So these are really scrubbed numbers from Guild Wars 2.

233
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:35,755
They're just-

234
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:43,461
relational and what we're looking at is average revenue per user and retention numbers and on the

235
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:50,984
left we just have all players. So everyone playing Guild Wars 2 this is this is the average or mean

236
00:11:51,225 --> 00:12:00,409
of the ARPU and retention for these players and it's fine but on the right we have cohort number

237
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:04,010
one and so cohort is just a group of players that share some characteristics.

238
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,066
So it's a subset of all the players

239
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,827
and they share some characteristic together.

240
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,250
And this card has significantly better ARPU,

241
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,531
average revenue per player,

242
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,092
and retention than just the general average.

243
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:21,034
So these are better players in this measurement anyway.

244
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,076
So who are these people, right?

245
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:24,817
What is this attribute they share

246
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:27,358
that makes them so much better than the average player?

247
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:31,120
Well, in this case, this is players who spend time in town.

248
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:37,866
So town in Guild Wars 2 are no combat social hubs in the game.

249
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:43,208
Now, it's not as if you really need to spend time in town

250
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:44,208
in Guild Wars 2.

251
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:47,289
In fact, there's exceedingly little

252
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,770
that actually requires you to return to town.

253
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,511
The spending money on microtransactions,

254
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:59,153
player to player, marketplace, guilds, chatting,

255
00:12:59,213 --> 00:12:59,853
party systems.

256
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:01,887
These are all accessible anywhere in the game.

257
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,787
You do not need to go to town to do these things.

258
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:06,869
There's very little in the game,

259
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:09,610
in the game loop that drives players to town.

260
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,271
And yet, spending time in town is clearly super important.

261
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:17,813
And if we dig into this, it's not an outlier group, right?

262
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:20,134
If we just narrow down all the players

263
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:22,214
that are engaged in the game,

264
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,075
so players are actually actively playing the game,

265
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,197
excuse me, we see that actually

266
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:29,457
a majority of them are townies.

267
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,334
a lot of them spend time in town.

268
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,576
And if we dig deeper in this curve on the right,

269
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:37,839
you can see the likelihood of being a townie grows

270
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,580
over the player's first 100 days playing the game.

271
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,642
Even though the amount of things to do in town

272
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:46,024
does not increase as you progress in the game,

273
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:48,065
and certainly not to this level.

274
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:52,228
And this increasing tendency to spend time in town

275
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:54,910
corresponds with this increasing likelihood

276
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,730
to become a spender.

277
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:59,275
So really for us, just being a great highly engaged player

278
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:00,735
seems to be strongly correlated

279
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,275
with spending this time in town.

280
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:06,056
I don't really find this particularly surprising,

281
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:09,417
mostly because we saw a really similar effect

282
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,478
in MapleStory when I was working on that.

283
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:14,258
So this wasn't a huge shock to me

284
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:19,240
because spending time in towns and non-combat social zones

285
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,580
usually means focusing on social interactions

286
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,680
like chatting and voting

287
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,941
or simply being seen by other players.

288
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:27,618
And it also means downtime, which can be really important

289
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:30,659
for players that are trying to spend a lot of time

290
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:33,120
in your game to not always be actively engaged,

291
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,441
but to have some downtime where they can relax and plan

292
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:36,702
and just sort of talk.

293
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:42,044
Design, the point I'm making in bringing this up, right,

294
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:43,504
is the design has to be thinking

295
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:44,765
about the player's experience

296
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:47,526
and what's engaging to them in the game,

297
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:49,046
and what kind of experiences and engagement

298
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,307
the game is giving to them,

299
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,728
not just how to engage them more.

300
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,551
If we focus too much on just delivering services,

301
00:14:55,972 --> 00:15:00,294
we might just get bogged down in just increasing engagement.

302
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:02,535
You know, both Guild Wars 2 and MapleStory

303
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:04,716
have lots of progression systems and rewards

304
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:08,858
and gameplay loops and combat and all of these things

305
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:10,718
that we associate with active engagement.

306
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,900
And we can spend a lot of time trying to increase

307
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,201
players' engagement with those systems.

308
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,502
But what we actually saw was that as players

309
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,923
invested more time in the game,

310
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:22,704
they were more motivated by relatedness.

311
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:26,645
to other players and the joy of wasting time just chatting in town.

312
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:30,366
Now, I'm not saying that every game should add social spaces to increase revenue

313
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:34,747
or that there's some magic connection between spending downtime in town

314
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:38,668
and spending in every game, but I just want to emphasize that engagement

315
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:43,449
is more likely to come from the actions that feed whatever the game's intrinsic motivator is,

316
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:49,050
not necessarily the actions that feed really easy-to-measure and optimized loops.

317
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,331
For MapleStory and Guild Wars 2,

318
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,992
The motivators in the game, and we already knew this,

319
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:56,554
are largely social, they're largely relatedness.

320
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,575
For other games, it's going to be other things,

321
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:01,597
but the point is, design has to think about those things

322
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:03,338
from that direction, from the direction of

323
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:05,100
what are the player experience going to be

324
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,521
and what's going to motivate them,

325
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:09,843
not just from the direction of how is my service optimized?

326
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:15,147
So, Games as a Service, it's been really great for business,

327
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,428
it's been great for strategy.

328
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,509
I think it does actually have a lot to offer

329
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,890
to game development.

330
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:22,536
as far as processes and just a way of thinking

331
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:24,257
about delivering to players,

332
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:27,978
but it's mostly confusing and frustrating for design

333
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:30,278
because it just doesn't fit into the things

334
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:31,278
that we're trying to do.

335
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,479
And yet more and more teams will continue to be asked

336
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:36,939
to make engagement-focused live games, right?

337
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,940
We want to make engagement-focused live games,

338
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,121
but Games as a Service isn't really gonna help design

339
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:45,461
because it doesn't really show us any design direction.

340
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,982
Luckily, there is an approach to game development

341
00:16:49,002 --> 00:16:49,722
that's been around.

342
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:54,508
For a long time, it's been employed by those working in live games for quite a long time,

343
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,390
and it is a lot more useful for game design,

344
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,193
and I think it has a lot more to say about the direction of design.

345
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:06,175
And that is, of course, LiveOps. Surprise.

346
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:14,241
So LiveOps is a way of thinking about game design and game service

347
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,162
that's been around since...

348
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:18,985
MUDs, which are multi-user dungeons.

349
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,486
These are sort of the precursors to MMOs.

350
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:25,647
They were text-based multiplayer adventures

351
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,648
that were around in the 80s, largely in 90s.

352
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:31,809
And that's sort of where LiveOps grew up,

353
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:35,450
was in managing these online communities

354
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,771
of people playing MUDs together.

355
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,532
And it's great, LiveOps, is it's supporting games

356
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:43,352
that are focused on long-term engagement.

357
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:44,893
Because it's sort of what it grew out of.

358
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:46,866
At the heart of LiveOps,

359
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:49,168
it's really about taking care of a game

360
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,449
and taking care of the game's players

361
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,471
over an extended period of time.

362
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:55,172
So you can see that in the word itself.

363
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:58,714
It's live, it's connected experience, it's persistent,

364
00:17:59,135 --> 00:18:00,596
and there's an operation component

365
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:02,377
where you evolve and change

366
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:04,398
and take care of it with continual investment.

367
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,281
I have spent pretty much the entirety of my 17 years

368
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,162
in the industry working in LiveOps frameworks.

369
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:12,263
So a lot of experience with LiveOps.

370
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:14,925
And I've seen the approach in my time go

371
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:18,763
from mostly servicing relatively small niche communities

372
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:21,184
in virtual worlds online,

373
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:22,984
to being a big driving force

374
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,305
behind the free to play explosion,

375
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:26,146
and now having deep influence

376
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:27,946
on some of the most successful games today,

377
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:29,227
and also the AAA space.

378
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:35,189
So LiveOps has grown in its importance

379
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:36,709
to the game industry in general.

380
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,010
And I will say, as I work with teams

381
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,212
who are transitioning to thinking about making live games

382
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:43,952
and service-based games,

383
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:48,017
Teams that have some tradition of LiveOps

384
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:50,017
or some understanding of live operations

385
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:51,918
tend to be a little bit better prepared

386
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:54,599
for what's coming when they make this transition.

387
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:58,900
So that's LiveOps, but of course,

388
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,801
we wanna know how do you do LiveOps?

389
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:03,061
It would not be super fair for me to come and say,

390
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,422
hey, LiveOps is great, it's so much better

391
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:07,083
than all these other things you're doing,

392
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:09,243
and then not actually explain how to do it.

393
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:13,485
Well, like most things in game development, it's a journey.

394
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:17,797
Not a destination, just like prelaunch development, right?

395
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:24,100
LiveOps is a set of steps, so just prelaunch development,

396
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,320
and this is a very simplified version of that journey,

397
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,421
pre-production, production, launch.

398
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:29,461
Great, we've all been through it.

399
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:32,182
Unlike this part of development,

400
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:35,284
LiveOps tends to be additive instead of sequential.

401
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:38,445
So you never actually stop doing the basics.

402
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:40,943
You just keep adding more and more on, right?

403
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:43,865
So we start by doing basics, then we add optimizations,

404
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:44,826
then we add mastery.

405
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:47,888
You just sort of keep layering it on.

406
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:51,730
Of course, LiveOps actually does begin

407
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,491
well before the game is launched.

408
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:54,311
I know this sort of looks,

409
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:56,813
this chart sort of makes it seem like you make the game

410
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:57,954
and then you LiveOps it.

411
00:19:57,994 --> 00:19:58,874
And there's a lot of that,

412
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:01,296
but in order to do really great LiveOps,

413
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:02,756
you actually want to start really early.

414
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:04,826
You know, all the way back in pre-production,

415
00:20:04,846 --> 00:20:06,707
you should be thinking about your progression design,

416
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:09,088
your retention design, your monetization strategy.

417
00:20:09,548 --> 00:20:12,369
Then during production, you've got to be thinking about

418
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:13,930
what kind of goals you're going to be setting,

419
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,191
what kind of data you're going to be pulling in,

420
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:18,051
how you're going to do live content,

421
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:20,012
how you're going to do community feedback.

422
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:22,133
All of these things need to be part of the process

423
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:23,013
of building your game.

424
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,674
Then once you launch,

425
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:28,416
then we start getting into the specifics of these basics.

426
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:31,417
Live incidents process, feedback management,

427
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:32,317
game iteration.

428
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:35,325
and then adding in player behavior analytics,

429
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:38,386
strategy adjustments, segmentation and targeting,

430
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:39,866
breaking your game apart,

431
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:42,747
and really looking at how different players experience it,

432
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,888
all the way into community shaping, brand retention.

433
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:50,049
And I'm gonna go really deep on all of these things

434
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,589
in just a minute.

435
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:52,309
I'm actually gonna,

436
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,950
even though I do wanna impress upon you

437
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,551
that it is super important to start working

438
00:20:57,931 --> 00:20:59,431
on the live ops for your game

439
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:00,912
all the way back in pre-production,

440
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:02,252
we're gonna spend most of this talk.

441
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:07,517
Talking about what happens after launch and focused on those areas

442
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,798
where live apps is really the primary thing that you're doing

443
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:14,059
with your game and also going to be some of the things that are

444
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:17,059
most different from what traditional game developers might

445
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:19,460
be used to who mostly make games as a product. So we're going to

446
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,401
focus mostly on that, but I did want to make the point that

447
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:26,401
doing these things well before you get to launch is going to

448
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,802
set you up for success in live ops. There's probably a whole

449
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:37,041
So I said we're going to focus mostly on this part of the journey.

450
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:41,885
The process that starts with basics and then adds in some optimization and adds in some

451
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:42,165
mastery.

452
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:45,948
I'm going to go into detail about what I mean by those basics and what I mean by optimizing

453
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:51,052
and what I mean by the more advanced LiveOps mastery techniques as we walk through this.

454
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:56,096
But one more point I want to make before we dive in is that this really is a process that

455
00:21:56,276 --> 00:21:57,677
everyone has to go through.

456
00:21:58,824 --> 00:22:05,390
Live Ops can be very overwhelming if you think of all the things that you could do with a live game and try to execute on them at once.

457
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:14,497
And so in my experience, every game team, every game has to walk this path and they have to walk it iteratively.

458
00:22:14,838 --> 00:22:17,440
They have to add these things in slowly over time.

459
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,505
Even if I'm working with a team that shipped a dozen live games before, we still want to start with basics.

460
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:25,062
And then when we're good at that,

461
00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:25,902
add the optimizing.

462
00:22:26,022 --> 00:22:27,483
And then when we've got that under control,

463
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:29,824
add the mastery so that we don't get totally overwhelmed.

464
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,865
So that's something that I do want to say that

465
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,626
even if this is the very first time you're using LiveOps

466
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:36,226
or you've never done a live game before,

467
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,287
you're really not starting in any of a different position

468
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,308
than anybody that's doing it

469
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:42,869
and has done it many times before.

470
00:22:43,209 --> 00:22:45,690
They might have some past learnings and experience

471
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,630
to avoid some mistakes,

472
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,251
but you're all going to have to crawl

473
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,292
before you walk with every single game.

474
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:53,133
And that crawling starts with the basics.

475
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:54,962
So once your game is live,

476
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:58,824
the first thing you're gonna wanna focus on is the basics,

477
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:00,505
which is really encapsulated

478
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,866
with the idea of iterating on your game.

479
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:08,430
This is the first and most fundamental LiveOps skill

480
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,852
is making quick iterative updates to your game to improve it.

481
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,453
And when I say iterate,

482
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:17,615
I do not mean releasing planned DLC content.

483
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:19,657
That's not really iterative,

484
00:23:19,737 --> 00:23:21,578
that's just a slow.

485
00:23:22,117 --> 00:23:26,218
continual form of pre-launch production.

486
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:30,619
I mean actually making small, frequent changes to your game

487
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:33,380
in response to player feedback and behavioral data

488
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,880
to slowly improve the game over time.

489
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:38,221
This might seem obvious,

490
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,281
like yes, that's what iterating a game is,

491
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:44,182
but many AAA games still spend millions of dollars

492
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:45,923
avoiding this step.

493
00:23:46,483 --> 00:23:47,983
They really try to make the game

494
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:50,003
as perfect as possible before shipping.

495
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:55,499
And sometimes, inadvertently, that actually hinders their ability to iterate the game later

496
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:59,200
because they don't really design the game to be iterated.

497
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,141
That might seem tautological, but if you want to iterate on your game,

498
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:04,581
you need to design it to be iterated on.

499
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:08,862
And that actually speaks to the architecture of your game content

500
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:12,523
and the way that you're organizing all of what your game is.

501
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:17,305
As an example, I want to talk a little bit about Guild Wars 2.

502
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:20,085
And this is just sort of a story about...

503
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,007
not only iteration, but managing player feedback.

504
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:25,409
So this is a map for Guild Wars 2,

505
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:27,430
which is sort of the UI version of a map.

506
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:31,813
Maps are sort of the fundamental building block

507
00:24:31,993 --> 00:24:33,894
of the game world in Guild Wars 2.

508
00:24:34,414 --> 00:24:38,917
They are these massively large player spaces, right?

509
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,238
And they're filled with dynamic events

510
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,500
that kick off based on player activity in the map,

511
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:46,342
and also some real-world timers.

512
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:48,283
So when players are playing Guild Wars 2

513
00:24:48,343 --> 00:24:49,403
and they're out questing,

514
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:51,877
They don't go get quests from NPCs.

515
00:24:52,277 --> 00:24:55,498
They actually just engage with whatever event

516
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:57,419
is active in the area they're in at the time.

517
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,460
And some of their actions might trigger an event to happen,

518
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,080
or they might walk into an area

519
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,760
where an event is already underway,

520
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,921
or events might be designed to trigger automatically

521
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:08,442
every X number of minutes.

522
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:10,482
But the world is sort of this dynamic place

523
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,663
where players are walking around and engaging with it.

524
00:25:14,203 --> 00:25:15,924
So the Guild Wars 2 content designers

525
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:19,105
crafted the maps to be these branching chains of events.

526
00:25:19,578 --> 00:25:23,081
that are punctuated by fights with elite enemies called champions.

527
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:28,324
The design was that players would play through a sort of emerging story of events

528
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:30,686
that culminates in a boss fight, right?

529
00:25:30,706 --> 00:25:32,768
It was pretty traditional, it's just more dynamic.

530
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:36,751
And that players would just sort of experience this inside of the map,

531
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:38,832
probably in small groups or maybe even solo.

532
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:42,455
So when the game launched, we had made all of our maps

533
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:44,937
match sort of this philosophy, and then...

534
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:50,349
nothing about our plan actually ended up working that way

535
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:53,971
because players did not do what we expected them to do,

536
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:54,871
shockingly.

537
00:25:56,652 --> 00:25:59,474
Instead, players coordinated over chat

538
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:02,796
to form these large groups of 50 to 100 players

539
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:06,017
that would roam the map as a devastating zerg

540
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:07,658
in this efficient loop,

541
00:26:07,918 --> 00:26:10,120
defeating all the champions in succession.

542
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,621
And they called this the champ train.

543
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:13,661
And it didn't take long.

544
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:16,598
for players to get these champ trains organized.

545
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,199
The champ train ignored the intended story-driven loops

546
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:23,700
of events and it removed a lot of the challenge

547
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,020
that would come from battling bosses

548
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,401
because the zerg of 100 players can simply steamroll

549
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:29,761
basically everything in the map.

550
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,202
And so this was really nothing

551
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,903
like what the content designers had intended at all.

552
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,663
And at first we tried to come up with ways

553
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:41,004
to discourage this behavior and sort of force players.

554
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:44,695
back into the intended track, move things around,

555
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:46,056
separate it, disincentivize it.

556
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:48,637
But the truth was, as we were playing the game too

557
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:51,778
and listening to feedback, the chat train was really fun.

558
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:54,019
And players actually really enjoyed it.

559
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:54,939
It was a good time.

560
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:57,140
It's fun to join a big zerg of players

561
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,921
and just sort of steamroll over things

562
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:03,402
and have all this sort of efficient move around the map.

563
00:27:03,842 --> 00:27:06,523
You can just sort of join up and follow along.

564
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:13,577
And what we saw was actually players that participated had better engagement and the maps with good champ train sought more playtime.

565
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:15,578
So players were really liking this.

566
00:27:16,098 --> 00:27:20,879
So we basically pretty quickly said, OK, we give in.

567
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,540
This emergent behavior is actually a good thing.

568
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,660
And we switched our approach.

569
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,942
Instead of trying to stop the champ train, we asked, how do we make them as fun as possible for everyone?

570
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:33,794
Ultimately what that meant was we relocated

571
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:35,835
many of the champ trains away from starter zones.

572
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,216
We sort of moved them around the map

573
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,397
to keep them away from people

574
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:39,877
who were just starting out in the game

575
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:41,798
because that wasn't a fantastic experience for them.

576
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:44,440
We added boss timers to the worlds

577
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,080
for better coordination in the game.

578
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:48,402
We adjusted many of the event loops

579
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:50,403
to remove the incentive to fail events

580
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:52,684
because previously some of those bosses

581
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,724
that the champ train wanted to get

582
00:27:53,764 --> 00:27:55,525
could only happen if they failed an event,

583
00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:58,326
which was not great and would disrupt the story

584
00:27:58,346 --> 00:28:00,147
for people who were trying to consume the story.

585
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:04,660
And we made a lot of adjustments to loot and loops

586
00:28:05,621 --> 00:28:06,862
and all of that great stuff.

587
00:28:07,863 --> 00:28:09,504
One thing this didn't solve was Champ Train

588
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,466
still made boss battles pretty trivial,

589
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:13,847
but we actually learned from this as well eventually.

590
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:16,990
And we eventually actually used this to design

591
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,473
really cool, challenging open world bosses

592
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,214
that were meant to be played

593
00:28:22,274 --> 00:28:24,216
by like a group of 100 players at once.

594
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:25,997
This is Dequadal, which is one of those

595
00:28:26,397 --> 00:28:28,439
first really large scale.

596
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:31,755
bosses be added after the game was already live.

597
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:33,355
It's meant to be played by a group,

598
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:35,275
I think the optimal group is like 80,

599
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:37,956
coordinating together to take them down.

600
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:42,857
And so this was actually a big achievement for us

601
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:45,917
in listening to player feedback and not reacting

602
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:47,998
and trying to force them into the mold

603
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:48,898
we thought they should be in,

604
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:51,478
but actually going along with their emergent behavior

605
00:28:51,518 --> 00:28:52,979
and what they really enjoyed doing.

606
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:56,459
But what's really important is that none of this

607
00:28:56,499 --> 00:28:59,040
would be possible if it hadn't been easy.

608
00:28:59,543 --> 00:29:03,167
for us to move things around, mess with boss timing,

609
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:05,729
change balance rewards without breaking the structure

610
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:06,610
of everything in the map.

611
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,632
Because we knew before we launched the game

612
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,235
that we would probably want to make changes to it

613
00:29:12,395 --> 00:29:13,716
after a lot of players were playing it,

614
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:16,318
it was possible for us to make these changes.

615
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:18,340
I'm not going to say it was trivial,

616
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,142
but it was definitely doable,

617
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:22,644
and we didn't have to worry about breaking the whole game

618
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:24,946
because we were going to move around some quests.

619
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:31,123
So the point of that just is that content

620
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,723
is the first thing you want to think about.

621
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:34,264
And while that does require some planning

622
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:35,344
before you do the live game,

623
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:38,185
in order to make it possible for you to iterate,

624
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:40,326
you want to be focused in this point

625
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,667
in your live ops journey on that iteration.

626
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:44,187
Improve the game's performance,

627
00:29:44,307 --> 00:29:46,448
extend its life, respond to feedback.

628
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:48,469
That is going to require that you also

629
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,670
build some feedback management processes

630
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,930
and also some live incident processes.

631
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,411
So you're going to want to figure out

632
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:55,992
how you want to take in that feedback.

633
00:29:56,963 --> 00:30:00,104
You can start by just reading forums or Reddit.

634
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:03,365
That's probably going to give you a bit of a skewed perspective on things.

635
00:30:03,445 --> 00:30:07,186
So you might want to think a little more deeply about how you're going to process feedback as it comes in.

636
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:10,727
Are you going to set up other channels for players to deliver that feedback to you?

637
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:13,888
How are you going to handle the feedback coming from inside the team as well?

638
00:30:14,808 --> 00:30:19,349
And then, of course, live incident processes when inevitably something's going to go wrong.

639
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:21,570
As you're iterating the game, you're going to make mistakes.

640
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,910
Games are incredibly complicated and messy.

641
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,781
and it's pretty much impossible to avoid.

642
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:27,862
So what are you going to do when that happens?

643
00:30:28,402 --> 00:30:30,664
Hopefully not panic and hopefully respond in a way

644
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,564
that's going to be healthy for your community.

645
00:30:33,085 --> 00:30:34,465
And finally, rounding this out

646
00:30:34,786 --> 00:30:36,206
is business intelligence tracking.

647
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:37,587
I put this on here,

648
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:40,048
even though it might not seem like a design area of focus,

649
00:30:40,328 --> 00:30:41,469
because in my experience,

650
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:44,851
teams that are really good at this phase of live ops

651
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:47,552
do have design take a larger role in that area.

652
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,013
With all the iteration and feedback response going on,

653
00:30:50,253 --> 00:30:51,694
design really does need to be on top

654
00:30:51,714 --> 00:30:53,335
of how those changes are affecting the community

655
00:30:53,495 --> 00:30:54,095
and the business.

656
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:57,019
to avoid conflicts where design wants to do one thing

657
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,581
and business doesn't want to do that.

658
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:01,682
So you really need to keep those guys close

659
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:04,744
and working in concert in order to make this

660
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:08,687
a more successful iterative process for your game.

661
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:13,209
So awesome, live ops basics, you're iterating your game.

662
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,510
If you can get good at this,

663
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,752
if you can in fact iterate on your game

664
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:20,634
without having to destroy the whole thing

665
00:31:20,674 --> 00:31:22,675
and you're making incremental improvements.

666
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:25,740
And you get to this point where you start saying things like,

667
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,262
man, I wish that we had a little bit more insight

668
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:31,982
into which changes we want to make.

669
00:31:32,463 --> 00:31:35,003
Also, maybe some of the changes we want to make

670
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:37,164
are good for some group of players, but not another.

671
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:41,266
You're ready to move on to the second phase

672
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:45,247
of LiveOps maturity, which is LiveOps optimizing

673
00:31:45,907 --> 00:31:48,688
with a focus on personalizing your player's experience.

674
00:31:50,888 --> 00:31:53,690
This is all about serving content and experiences

675
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,592
to players based on who they are and how they behave,

676
00:31:56,912 --> 00:32:00,075
instead of just making blunt overall changes to the game.

677
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:02,056
This is what most people are thinking of

678
00:32:02,076 --> 00:32:03,157
when they talk about gathering up

679
00:32:03,197 --> 00:32:04,458
tons of player behavior data.

680
00:32:05,078 --> 00:32:05,999
Right, they think like, yeah,

681
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:08,241
we're gonna like do a bunch of segmentation

682
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,062
and like analyze it,

683
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:12,063
and then it's gonna tell us all kinds of cool stuff

684
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,624
that we should do to the game to make it better.

685
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:18,168
I do think a lot of teams try to do this step first,

686
00:32:18,664 --> 00:32:21,366
but I would suggest that it is very

687
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:23,528
difficult to make this step work for

688
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:25,849
you if you don't have the basics down,

689
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,531
because data is only valuable if you

690
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:29,892
can actually do something with it.

691
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:33,335
So even if you collect lots of fantastic data,

692
00:32:33,575 --> 00:32:34,876
it can be really,

693
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:36,937
really hard to action on it if you

694
00:32:36,977 --> 00:32:41,181
don't actually have the means to make

695
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:42,922
those iterative changes into the game.

696
00:32:42,942 --> 00:32:46,905
OK, so we're optimizing.

697
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:52,930
What does this really mean to a development team functionally?

698
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,930
A lot of it is about segmentation.

699
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,491
Segmentation, whether we're talking about

700
00:32:57,931 --> 00:32:59,752
segmenting by acquisition timing,

701
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:02,213
like these players all joined the game in the same month,

702
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:03,553
or these players all joined the game

703
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:06,834
from the same marketing campaign.

704
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,495
Or in-game behavior, right?

705
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:11,536
These players only ever do PVP,

706
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:14,617
and these players only ever do story content.

707
00:33:15,157 --> 00:33:16,918
Or player motivation, right?

708
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:19,679
These players really will do anything

709
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:23,201
that gets their progression to increase.

710
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,821
Or these players will only do things

711
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:25,682
that are socially motivated.

712
00:33:26,102 --> 00:33:27,382
All of these are segmentations

713
00:33:28,103 --> 00:33:30,704
that you can make to your players

714
00:33:30,904 --> 00:33:32,545
and look at them differently.

715
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,186
And it can be an incredibly powerful tool

716
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:37,947
in driving more targeted changes into your game.

717
00:33:40,028 --> 00:33:40,348
Excuse me.

718
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:44,630
In phase one, teams tend to rely pretty much solely

719
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,212
on just the design team's expertise,

720
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:49,174
the things that you already know that you should do,

721
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:52,316
and direct player feedback to drive iteration.

722
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:54,758
But where that can start to fall down

723
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:58,882
is when you have changes that you want to make

724
00:33:58,922 --> 00:34:01,224
that are really only for one group of players,

725
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:03,666
and that group of players may actually be quite different

726
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:06,608
than you expected or different than the group of players

727
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,310
that's spending a lot of time giving you feedback.

728
00:34:09,098 --> 00:34:27,535
Tutorials and first time user experiences are notoriously difficult to optimize without using a data approach because designers and engaged players don't usually give great feedback on being a new player because they don't really remember what it was like to be a new player and it's difficult to give that mindset.

729
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:34,681
You know, just to drive this home, this is some retention data from a game that I worked on and you can see.

730
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:36,623
that it gets better over time.

731
00:34:36,863 --> 00:34:38,204
But what's really important is what we did

732
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:40,245
to make this improvement happen.

733
00:34:40,686 --> 00:34:43,387
We started by just making basic updates to the game.

734
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:44,328
We asked the design team,

735
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,469
hey, could you improve the first time user experience?

736
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,050
And they went in and they looked at it and they're like,

737
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,311
well, these things are not that great

738
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:50,892
and these things are not that great, we'll change them.

739
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:52,313
And they did have an improvement.

740
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,234
Like when we made those updates, it did actually help.

741
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:55,655
But it didn't help that much.

742
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:57,697
And we were sort of running into this problem

743
00:34:57,757 --> 00:34:58,998
over and over again where design was like,

744
00:34:59,018 --> 00:35:02,059
well, I don't really know what's gonna make a difference.

745
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,261
And so then we added A-B testing.

746
00:35:05,177 --> 00:35:09,061
And A-B testing is just making a small change

747
00:35:09,661 --> 00:35:12,304
and having one group of players,

748
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:14,686
that would be the A group, experience that change,

749
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,087
and another group of players, the B group,

750
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,288
not experience that change,

751
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:18,450
or experience something different,

752
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,891
and then see which one is better.

753
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,532
And then whichever one performs better

754
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,394
make that the final change.

755
00:35:23,474 --> 00:35:24,895
And so you can do this iteratively over time

756
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:25,916
with very small things,

757
00:35:26,217 --> 00:35:28,199
and that can start to add up to big changes,

758
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:29,320
as you can see in this graph.

759
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,721
We really started to unlock.

760
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:33,776
And this wasn't just doing exactly what the A B testing said.

761
00:35:34,057 --> 00:35:36,379
It was actually a combination of A B testing and design.

762
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:38,500
Because as the A B test results came back,

763
00:35:38,801 --> 00:35:40,562
that helped the designers go,

764
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:44,105
oh, this is really what's making a big difference.

765
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:47,208
I'm going to focus on making great designs around that instead.

766
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:53,773
So the next thing we can talk about in this optimizing phase is

767
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:56,814
The idea of sort of machine learning.

768
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,255
This is very popular right now,

769
00:35:58,355 --> 00:36:00,197
and a lot of times I talk to teams

770
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:01,138
and they're like, yeah,

771
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:03,300
I want to do a lot of multivariate testing.

772
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,621
I really want to build a bunch of

773
00:36:05,681 --> 00:36:06,943
machine learning that's going to

774
00:36:07,303 --> 00:36:08,464
make those changes for me,

775
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:09,985
and that is really cool.

776
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,686
And if you work for a really big team

777
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:13,408
with a lot of fantastic analytics

778
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:15,570
available to you, you can do that.

779
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,112
But I do want to say that you don't need that.

780
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:20,734
You can actually get a lot done

781
00:36:21,154 --> 00:36:23,156
with pretty basic information.

782
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:28,205
As an example, there's this example from MapleStory.

783
00:36:28,826 --> 00:36:31,227
So MapleStory, and this was quite a long time ago

784
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:33,568
before we really had a lot of fancy machine learning at all.

785
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:36,590
So this is actually one of my favorite examples.

786
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,471
It's a system we introduced in MapleStory

787
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,812
where when we saw players exhibit behaviors

788
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,993
that correlated with churn,

789
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:43,293
and this was pretty basic stuff,

790
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,154
like logging in less frequently,

791
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:46,895
leveling up less frequently,

792
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,716
not talking to their friends as much.

793
00:36:49,865 --> 00:36:51,887
We would look at that behavior and we say,

794
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:52,887
oh, if you're doing these things,

795
00:36:52,907 --> 00:36:54,048
you get a little flag on you.

796
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:57,611
And then there's a chance that when you log out,

797
00:36:57,811 --> 00:36:58,952
you'll get this special message,

798
00:36:59,232 --> 00:36:59,992
which is basically,

799
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:04,135
hey, if you log back in tomorrow or in the next three days,

800
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,396
you're gonna get a free gift.

801
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:08,138
And we didn't really worry about making

802
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:09,959
churn prediction model perfectly accurate.

803
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,581
We were really just trying to see if this would work

804
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:16,083
with basic information about churn,

805
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,104
just really obvious stuff.

806
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,052
In fact, we actually eventually expanded this

807
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:24,094
to allow the gift to trigger on accounts

808
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:25,975
that didn't meet the term prediction criteria

809
00:37:26,275 --> 00:37:28,297
because the effect it was having was so positive.

810
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:31,539
It was a really, really successful campaign.

811
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:34,481
Players were actually really into this idea.

812
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:36,423
They didn't really know why they would get the gift

813
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,064
and there was a lot of conspiracy theories

814
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:39,145
about what would get you the gift.

815
00:37:39,505 --> 00:37:41,807
And it just sort of generally increased retention

816
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:43,108
across the board.

817
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:46,030
And even though that's not what we think of

818
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,672
super tight focused machine learning.

819
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:51,797
algorithms that optimize everything.

820
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,139
This was still a big benefit to the game

821
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:56,201
and still really worthwhile to do.

822
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:58,503
So I would say even if you don't have access

823
00:37:58,563 --> 00:38:01,385
to that kind of sophisticated machine learning,

824
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,387
you can still try some things that can have

825
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,608
a really positive effect.

826
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:06,730
It's just important if you don't have

827
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,991
that kind of sophisticated analytics

828
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:09,672
to make sure that you do look

829
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,514
and make sure it did have a positive effect

830
00:38:11,534 --> 00:38:12,395
and not a negative effect

831
00:38:12,435 --> 00:38:14,657
and then react to those changes accordingly.

832
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:17,839
Okay, so we have the basics.

833
00:38:18,602 --> 00:38:21,264
And then we've added in this optimization

834
00:38:21,964 --> 00:38:25,987
where we've really focused on personalizing the experience

835
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:29,290
and targeting offers and content to our players

836
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,152
to like reduce risk

837
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:33,213
and optimize individual player experience.

838
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:34,734
So if you're doing both of these things

839
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:38,037
and you're really having a lot of success already

840
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:39,658
in getting these things done,

841
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:42,480
we can move on to this final step

842
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,582
where we add in the most sophisticated.

843
00:38:45,637 --> 00:38:48,978
LiveOps tactics, which is sort of called LiveOps mastery.

844
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,959
And specifically, when I think about this step,

845
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:54,640
the really the most advanced tactics for LiveOps,

846
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,261
I think about expanding your game's engagement

847
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:01,702
beyond the time players spend playing.

848
00:39:02,302 --> 00:39:04,183
At this phase, you should be thinking of your game

849
00:39:04,283 --> 00:39:07,324
as more than a collection of systems and content, right?

850
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:09,685
Discussing the game, making fan art,

851
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:11,386
reading tie-in comic books,

852
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:12,566
meeting guild mates in real life.

853
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:15,352
All of these are actually a part of your game,

854
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,813
and they should be something that you care about designing.

855
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:21,234
And that experience becomes vitally important

856
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,934
as you move through this LiveOps journey.

857
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:25,715
Because if you want to get to the place

858
00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:28,016
where you're strengthening your brand and your loyalty,

859
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:31,497
and you actually start seeing organic growth and sustainment,

860
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:34,838
i.e. not always having to pay for all your acquisition,

861
00:39:35,118 --> 00:39:36,358
you're going to have to focus on more

862
00:39:36,398 --> 00:39:38,339
than just what's happening inside of the game.

863
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:40,640
While a lot of this work,

864
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:43,137
happens quite literally outside of the game.

865
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:45,619
Supportive integration with game systems

866
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:47,701
is really what separates the best from the rest

867
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:48,561
in this area.

868
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:52,364
And it really behooves designers to think a lot

869
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:54,846
about what these experiences are for their players,

870
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:56,667
even outside of time spent in the game.

871
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,409
Many of the examples for this phase,

872
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:01,230
when we actually talk about systems in the game

873
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,973
and not just outside community events and things like that,

874
00:40:05,313 --> 00:40:06,534
many of these examples are things

875
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:07,975
that lots of games actually do,

876
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,456
but very few do really well.

877
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:12,033
An example I like to use is matchmaking.

878
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:13,794
It's something that we've gotten

879
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:15,395
really good at as an industry.

880
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:17,296
If we define it as predicting who

881
00:40:17,336 --> 00:40:18,697
will win competitive matches,

882
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:21,038
but we've struggled to really create

883
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:22,519
matchmaking that predicts who will

884
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:25,901
have fun together and so we actually

885
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:27,842
ended up using matchmaking for something

886
00:40:27,882 --> 00:40:29,743
a lot more social in Guild Wars 2.

887
00:40:30,143 --> 00:40:31,584
I think is a really interesting

888
00:40:31,624 --> 00:40:33,145
example of this kind of.

889
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:36,287
Thinking of engagement beyond

890
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,327
just game systems.

891
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:40,024
So I'm going to talk about Mega Servers,

892
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:43,046
which is a whole program that we developed

893
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:44,988
in Guild Wars 2 after the game had launched.

894
00:40:45,308 --> 00:40:46,329
But when the game launched,

895
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:49,652
the way that Guild Wars 2 worked was players would log in

896
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:53,855
and then they would tell us what map they wanted to go to.

897
00:40:54,296 --> 00:40:56,217
Right? In this case, Silverwaste,

898
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:57,478
which is a map in Guild Wars 2.

899
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:00,201
And then we would go, okay, you want to go to Silverwaste?

900
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:02,142
Well, let's see if there's already

901
00:41:02,282 --> 00:41:03,683
a Silverwaste server up and running.

902
00:41:03,824 --> 00:41:04,884
Oh, there is, here it is.

903
00:41:05,445 --> 00:41:06,486
And there's an empty slot in it.

904
00:41:06,826 --> 00:41:07,347
So awesome.

905
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,111
you will be moved into this server.

906
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:12,171
And that was sort of the way it was supposed to work, right?

907
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,572
Players would be sorted into the server until it was full.

908
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:18,192
And then when it was full and another player showed up,

909
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:20,173
they'd come along and say,

910
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:22,013
hey, I want to go to Silverwaste.

911
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:25,574
And we'd say, well, there's no room in Silverwaste,

912
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:28,234
so we'll make a new version of Silverwaste for you.

913
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:30,075
And you can go there.

914
00:41:30,715 --> 00:41:33,275
And then, you know, that one will eventually fill up too.

915
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:35,896
And this all sounds pretty good on paper,

916
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:36,396
but...

917
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:38,457
In reality, when the game was live,

918
00:41:38,737 --> 00:41:41,619
what happened was we had a bunch of servers for maps,

919
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,702
and then naturally players would empty out of those servers

920
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:48,704
in a very organic, unorganized way.

921
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:52,207
And eventually we would end up with sad,

922
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:54,329
lonely players on an empty server

923
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:57,131
with really no way to get more players in

924
00:41:57,211 --> 00:41:59,753
because they aren't the most recent server.

925
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:01,734
And so when someone new comes to join,

926
00:42:02,175 --> 00:42:03,936
they would actually go to this server.

927
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:07,231
that was most recently spun up instead of to the empty,

928
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,832
lonely person above.

929
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:14,173
Worse, we didn't really do anything to ensure

930
00:42:14,253 --> 00:42:15,934
that when a player joined your server,

931
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:17,074
you were happy about it.

932
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,996
And so in fact, sometimes players would not be happy

933
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:22,716
about it, they wouldn't like the person

934
00:42:22,736 --> 00:42:24,797
that they were randomly paired with in their server

935
00:42:25,017 --> 00:42:28,378
and their, you know, enjoyment of the game would go down.

936
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:30,879
So this led to a lot of inefficiencies,

937
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:32,779
where you can see that this is also from a,

938
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:35,933
services component incredibly inefficient.

939
00:42:36,233 --> 00:42:38,534
And so we decided we wanted to take

940
00:42:38,574 --> 00:42:40,074
a totally different approach to this.

941
00:42:41,055 --> 00:42:42,635
A lot of it was spurred by this idea

942
00:42:42,655 --> 00:42:44,156
of can we make this more efficient,

943
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:47,236
but it quickly expanded to asking,

944
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:49,697
can we make the game more enjoyable?

945
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:53,198
So we changed everything about how we did this.

946
00:42:53,898 --> 00:42:55,419
Now when you log in, we would say,

947
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:56,359
where do you want to go?

948
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:58,920
But before we put you there,

949
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,860
we'd ask you a whole lot of things about yourself.

950
00:43:03,091 --> 00:43:03,811
Are you in a guild?

951
00:43:04,231 --> 00:43:05,792
Have you played in a party recently?

952
00:43:06,092 --> 00:43:07,692
What kind of content do you like to play?

953
00:43:07,772 --> 00:43:09,293
What kind of play time do you usually have?

954
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:10,053
What's your level?

955
00:43:10,073 --> 00:43:10,673
What's your class?

956
00:43:10,993 --> 00:43:12,314
What's the last map that you were in?

957
00:43:12,334 --> 00:43:14,114
And we've learned all these things about you

958
00:43:14,214 --> 00:43:16,095
and we had different weightings and we'd say, okay,

959
00:43:16,675 --> 00:43:18,435
now we know a little bit more about you.

960
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:21,036
You're not just a random person, you're a specific person.

961
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:23,337
And you want to go to Silverwaste, which is great.

962
00:43:23,657 --> 00:43:26,137
We actually have multiple Silverwaste servers open.

963
00:43:26,518 --> 00:43:28,738
Which one are you going to be the happiest on?

964
00:43:29,198 --> 00:43:29,358
Well,

965
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:33,567
This is the one that we think you're going to fit the best with because of your play style,

966
00:43:33,607 --> 00:43:40,450
so you should go there. And this was took some learning, right? Like, you know, the waiting,

967
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,172
we didn't, we had to make some guesses at first, and then we had to optimize that over time.

968
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:50,955
We also made some fairly large mistakes early on. For instance, the first version of this

969
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:55,277
sorting algorithm just straight up didn't ask what language you spoke.

970
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:01,371
And it turns out that sorting people into servers with a bunch of people who don't speak their language makes them pretty unhappy.

971
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:12,574
That was fairly easy to fix, right? We started, we added the language option in pretty quickly, and that was very heavily weighted because even if you would get along really well with a server full of people,

972
00:44:12,914 --> 00:44:16,955
if none of them speak Spanish, you're probably actually not going to have that great of a time.

973
00:44:17,035 --> 00:44:20,275
So we might actually find out that maybe you do match.

974
00:44:20,615 --> 00:44:21,816
The first server here a little better,

975
00:44:22,056 --> 00:44:23,117
but we're going to put you up here

976
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:24,678
because that's where people are

977
00:44:24,698 --> 00:44:25,638
going to be speaking your language,

978
00:44:25,658 --> 00:44:26,599
and that makes a big difference.

979
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,320
This effort,

980
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:32,223
which was driven by engineering and design,

981
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:35,105
ultimately just really improved the

982
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:36,266
social experience in the game in

983
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,847
general and we had we had general

984
00:44:37,948 --> 00:44:41,210
uplift in player engagement and

985
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,211
retention and and you know I don't know.

986
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:44,653
It might be overstating a little bit,

987
00:44:44,713 --> 00:44:46,214
but as our game matured,

988
00:44:46,294 --> 00:44:49,216
I think this system really helped.

989
00:44:49,713 --> 00:44:55,597
the game grow and thrive after it got over that initial excitement of launch

990
00:44:55,657 --> 00:44:58,479
and really became more about a continual community.

991
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:07,264
Such as one example of using in-game systems to drive the kind of social

992
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,546
behavior we want that can extend outside of the game itself.

993
00:45:11,346 --> 00:45:14,648
Another one is to think about community events.

994
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:18,150
When we think about community, a lot of times designers think about

995
00:45:18,563 --> 00:45:20,925
you know, forum moderation and fan meetups,

996
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:23,766
but communities really form and thrive

997
00:45:24,446 --> 00:45:25,747
because they have something to talk about.

998
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:27,468
And that usually actually comes from the game itself.

999
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:30,189
And so sometimes we actually want to create content

1000
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:32,410
that's about making a community moment

1001
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:37,692
and not just about driving playtime or increasing revenue,

1002
00:45:38,013 --> 00:45:39,793
but it's really just about getting players

1003
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,274
something cool and exciting to do.

1004
00:45:41,294 --> 00:45:44,056
So one of my favorite events we ever ran in MapleStory

1005
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:46,177
was the Random Beauty Coupon Drop event.

1006
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,071
So we have these random beauty coupons

1007
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:51,852
you can buy in MapleStory.

1008
00:45:52,373 --> 00:45:53,774
And they were this consumable item.

1009
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:55,234
And when you use them,

1010
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:57,476
they would change your appearance totally randomly.

1011
00:45:57,496 --> 00:45:59,377
You get a random face, random hair,

1012
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:01,118
random skin tone, random eyes.

1013
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:02,459
All these would be random.

1014
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:04,820
This was not a very popular item

1015
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,081
because it was truly random.

1016
00:46:06,401 --> 00:46:08,262
And there was hundreds of appearance options.

1017
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:10,403
So you can end up with something pretty funky

1018
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:12,624
as a pretty significant roll of the dice.

1019
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:15,186
So they weren't that popular.

1020
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:16,167
We didn't sell that many of them.

1021
00:46:16,428 --> 00:46:19,109
But we decided it would be fun to run this event

1022
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,751
where we dropped them commonly

1023
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:23,372
off of all the monsters in the game.

1024
00:46:23,812 --> 00:46:25,453
So now when the players were playing,

1025
00:46:26,093 --> 00:46:27,594
they would defeat an enemy

1026
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:29,755
and they would get sometimes multiple

1027
00:46:30,615 --> 00:46:32,336
random beauty coupons in their inventory.

1028
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,778
And so they had access to all these random beauty coupons.

1029
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:35,618
They had tons of them.

1030
00:46:35,978 --> 00:46:37,799
And they started consuming them all the time.

1031
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:40,280
And we started seeing these crazy combos

1032
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:42,141
we'd never seen in their appearance.

1033
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:44,583
And people were posting screenshots on the forums.

1034
00:46:44,603 --> 00:46:45,743
Look at this weird.

1035
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:49,984
you know, green skin, red hair thing that I got,

1036
00:46:50,305 --> 00:46:52,886
and it really drove a ton of fun engagement.

1037
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:54,626
It was just light and fun,

1038
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:56,587
and players were really enjoying it.

1039
00:46:56,867 --> 00:46:59,108
It actually ultimately did end up having a positive effect

1040
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:01,429
on our revenue because it actually exposed people

1041
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:04,050
to cosmetic options they didn't know about before,

1042
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,711
and they actually went and bought those permanently.

1043
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:09,272
But mostly it was done to drive this kind of interest

1044
00:47:09,372 --> 00:47:11,053
and get people excited about logging in.

1045
00:47:11,073 --> 00:47:13,294
And it was a pretty generous event, right?

1046
00:47:13,314 --> 00:47:14,895
We were giving away something that technically

1047
00:47:15,389 --> 00:47:18,010
You know we sold and had monetary value,

1048
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,030
but it really was incredibly worth it.

1049
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,751
And a lot of fun. OK,

1050
00:47:24,651 --> 00:47:27,251
so this is the journey I wanted

1051
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:28,792
to talk about today, right?

1052
00:47:28,832 --> 00:47:29,952
Starting with these basics,

1053
00:47:30,752 --> 00:47:32,712
moving into optimization and then mastery.

1054
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:36,333
Every game that sees a lot seeks to do

1055
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:38,734
live ops has to tackle these cool areas.

1056
00:47:38,894 --> 00:47:39,694
Core areas, right?

1057
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:41,094
We have to think about content.

1058
00:47:41,394 --> 00:47:42,794
We have to think about players very.

1059
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:44,655
We have to think about community engagement.

1060
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:47,283
All of these things are really core to LiveOps.

1061
00:47:47,924 --> 00:47:50,105
Some teams are going to focus on different portions

1062
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:51,326
for different amounts of time.

1063
00:47:51,686 --> 00:47:52,927
Some are actually going to, you know,

1064
00:47:53,228 --> 00:47:55,729
move pieces of this at different lines in the journey.

1065
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,911
But what's really important, I think,

1066
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,312
for me to drive home to you,

1067
00:47:59,732 --> 00:48:01,814
is it really is a process

1068
00:48:02,194 --> 00:48:04,676
where you want to add things on slowly.

1069
00:48:04,996 --> 00:48:06,617
Don't try to take it on all at once.

1070
00:48:07,158 --> 00:48:09,179
My advice is start with content,

1071
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,700
then move to players.

1072
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:11,954
then move to community.

1073
00:48:12,234 --> 00:48:14,915
That's the method that has really been successful

1074
00:48:15,235 --> 00:48:16,816
for me and my teams and my career.

1075
00:48:17,476 --> 00:48:19,077
There's some play to move some stuff around

1076
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:20,977
and you'll get examples from teams,

1077
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:23,538
you know, that really focused on a lot of the stuff

1078
00:48:23,558 --> 00:48:24,959
that I have in mastery early on

1079
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:26,359
and that may have been really good for them.

1080
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:28,800
But especially if you're starting out from scratch,

1081
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,821
never having done it before,

1082
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:32,922
this could be a good roadmap to help you get your feet wet

1083
00:48:33,182 --> 00:48:35,063
and really get in there and start working.

1084
00:48:35,383 --> 00:48:36,283
And I would also say,

1085
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:38,184
resist the urge to move on

1086
00:48:38,204 --> 00:48:39,724
and add more complicated techniques

1087
00:48:39,804 --> 00:48:40,505
until you really.

1088
00:48:40,915 --> 00:48:42,115
Get the basic ones down.

1089
00:48:42,616 --> 00:48:44,197
Really get to the place where you can iterate

1090
00:48:44,517 --> 00:48:46,318
before you start trying to do fancy things

1091
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:47,079
with segmentation.

1092
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:49,020
Really get to the place where you feel like

1093
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,381
you can personalize and focus

1094
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,722
before you start trying to, you know,

1095
00:48:52,742 --> 00:48:55,144
drive a lot of viral excitement about your game.

1096
00:48:55,484 --> 00:48:57,685
And then I think you're gonna have a much easier time

1097
00:48:58,426 --> 00:49:01,448
getting success and help keep your players happier

1098
00:49:01,508 --> 00:49:03,889
with a more predictable game

1099
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:06,231
that's really focused on giving them what they need.

1100
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:09,833
Yeah, what's this all about?

1101
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:10,373
So this is.

1102
00:49:11,127 --> 00:49:15,150
A lot of this talk just came from me feeling like design,

1103
00:49:15,671 --> 00:49:18,112
games in general, but design really needs more

1104
00:49:18,152 --> 00:49:18,993
than just services.

1105
00:49:19,113 --> 00:49:21,515
It's great that we have a service mentality now.

1106
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:24,517
It's great that we have access to these new ways

1107
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:25,938
of thinking about business strategy

1108
00:49:25,978 --> 00:49:27,439
and new ways of thinking about games,

1109
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,782
but design does need more than that.

1110
00:49:31,783 --> 00:49:33,904
And I think it's important for designers to push

1111
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:37,827
for our view of live games to be equally as important

1112
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:38,768
as businesses view.

1113
00:49:39,651 --> 00:49:42,192
To a designer, games are culture, right?

1114
00:49:42,533 --> 00:49:43,313
That's what we make.

1115
00:49:43,493 --> 00:49:47,115
We create these communities of people that play together

1116
00:49:47,155 --> 00:49:48,336
and have a shared interest.

1117
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:50,237
It's more than consumed media.

1118
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:52,478
It's about deep, intrinsic motivations,

1119
00:49:52,558 --> 00:49:53,679
continual engagement.

1120
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:56,300
It's really about thinking about our games

1121
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,461
through this lens.

1122
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:00,783
You know, sometimes at Xbox,

1123
00:50:00,843 --> 00:50:02,904
we talk about games as community.

1124
00:50:02,964 --> 00:50:05,565
The game itself is a community,

1125
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,026
and that really is the core of it.

1126
00:50:07,593 --> 00:50:15,118
We also talk about games as culture and the effect that games have outside of just the client and the thing that players play with.

1127
00:50:15,438 --> 00:50:20,481
And I think that that is getting a little closer to the heart of how design sees live games.

1128
00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:24,764
Okay, so I'll leave you here with this journey.

1129
00:50:25,645 --> 00:50:29,307
In that declaration, the design needs more than just games as a service thinking.

1130
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:35,751
It's important to us and I would like to encourage you all to keep pushing to make designs.

1131
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:38,506
voice heard and use these live ops

1132
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:40,367
techniques to make your live games better.

1133
00:50:40,927 --> 00:50:43,909
Now in this virtual version of GDC,

1134
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:45,249
I can't take questions right now,

1135
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:46,370
which is unfortunate,

1136
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:49,631
but my email address is right here.

1137
00:50:49,771 --> 00:50:51,052
If you have questions or you just

1138
00:50:51,072 --> 00:50:52,413
want to talk about live ops,

1139
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:55,274
please don't hesitate to drop me a line

1140
00:50:55,874 --> 00:50:56,775
and let me know what you think.

1141
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:57,655
Thank you so much.
