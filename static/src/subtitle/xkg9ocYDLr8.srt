1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,451
Okay, so thanks for coming to the session,

2
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:08,972
throwing out the dopamine shots,

3
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:10,793
rewards without the neurotrash.

4
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,974
Just to get started, we've got the housekeeping

5
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:16,116
stuff, please turn off your cell phones

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,836
or put them on silent and please do

7
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:19,177
the evaluation afterwards, it'd be

8
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:19,597
really cool.

9
00:00:19,597 --> 00:00:19,938
Okay, so my name's

10
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:24,100
Ben, I'm a UX researcher

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,861
at Epic Games, I have a PhD

12
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,202
in psychology, I've worked in neuroscience departments

13
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,344
and human effectiveness departments

14
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:33,425
and I'm a kiwi, that's the nationality

15
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:34,565
not the fruit or the bird.

16
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:44,617
You can reach me at that email address or on Twitter or I like playing games so please feel free to add me on any of these services. I kind of hop around between them.

17
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:55,340
Okay, so that out of the way, who's ever said or heard someone say that a game mechanic gives a player a shot of dopamine? Hands up. Okay, a lot of people.

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,222
So what does this mean? I want to talk about that very quickly.

19
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,942
Dopamine is a compound.

20
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,987
It's found in various parts of the body.

21
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:07,028
It's a precursor to adrenaline, for example,

22
00:01:07,028 --> 00:01:09,750
so anywhere that adrenaline is produced, there's dopamine.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,411
But most people, when they're saying a shot of dopamine,

24
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:15,593
are talking about its use as a neurotransmitter in the brain,

25
00:01:15,593 --> 00:01:17,374
where you will find it.

26
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:22,879
And I think what a lot of people talk about when they're saying gives you a shot of dopamine,

27
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,020
they're talking about pleasure, a good feeling is what's occurring right now.

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:33,182
And based on the science, this is an idea that's about 30 years or so old.

29
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:37,203
And it was based on an idea that, of course, if animals are going to work for a reward,

30
00:01:37,203 --> 00:01:41,385
it must feel good, because none of us work for things that feel bad, right?

31
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:44,326
And that was kind of the idea when it came around.

32
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:49,139
And certainly if we look at dopamine and its impact on animals,

33
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:52,842
if you genetically engineer mice to not produce dopamine,

34
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:54,363
you get a different type of behavior.

35
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:57,185
So the mouse that's running around, that's normal mousy behavior.

36
00:01:57,185 --> 00:02:01,427
The one that's just sitting there and letting the other one walk all over top of it

37
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:03,589
is dopamine deficient, not producing any dopamine.

38
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:06,531
And certainly these mice, they lack motivation

39
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:10,313
and they will eventually die unless you make sure that they eat enough.

40
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:11,314
So it certainly does something.

41
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:18,948
The idea that it's responsible for pleasure and for liking rewards has fallen away within

42
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:20,688
the scientific community.

43
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:22,249
And there's various reasons for that.

44
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:26,911
One is that with animals, they still show that they get pleasure that they like things.

45
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:32,253
If you give mice a choice between water or sugar water that don't produce dopamine, they'll

46
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:37,035
choose the sugary water, suggesting that they still get pleasure from things.

47
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:40,176
If you're not convinced by animal research and want people that can actually talk to

48
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:41,757
you and talk about the pleasure they're getting.

49
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:44,387
You can look at Alzheimer's patients.

50
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:47,829
Alzheimer's is defined by a drop of dopamine.

51
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,970
But these people still report pleasure.

52
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,211
They still report liking things.

53
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:53,272
That's my father, by the way.

54
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,393
He doesn't have Alzheimer's,

55
00:02:54,393 --> 00:02:55,933
but he looks like he's having fun.

56
00:02:55,933 --> 00:03:03,098
So the idea that dopamine has to do with getting pleasure

57
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:04,779
or a reward system and all this kind of stuff

58
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:06,499
has kind of fallen away,

59
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:07,840
and it fell away quite a while ago.

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,182
It's just the popular way that it's talked about has not.

61
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:15,400
And even the people that originally put forward the idea of dopamine being pleasure have said,

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,041
okay, it's not.

63
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:20,467
And what followed after that was some thinking that it's to do with learning.

64
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:24,612
And this was based on the idea that in the brain, just before a reward is delivered,

65
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,455
there's an increase in dopamine.

66
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:27,977
So you're anticipating something happening.

67
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:32,451
Now, this is interesting, but there's some problems in that dopamine deficient mice have

68
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:35,673
been able to learn where rewards are in a maze.

69
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:39,936
Rats that don't produce dopamine have been able to be operatively conditioned to learn

70
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:40,997
new things.

71
00:03:40,997 --> 00:03:45,801
So maybe it's got something to do with learning, but it obviously doesn't look like it's necessary.

72
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:50,044
So where most people talk about dopamine in the literature nowadays is around wanting.

73
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:52,376
or needing or compulsion.

74
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:56,918
The idea is that dopamine has something to do with

75
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:59,959
a real magnetic draw or need for something.

76
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,120
Often what's talked about is junkies,

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,061
particularly for drugs like meth,

78
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:10,742
once they take a lot of it, they stop getting pleasure from the drug,

79
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:12,923
but they feel very compelled to still get the drug,

80
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:14,523
even though it's an unpleasant experience.

81
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:17,864
And certainly this is reflected in change in the dopamine system.

82
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:25,605
So if you're saying your game gives people a shot of dopamine, you're not necessarily saying it's fun or anything worthwhile to them,

83
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:31,088
just that it's compelling them to play it, which may not be a nice thing to say.

84
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:35,029
And even if that was the case, it's really not that simple.

85
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:38,891
If our brains were simple enough for us to understand we would be so simple.

86
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:40,579
that we couldn't.

87
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,262
This is a nice quote.

88
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:45,785
It doesn't necessarily mean don't study the brain, of course.

89
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,686
Like, that's silly.

90
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,849
It's more like it's not that simple,

91
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:52,072
and we need to be careful of simple explanations,

92
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:53,914
like a shot of dopamine.

93
00:04:55,996 --> 00:05:00,339
These simple explanations are very appealing to a lot of people and there's been a rise

94
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,501
in neuro things in the recent years.

95
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:07,105
Neuro training, neuro food, neuro exercise, all these things are real things and there's

96
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:08,005
a lot more of them.

97
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:09,947
You can pay money and have people do these things.

98
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:16,812
And the reaction in the neuroscience community as a large has been to declare these neuro

99
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:17,453
trash.

100
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:23,838
To say, the brain is more complicated than this and all this stuff is preying on cognitive

101
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:25,639
biases and preying on people with money.

102
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:32,096
And I want to ask us here at GDC is why do we care about this?

103
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:34,398
Why do I hear people talking about neuroscience here?

104
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:36,920
Well, first of all, science.

105
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,241
Science is cool.

106
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:38,842
I like science.

107
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:39,943
I have a PhD.

108
00:05:39,943 --> 00:05:41,164
I think data's really cool.

109
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:42,665
I think science is amazing.

110
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:45,788
And I think, look, you can put a piece of broccoli in an

111
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:49,491
fMRI machine, and it looks fucking awesome.

112
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:49,931
So it's cool.

113
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:50,592
Science is cool.

114
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,176
But if we look at a statement like this,

115
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:56,118
rewards delivered on a variable schedule strongly motivated players

116
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:58,281
due to activating a complex web of neurons

117
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:00,683
resulting in various neurotransmitters being released.

118
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:00,923
Okay.

119
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:04,147
But this is what we care about, right?

120
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:07,810
If we're making games, we care that what we can do,

121
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,912
rewards delivered on a variable schedule,

122
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,835
and what the behavioral outcome is, strongly motivated players.

123
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:17,069
So I really want to say, let's throw away the dopamine shots.

124
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:18,950
Let's not really care about neuroscience.

125
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,113
Not because it's not important, but because what neuroscience is doing

126
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:25,596
is it's explaining already known principles.

127
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:29,278
Neuroscientists want to know the physiology behind these principles

128
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:30,419
that already exist.

129
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,122
They're often not finding new things other than the physiological pathways,

130
00:06:34,122 --> 00:06:34,863
which are interesting,

131
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:37,005
but from a practical standpoint, it's not that useful.

132
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:38,065
So let's get rid of those.

133
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,007
You're welcome.

134
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:40,387
Thank you.

135
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:40,848
You're welcome.

136
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:42,349
Thank you.

137
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:48,461
If you do want to hear me talk about ways you can measure physiology and stuff like

138
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:52,266
that, look at my Twitter handle, I gave a talk about it a couple of years ago at another

139
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:52,446
GDC.

140
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:57,172
But I'm not going to talk about biometrics anymore, I'm going to talk about rewards and

141
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:59,976
motivation and what we already know.

142
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:01,598
So I'm going to start off.

143
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:05,040
by talking about intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.

144
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,422
And this is not because I feel that these theories require

145
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:13,465
particularly important attention paid to them,

146
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:16,306
rather that I know that they're very popular in games right now.

147
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:19,388
Who's heard of intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation?

148
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:21,370
Okay, nearly everybody.

149
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,192
Right, so this idea is a popular theory in games at the moment,

150
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:28,214
and it's the idea that intrinsic motivation is personal gratification,

151
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,615
intrinsic motivation is to get something from the environment.

152
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:38,113
Now this is just one model, one theory, and to give you an idea, this was my wall during my PhD.

153
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:43,137
My PhD was on just one area of human behavior which was driving behavior,

154
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:47,020
and this was a snapshot in time of every single model or theory I could

155
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,742
find that had been made to explain driver behavior.

156
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,209
And there was ones I didn't have up on this wall.

157
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,089
There was a lot of them.

158
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,530
And there are a lot of them.

159
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,952
And that doesn't mean that they're all worthless or we shouldn't think about them.

160
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:05,015
But as applied psychologists, which is myself, and working in an applied area like game design,

161
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:08,917
what we can do, and the advantage of this, is we can look at all these models

162
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,798
and we can find the commonalities between them.

163
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:15,281
Because if lots of models are agreeing on certain things,

164
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:16,341
then that's important.

165
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,239
So here's where the models currently agree and it's what I'm going to go over.

166
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,022
You don't need to read it all right now, I'm just letting you know I'm going to step through

167
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:23,423
these as we go.

168
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:31,171
And these may sound like the things that fit your model of choice that you may think about

169
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:35,035
and that's because these models are often explaining the same thing.

170
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:43,164
like the brain not being so simple, human behavior is not so simple. So try to not be dogmatic about what you're talking about.

171
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:50,346
So the first is feedback is important. And I want to start with this because feedback is vitally important for rewards.

172
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:53,548
If you take nothing away from this talk, please have it be that.

173
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:57,549
If players don't know they got a reward, they can't get it again.

174
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:02,851
If players don't know why they got a reward, they can't do it again.

175
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:06,078
And if players don't know the value of a reward,

176
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,599
then they may not care about it.

177
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,159
You can give them all the stuff in the world,

178
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,860
and they're like, eh.

179
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:10,960
So,

180
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,501
rewards are feedback, fundamentally,

181
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:20,242
and a lot of feedback can be reward.

182
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:22,062
And usability and clarity of feedback

183
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,043
is a core component of what we do in user experience work,

184
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:27,824
which is why I'm here at a UX summit talking about it,

185
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:31,485
because UX is fundamentally about reward in a lot of ways.

186
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:35,505
You're a wonderful audience, by the way.

187
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:36,586
I really mean it.

188
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:37,967
Paying attention, especially you.

189
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:38,788
All right.

190
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:43,172
So if we're going to go back to kind of basics,

191
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:45,554
we can talk about some learning principles.

192
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:47,455
We can talk about classical conditioning,

193
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:51,238
which is linking old responses to new or responding for a reward.

194
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:53,000
So as an example of this,

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,643
seeing this image is probably quite rewarding for a lot of people

196
00:09:56,643 --> 00:10:00,106
because of the activity that's often associated with it.

197
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:03,108
Hearing the sound, also probably quite rewarding.

198
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,806
And that's because they're often linked together.

199
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:07,546
And let's stop that.

200
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:12,071
They're linked together and linked together in a performative way when playing the game

201
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:15,475
and it gives you progress. So they've been associated, they've become a reward.

202
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:20,159
Maybe a more practical example of this is in a lot of games

203
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,483
currencies that are used are gold and gems and...

204
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:28,818
dollar amounts and things like that. And that's because we already have an association with these

205
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:35,341
as having value. And by using them in a game you don't have to re-establish the value of the reward.

206
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:40,484
You can use a completely made up space thing as your currency, but you're going to have to

207
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:44,946
teach players the value of it. By using an established one it lets players immediately

208
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:48,028
know this is something valuable. And that's why it's so commonly done.

209
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:53,502
Another example of classical conditioning is if you look at the idle games,

210
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:57,945
often you get those going and then they kind of run by themselves.

211
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:01,528
And because we're so used to association, numbers going up,

212
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,310
and feedback like this with progress,

213
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,172
it feels like we're doing something even though that we're not really.

214
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:08,413
We're just watching a gameplay itself.

215
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:13,597
So another learning principle we can talk about is operant conditioning.

216
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:18,860
It's rather than responding to a reward, it's responding for a reward.

217
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,405
You're doing something to get a reward.

218
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:26,681
So when we talk about operating conditioning, we can go through schedules.

219
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:29,743
I don't want to spend too much time on this, but it is important.

220
00:11:29,743 --> 00:11:34,006
Fixed ratio is when you have to do a certain number of responses to get the reward.

221
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:39,811
So turns in a unit, until a unit or building is ready in a turn-based game would be a classic example of this.

222
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,613
You just have to wait and hit that next turn button.

223
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:45,895
Or clicks in a clicker that doesn't have a critical hit system or anything like that.

224
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:48,998
You have to click a certain amount of time, then you get enough gold,

225
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:51,520
and then you can buy your reward and then click some more.

226
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:58,086
And the reason these are important is if you look at these graphs, you've got the number

227
00:11:58,086 --> 00:12:04,148
of responses up this side and then the time across there, and these are the responses

228
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:06,388
over time with each tick being a reward.

229
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:11,170
And what you typically see with a fixed ratio, and this is just one single fixed ratio,

230
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,492
running at a certain length, so maybe you have to press 20 times and then something happens each time,

231
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:21,394
is that what happens is you get pretty fast responding, then they get the reward and they

232
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:25,396
stop for a little bit and then they go up. And it's because once you've got the reward you've

233
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:29,998
got that whole process ahead of you again before you can get to the next one. So it's kind of like a rest.

234
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:36,944
And the way that these turn-based games work to stop that rest is you always have multiple things going at once, right?

235
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:42,789
So your building's done, but you've got three other buildings on the way, so you just take one more turn, you get a lot of things going.

236
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:47,173
Fixed interval, appointment gaming type stuff.

237
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:51,957
This is an example from Paragon of our jungle minions spawning at set times,

238
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:56,141
so the players know, be there at this time, kill the minions, get the reward.

239
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:01,819
The response that this kind of interval of reward produces is like this.

240
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:06,581
You show up at a set time, respond, and then you go away until that set time.

241
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:10,783
It's used a lot in mobile games for timers and daily login bonuses,

242
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,044
which is effectively trying to pace out people using the game

243
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,885
and have them coming back at certain times.

244
00:13:18,135 --> 00:13:21,156
Variable ratio is probably the most famous of these.

245
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,437
It's used a lot in gambling.

246
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:25,139
It leads to reward chasing behavior.

247
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,101
And it is where there's a variable number of responses

248
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,862
until the reward shows up.

249
00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:30,822
So it's not 10.

250
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:34,925
It might be 10 to 50, something within that range.

251
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:38,126
And loot drops, like the loot crate system in Paragon,

252
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,327
are example of this.

253
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:40,928
And critical hits are an example of this,

254
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:43,730
where you hit a certain amount of times and will do damage.

255
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,692
And the response rate that that tends to get

256
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:48,933
is high and relatively steady.

257
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:53,675
The reason it's steady is because it's unsure

258
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:55,656
when the next critical hits, they will come along.

259
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:58,598
You want to keep on trying to maximize those critical hits.

260
00:13:58,598 --> 00:14:00,659
There's no like, I've already got it,

261
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,640
and I know I have to work harder

262
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,101
until the next one comes at a certain set point.

263
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:09,724
The last is variable interval, or event-seeking behavior.

264
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,606
An example of this I found is from Destiny

265
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:14,307
with their public events.

266
00:14:15,469 --> 00:14:20,432
happen at certain times but around that certain time and may not happen every time.

267
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:25,335
And it generally encourages people to move into an area and hang around because they don't know

268
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:31,799
exactly when it's going to happen. And this kind of random world event is a little bit more if you

269
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:37,583
want to drive people to a zone and then have them wait around for things. It gets a pretty good rate

270
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:41,625
of responding because you're not sure when when the event's going to occur and people will stick around.

271
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:46,956
Now of course this is just a diagram I've copied off data from textbooks.

272
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:51,238
And in a real game, in a lot of cases, you'll be mixing all these schedules together.

273
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,299
They'll be running over top of each other.

274
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:56,620
But it's kind of interesting to pull them out one by one like this

275
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,861
and look at their kind of fundamental characteristics.

276
00:14:58,861 --> 00:15:00,842
So moving on from those.

277
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:03,979
We want to talk about reward timing and uncertainty.

278
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:09,165
Ideally, rewards should come immediately for success mechanisms,

279
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:11,067
progress mechanisms, and choice mechanisms.

280
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:14,650
If I make a choice, if I'm succeeding or I'm progressing in your game,

281
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,854
I should know about it straight away, and I should be rewarded straight away.

282
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:23,280
Now this doesn't necessarily mean we can't have long-term rewards that we're aiming for,

283
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,063
but people are generally not great at long-term rewards.

284
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:29,326
There's the famous marshmallow test where you give a kid a marshmallow

285
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:33,490
and say if you wait, I'll come back in a few minutes, you can have two marshmallows,

286
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,094
and you leave the room and the kid just shoves the marshmallow in their face.

287
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:42,299
And as adults we like to go, ha, children, but actually we're all pretty bad at that.

288
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:46,169
So if you want people to work to a long-term goal, they need to know there's a long-term

289
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:49,831
goal and you give short little feedback bursts on the way there.

290
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:52,953
Progression bars or experience bars are a classic example of this.

291
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,535
They're little bursts of feedback, little bursts of reward to let you know you're making

292
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:57,675
progress towards a big thing.

293
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:05,140
Now, I've been talking a lot about, I've just talked about things being immediate rewards.

294
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,842
Of course you can also have unexpected rewards.

295
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,304
And unexpected rewards can be very strongly motivating.

296
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:15,687
So an example of that would be in a game like Portal 2, you unexpectedly work out a way

297
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:16,928
to solve the solution.

298
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:22,132
It feels very satisfying, it's not something you necessarily saw coming, and it can feel

299
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:22,632
good, right?

300
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:23,393
Surprise puppy.

301
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:34,552
But the problem with unexpected rewards is if I, in six slides time, showed this puppy again,

302
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:36,374
it probably would have less impact.

303
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:39,177
And if I kept doing it, it would have even less impact.

304
00:16:39,177 --> 00:16:43,842
And even if I mixed up different puppies, you might start to expect the unexpected.

305
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:48,788
So, unexpected rewards can be really valuable, but they're hard to pull off, and they're hard to pull off repeatedly.

306
00:16:50,753 --> 00:16:55,239
The next thing I want to talk about with feedback is game feel, the way it feels to play your game.

307
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,842
And I want to argue to go back to this idea of intrinsic motivation,

308
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:00,084
that this is the ultimate in intrinsic motivation.

309
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:04,905
A lot of companies when they talk about intrinsic motivation will talk about a lot of goal structures

310
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:07,026
and adding a bunch of stuff on top of the game.

311
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,887
And that can work.

312
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:13,169
But if you look at the games that are commonly cited, games like Destiny as having great

313
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:17,392
intrinsic motivation, they're games that just feel satisfying to play.

314
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:22,094
That the action of just moving a controller or a mouse feels impactful and immersive.

315
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:27,957
So there's an example of this from Gears of War and it's the active reload mechanic, where

316
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:30,058
it takes the simple action of just pressing a button.

317
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:32,922
to reload and makes it into a mini game.

318
00:17:32,922 --> 00:17:40,388
You've got a nice little bit of feedback there, a chance to succeed more or to fail.

319
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:43,930
Of course, rhythm games like Thumper

320
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,993
heavily rely on having a good game feel in order to succeed because all you're

321
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:50,675
doing in these games is pressing left, right, up, down

322
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:52,516
and buttons and rhythm.

323
00:17:53,572 --> 00:18:06,289
It's not that complicated a thing to be doing, really, but by using the rhythmic design and the sounds and the ramping up the difficulty, they can create a very compelling game feel.

324
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:10,574
It feels satisfying, it feels like it builds, it feels like you're doing an important thing.

325
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:18,728
I already mentioned Destiny, but Destiny, the developers at Bungie, worked very hard

326
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:23,073
on making the animations and everything like that feel just really satisfying to reach

327
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:27,539
out and every action in the game makes it feel like it has impact, even though, say

328
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,143
this melee attack, all you're really doing is pressing a bumper on a controller, but

329
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,766
it feels like you're really reaching out there and hitting your enemies.

330
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:39,400
And even a simple screen shake, even though it may not be to everyone's taste,

331
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,522
makes this space marine in Space Marine feel like he has weight,

332
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,884
even though all that's happening is pushing forward on a stick.

333
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:48,685
Feels like he's physically in the world.

334
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:52,447
This is something we've done in Paragon with several of our heroes,

335
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:54,648
and I want to just give a brief example of that.

336
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:22,187
Okay, of course it's exaggerated for the trailer, but Steel's this big android and you can feel

337
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:27,108
the weight to his moves, the weight to simply moving with him and simply pressing the button

338
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:31,969
makes it feel satisfying to play even outside of the other structures of the game.

339
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,870
It's six slides by the way.

340
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,351
Alright, moving on. The next thing is progression.

341
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:42,233
Progression towards clear goals. This is kind of pretty easy stuff.

342
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,613
Progression towards clear goals, whether those are internally set

343
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:49,395
or externally set by the game, is rewarding and, of course, relies on feedback.

344
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:53,316
I already mentioned having to give progression feedback for long-term goals.

345
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:58,801
And typical examples of this would be, this is from Paragon, we have a bunch of things,

346
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:04,384
weekly quests, your progression in game as you level up and get new abilities in Almoba,

347
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:09,267
daily victory chests, living up your account progress, all of this is progression and to

348
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:13,370
show to players that things are happening and that their actions are being rewarded.

349
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,642
Progression is also commonly used in tutorials, or at least tutorials that do

350
00:20:18,642 --> 00:20:19,862
things well.

351
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:22,443
This is the tutorial from Unreal Tournament.

352
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:25,604
It's clearly telling the player what to do, to jump.

353
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:29,166
It's showing a modeling character doing that action,

354
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:33,587
and the player cannot progress out of that room without doing the action.

355
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:35,448
They can't leave without jumping over that barrier.

356
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:39,169
And once they do, they have immediate feedback that it was successful because

357
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:39,870
they're out of the area.

358
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:44,765
The interesting thing about the UT tutorial, which I think is a nice element to it, is

359
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,806
it has optional skill tokens in it.

360
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:53,127
Optional skill tokens are, as the game teaches you, there'll be skill tokens hidden around

361
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,107
the tutorial that kind of build on what you've already learnt.

362
00:20:56,107 --> 00:21:00,708
So if you've learnt jumping and wall running, maybe in the next room, off in the corner

363
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:05,009
it's not required for you to do, there's a token spinning up there that requires you

364
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,310
to jump and wall run to get it.

365
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:11,801
You don't have to do it, but it's a way for you to put together what you've previously learned and show your progression.

366
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:18,628
So this will be an example. This is probably the hardest one in the tutorial. It's pretty difficult to get.

367
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:22,751
You can't jump over there, so you need to scoop around,

368
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:26,455
like slide up a wall, jump around and then slide out to get it.

369
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:32,340
It's pretty difficult, but it's a nice way to show players progress that doesn't also make them feel forced.

370
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,886
Progression can also be shown by a social comparison.

371
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:40,868
This is the post game screen that was added to Dota 2

372
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:44,390
a while ago, where it shows, after the game is over,

373
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,771
the progression of each player during the match.

374
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:49,733
And it lets the players look and rank themselves

375
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:52,694
within this information and know how well they did

376
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:55,336
at certain times over the match and hopefully learn from this

377
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:56,436
or be rewarded by it.

378
00:21:57,324 --> 00:22:01,207
Now, comparison, especially to other players, can open the path to abuse.

379
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:03,248
So often making it only available after a game,

380
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:06,511
where players cannot interact with each other is a good idea.

381
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:10,654
Hiding MMR is a good idea, so people don't attack each other for,

382
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:13,036
you're on my team and you've got 200 less MMR than me,

383
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:16,319
so I'm instantly going to think that you're worse off at playing the game,

384
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,621
because your matchmaking rank's lower.

385
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,762
And making stat tracking websites opt-in.

386
00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:23,084
So if you want to see how good I am at Dota

387
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:24,986
by looking on a stat tracking website,

388
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:26,627
you can't, because I haven't opted in.

389
00:22:29,107 --> 00:22:32,910
And what's actually been happening recently that's interesting in games is

390
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,453
the idea of comparison within yourself.

391
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:36,033
So in

392
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:40,858
Overwatch, for example, at the end of the match, they don't compare you against the

393
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:44,761
other players, they compare you against your own progression over the game.

394
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:48,065
So even if you've lost the game, maybe you've got better at something, maybe that

395
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:49,946
was your best ever game at healing.

396
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:53,689
or your third best ever game at healing or whatever it might be.

397
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:57,012
It's some kind of reward that lets you know that you're progressing yourself

398
00:22:57,012 --> 00:23:00,335
but is not potentially a negative comparison against other people.

399
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:05,100
And Dota's similarly got this thing that shows you your average for the hero over certain metrics.

400
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,844
Okay, so that's feedback. A lot of this other stuff is also feedback

401
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:13,568
but I'll talk about it in a different way.

402
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:15,049
Control and choice is important.

403
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:19,027
So what we're talking about here is feeling in control.

404
00:23:19,027 --> 00:23:25,231
We like to feel like we have choice and control and generally speaking we just like feeling limited,

405
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:26,952
controlled or out of control.

406
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:31,725
And there is a slight difference between feeling controlled and feeling out of control.

407
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:34,726
I hope that you can get, even though they're kind of the same thing.

408
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:39,448
There's an exception to this, and that's unless we choose to be controlled and limited.

409
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:44,170
If we choose to cut off paths for ourselves that are presented to us,

410
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,311
making interesting, meaningful choices within the game,

411
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:49,852
then that can make us feel in control as well.

412
00:23:49,852 --> 00:23:53,493
So the statement like, people don't like feel controlled,

413
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:56,495
doesn't necessarily mean they don't like feeling limited.

414
00:23:56,955 --> 00:24:00,636
They just like feeling like they have choice in those limitations.

415
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:03,336
So this is often talked about around story.

416
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:07,097
And there's different approaches that can be taken here.

417
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:08,817
You can go crazy like The Witcher 2,

418
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:13,198
where a whole act of content can be skipped based on a decision by a player.

419
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:17,900
They completely miss a massive chunk of hours and hours of content

420
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,940
based on a choice.

421
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,300
It makes choices feel very meaningful in the game.

422
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:25,130
You can also look at performative stories,

423
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,192
where there isn't actually much formal story,

424
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:30,276
and there's not much choice in a game like Journey,

425
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:32,198
except for the way that you play out the game

426
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:35,703
and the way that the story is created around your character.

427
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:38,546
And then you can look at maybe more traditional structures

428
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:40,969
of story games, like the original Walking Dead.

429
00:24:41,724 --> 00:24:45,769
where they very successfully created a feeling of choice that was

430
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:47,571
praised for its feeling of choice.

431
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,894
Even though if you go back and play through the game and make different

432
00:24:49,894 --> 00:24:52,497
decisions you'll find out that actually the choice

433
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:55,500
doesn't strongly matter to how the game plays out.

434
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,085
There'll be different people that fill in at different times for people you let die

435
00:25:00,085 --> 00:25:01,127
or whatever might happen.

436
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:06,191
but because it felt like you were making a decision at the time, it feels important.

437
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:10,234
And this can be contrasted against Mass Effect 3, which came out the same year, and used

438
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:15,758
a similar structure, but because players had expectations built up over two games beforehand,

439
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:20,502
and maybe they were more likely to play through more often, players would know, oh, it doesn't

440
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:25,306
really matter, this character shows up here anyway, and some players were disappointed

441
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:25,626
by that.

442
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:30,388
Now, that's not to say that this was fundamentally wrong, it's just I'm trying to make a point

443
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:36,230
about player expectation about control and how it can be good, but it can also backfire.

444
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,732
It also interacts with activities in progression.

445
00:25:40,732 --> 00:25:46,494
So what I'm talking about here is examples like side activities in open world games.

446
00:25:47,277 --> 00:25:52,479
If the side activities feel forced upon a player, or they feel like they have to do them in order to progress,

447
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:58,162
or they're being bugged to do a side activity, they may resist doing it. It may feel like control.

448
00:25:58,162 --> 00:26:03,424
Escort quests can also be very controlling, because they're essentially taking away success from the player

449
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:08,946
and putting it in the hands of the NPC they have to look after, that can get in trouble or die or break stealth.

450
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:14,627
Modern escort quest type games like Last of Us solve this by making the person you're

451
00:26:14,627 --> 00:26:19,928
escorting not do these behaviors, so they can't break your cover or they can't die.

452
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:24,289
This of course is a trade-off for immersion, but it's a worthwhile one for the player not

453
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,429
feeling controlled and frustrated.

454
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:28,470
And then the other one is of course grind.

455
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,670
If players don't feel like the activities they're doing in a game have meaning, are

456
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,211
showing progression, and are meaningful to them.

457
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:42,919
then they're more likely to view having to make a lot of daggers to level up in Skyrim

458
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:44,440
as a grinding activity.

459
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:51,772
And in fact, this idea about control being so important has come up in the recent literature

460
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:58,577
as a suggestion to replace intrinsic versus extrinsic and to talk about instead autonomous

461
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:00,638
or controlled behavior.

462
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:06,962
And internally motivated behavior, if you feel obligated to yourself, can feel controlling

463
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:08,563
and be demotivating.

464
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:14,567
Just like external behavior can feel autonomous if there's a lot of choices set up for you.

465
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:19,531
So this idea of control seems to be a core point where a lot of theories are agreeing.

466
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:24,901
And I've been saying it's perception of control that matters, and that is the important point.

467
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:28,347
You can give players an illusion of control and get just as much...

468
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:31,124
Impact is real control.

469
00:27:31,124 --> 00:27:34,666
So games like P.E.G.O. where you fire into a random zone, but because you pick where

470
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:38,947
you fire and you have a special skill, can feel like you're more skilled than the game

471
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:40,868
is actually working on.

472
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,009
And of course match three games can be masters of this.

473
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:47,591
You have no control over what's about to fall on the screen at all as a player, but because

474
00:27:47,591 --> 00:27:52,613
of the way that the feedback is presented to you, it feels like you made a really weighty

475
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:56,015
important decision, even though you just like matched one line.

476
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,853
The last, well, one of the last things about control is this interesting idea of counter-control

477
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:05,494
that came out of behaviorism, it's been around for a while.

478
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:09,616
And it's typically the idea that when people feel controlled, we often counter to this.

479
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:12,397
And this is often talked about in a negative way.

480
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:15,979
If people feel controlled in your game, they feel like it's grindy, they'll stop playing it.

481
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:18,100
That's how they break the control of your game.

482
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,761
They're like, no, stop, I'm out.

483
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:25,566
However, it can actually be used as a game mechanic because it feels very rewarding to break control.

484
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:28,129
So a classic example of this would be the Stanley Parable,

485
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:34,115
which is a game all about a narrator trying to control you and your attempts to break that control.

486
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:38,139
And it feels very satisfying to do so, even though you ultimately fail.

487
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:41,523
So the last thing...

488
00:28:43,343 --> 00:28:45,525
is control and tutorials.

489
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:48,246
Now, when a lot of people hear this stuff about control

490
00:28:48,246 --> 00:28:51,207
and feeling controlled is negative,

491
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,148
they'll say, okay, we're not gonna put tutorials in

492
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,529
or we're gonna do tutorials

493
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:56,690
that have no controlling elements and no guidance in them

494
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,451
because it's better for people to learn things.

495
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:02,393
Now, that can work out, but the problem is

496
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:05,894
it's feeling in control and not feeling out of control.

497
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:11,959
Really, big ways to feel out of control is to feel confused and unclear and not know

498
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,203
what the hell is going on.

499
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:18,370
And so having a little bit of handholding, a little bit of guidance in tutorials,

500
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,473
if it lets your players get to the point where they can feel in control,

501
00:29:22,473 --> 00:29:24,955
like you're telling them what to do and then suddenly they have control

502
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:27,437
and they can show that control, it can be worth it.

503
00:29:27,437 --> 00:29:31,440
So this idea of control doesn't necessarily mean don't make tutorials.

504
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,863
And of course, that's one of the nice things about the optional skill tokens

505
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:37,845
in Unreal Tournament, is that there are optional things players can do

506
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:41,128
to show that they've mastered the mechanics that you're teaching them.

507
00:29:43,402 --> 00:29:48,204
Okay, last thing in control is non-contingent rewards.

508
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:50,305
These might be known as participation awards.

509
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:54,467
Who thinks participation awards are a dumb idea?

510
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:55,948
Not as many people as usual.

511
00:29:55,948 --> 00:30:01,250
Participation awards kind of came out of SDT and the intrinsic model theory.

512
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:07,171
and there's a reason for that and it's that participation awards which are

513
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:11,074
awards you get for just showing up are less likely to be seen as controlling

514
00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:15,077
which we've said is not good and more likely to be unexpected right because

515
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:17,119
you don't have to do anything to get them they're not based on your

516
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,961
performance of course because they're not based on your performance they're

517
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:23,324
not really giving you feedback on anything however there are multiple

518
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:27,427
occasions that they're used in video games so probably the one that the

519
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:30,249
people have the most negative association with its rubber banding

520
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:37,892
This was where mechanics in the game like in Mario Kart will help losers equalize with winners.

521
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:41,718
And it's good for casual games because nobody wants to just be beaten over and over again

522
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:44,001
if they're supposed to be just having fun with their kids or family.

523
00:30:45,316 --> 00:30:47,998
Another example from more hardcore games is gold drips in MOBAs.

524
00:30:47,998 --> 00:30:52,963
As long as you're playing a game of a MOBA, there's just some constant resource coming

525
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:57,206
to you, no matter how well you're doing, that might let you buy that one item you needed

526
00:30:57,206 --> 00:31:01,730
to win the team fight and come back in a situation you were otherwise losing.

527
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,413
A similar example in Titanfall 2 is the Titan drop.

528
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,184
progression which like a gold drop in a MOBA was just constantly coming in in Titanfall 2.

529
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:15,327
So even if you're getting beaten and not performing very well,

530
00:31:15,327 --> 00:31:18,710
you probably still got to use your Titan and experience that part of the game

531
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,153
and get that reward during a match.

532
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:26,758
So that's what these non-contingent rewards can be quite useful for is this kind of balance

533
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:31,282
and making sure people experience more of your game.

534
00:31:31,282 --> 00:31:32,823
You're a really wonderful audience by the way.

535
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:39,562
Okay, so I'm not going to do a bunch of slides about this one, in fact this is the ODee slide,

536
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:43,125
but not getting a reward you expect can make a reward a penalty.

537
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:47,088
So this is the idea that if you build something up as really big and important,

538
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:52,633
like players go around and they pick up every single consumable and collectible in your entire game

539
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,715
and they get nothing for it,

540
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:59,679
this can feel like a bad thing if they were expecting something to come out at the end.

541
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:06,504
The next is that task inherent rewards motivate more than task relevant.

542
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:09,325
Or to put that more simply and basically,

543
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:13,106
rewards that are meaningful to a player are more motivating.

544
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:19,487
A classic example of this would be the agility orbs from the Xbox game Crackdown.

545
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:23,528
These orbs, you had to show agility in order to get them.

546
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:27,009
You had to climb up buildings, jump, and generally show that...

547
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,892
you had agility and power in your character, but by collecting them

548
00:32:30,892 --> 00:32:35,074
you also increased your agility. So they had meaning in two ways to players.

549
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:38,416
You showed competence in this to get them and then you're awarded by

550
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:42,358
being able to do more of this, you got the progression of being able to do that.

551
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:48,661
And one way you can do this in games is to personalize if you can, if you have

552
00:32:48,661 --> 00:32:52,263
data on what people are already doing in your game you can reward them in ways

553
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,143
that you know

554
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:55,824
will be rewarding to them because it's the type of thing they're already

555
00:32:55,824 --> 00:32:56,525
interested in.

556
00:32:57,454 --> 00:33:01,437
but you don't have to go that far. All you really have to do is show value.

557
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:05,700
And when I was working as a consultant, this was often a problem we would see

558
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,443
in mobile games that would come to us, is in the tutorials

559
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:11,685
they would throw all their awards at the players. They would say,

560
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:15,008
here's premium currency, here's this, skip this timer, all these things.

561
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,831
And it was like, here's all the things, but we're not telling you why or what

562
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,993
the meaning or what the value is. We're going to get you to skip a 30-second

563
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:21,374
tutorial.

564
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:24,715
Like, why is that important to somebody?

565
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:26,856
And it doesn't, it hurts people's learning

566
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:28,817
and it hurts the evaluation of the reward

567
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:30,758
if the reward is not meaningful.

568
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:35,700
Okay, interacting with others positively is motivating.

569
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,941
And when I say positively, it's positive

570
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:39,902
for at least one person in the equation.

571
00:33:39,902 --> 00:33:41,863
So if I beat someone at a game,

572
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:44,744
it may not be positive for them, but it's positive for me.

573
00:33:44,744 --> 00:33:48,326
So, when you're interacting with others,

574
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,846
you can do performance comparison.

575
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:53,097
you can compare your performance against other people.

576
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,297
And this is potentially rewarding if it's in our favor.

577
00:33:55,297 --> 00:33:58,958
It's also potentially motivating if it shows progress

578
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:01,038
or changes expectations positively.

579
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,139
So even if it's not in our favor, but it shows we made progress

580
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:06,779
or it changes our expectations,

581
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,220
like we did better than we thought we would, that can be good.

582
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,741
But of course, it can be demotivating if it's against us

583
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:14,661
or if it changes our expectations negatively.

584
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,681
And I'm going to give you an example of this.

585
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,642
It's not necessarily a reward example.

586
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:25,390
But in Dota, they have these conduct summaries.

587
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,292
They'll show you about your behavior in terms of how you've been reported by other players.

588
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:32,514
This is a report of a negative player.

589
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:37,897
They've got six reports and they're being told that 94% of the population, their report

590
00:34:37,897 --> 00:34:39,958
rate is higher than 94% of the population.

591
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:45,541
So the idea is you're supposed to go, oh no, I must be a really bad person and it's not

592
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,642
normal to do this and I'm supposed to change my behavior.

593
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:57,751
Now this is a conduct summary of a nice person, it's me, who's got less than three reports

594
00:34:57,751 --> 00:34:59,533
when this popped up.

595
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:04,877
And they're being told that only 77% of players have three reports.

596
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:07,238
Well, 77% of players have less than three reports.

597
00:35:07,864 --> 00:35:10,446
But you might view that as, okay, that's good.

598
00:35:10,446 --> 00:35:13,048
But it could also be telling you that over 20% of people

599
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:14,829
have more than three reports.

600
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:17,552
Maybe I don't need to be so nice.

601
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:19,634
And certainly in research where they've shown people

602
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:22,136
in neighborhoods energy use, where you get to see,

603
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:24,238
hey, your neighbor's using more energy than you are,

604
00:35:24,238 --> 00:35:26,439
but congratulations, you don't use much energy.

605
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:28,982
The people that are being told they don't use much

606
00:35:28,982 --> 00:35:30,623
start using more, because they're like,

607
00:35:30,623 --> 00:35:31,764
well, everyone else is doing it.

608
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:34,687
So you gotta be careful when presenting this information.

609
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:40,165
Now competition is a social interaction that comes naturally to game designers, I think.

610
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:43,371
Quite often we think about it nearly straight away.

611
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:46,217
And it's a strongly motivating force, especially if you think you can win.

612
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:52,733
And it does have a potentially slight demotivational effect immediately after winning.

613
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:56,955
And that's often because competitions are often in a fixed ratio or fixed interval.

614
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:59,697
They only run at set times or only for a set period.

615
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:05,159
And so after you've won, often people kind of take a breath and then start competing again.

616
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:10,742
It's just something to be aware of to keep people motivated between events of winning.

617
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:16,474
Of course, the downside of competition is it can demotivate those who think they can't win

618
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,076
or know they can't win.

619
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:22,921
So in a mobile game, if you load in and it tells you you're 31st thousandth in the world

620
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:26,726
at this game when you first started playing it, that might be really demotivating to you.

621
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,491
Unless of course you make a lot of progression quickly.

622
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:33,814
So one way to get around that is to put people in local leagues where they can actually see

623
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:34,675
progression.

624
00:36:34,675 --> 00:36:40,098
It's also, I'm being hard on competition here maybe, and it's because I think as game developers

625
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:44,321
we often don't think about the losers in our games and how we can make losing a pleasant

626
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:44,941
experience.

627
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:51,025
An experience that we can let people learn from and come back from and feel like they

628
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:55,248
can stay engaged with our game and don't just go, well this is over, I'm going to stop playing.

629
00:36:56,775 --> 00:37:02,696
Cooperation, on the other hand, compared to competition, is a very powerfully motivating

630
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:03,916
factor for a lot of people.

631
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:07,017
And that's because it allows everyone to contribute to it.

632
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:12,158
Nearly every top game you can think of nowadays has some kind of cooperation element in it.

633
00:37:12,158 --> 00:37:17,459
Cooperation, according to psychological research, motivates people a lot more than competition,

634
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:18,940
which has been shown to...

635
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,861
Competition has been shown to do things like suppress creativity, cause conflict, all these

636
00:37:23,861 --> 00:37:24,461
kind of things.

637
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:30,362
And it does allow for cooperative competition where guilds can compete against each other.

638
00:37:30,362 --> 00:37:32,485
And this gets you kind of the best of both worlds.

639
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:35,589
You've got the competition stuff but you've also got the cooperation between people.

640
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,264
It allows for repossessity, which I can never say, but it's basically the idea that people

641
00:37:41,264 --> 00:37:45,027
feel like, oh, someone's being nice to me, so I'll be nice to them.

642
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:49,631
A monetization example of this is in Game of War, Fire Age, which is anyone in your

643
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:53,033
guild spends in the game, it benefits everyone in the guild.

644
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:59,279
So this is a monetization application of it, in that by spending within this game, it benefits

645
00:37:59,279 --> 00:37:59,759
everybody.

646
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:04,166
and that's one of the things I want to talk about here with that's kind of the idea of

647
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:11,009
positive externalities which is a economics term that is by spending in an economy I don't

648
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:15,971
just benefit myself I benefit everyone else around me and this can be a very powerful

649
00:38:15,971 --> 00:38:21,113
motivating force because while it's not a selfish competitive force it says

650
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:25,819
By me contributing to this game, I'm part of something bigger.

651
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:28,522
I'm helping other people. I'm helping friends.

652
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:32,127
And also, if I've already spent as much as I want to help myself,

653
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:37,153
I can continue to spend to help other people and feel like a good person.

654
00:38:37,994 --> 00:38:41,057
There's an example of this in Paragon.

655
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:43,979
And this is our master challenge system,

656
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:45,941
where by buying into these master challenges,

657
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:48,643
you get an experience boost that goes up the more you play.

658
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:51,465
And the more people that have these experience boosts

659
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:52,747
on your side when you're playing,

660
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,049
the faster everyone's experience goes outside of the game.

661
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,410
So the idea is by purchasing this,

662
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,873
you're not just helping yourself, you're helping others.

663
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:05,217
All right, so last one on this big, long list.

664
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:09,798
And that's that rewards can, in certain situations, be demotivating.

665
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:12,278
I've already tried to call this out where it comes up,

666
00:39:12,278 --> 00:39:14,979
in terms of if they're felt to be too controlling

667
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,420
or they're against expectations, things like that.

668
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,141
Now, before I finish up,

669
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:22,741
I do want to just briefly talk about some cognitive biases,

670
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:27,643
and only a couple of them that I feel can be important

671
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:28,603
when it comes to reward.

672
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:32,024
One of them is the representativeness heuristic.

673
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:36,581
And this is the idea that the more time, cost, effort you put into an activity,

674
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:41,044
there's a basic expectation that you get more reward for it.

675
00:39:41,044 --> 00:39:46,067
So imagine you're a relatively tough fighter in an RPG game,

676
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:50,790
and you encounter an unconscious goblin,

677
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,972
and you knock it out and kill it.

678
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:56,273
You probably don't expect to get much reward from that.

679
00:39:56,273 --> 00:39:58,575
You haven't put much effort in, you haven't done very much.

680
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:04,498
But if you fight something like this, you probably expect to get a lot more from beating it.

681
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:12,463
And this is somewhat common sense, but it can be a problem for games that have a lot of randomness or procedural generation in them.

682
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:17,146
I've played quite a few roguelikes where I'll go through a room that was really, really difficult

683
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:20,848
because of the configuration of monsters in there or the way that it was laid out,

684
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:24,451
and then the room on the other side is just an empty hallway with nothing in it.

685
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:28,895
And that feels against expectations, against this heuristic, that if I've put effort in,

686
00:40:28,895 --> 00:40:31,477
I expect that effort to be rewarded.

687
00:40:31,477 --> 00:40:37,422
So this can be taken into account with the reward systems also being tied to the randomization

688
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,404
or the proceduralization that comes out at the end.

689
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:44,008
If it's over a certain amount of difficulty, then there should be more reward for doing it.

690
00:40:45,972 --> 00:40:48,153
This can also apply to monetization.

691
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:50,595
If people spend more in your game,

692
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:53,836
they of course expect to get more from it.

693
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:56,378
So you need to make sure your economy is balanced

694
00:40:56,378 --> 00:40:59,800
to support the people who spend more in your game,

695
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,061
or at least they feel like they're getting more value.

696
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:03,722
And in fact, some games...

697
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:07,024
So it's important to go back to this idea of feedback

698
00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:08,605
and making sure that everything's very clear

699
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:11,526
and the value of buying things is very clear

700
00:41:11,526 --> 00:41:13,727
and the value of the things you can purchase with money

701
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:14,368
is really clear.

702
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:17,191
even before you make the purchase.

703
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:20,835
But some games will also, once you make a certain level of purchase,

704
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:23,778
they'll, without telling you, modify the odds

705
00:41:23,778 --> 00:41:27,021
of certain good things happening for a little while afterwards.

706
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:31,005
So the game suddenly is more in your favor after you've spent

707
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:31,806
perhaps a dark pattern.

708
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:36,486
Another thing with this is after a string of bad luck,

709
00:41:36,486 --> 00:41:37,548
we expect the payout.

710
00:41:37,548 --> 00:41:39,571
This is what keeps people gambling.

711
00:41:39,571 --> 00:41:43,096
But it can be something that we can use in games

712
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:45,380
to reinforce this expectation and make people feel

713
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,463
like your game is fairer and more in line

714
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,204
with what they want.

715
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:52,849
So an example of this from Destiny would be the Vanguard bonus.

716
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:59,554
In Destiny when you run strikes you get loot, random loot based on how you play through

717
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:00,515
the strike, it just pops up.

718
00:42:00,515 --> 00:42:05,819
And the more strikes you run in a row, the higher your Vanguard bonus gets, which increases

719
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:10,123
your chance to get better stuff, which meets this expectation of the more effort I put

720
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:11,344
in, the more I get out.

721
00:42:12,648 --> 00:42:17,773
Another example of this is non-replacing randomness and variable loot rewards like a loot crate.

722
00:42:17,773 --> 00:42:23,397
Once you've got something out once, it's out, and that increases the odds of you getting things that you actually want out of it.

723
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:29,483
And that feels better to players. It's more in line with what they expect for their increased effort and increased spend.

724
00:42:29,483 --> 00:42:32,425
You also need to make sure you set expectations.

725
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,987
This is another Destiny example.

726
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:38,090
When Destiny launched, they had the Engram system.

727
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,732
The Engram system shows you...

728
00:42:41,902 --> 00:42:44,164
is kind of random loot you pick up in the world.

729
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:49,227
And when it launched, the color of the engram was the highest possible reward you could get out of the engram.

730
00:42:49,227 --> 00:42:53,530
Which set the expectation, if I see this, it's got to be an exotic, which is really cool.

731
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,793
But you could hand it in to the Cryptarch, and you'd get a common item out of it.

732
00:42:58,673 --> 00:43:03,459
And people didn't like that very much because it was against what they felt was being represented to them.

733
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:07,685
So in my understanding what Bungie did is they didn't change the drop tables,

734
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:10,568
they didn't change the loot or the underlying math of this.

735
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:14,834
All they did is color the engrams at the lowest possible thing you can get out.

736
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:19,875
So now you saw a blue ingram, you knew you were going to get at least a blue item out of it,

737
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:22,277
but maybe you got a surprise and got an exotic.

738
00:43:22,277 --> 00:43:28,921
So it's important to be aware of what expectations you're setting up for your players with the reward systems.

739
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:32,883
The final bias I want to talk about is the idea of loss aversion.

740
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:37,966
This is simply state that players will often work harder to keep something they have

741
00:43:37,966 --> 00:43:40,027
than to get something they could gain.

742
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:41,968
So maybe a complicated example of this could be...

743
00:43:42,942 --> 00:43:47,405
If you're designing a MOBA and you want people to attack towers,

744
00:43:47,405 --> 00:43:51,448
you want to encourage them to stop playing defensive and get out there and attack,

745
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:55,831
one thing you could consider doing is lowering the hit points of enemy towers,

746
00:43:55,831 --> 00:43:57,632
making them easier to take down and attack.

747
00:43:57,632 --> 00:43:59,713
You can achieve your attack more easily.

748
00:43:59,713 --> 00:44:00,554
And that might work.

749
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:06,338
Or, what might happen is people might work that out and they might start playing even

750
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:11,182
more defensive because people view that tower as something that they own and they control.

751
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:16,306
And even though now it's easier to go out and gain, it's also easier to lose and people

752
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:19,488
will often work harder to keep something they have.

753
00:44:19,488 --> 00:44:24,252
Other examples from games will be continuous login bonuses where if you don't login every

754
00:44:24,252 --> 00:44:26,233
day you lose progression.

755
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:27,214
Of course...

756
00:44:27,354 --> 00:44:32,177
That can be a very negative thing if you actually hit that not logging in on the day.

757
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:36,940
So sometimes you can buy that progression back or sometimes games don't use a continuous login bonus.

758
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,543
You just get an increasing bonus every time you open it rather than it being continuous.

759
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:46,186
Consumables and durability. People often hoard things like potions and consumables.

760
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:50,308
Because of this reason we don't like spending something that's going to go away.

761
00:44:50,308 --> 00:44:53,510
So you need to make sure that the base rate and the drop rate of these things

762
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,431
is good enough that maybe...

763
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:59,173
people will use it or you really demonstrate the value of doing so.

764
00:44:59,173 --> 00:45:02,734
And paying to continue is a classic example of this,

765
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:05,375
you're paying to keep the progression that you have.

766
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:09,317
Alright, so I just want to summarize the points I've gone over today.

767
00:45:09,317 --> 00:45:12,178
It's not everything about reward, but it's what I feel

768
00:45:12,178 --> 00:45:14,539
there's a lot of agreement in the literature.

769
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:19,241
First of all, what I talked about with dopamine at the start,

770
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:26,297
I really hope that you can be skeptical of any simple expectations, whether they be neuro

771
00:45:26,297 --> 00:45:27,318
or not.

772
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:28,820
Shots of dopamine are not needed.

773
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,823
There's practical answers out there if you look for them already.

774
00:45:31,823 --> 00:45:34,206
They don't have to be the newest and hottest things.

775
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,491
There's a whole load of research, and there's more that you can find.

776
00:45:39,491 --> 00:45:43,212
To go over what I've gone over today, reward is feedback.

777
00:45:43,212 --> 00:45:46,392
Please do provide feedback on rewards as close to the behaviors

778
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:48,773
you want to reward as possible.

779
00:45:48,773 --> 00:45:51,133
For long-term rewards, this can be progression towards them.

780
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:54,934
Mix certain guaranteed rewards with rewards that feel more random

781
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:59,215
and unexpected to get different types of behaviors,

782
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,796
to get different kinds of response rates.

783
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:04,437
Control and value. Help players feel in control.

784
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:08,008
This does not mean not guiding them or teaching them,

785
00:46:08,008 --> 00:46:10,549
but help them be able to access your game

786
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:15,271
and get at the rewards and not feel controlled by those rewards.

787
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:18,212
And show the value of the rewards and behavior,

788
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:20,112
which can often be a good way to reduce control.

789
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:22,833
When we talk about social rewards,

790
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:27,375
comparison, competition and cooperation can motivate,

791
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,575
but they do come with risks.

792
00:46:29,391 --> 00:46:33,892
Really, try and think about the players in your games that are losing out on your competitions,

793
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:39,353
or not coming in first place, or consistently not showing any performance increases.

794
00:46:39,353 --> 00:46:46,594
By giving these players some way to stay motivated, some way to still feel in control, to feel

795
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:51,255
like they can progress, you can keep them in your game and keep them retained.

796
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:57,016
Social pressure and cooperation to do things like give gifts to other players or work together,

797
00:46:57,016 --> 00:46:57,816
it can be good.

798
00:47:00,016 --> 00:47:03,058
If it's presented wrong, it can also feel like control,

799
00:47:03,058 --> 00:47:05,039
which may cause people to abandon it.

800
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,161
And you should set and meet player expectations.

801
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:11,603
Try and understand what these expectations that you're setting up

802
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:13,044
may be unintentionally,

803
00:47:13,044 --> 00:47:15,006
and at least meet them, if not exceed them.

804
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:19,288
And preventing loss can motivate more than working for gain.

805
00:47:19,288 --> 00:47:24,051
Okay, thank you very much, and any questions?

806
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:34,965
If you have questions, please come up to the mic.

807
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:39,307
And you can contact me at these addresses down here.

808
00:47:39,307 --> 00:47:41,088
Hi, thanks so much for the talk.

809
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:45,271
So in a lot of, especially casual and mobile games,

810
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:48,653
there seems to be an order of how these things are unrolled.

811
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:51,275
Like early on, there's more simple rewards

812
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:53,136
and like a variable schedule.

813
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,317
And then only later do you get things like social rewards.

814
00:47:55,317 --> 00:47:57,979
Is there actually like a hierarchy,

815
00:47:57,979 --> 00:47:59,360
or is that just kind of convention?

816
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,801
Do you think these kind of roll into each other?

817
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:06,941
I think there's a hierarchy in terms of the cost to the developers in some ways.

818
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:10,363
You don't want people getting into social too early in some cases because that might

819
00:48:10,363 --> 00:48:11,304
be more load for you.

820
00:48:11,304 --> 00:48:14,987
You want to make sure that they're engaged with your game first and a good way to that

821
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:19,150
is to show the value and roll out these more simple rewards early on and show them.

822
00:48:19,932 --> 00:48:23,313
kind of the fundamental nature of your game and why they might

823
00:48:23,313 --> 00:48:25,633
want to have this value of working with others, right?

824
00:48:25,633 --> 00:48:29,474
Rather than just forcing working with others on them before they understand

825
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:31,355
what the potential of doing that is.

826
00:48:31,355 --> 00:48:33,535
I think that could be what some developers are thinking.

827
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:38,717
There's not really a formal hierarchy to it, but I think it could be around this,

828
00:48:38,717 --> 00:48:42,638
you know, get people into the game, show them the value and make sure that they

829
00:48:43,178 --> 00:48:47,779
Engage with these later systems that might be a bit more

830
00:48:47,779 --> 00:48:52,941
Ask a bit more more of them in terms of how much they time they're giving up or how much if it they have to

831
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:53,381
put in

832
00:48:53,381 --> 00:49:00,443
Thank you, that was very interesting talk, thank you so many of the free-to-play games rely on

833
00:49:00,443 --> 00:49:03,524
Boosters and power-ups to win levels

834
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:10,406
I wonder if you have any insights on when using these boosters and power-ups you have less or more reward mm-hmm

835
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,286
so I think

836
00:49:12,505 --> 00:49:17,007
One interesting trend I've seen in free-to-play mobile games that use boosters and rewards,

837
00:49:17,007 --> 00:49:20,828
which are consumables, which people can be kind of averse to using,

838
00:49:20,828 --> 00:49:25,270
is to, instead of having them as things you collect and then they go away,

839
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:28,872
they have them, the last one of them goes on a timer.

840
00:49:28,872 --> 00:49:33,914
So it's not gone, you've used it, but it's going to come back in a certain amount of time.

841
00:49:33,914 --> 00:49:37,075
And by having it on a timer, which means it's not a permanent loss,

842
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:41,982
that can help people be more motivated to try them out, see the value of them

843
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:45,608
and keep using them a little bit more than perhaps they would.

844
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,214
But I've also, I've experienced doing UX tests on mobile games that people don't

845
00:49:49,214 --> 00:49:52,699
like consumables very much and this is one way to overcome it.

846
00:49:54,996 --> 00:50:00,342
Hi, as somebody else who plays Dota 2, I love Dota.

847
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:05,588
But for people my age, it's kind of this learning curve is so steep.

848
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:10,273
So like I was wondering, there aren't, the rewards for Dota are consistent.

849
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,415
So do you think for

850
00:50:11,915 --> 00:50:16,902
like new players if they offered, I don't know, more rewards or like different rewards,

851
00:50:16,902 --> 00:50:19,786
do you think that would help bring more players to Dota 2?

852
00:50:19,786 --> 00:50:24,953
So I think the thing with Dota and other MOBAs is the thing about, while they have this really

853
00:50:24,953 --> 00:50:27,817
complicated learning curve to become good at them.

854
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:33,032
They're actually not that complicated to throw yourself into and compared to an RTS where

855
00:50:33,032 --> 00:50:36,754
you had to control a lot of units and all this economy, all you're doing is controlling

856
00:50:36,754 --> 00:50:42,276
this one unit and clicking on things and you can kind of do that pretty fast and each game

857
00:50:42,276 --> 00:50:47,779
of a MOBA is this nice progression loop where it's an even playing ground and you're cooperating

858
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:51,700
with a bunch of people in a competition so it has a lot of these other elements and I

859
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,422
think those are what's the really rewarding things about MOBAs and have made them so...

860
00:50:56,523 --> 00:51:00,345
popular, even without the need for a bunch of external rewards or

861
00:51:00,345 --> 00:51:01,586
extra things on top of it.

862
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:03,747
You had a question. If you have a collectible game

863
00:51:03,747 --> 00:51:08,850
where people are opening booster packs to get rewarded a lot of times,

864
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:14,914
I've noticed that sometimes opening the 50th booster pack, it's not quite

865
00:51:14,914 --> 00:51:20,017
as fun as the first one. So a question for you would be, do you have any strategies

866
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:24,020
or recommendations for exploring rewarding players, whether in booster

867
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,281
packs or related to booster packs?

868
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:28,302
that can continue to be motivating even during deep monetization?

869
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:33,343
Right. So I would say the way to address that is to maybe talk to players

870
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,724
and work out why it's maybe not so motivating.

871
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:38,325
And it could be just there's no value in it anymore.

872
00:51:38,325 --> 00:51:43,326
Like I've got all the things I need or I've realized that the things I actually want

873
00:51:43,326 --> 00:51:47,367
have so little value or so little chance of coming out that it's not worth me trying.

874
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:50,728
And if those cases you maybe you can play with the underlying rates

875
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:53,769
once people open a certain amount then you make certain things more likely.

876
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:55,550
there's adding new content.

877
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,052
But ways to demonstrate that value to the players

878
00:51:59,052 --> 00:52:00,613
is important to keep them engaged, I feel.

879
00:52:00,613 --> 00:52:04,896
Awesome, thank you.

880
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:08,538
Hi. So using Overwatch as a case example,

881
00:52:08,538 --> 00:52:10,720
when it was in beta,

882
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,142
one of the complaints I heard from people I was playing with

883
00:52:14,142 --> 00:52:16,503
was that there was no metagame progression,

884
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:18,765
which is something they did add when the game launched.

885
00:52:18,765 --> 00:52:21,386
Do you think that's something that is necessary

886
00:52:21,386 --> 00:52:23,528
to keep people interested, or is that an easy way out?

887
00:52:24,472 --> 00:52:26,832
I don't know.

888
00:52:26,832 --> 00:52:33,094
Certainly progression is important and if people were feeling

889
00:52:33,094 --> 00:52:36,035
like there was no metagame progression and that's the feedback

890
00:52:36,035 --> 00:52:38,155
that was coming in and that's what they're getting,

891
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,616
then I would understand doing it.

892
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,137
It's not something you necessarily need

893
00:52:42,137 --> 00:52:46,398
if your core game is compelling enough, but it can certainly add on.

894
00:52:46,398 --> 00:52:48,978
But I'm not familiar enough with that case, unfortunately.

895
00:52:53,555 --> 00:52:57,562
Hi, yeah, when you talk about setting up player expectations

896
00:52:57,562 --> 00:53:00,066
and making sure that you're meeting them,

897
00:53:00,066 --> 00:53:03,392
what do you think is the right balance between having

898
00:53:03,392 --> 00:53:07,379
a cadence that's so expected that your player sort of maybe

899
00:53:07,379 --> 00:53:07,599
like?

900
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,421
save all their money to only purchase on sale days.

901
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,223
And now they're so trained that you can't really break them of it.

902
00:53:14,223 --> 00:53:18,005
So what do you think is the right balance of having those expectations, but

903
00:53:18,005 --> 00:53:23,728
still wanting them to have that intuitiveness about purchasing and using?

904
00:53:23,728 --> 00:53:27,630
And if you see them coming down this path that you don't really want them to be on

905
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:28,570
where they're so trained,

906
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:31,612
how do you break that without making them feel cheated?

907
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:31,772
Right.

908
00:53:32,957 --> 00:53:37,140
So that's going to be different on a case-by-case basis.

909
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,962
But generally speaking, you can try and cut off that

910
00:53:39,962 --> 00:53:43,285
by mixing different kind of schedules so it's not always...

911
00:53:43,285 --> 00:53:46,668
Like, what's important is that players' expectations are met

912
00:53:46,668 --> 00:53:48,849
and they feel like there are certain rewards coming,

913
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:52,012
but you can still use randomness or still use variable schedules

914
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:53,953
so they don't know exactly when it comes,

915
00:53:53,953 --> 00:53:56,455
so it's not completely predictable.

916
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,544
It's just be aware that if you have built an expectation and don't deliver on it, that can be a problem.

917
00:54:02,544 --> 00:54:08,090
But certainly what you're saying where because players have built such a strong habit,

918
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:12,354
maybe all the fun's gone out of it can certainly be a problem,

919
00:54:12,354 --> 00:54:15,518
and I would say just mix it up to get around that.

920
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:21,911
Do you know any examples of games that you see that's done this successfully?

921
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:27,953
In some of our games we have a daily log in reward and we might have changed that to be like a collect wheel.

922
00:54:27,953 --> 00:54:33,174
So the expected value is lower but maybe we think they won't notice that or something.

923
00:54:33,174 --> 00:54:37,975
But then the players who are the core players, they do notice based on the feel.

924
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:39,135
Do you have any stories of...

925
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:43,876
So I think that's an interesting trade-off because it's hard when you're designing a game

926
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:46,277
because you're designing for most players who will be satisfiers.

927
00:54:46,277 --> 00:54:50,358
They don't really understand the core base levels of all the probabilities.

928
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:52,079
They don't really care. They just want to play a game.

929
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,321
And that kind of thing will work for them, but your really hardcore players are optimizers.

930
00:54:56,321 --> 00:54:59,822
They look up the tables and they work out the odds and everything like that.

931
00:54:59,822 --> 00:55:06,504
And certainly the idea of adding a random reward as a daily is on a base level kind of a good one

932
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:09,665
because it's moving to this more variable schedule.

933
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:14,790
But I don't know off the top of my head an example of a game that's got over that.

934
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:18,411
I would just say,

935
00:55:18,411 --> 00:55:22,072
you need to think about when you are designing your rewards,

936
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,712
that somebody's gonna work out the base rates for it,

937
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:28,153
and how upset are you gonna be when they do that.

938
00:55:28,153 --> 00:55:31,534
Do you feel it will demotivate them if they know the base rates?

939
00:55:31,534 --> 00:55:33,254
And if the answer to that is yes,

940
00:55:33,254 --> 00:55:35,254
then maybe you need to reconsider your base rates.

941
00:55:35,254 --> 00:55:36,675
Or you need to say,

942
00:55:36,675 --> 00:55:39,155
they're gonna be such a small amount of the population,

943
00:55:39,155 --> 00:55:40,695
we don't care if they get demotivated.

944
00:55:41,326 --> 00:55:43,327
It will be a trade off there.

945
00:55:43,327 --> 00:55:43,367
OK.

946
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:43,647
All right.

947
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:44,187
Thanks.

948
00:55:44,187 --> 00:55:44,247
Hi.

949
00:55:44,247 --> 00:55:44,387
Hi.

950
00:55:44,387 --> 00:55:46,728
Do you have any particular framework

951
00:55:46,728 --> 00:55:49,490
you kind of use when you're designing rewards?

952
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,811
Or do you kind of just, because you're a PhD,

953
00:55:51,811 --> 00:55:52,771
you know everything?

954
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:56,373
Like, what are you used to help you when you're coming up with?

955
00:55:56,373 --> 00:55:57,173
I mean.

956
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:09,222
Basically the list I had is where I feel like the research comes together.

957
00:56:09,222 --> 00:56:15,003
It's like try and think about all these things when you're designing your reward system

958
00:56:15,003 --> 00:56:16,684
and think about how you're hitting the different parts of them

959
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:18,084
and is there a good clarity and all that kind of thing.

960
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:19,504
Fair enough. Thank you.

961
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:22,545
So you gave some cool examples and some counter examples.

962
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,065
I'm wondering in your opinion what's the biggest sin?

963
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:28,046
Like where has the dopamine naive theory or naive...

964
00:56:28,923 --> 00:56:33,146
like incorrect model being misapplied widely in gaming.

965
00:56:33,146 --> 00:56:34,948
Like if you could wave your wand and fix.

966
00:56:34,948 --> 00:56:41,993
For me personally, and I don't know if this is the biggest problem, I think it's that

967
00:56:41,993 --> 00:56:42,134
point of,

968
00:56:42,134 --> 00:56:46,337
okay thank you, of a lot of game developers don't think of losers.

969
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:48,018
And if your competition is

970
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:52,762
fair, usually that means people losing fifty percent of the time in your game.

971
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:58,213
And there's often, we like to think about winners because we like to think of ourselves as winners

972
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:01,935
and winning is already rewarding in itself but we also like to throw a bunch of rewards and

973
00:57:01,935 --> 00:57:07,078
celebrations and everything on top of it and often our losing screens are kind of like heart you lost

974
00:57:07,078 --> 00:57:12,441
and then that's it and we don't allow for our players to still feel engaged with our games

975
00:57:12,441 --> 00:57:17,204
