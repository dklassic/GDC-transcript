1
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:07,638
Okay, thanks for coming to my talk.

2
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:09,118
My name is Bernie Yee.

3
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:12,920
I'd like to give a quick intro of my background

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,500
and what I'm talking about today.

5
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:16,721
I've served as an internal producer

6
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:18,182
into internal dev teams.

7
00:00:19,402 --> 00:00:20,363
Currently I'm at Oculus.

8
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:21,903
I've been working on the set of demos

9
00:00:21,923 --> 00:00:24,164
that are maybe you'll see today if you get a chance to.

10
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:28,339
I've worked at PopCap, where I got to work on two great teams,

11
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:30,681
the Peggle 2 team and the Plants vs. Zombies 2 team.

12
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,483
Before that, I was at Bungie working on Destiny.

13
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:37,505
I've done external production, which is a different beast.

14
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:39,146
We won't be talking about that as much today,

15
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:43,249
but I've been at publisher side, at Atari and Sony Online.

16
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:47,312
I've done a bunch of startups. I've tried my own startup.

17
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:51,828
We raised some money and didn't get Escape Velocity.

18
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:53,489
I worked for some well-funded startups,

19
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:54,530
some poorly funded startups.

20
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:57,432
I've done some business development work.

21
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:01,295
I was at Harmonix trying to convince the studio

22
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:03,357
to build a PC version of Rock Band.

23
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:05,939
Great idea, we didn't get enough traction.

24
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,021
And I also taught game development and production

25
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:10,342
at Columbia University.

26
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:13,024
I foolishly convinced several of my students

27
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:13,785
to get into the business.

28
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:14,866
To them, I apologize.

29
00:01:16,947 --> 00:01:17,048
So.

30
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:21,872
I was thinking about the subject of what producers do.

31
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:24,073
I was building a house,

32
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:27,516
and you're constantly creating lists of things

33
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:29,477
and thinking about whether they're worth doing or not.

34
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,638
So much of the work of a producer

35
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:33,600
comes down to this list-making,

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,222
and it seems like a very trivial task.

37
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:38,583
You make lists to go shopping.

38
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:41,645
You make lists to take care of your kids.

39
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:44,907
But it occurred to me that even that simple task...

40
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:48,753
The process by which you derive that list is loaded with meaning.

41
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:53,055
This talk is really about how you, how I as a producer,

42
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:55,136
approach creating this to-do list.

43
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,337
This isn't a talk to tell you what should be on that list,

44
00:01:58,837 --> 00:02:01,398
how you should spend your time from moment to moment.

45
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:04,860
We have other talks.

46
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,641
There was a talk today about prioritization.

47
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,542
There was a talk after mine about communication.

48
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,022
All these things are very important.

49
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:16,095
But this is really about a frame of mind, a kind of a conceptual framework

50
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:18,517
about how which you should approach your work.

51
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:20,199
Because really, kind of like a Jedi Knight,

52
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,201
you've got to build your own lightsaber, and this is how you go do it.

53
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:27,746
The background story of this, too, is I draw a lot of parallels

54
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:29,327
to sports and deliberate practice.

55
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:32,390
I used to race bicycles, and I was not very good.

56
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:36,214
I placed in a handful of races, and that was when I was much younger

57
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:37,255
and had more time to train.

58
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,861
and I had a coach who used to tell me,

59
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,782
Bernie, when you're racing, get to the front,

60
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:44,883
be in the right position, watch their attacks,

61
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:47,483
pay attention to what wheel you're on,

62
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:50,564
don't ride in the gutter, over and over again.

63
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:53,205
And because my results weren't so fantastic,

64
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:55,285
I kind of thought, well, I'm a suck, this is really hard.

65
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:58,706
I got a chance to watch a few years later,

66
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:00,987
in the midst of the Armstrong doping years,

67
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:03,068
televised Tour de France.

68
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,728
And they put a camera in the,

69
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:11,551
car where the director sportif, the coach of the team, was talking to his team on the

70
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:18,015
radio. And sure enough, he said the same things. Get to the front, Frank, you are on this wheel,

71
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:22,017
get out of that position, watch the attacks, the same sort of thing that I would hear as

72
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:30,662
a very mediocre bike racer. And it reminded me that you have to be deliberate about what

73
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:34,244
you do. You have to do things consciously. Even professionals, people who are at the

74
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:38,727
far end of the bell curve, the top 1% of the 1%,

75
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:42,210
needs sort of the same reminding of basic things

76
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,231
over and over again.

77
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:46,333
And if you don't do things deliberately and thoughtfully,

78
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:47,634
you're ultimately just a robot.

79
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:51,037
You're following a prescribed set of tasks.

80
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,958
And it limits your growth as a producer.

81
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:53,779
It limits your team.

82
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,361
And it ultimately limits your game.

83
00:03:57,557 --> 00:04:00,838
So it's sort of a microcosm of how you evaluate games themselves.

84
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,899
You consciously evaluate the state of the game at any given time.

85
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,739
You should also consciously evaluate what you're doing as a producer.

86
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:11,201
So one thing a producer does,

87
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,542
in general, is try to get everyone on the same page.

88
00:04:14,662 --> 00:04:16,843
At Facebook, you know, Oculus was purchased by Facebook,

89
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:18,743
and Facebook doesn't really have a producer culture.

90
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:22,124
I had an engineer ask me,

91
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:25,045
so you're the producer, do you tell people what to do?

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,020
In some sense, I guess I do.

93
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,141
Someone will ask me,

94
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:30,221
Birdy, what should I work on next?

95
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:32,282
And I'll say, you should work on this thing.

96
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:33,382
It seems to be the highest priority.

97
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:37,623
But in reality, I'm representing the priorities of the project.

98
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:39,924
This is an important distinction.

99
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:42,225
Producers are not managers.

100
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:44,025
It's not my personal authority.

101
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:44,986
I'm not your art director.

102
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:46,966
I can't tell you how you're going to improve as an artist.

103
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:48,647
I can't give you creative feedback.

104
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:50,467
I'm certainly not going to review any code.

105
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:50,988
God knows.

106
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:55,916
And I've also learned it never hurts staying the obvious.

107
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:58,138
So let's go through the definition

108
00:04:58,158 --> 00:04:58,918
of what a producer does.

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,723
Very quickly, you plan, you schedule, you create priorities,

110
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:11,225
you articulate priorities, you get priorities from your team,

111
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:14,507
you resolve a lot of conflict.

112
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:16,668
Whenever there's more than two people in a room,

113
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:19,369
sometimes two people only is all you need to create conflict.

114
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:22,511
People don't see eye to eye on a task, the importance of a task.

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,381
how to solve a problem.

116
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:26,782
Maybe there's egos involved.

117
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:28,242
Almost always there's egos involved.

118
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:32,383
You end up a defender of the team quite a bit.

119
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:36,105
You resolve, you're the meat shield

120
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:38,105
for all sorts of people outside your team

121
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,626
that have opinions on how you should be doing your work

122
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,907
and how your team should be doing your work,

123
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:43,207
what direction you're going.

124
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,188
Sometimes these are valid inputs.

125
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:49,749
They, even valid inputs and opinions can be distracting.

126
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:52,150
It's your job to take body blows for the team

127
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,810
more often than not.

128
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:54,782
You spend a lot of time with marketing.

129
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,524
Anybody who's played Destiny or Shadow of Mordor,

130
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:00,425
there was a huge marketing campaign around these games.

131
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:03,347
Whether you like it or not, marketing is super important

132
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:06,730
and gets the word out in a very crowded marketplace.

133
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,671
You have to have a good working relationship with them.

134
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:12,354
Some of the less sexy things,

135
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:15,976
as if working with marketing wasn't at least sexy enough,

136
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,897
is headcounts in P&L.

137
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:20,099
So part of the plan that you build up front

138
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,320
will tell you how many people you think you need to build your game.

139
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:24,348
how much they cost to hire,

140
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,070
and whether your game makes money or not,

141
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,351
how much, what you have to do.

142
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:31,612
And I think you see a lot of this on Kickstarter now,

143
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,654
where people spend, donate money to Kickstarter.

144
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,714
You've raised a million dollars.

145
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,075
How come you can't deliver this game?

146
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:39,256
Games cost a lot of money.

147
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:41,197
Good people cost money to work.

148
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:44,879
And at certain places, like Electronic Arts,

149
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,561
a producer can be sort of a project lead.

150
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:51,583
This is a creative vision holder, creative vision.

151
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:54,616
creator, role.

152
00:06:54,996 --> 00:06:56,276
And I think, depending on where you are,

153
00:06:58,437 --> 00:07:00,597
the proportion by which you do these jobs vary.

154
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:05,918
But I would argue that it is all these tasks are part of what a producer does.

155
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:08,939
I had someone explain to me what they thought production was.

156
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:13,620
You're juggling plates, and you have to know which ones you let fall, and you make

157
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,680
those conscious decisions.

158
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:20,818
So when do producers get hired?

159
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:22,459
So small teams.

160
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:23,640
This is a big thing that's going on

161
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,822
with a lot of my former colleagues now,

162
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:27,843
both at PopCap and Bungie.

163
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:30,185
Folks are spinning off and starting their own studios.

164
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:32,267
They're super happy to be working

165
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:33,728
with a small group of like-minded people.

166
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:36,891
They have history and shared communication.

167
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:38,312
Communication is easy.

168
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:39,633
You know what other people are thinking.

169
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,174
You've already agreed on your values.

170
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,649
Still, it's hard to get five people on the same page.

171
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,631
If you've been in a relationship with someone,

172
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:48,292
it's hard to get two people on the same page often.

173
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,615
So five people, still a challenge,

174
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:52,176
but the short cycle of communication,

175
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:53,677
the sort of trust, the history

176
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:54,698
that you've built up with people,

177
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,261
a lot doesn't have to be said,

178
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:00,123
and in theory, you are comfortable enough

179
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:02,025
to say important things to each other.

180
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:05,228
So short cycle is a quick error correction.

181
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:05,889
You can get away with it.

182
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,590
So things are going great.

183
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,080
Presumably, you've got more money, you hire more people,

184
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,502
you can do more work, the scope of your game increases,

185
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,623
maybe the revenue projections of your game increases.

186
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:20,944
This is fantastic.

187
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:25,006
Then you reach this point where there's, I think,

188
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:26,967
inherent limitations to communication

189
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,148
within a team structure, when a team scales.

190
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:31,790
There's a few things that you can probably know

191
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,710
about Dunbar's number.

192
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:35,351
150 is the maximum number of people

193
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,793
that you can maintain a stable social relationship with.

194
00:08:38,907 --> 00:08:40,869
Beyond that, you forget who they are,

195
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,311
and you, more importantly, maybe lack empathy

196
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:44,052
for what they are doing.

197
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:46,714
One of the things I learned, even at Bungie,

198
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,596
arguably pound for pound,

199
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:51,018
one of the most talented development studios,

200
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,741
in the absence of information, people assume incompetence.

201
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:55,943
I don't know what they're doing.

202
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:57,104
They must be screwing it up.

203
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,208
There's another number that comes up often.

204
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:03,990
If you've ever tried to have a group conversation

205
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,751
of more than five people.

206
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,520
you know what happens.

207
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,142
Either someone stops speaking up,

208
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:10,824
or the conversation splinters.

209
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:12,485
Because your brain only sort of,

210
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,507
we're not too far removed from

211
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,172
primate socialization.

212
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:21,474
Our brain can only track about five conversations,

213
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:23,135
five people talking at once,

214
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,578
and once it exceeds that number, you start to focus.

215
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:27,313
So communication breaks down.

216
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:29,975
This is, you can, next time you go to a party tonight,

217
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:30,756
watch it happen.

218
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:34,158
You probably know why, you know what I'm talking about,

219
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:35,779
and one of the reasons for small meetings

220
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,241
is conversations are hard after five people.

221
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:40,043
So people aren't communicating.

222
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:41,884
You've probably heard this, features are late.

223
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,692
Engineers are complaining about randomization.

224
00:09:44,732 --> 00:09:45,853
I didn't know that we're supposed to do this.

225
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:47,074
This is not the highest priority.

226
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:49,917
Designers don't see their systems live until it's too late.

227
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:52,559
How come the engineer didn't talk to me before we built this?

228
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,941
He totally got this wrong.

229
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:55,582
And the business guys are beginning to wonder

230
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:56,363
when you're going to ship your game.

231
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:58,502
This is often when a producer comes in.

232
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,125
Experienced teams will hire a producer earlier,

233
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,486
before they reach this crisis state.

234
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:06,748
In fact, one of the, one of some of my colleagues

235
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,310
formed a studio, Adam Jack, in Seattle,

236
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,450
and they brought on a producer

237
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:14,493
before they reached this point of chaos,

238
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,555
because people who've been through this process know

239
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:21,058
it takes energy to rally a team around a product goal.

240
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,180
So...

241
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:30,101
The producer spends most of their time on the to-do list of the team in the game.

242
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,981
People call this the backlog.

243
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:34,403
It's really a big fancy to-do list.

244
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,585
It's a thing in Excel or HandSoft or whatever you want to use.

245
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:45,568
But it's incredibly powerful because I think it encapsulates all the work a producer does.

246
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:49,970
The scheduling, the prioritization, the conflict resolution.

247
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,431
All of that gets wrapped up into creation of this artifact.

248
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:54,612
It's all the known work you know how to do.

249
00:10:56,537 --> 00:10:59,057
This list also represents some of the issues

250
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:00,798
that you hear about in game development.

251
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:04,859
Crunch culture, I see this on a lot of listservs that I'm on.

252
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,899
People decry crunch culture, and yet they play games

253
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,680
like Last of Us that were built in crunch culture,

254
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,460
and they're fantastic.

255
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:11,860
Is it good?

256
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,401
Is it bad?

257
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:13,341
Is it necessary?

258
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:14,301
How do you mitigate this?

259
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,582
And it comes from the list of work you generate.

260
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:17,642
You create a list.

261
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:18,722
It's a big list.

262
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:21,743
If the team's incapable of doing it under normal hours,

263
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:23,623
things have to change, right?

264
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,361
So this is also an area where I think producers

265
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:31,283
can really fall into a significant trap

266
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:32,523
where you design by schedule.

267
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:34,144
If you control the schedule,

268
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:36,085
you control, in theory, priority.

269
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:37,846
If you control priority,

270
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,467
you control the aspects of the design.

271
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,148
You don't want to do that

272
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:42,568
because you think you're being all sly

273
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:44,189
and like, oh, I'm gonna get my thing on the list,

274
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:45,410
but everyone knows what you're doing,

275
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,251
and people don't like it.

276
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,332
They want to understand that the process is transparent

277
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,594
and you're a steward and a shepherd of the project.

278
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:56,662
and there's a time to interject your opinion.

279
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,345
So how do you sort of build a to-do list

280
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,548
that is rational, fair, transparent?

281
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:05,390
This is the thing that I want to talk about today,

282
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,392
how you manage your own to-do list

283
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:09,213
when you create the team's list.

284
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:12,236
This is what allows you to be effective as a producer.

285
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,401
The backlog is your responsibility,

286
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:20,803
and that's the thing you have to take most seriously.

287
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:23,425
So I think...

288
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:26,036
Often when you start as a producer,

289
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:32,762
you enter an environment that has a habit already

290
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:33,362
and patterns.

291
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:36,004
So it's easy to follow the things you're supposed to do.

292
00:12:36,184 --> 00:12:38,626
When I got to Bungie, they showed me

293
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:41,669
the tools, the template, how they like to track their work.

294
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,370
And you just follow it for a while.

295
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,371
It's new to you.

296
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,392
You probably have to figure it out.

297
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,485
And it varies from studio to studio.

298
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:52,647
I think what a studio, what an executive producer does at PopCap

299
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:55,210
is very different than what an executive producer does at Bungie.

300
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,851
So, if somebody were to make that transition,

301
00:12:58,372 --> 00:12:59,513
you'd have some acclimation time.

302
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:00,754
But when you settle in,

303
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,838
you need to think about why you're doing these things.

304
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,580
You don't follow your process blindly.

305
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,724
You think about why you're going through all these steps.

306
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:15,083
There's a constant evaluation of this.

307
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,844
Why are you building a burndown chart?

308
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,885
It takes time. You have to collect the data.

309
00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:19,885
You've got to crunch the numbers.

310
00:13:19,905 --> 00:13:21,506
You've got to talk about it. You've got to react to it.

311
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:24,427
Why do you need to plan down to a really granular level?

312
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:25,388
How important is this?

313
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:27,428
What is it trying to solve?

314
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:31,470
So my talk is sort of built into three things.

315
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:35,672
Useful cliches, these sort of guiding principles

316
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:40,033
that I've heard that have affected the way I think about production.

317
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,583
the things I do that try to make sense of the cliches

318
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:48,423
and make them actionable,

319
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:51,966
and things I've read that have really also profoundly affected

320
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:53,727
the way I think about producing teams.

321
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,051
So the cliches are a really useful starting point.

322
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,413
My dirty little secret is I went to law school,

323
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:05,997
and I know it's funny to have a business guy as a producer,

324
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:07,258
but I was a nerd before that.

325
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:10,100
There are things we talked about in law school

326
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,022
about the community of people that enforce laws.

327
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:15,790
You have police officers, you have lawyers, you have judges.

328
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,732
And each of them approaches their problem set

329
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:23,414
in this continuum of law enforcement in a different way.

330
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:25,295
Police officers generally default

331
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,136
to controlling a situation.

332
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:28,596
They don't care who did what.

333
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,638
They don't care if you're guilty or innocent.

334
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:31,298
It's not the time.

335
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:33,399
They want to get control and find out who's involved.

336
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,400
Lawyers come in after that.

337
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:37,521
Usually we ask a lot of questions.

338
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:38,802
We want to analyze the situation.

339
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:39,763
We ask hard questions.

340
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:41,243
We're rewarded for asking hard questions.

341
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:43,843
We want to understand both sides.

342
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:45,284
We want to understand all the possibilities.

343
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:47,725
And the judges take all of it and make a decision.

344
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:48,866
They're deciding.

345
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:49,726
They're the deciders.

346
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:51,608
They hear the facts.

347
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:52,668
This is how you do it.

348
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:56,251
Now, I say this because it sort of is my own bias

349
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,271
about how I view production.

350
00:14:57,832 --> 00:14:59,393
I was a lawyer, so I like to ask questions.

351
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:00,773
I like to understand why things work.

352
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,155
And I think by asking those questions,

353
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:06,017
it reminds us of the essential reasons for what we are doing

354
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:06,917
and why we're doing it.

355
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:10,860
So my first quote is.

356
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:16,380
My first cliche, I think, is from General slash President Eisenhower.

357
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,981
Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.

358
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,585
My second quote, George Patton, General George Patton.

359
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:30,167
A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.

360
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:35,570
He also was quoted saying a good solution applied with vigor now is better than a perfect

361
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,630
solution applied ten minutes later.

362
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:39,554
I think it says probably something about me

363
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:41,095
that the first two people I quoted were generals.

364
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:44,458
It probably fits my Myers-Briggs profile.

365
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:48,922
If anyone's a little more touchy-feely, Richard Carlson

366
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:50,724
wrote a book, I think in the 70s or 80s,

367
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,646
Don't Sweat the Small Stuff, and it's all small stuff.

368
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:54,808
I think this is really powerful.

369
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,729
I disagree that it's not all small stuff,

370
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,931
because your game has a ship and it's not built on small stuff.

371
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,634
But this is an important thing to remember.

372
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:02,695
Don't sweat the small stuff.

373
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:06,789
Robert Greenleaf also wrote a self-help book,

374
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:08,570
and he brought the term servant leader

375
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,291
back into some modern usage.

376
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,371
The servant leader is servant first.

377
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,833
This reminds me constantly that producers are overhead.

378
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:21,054
You are a support function, like QA,

379
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,194
like your office manager.

380
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:25,415
I used to say that I only have influence

381
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:28,396
insofar as my leads on my team vested me with influence.

382
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,939
Bad games comes from bad communication.

383
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:36,120
I actually had an argument about this during a job interview

384
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,880
with the head of production at a studio.

385
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,141
It is a producer-centric view of the problem of,

386
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:42,442
let's not ship bad games.

387
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,102
I think an engineer would approach this problem

388
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:44,462
differently.

389
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:47,363
I think a designer would explain this differently.

390
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,544
But I believe that this is defendable as the root cause

391
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:51,624
of why games are bad.

392
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:52,764
If you assume that teams are generally

393
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,745
competent and ambitious, and everyone

394
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,105
wants to do the right thing for their project.

395
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:01,795
So we have these cliches or these truisms.

396
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:04,737
I think of them as fundamental principles.

397
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,279
How do you translate this into organizing your day?

398
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:12,963
So let's start with my favorite one.

399
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:15,044
Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.

400
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:18,447
This is your most important job.

401
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:21,008
This is the most probably time-consuming of your jobs.

402
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:23,870
We used to do it every Wednesday or Thursday on PVZ2.

403
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,352
The leads would dread it because I'd drag them in for hours

404
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:27,793
and walk through the work.

405
00:17:29,677 --> 00:17:30,237
Very important.

406
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,978
I mean, it is the most important thing to do.

407
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:36,799
And yet, by definition, the end result, the artifact

408
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,560
you generate, is sort of futility.

409
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,040
It's like you Sisyphus rolling the rock up the hill.

410
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:45,422
Because the painful truth is, you throw away the plan.

411
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:46,902
You build this plan.

412
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:49,623
You work for a couple weeks or three weeks.

413
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:51,964
And you realize you didn't achieve your plan.

414
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:57,213
I tend to be pretty philosophical about these things

415
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:59,034
because it's the only way that I can stop myself

416
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:00,175
from grinding my teeth at night.

417
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,536
I think about monks who are making,

418
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:03,657
you know, they take colored sand

419
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:06,339
and make the intricate patterns like sand mandalas.

420
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:09,140
They spend all this energy and they create this thing

421
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,981
of beauty and the wind comes and it blows it away.

422
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:12,823
Why is this true?

423
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:15,844
Because very rarely, despite your best efforts,

424
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:19,286
does even two weeks go exactly according to plan.

425
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,262
Lots happened, right?

426
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:21,642
You know.

427
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:23,003
I mean, everyone here has seen it.

428
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:25,345
Found work, emergencies, people get sick,

429
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:27,627
people finish faster than they thought they would.

430
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:28,507
It takes longer.

431
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,949
Dependencies outside your team are affecting you.

432
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:33,591
These happen.

433
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:36,353
And I think the more you are willing to let it go,

434
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:41,017
the less bound by your plan you were.

435
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,462
If you repeat this pattern, plan, execute, throw away,

436
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:48,963
plan, execute, throw away.

437
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,715
You do this predictably and consistently.

438
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:53,456
That's your process.

439
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:56,438
People talk about production process a lot.

440
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:57,399
That's your process.

441
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,001
The little side is it leads to the typical question,

442
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:04,244
what's the best process?

443
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:07,486
We all want to know what the most efficient way of solving

444
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:08,006
problems are.

445
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:10,048
And there's a lot of nuance to these things.

446
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:14,511
Waterfall, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, all these things

447
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:15,772
are true and useful.

448
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:21,879
Do people know the difference between a complicated problem and a complex problem?

449
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,900
So this is an important thing to remember.

450
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:26,401
These things are different.

451
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,963
Complicated problems are things with lots of moving parts.

452
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,164
Let me give you an example.

453
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:34,706
Putting together a car is a complicated problem.

454
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:38,608
You put out a lot of stuff, you give me the tools, you give me the manual, I have no idea

455
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:39,068
how to do it.

456
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:43,411
That being said, nothing in that process is unknown.

457
00:19:44,078 --> 00:19:44,759
We know it all.

458
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:46,339
There is a book, there is a way to do it.

459
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:48,800
Someone does it, some machines do it every day.

460
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,981
Complicated problem.

461
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:53,462
A complex problem is, to quote Rumsfeld,

462
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:54,542
it's the unknown unknowns.

463
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:56,583
You're trying to solve things you don't know yet,

464
00:19:56,743 --> 00:19:57,703
you don't know the answer to.

465
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:01,005
And I think that that's a thing you want to keep in mind,

466
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,345
the difference between complicated problems

467
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:03,225
and complex problems,

468
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:04,266
and think about your best process.

469
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:06,867
That being said, this question, I believe, is the red herring.

470
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:10,208
The question isn't what the best process is, necessarily.

471
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:11,568
It's why do you have a process at all?

472
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:19,686
The process that I think about is a structure you can rely on when things get crazy.

473
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,847
They deliver goals to you that you can think about.

474
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,670
And I think again I got by the sports story.

475
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:28,172
I had a friend of mine who used to race bikes, and he was very good.

476
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:31,735
He was in Philadelphia, and Julius Erving, the famous basketball player,

477
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,877
used to have this thing for athletes.

478
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:38,368
his basketball court unsurprisingly

479
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:41,873
and he would shoot three-pointers all day and anyone who's old enough to

480
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:44,017
remember doctor jay he couldn't hit three-pointers during games

481
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:46,440
but all day he was hitting it from from downtown

482
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:50,144
And my friend, the bike racer, asked, like, you're so good.

483
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:51,545
How come you don't do this in a game?

484
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:53,745
And he said, you try doing this with Larry Bird in your jersey.

485
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:55,526
It's hard.

486
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,667
But the reason why he practiced it was to do it under pressure.

487
00:20:59,408 --> 00:21:01,549
So he could take the shot if he wanted to.

488
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:04,430
And that's the sort of deliberate practice part

489
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,751
and what process is designed.

490
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:09,332
You repeat it, you do it, and when things get hairy,

491
00:21:09,632 --> 00:21:10,232
you rely on it.

492
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:16,367
So I think the real answer to this question

493
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:18,148
is the best process is the one the team buys into.

494
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:21,348
I think it's fair to say that developers are generally

495
00:21:21,428 --> 00:21:22,429
suspicious of process.

496
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:24,909
They see it as a set of rules that gets in the way of work.

497
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:25,890
They want to start typing.

498
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,150
They want to start making the art.

499
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,190
They want to start making the game.

500
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,130
They see meetings.

501
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:29,831
They see stand-ups.

502
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,991
They see the arguments between teams, team members.

503
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:34,752
And it drives them crazy.

504
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:37,973
Your job is to get them to believe in the process.

505
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:42,723
even if it isn't the one you think should work.

506
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,524
Because you may be wrong, actually.

507
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:48,448
And when you have a process that the team buys into,

508
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,470
even if it's waterfall and you think it's not going to work,

509
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,191
you have a starting point,

510
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,393
and a starting point is what you need for iteration.

511
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,676
You can iterate based on your own experiences

512
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,138
and the sort of character of the team

513
00:21:59,178 --> 00:22:00,619
and their own temperament,

514
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:02,000
but you need a starting point.

515
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:04,602
The thing I tend to do is make a lot of suggestions.

516
00:22:04,663 --> 00:22:06,784
Hey, I think we should try to do it this way.

517
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:08,921
And if the team doesn't want to do it,

518
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,082
you let them feel the pain of the decisions.

519
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:15,584
So it puts a little bit of a short-term deliverables

520
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:17,845
at risk, but I think it's well worth it.

521
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:20,486
Let's say your team doesn't want to track work

522
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:21,487
as granularly as you want.

523
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:23,187
They don't want to do stand-ups every day.

524
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:26,649
Can we do every other day?

525
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:28,790
What happens when something invariably

526
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,790
happens on the days you don't meet

527
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,351
and things get dropped and missed?

528
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:32,951
And then the team will be much more

529
00:22:33,012 --> 00:22:34,512
likely to hear your suggestions.

530
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,645
When they know there's a problem, they want the solution,

531
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:39,907
and you should be able to provide them suggestions.

532
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:41,788
I actually, as an insider,

533
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:44,230
have an opinion about the best process, unsurprisingly.

534
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,192
I think it's the one that aligns closest with game development

535
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:48,933
and complex problems.

536
00:22:50,054 --> 00:22:51,875
Consistent re-evaluation is really important

537
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:53,476
because we're trying to build something that's fun,

538
00:22:53,556 --> 00:22:57,059
and no one can really define fun until you play it.

539
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,780
I think you want to protect the team from meddling.

540
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,182
This is the everybody's a designer syndrome,

541
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:04,144
and I think the thing that does this most is Agile and Scrum.

542
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:08,510
for these two reasons, interactions in individuals

543
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,131
over processing tools and responding to change

544
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,492
over following a plan.

545
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,875
This reminds me not to be rigid about the process.

546
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:21,898
I think it aligns most well with how games are made,

547
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:22,739
although not perfectly.

548
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,100
I think games has this constant pressure

549
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,402
of delivering a promised feature set on a schedule,

550
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:29,463
hard deadlines and unmovable dates.

551
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:32,865
And Agile is really about potentially skirting around

552
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:33,265
some of that.

553
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:36,657
And Scrum has that, you know, once your sprint begins,

554
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:38,078
don't inject new work.

555
00:23:38,338 --> 00:23:40,299
And that is an easy way to keep people

556
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:41,419
from meddling with the team's work.

557
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,742
So Jason was a former colleague of mine at Harmonix,

558
00:23:48,782 --> 00:23:50,402
and he said this, which I really appreciate.

559
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:52,743
There is no process which cannot be made ineffective

560
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:53,883
by following it too closely.

561
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:58,272
myself included, tend to hold onto their process,

562
00:23:58,292 --> 00:23:59,293
which can be a good thing.

563
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:01,634
I think you want to perpetuate good habits

564
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:02,775
in times of stress.

565
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:04,476
But this is also a dangerous thing

566
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:06,277
when the process is no longer working

567
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:09,118
and you're holding onto it because it's your process.

568
00:24:09,258 --> 00:24:10,939
You're the producer. You should own the process.

569
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:13,481
And you can look at even some of the message boards

570
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:16,222
on Agile and Scrum and these zealots

571
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:19,284
who dismiss alterations to the one true way,

572
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:21,925
even though their whole manifesto is to be flexible.

573
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:25,367
You can't hold onto your process too tightly.

574
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:32,144
So this leads to this idea of re-evaluation, re-factoring.

575
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:33,906
This happens to your game all the time.

576
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:43,075
To do this properly for a game, you need a plan, a backlog.

577
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:44,196
You need to do the work.

578
00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:50,001
You need to think about how you succeeded against your plan.

579
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:56,858
I apply this to myself in a thing I started doing relatively recently, and I keep a diary

580
00:24:56,898 --> 00:24:59,561
now, a production diary, of my personal thoughts.

581
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:04,285
I remember reading someone talking about this on Facebook, another producer, who talked

582
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:08,729
about how Trappist monks used to record their most important decisions of the day and why

583
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:09,610
they made those decisions.

584
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,351
They'd keep a sort of diary of decision making.

585
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:15,175
And I don't have the discipline of a Trappist monk, but I try to keep it logged now.

586
00:25:15,195 --> 00:25:17,937
I have a little OneNote tab that says, My Diary.

587
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:21,573
And I put things in there that hit me,

588
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:23,873
mistakes I've made in real time.

589
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:27,254
So work went on at Oculus.

590
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,755
We were given a lot of tight deadlines and public shows.

591
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:31,075
We scoped a bunch of work.

592
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:34,456
It seemed like too much work to me, and it seemed vague.

593
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:36,316
But one other thing that's true about Oculus

594
00:25:36,357 --> 00:25:37,337
is it's full of smart people.

595
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:38,497
You know, what am I going to do?

596
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:40,418
I'm not going to tell Mike Abrash that he's wrong.

597
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:43,591
Full of smart people. They can do the work.

598
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,212
They've shipped big games. They've done this before.

599
00:25:45,232 --> 00:25:46,453
I'm like, all right. They believe it.

600
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:48,255
I guess I should go along with it.

601
00:25:48,635 --> 00:25:49,937
And it turns out that it had too—

602
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:51,118
there was too much work in it.

603
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,219
There was a lot of hidden stuff

604
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,101
that came back and bit us in the ass.

605
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:56,043
And I went back to my diary, and I'm like,

606
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:56,983
trust your instincts.

607
00:25:58,345 --> 00:25:59,005
Ask the questions.

608
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:00,867
And I think were I younger,

609
00:26:00,887 --> 00:26:03,149
I would have read that to believe,

610
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:04,651
pushed back really hard at the time.

611
00:26:06,223 --> 00:26:09,726
And maybe I tend to do that too much, but I think there's a way to approach that problem

612
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:10,146
differently.

613
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,186
Ask questions.

614
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:17,050
Figure out what work is—if there's a question—if I'm unsettled about something, explore it.

615
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,572
The worst thing that happens is I look like an idiot, and I'm like, oh, it's obvious,

616
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,112
Bernie.

617
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:22,233
This is super easy to do.

618
00:26:22,253 --> 00:26:23,193
Look, this, this, and this.

619
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:23,694
Great.

620
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:27,656
The best thing that could happen is, hey, there's a lot of work here we hadn't thought

621
00:26:27,696 --> 00:26:27,916
about.

622
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,737
Maybe we should consider.

623
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,916
So I write this stuff in my diary, and I remember it.

624
00:26:33,936 --> 00:26:34,936
And I still talk about it today.

625
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:37,597
So once you write something,

626
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:39,637
it stays with you differently.

627
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:44,958
So...

628
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:48,719
don't sweat the small stuff.

629
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,560
Now, this is not an excuse not to be detail-oriented.

630
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,471
I think it's a fundamental entry condition of a producer

631
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:00,712
to be detail-oriented.

632
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:02,233
You have to understand all the details

633
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:03,254
before you start dropping them.

634
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:06,215
You have to know what the small stuff is.

635
00:27:06,235 --> 00:27:07,276
You have to know what the big stuff is.

636
00:27:07,316 --> 00:27:09,518
And the small stuff are things like process specifics.

637
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:10,638
We've been talking about this a little.

638
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:12,219
Detailed plans.

639
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,561
And detailed plans are really tempting

640
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:15,582
because it gives you this illusion

641
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:16,522
of control and knowledge.

642
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:19,204
I planned this guy's work down to the hour.

643
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:20,125
This is gonna be great.

644
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:22,946
Attention of granularity.

645
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:24,988
Do you believe how accurate you are?

646
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:28,620
The truth is, you know this plan is not going to work.

647
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,460
It's never worked.

648
00:27:30,021 --> 00:27:32,543
So where's your ROI?

649
00:27:32,723 --> 00:27:33,703
Where do you cut your losses?

650
00:27:34,224 --> 00:27:35,705
The big stuff is the stuff you want to sweat.

651
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:37,246
Good habits.

652
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:43,050
How the team responds to crises, how communication

653
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,872
works on your team, how accountable your team

654
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:46,373
is to each other.

655
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:50,904
how critical you can be to each other

656
00:27:51,024 --> 00:27:52,405
about the work and progress,

657
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:53,866
and how you course correct.

658
00:27:54,387 --> 00:27:55,387
This is all the big stuff,

659
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:56,708
and this is stuff you should sweat.

660
00:27:57,869 --> 00:27:58,730
So how do you tell the difference?

661
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:03,893
It occurred to me, I was at Bungie,

662
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,694
and Bungie's a very data-driven sort of...

663
00:28:07,575 --> 00:28:09,016
quantitative data-driven culture,

664
00:28:09,036 --> 00:28:11,078
is that we are, in fact, scientists.

665
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:13,080
We collect data on the state of the project

666
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,941
at any given time.

667
00:28:14,582 --> 00:28:15,423
Data is very useful.

668
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:17,725
We talked about how it could avoid crunch

669
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:19,107
and choose the right set of work.

670
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:21,569
And I think a lot of places get caught up

671
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:24,092
in measuring quantitative data.

672
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,610
burn down charts.

673
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,871
How fast are you fixing your bugs?

674
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,912
How fast are you finishing these features?

675
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:33,735
What percentage of efficiency does your ICs work at?

676
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:37,717
Some places track some sort of multiplier.

677
00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:38,317
You're a 0.8.

678
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:39,878
You're a 0.75.

679
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:42,400
Leads are 0.4, because they've got to manage people.

680
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,581
And there's an essential truth in there.

681
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:47,103
Leads probably can't be accounted on for IC work

682
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,404
the same way that IC can, because you spend time managing.

683
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:50,985
So you know they're going to be less efficient.

684
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:56,491
On a project I worked on, people were talking about time estimation.

685
00:28:56,832 --> 00:28:57,992
Two hours, four hours.

686
00:28:58,512 --> 00:28:59,712
Yeah, it's a two-hour task.

687
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:02,193
No, it's a four-hour task.

688
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:04,733
We'll put down two hours, because you think you're working on it,

689
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:05,333
you should know better.

690
00:29:05,773 --> 00:29:09,454
These are all, I think, the important details that

691
00:29:09,654 --> 00:29:12,715
can be seductively misleading.

692
00:29:13,255 --> 00:29:13,955
What are you measuring?

693
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:14,635
Work?

694
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:16,475
Efficiency is only one thing.

695
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:19,296
People, morale.

696
00:29:20,765 --> 00:29:21,646
Faith in decisions.

697
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,669
How do you put that in an Excel spreadsheet?

698
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:27,354
It's your job to measure it.

699
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:30,278
So you're going to have to figure that out.

700
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,280
But I would argue that the failure

701
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,824
from these unmeasurable qualitative things,

702
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:38,148
like faith and belief in a project or a feature.

703
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:42,097
can overwhelm any granular planning errors you check.

704
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:43,458
I'll give you an example.

705
00:29:43,478 --> 00:29:48,721
A studio had specced out a feature, passed concept,

706
00:29:48,741 --> 00:29:50,122
went into production.

707
00:29:50,182 --> 00:29:52,863
It was a very expensive asset production pipeline.

708
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:57,466
Green all the way, check, it's good, we're on target.

709
00:29:58,106 --> 00:29:59,667
Reach the end, see the final thing.

710
00:29:59,687 --> 00:30:02,049
And the creative leadership is like, this sucks.

711
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:03,950
This is no good.

712
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,791
We're going to go, we've got to throw it all away.

713
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:08,313
So yes, the producer on the project.

714
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:11,689
Things were going well. We hit our milestones.

715
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:16,232
But the producer-centric lens that I would use is say,

716
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:19,215
the producer did not or was not empowered

717
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,958
to raise all the qualitative issues that they had found.

718
00:30:23,218 --> 00:30:24,259
Because if you had found this earlier,

719
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,981
and probably findable way

720
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:28,382
before it actually hits real production,

721
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:30,904
we would have not spent millions of dollars

722
00:30:30,984 --> 00:30:32,105
on this particular feature.

723
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:37,689
So science is a good metaphor.

724
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,325
We have theories which are operating assumptions based on data.

725
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:45,427
It's a theory of evolution. It's a theory of gravity.

726
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:49,629
We don't need to know all the details to know that this is an accurate theory.

727
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:57,834
I'm going to go back to that point of backlog being the known work.

728
00:30:58,714 --> 00:31:01,996
Being 100% accurate, knowing all the work, is impossible.

729
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:06,199
There's one way to know exactly what work is in any given period.

730
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,180
It's to actually do the work.

731
00:31:09,187 --> 00:31:13,430
So chasing accuracy at some point gives diminishing returns.

732
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:17,333
I accept that my goal is not to define all the work,

733
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:19,976
but do enough to give the team confidence to act.

734
00:31:20,516 --> 00:31:22,037
And this leads into my next cliche.

735
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:26,161
A good plan violently executed now

736
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,782
is better than the perfect plan next week.

737
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:31,225
Another one I think, another good cliche

738
00:31:31,245 --> 00:31:32,526
which I almost use is don't let the perfect

739
00:31:32,546 --> 00:31:33,266
be the enemy of the good.

740
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:43,632
I had a friend of mine, a colleague, who just recently left a studio that was known for a very flat management structure to Amazon Game Studios.

741
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:48,875
And he finds it actually quite gratifying. He says that they have this thing called bias towards action.

742
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,593
which I really like, the idea that you want to act.

743
00:31:53,093 --> 00:31:54,474
You don't want to think too much.

744
00:31:55,574 --> 00:31:58,375
And that's why I think you need to embrace uncertainty.

745
00:31:58,595 --> 00:31:59,776
Don't wait for a plan to be perfect.

746
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,797
It doesn't mean don't be rigorous.

747
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,657
You can define the amount of rigor you want

748
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:06,718
to any given plan, but don't wait for that perfect plan.

749
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:10,660
You embrace uncertainty in planning.

750
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,201
You have to be comfortable with the fact

751
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:15,542
that you're dealing with complex problems

752
00:32:15,562 --> 00:32:17,082
that don't have a clear solution yet.

753
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:18,863
I'm gonna.

754
00:32:19,552 --> 00:32:21,894
quote, another former PVZ2 colleague of mine,

755
00:32:21,914 --> 00:32:23,415
our lead designer,

756
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,858
and I squeezed him on his schedule once.

757
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:27,919
And he said to me,

758
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,122
Bernie, you're forcing me to get it right the first time.

759
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:32,923
And he turned around and he walked away.

760
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:34,044
Um...

761
00:32:36,026 --> 00:32:37,527
He wasn't mad at me, I don't think.

762
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:41,250
And I remember that vividly.

763
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,593
I mean, of all the moments of working on PVZ2,

764
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:45,374
that's one of them.

765
00:32:46,415 --> 00:32:48,516
I realized that I was limiting his effectiveness as a designer.

766
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,835
I was forcing him to be conservative.

767
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:52,457
I was forcing him to get something to ship.

768
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:55,059
And while I think he understood

769
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,561
that we were on a tight schedule and that happens,

770
00:32:58,682 --> 00:33:00,363
that shouldn't be my default.

771
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:02,706
You have to embrace the uncertainty of that process.

772
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:05,328
The hardest problems you face will have uncertain answers

773
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:06,309
that are not schedulable,

774
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,691
and you'll have to embrace the sort of duality

775
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:10,352
of a schedule and unschedulable work.

776
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:13,655
That is really kind of what makes making games hard

777
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:15,977
and what makes making games great.

778
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:23,227
This sort of brings to the next cliché

779
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:24,027
about servant leadership.

780
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:31,130
This falls into the idea that uncertainty means,

781
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,451
as a producer, you don't have to have all the answers.

782
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,472
And the irony is even if you do have the answers,

783
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:38,293
sometimes when you dictate them to the team,

784
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:39,953
you'll have sabotaged the outcome.

785
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:43,135
Your team should derive the answers themselves.

786
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,892
While this was brought up in a self-help book in the 70s,

787
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:50,393
it has its origin in the Teitiaoqing.

788
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:52,754
And I'll read you the translation,

789
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:54,115
which I find really useful.

790
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:57,316
The highest type of ruler is one whose existence the people

791
00:33:57,356 --> 00:33:58,036
are barely aware.

792
00:33:58,957 --> 00:34:01,438
Next comes the one whom they love and praise.

793
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,279
Next comes one whom they fear.

794
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,661
And next comes one whom they despise and defy.

795
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:11,323
Probably a lot of producers fall into the last two categories,

796
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,884
fear, despise, defy.

797
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:14,524
I hope I get the fear and love and praise.

798
00:34:16,022 --> 00:34:19,264
I don't think I've reached any of the higher levels of this,

799
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:20,664
but this is true.

800
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:28,548
So everyone hear the chicken, you know,

801
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,169
the chicken-pig project management story?

802
00:34:30,189 --> 00:34:31,550
It's a joke, right?

803
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:36,252
Well, so I remember doing an interview at a studio,

804
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:39,694
and some of the feedback that came back to me was,

805
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:42,255
Bernie talks about him and the team

806
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,736
almost as separate things a lot.

807
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:48,144
And it concerned them because, you know, you'd be on the team.

808
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:49,485
Why do you consider yourself separate?

809
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:51,426
That's how it perceived.

810
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:52,727
And I stand by that.

811
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:55,168
This is the joke.

812
00:35:01,172 --> 00:35:02,333
So producers are chickens.

813
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,695
We lay the eggs, but our skin isn't on the line.

814
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,557
You're involved in it.

815
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:09,558
You're part of the outcome.

816
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:11,479
There's no question that your contribution

817
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,320
is in the shipping product.

818
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,957
but you're not the bacon.

819
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:19,822
People are doing the typing and doing the Cintiq stuff.

820
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:22,545
They're the bacon. They're the pigs in this.

821
00:35:23,446 --> 00:35:25,488
And that's why I think it's actually really important

822
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:27,631
to resist the urge to prescribe action.

823
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:32,896
So when I go through my day, I think about how I want to frame these issues for people.

824
00:35:33,636 --> 00:35:37,257
I try to present data and options. And I may have the right option, and you think

825
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:39,538
I'm saving everyone time. Like, we could all talk about this, and we

826
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:44,299
could just do the thing that I know is right. But the team will remember not necessarily

827
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:47,280
the outcome, but they'll remember that it was your option and not their option.

828
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,281
I don't do this very well all the time. People in the audience probably know that.

829
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:56,775
There was a thing I did once that I was really proud of.

830
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:58,677
We were working on PVZ2,

831
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:00,078
and we had a pretty big milestone coming up.

832
00:36:01,379 --> 00:36:02,320
And we planned all this work,

833
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,041
and it was really important not to miss a feature

834
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,903
because it's EA, and we've got to hit these things,

835
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:06,863
and it's important.

836
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:08,785
I'm not going to trivialize it by saying it's just EA.

837
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:10,206
We have to keep to a schedule.

838
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:11,007
We had a date.

839
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:14,870
And we put up, I don't know, it was like,

840
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,571
2x the work of the hours available

841
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:18,313
or something like that, and we had to get it done.

842
00:36:18,953 --> 00:36:20,655
And we put up the cards on the board.

843
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:21,796
We put up the time estimates.

844
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:22,997
I ran through the math with everyone.

845
00:36:23,855 --> 00:36:26,697
and it's like 35 people sitting in the big team area.

846
00:36:27,238 --> 00:36:28,259
I'm like, okay, we have all this work.

847
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:30,200
And we don't have enough time.

848
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,262
And then I stopped talking.

849
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,003
And it was really uncomfortable.

850
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:35,644
I stood there.

851
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:38,886
It felt like hours, but it was probably 10 seconds.

852
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:42,249
And I think the team was expecting, oh my god,

853
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:43,590
Bernie's going to tell us a crunch.

854
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,572
He's going to go get pies for everybody or whatever it is

855
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:48,033
and make us work through the weekend.

856
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:50,575
I didn't say anything because really it was so far beyond

857
00:36:50,616 --> 00:36:53,178
the realm of what I thought was even feasible to ask for, I

858
00:36:53,218 --> 00:36:53,858
didn't say anything.

859
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:59,062
And I remember Joe Sola, one of our engineers, probably one

860
00:36:59,102 --> 00:36:59,583
of our real.

861
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:04,239
leaders on that engineering team, came up and took a card down and said, what does this

862
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:09,260
really mean? And the designers started talking. And they started breaking it up. I mean, some

863
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,622
of the issues were we didn't think a lot of this work was parallelizable on a team. But

864
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:17,443
Joe took it down, and he applied more rigor to it than I would have and probably

865
00:37:18,074 --> 00:37:20,296
more than you would normally want in a planning process

866
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:21,636
because we had this problem.

867
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:23,578
And all the engineers sort of build up,

868
00:37:23,678 --> 00:37:25,079
and they start talking to these processes.

869
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:27,260
They started ripping up the cards

870
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,100
and writing different ones,

871
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,821
and they started load balancing their work.

872
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:33,124
And I think it was a sprint where we hit our goals.

873
00:37:33,144 --> 00:37:34,004
We didn't finish all the work,

874
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:35,785
but at the end, we were happy with what we did.

875
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:37,546
I wish I'd done that more often,

876
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,828
and that's why I think it's useful to remind myself of this.

877
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:44,987
So the end state of your production values

878
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:47,968
is this sort of idea that if you resolve the conflicts

879
00:37:47,988 --> 00:37:49,188
and you get people on the same page

880
00:37:49,288 --> 00:37:50,649
and you have clear priorities,

881
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,270
these are the things you're doing on a daily basis,

882
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,351
it's a little scary for your job security.

883
00:37:57,932 --> 00:38:00,153
The best producers want to obsolete themselves.

884
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:01,833
They want to get their team into a state

885
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:03,474
where they don't have problems and don't need you.

886
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:06,015
It's a little unsettling.

887
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:08,256
Things can go well.

888
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:09,516
I mean, people talk about production

889
00:38:09,536 --> 00:38:10,497
and all these horror stories.

890
00:38:11,037 --> 00:38:12,498
In general, I thought PVZ, for instance,

891
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:15,215
Things went pretty well.

892
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:16,335
We had a plan.

893
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:17,176
We executed to it.

894
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:18,356
We dodged some bullets.

895
00:38:18,857 --> 00:38:21,938
We shipped a game that we were proud of.

896
00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:23,258
So things can go well.

897
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:24,319
And when things go well,

898
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:25,959
I think this is actually true for producers,

899
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,400
you feel kind of useless.

900
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,781
You feel kind of unproductive.

901
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:30,581
Everyone's banging away at their stuff.

902
00:38:31,062 --> 00:38:31,642
They're happy.

903
00:38:32,302 --> 00:38:35,944
Even when things are problematic

904
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:38,785
and there's a plan, they're executing on it,

905
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:40,045
you kind of sit back and, you know,

906
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:41,746
you play the build and you talk to folks.

907
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:44,639
You feel like you're not checking anything to perforce,

908
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:45,560
therefore you're not useful.

909
00:38:47,901 --> 00:38:48,601
You'll vacillate.

910
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:50,702
I think my current boss, Laura Fryer,

911
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:53,243
tells me that there's an optimum line of efficiency

912
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:53,783
for producers.

913
00:38:54,184 --> 00:38:56,144
And a good producer will always veer

914
00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:58,405
towards the pushy, ineffective, pushy, ineffective.

915
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:01,187
And when she told me that, I felt

916
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:03,708
like a weight was lifted off me, because I feel that way.

917
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:07,929
So my point, my advice here is to resist the urge to meddle.

918
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,231
Don't ask too many questions when things are going well.

919
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:12,391
Go home.

920
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:14,713
If you're a good producer, you're probably there late.

921
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:16,133
You should go home.

922
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,315
And I also remind you that watching and listening

923
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:19,375
is actually doing something.

924
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:19,916
It's passive.

925
00:39:20,856 --> 00:39:23,758
It's watchful, but it is still doing something.

926
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:25,899
Don't worry.

927
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,041
When things go well, they only go well for so long.

928
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:38,127
Okay, I think this is my last cliche.

929
00:39:39,886 --> 00:39:41,928
Bad games comes from bad communication.

930
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:44,531
So I had this interview with a friend of mine now,

931
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:46,653
head of production at a big studio.

932
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:48,574
And we talked about this.

933
00:39:48,974 --> 00:39:51,556
And I think he felt communication was a soft skill.

934
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:52,617
Some people understand the difference

935
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:53,698
between hard skills and soft skills.

936
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,680
Hard skills is sort of the technical aspects

937
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,260
of being a producer.

938
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,421
You're going to create the work.

939
00:39:57,441 --> 00:39:58,322
You're going to track the work.

940
00:39:58,342 --> 00:39:59,062
You're going to check it off.

941
00:39:59,082 --> 00:40:00,083
You're going to check in with people.

942
00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:02,245
You're going to see what the risks are.

943
00:40:03,306 --> 00:40:05,127
These are all expressible, arguably,

944
00:40:05,147 --> 00:40:05,888
in an Excel spreadsheet.

945
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,569
The soft skills stuff is how you deal with people

946
00:40:07,649 --> 00:40:09,110
and how you talk to them and how you understand

947
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,111
what they really are feeling.

948
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:13,254
And I believe this is a false dichotomy, actually.

949
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:16,157
I disagree with him then, and he still gave me a job offer,

950
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:16,557
which is good.

951
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:18,819
But I disagree with him now.

952
00:40:18,979 --> 00:40:20,521
Because as I understand the hard skills,

953
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:22,343
it's all about communication, right?

954
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:26,446
That task list, your check-ins, your worksheets,

955
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:30,310
how much hours you've allocated, what your overage is,

956
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,112
these are all about communicating problems

957
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:34,374
to people that, in theory, can do something about it.

958
00:40:36,245 --> 00:40:38,046
All the soft skills stuff is about communication, too.

959
00:40:38,426 --> 00:40:40,086
It's understanding, are you bought into this feature?

960
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:41,767
Do you have any questions?

961
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:43,188
Do you have any doubts about what we're doing?

962
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:46,789
I say that every team has an Eeyore, you know,

963
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:48,090
somebody who's super negative.

964
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,031
Oh, it's going wrong.

965
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:52,532
And that's my favorite person on the team

966
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:54,993
because 70% of what that person is saying

967
00:40:55,473 --> 00:40:58,054
is usually just sort of Eeyore-ness,

968
00:40:58,094 --> 00:41:00,215
and 30% is, oh, my God, he's the canary in the coal mine.

969
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:01,096
I must listen to him.

970
00:41:02,316 --> 00:41:03,757
So I take on the... I hear all the...

971
00:41:05,538 --> 00:41:05,758
The...

972
00:41:06,562 --> 00:41:10,251
the paranoia and fear, and I pick the things out of it that I think are worth following

973
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:11,113
up and I follow up on them.

974
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:18,403
We're near the end of my talk.

975
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,586
There are things that I think people want to do about learning about production.

976
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:25,831
It's unfortunate because I use the baseball or the cycling analogy,

977
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:28,534
and these are areas where you get to practice a shit ton

978
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:30,176
before you go out on the field and do it.

979
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:31,537
You know, you have a job.

980
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:32,898
You don't get a chance to practice any of this.

981
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:34,500
You're on the field every day,

982
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:37,383
and you have to figure out how to learn about your craft.

983
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,826
So books you might be tempted to read.

984
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:41,644
And I think they're all worth reading.

985
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:42,764
You probably read them.

986
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:45,425
Mythical Man Month on PeopleSoft is another one.

987
00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:49,286
I learned things like how interruptions break productivity

988
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:51,547
and set you back hours, potentially,

989
00:41:51,587 --> 00:41:52,527
for a small interruption.

990
00:41:52,987 --> 00:41:55,108
Rapid Development, Agile Game Development with Scrum,

991
00:41:55,128 --> 00:41:56,008
these are all useful books.

992
00:41:56,028 --> 00:41:57,168
Dynamics of Software Development.

993
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,229
These are all worth reading, and you probably know them.

994
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,071
Let me suggest other books which I think are probably more useful.

995
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:08,932
These four books have profoundly affected

996
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:10,112
the way I think about my work.

997
00:42:11,474 --> 00:42:13,175
and I struggle to put them into practice.

998
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:16,738
Science of Fear by Daniel Gardner is a book about cognitive bias.

999
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:19,521
It's about how we make shitty decisions

1000
00:42:19,741 --> 00:42:21,083
when we think we're making good ones.

1001
00:42:22,204 --> 00:42:25,126
The two obvious ones, two cognitive biases,

1002
00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:26,107
are confirmation bias.

1003
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:30,211
People hear and they take data that reaffirms their worldview

1004
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,134
and they reject data that contradicts their worldview.

1005
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:36,377
And as I said about befriending the Eeyore on my team...

1006
00:42:37,326 --> 00:42:40,468
I want to hear the contradictions to the worldview.

1007
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,109
If I think things are going well,

1008
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,152
and I'm kind of the least domain expert

1009
00:42:45,172 --> 00:42:46,973
of all the different disciplines on the team,

1010
00:42:47,013 --> 00:42:48,994
if I think things are going well, I want to hear that stuff.

1011
00:42:49,595 --> 00:42:51,136
The other one is for those who are parents,

1012
00:42:52,317 --> 00:42:54,358
the availability heuristic is another cognitive bias.

1013
00:42:54,378 --> 00:42:55,619
When you hear about a child kidnapping,

1014
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:57,600
you think, oh my God, my kid is gonna be kidnapped.

1015
00:42:57,881 --> 00:42:59,682
Because these events are so powerful,

1016
00:43:00,282 --> 00:43:03,305
it skews your sense of probability and likelihood.

1017
00:43:05,226 --> 00:43:06,907
My second book is a book called Numeracy.

1018
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:12,728
It talks about how, as a society, we are mathematically illiterate,

1019
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:16,510
and I don't want to undersell the value of production data.

1020
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,010
Quantitative production data is super useful.

1021
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,431
And understanding numbers is super useful.

1022
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,612
And Paul talks about two examples that really struck in my head.

1023
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:28,934
He draws a, he takes students, he draws a timeline on a blackboard.

1024
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:32,815
He says, number line, zero, or on your side, zero, a billion.

1025
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:34,195
Draw where a million is.

1026
00:43:34,775 --> 00:43:36,376
Most people put it like a third of the way there.

1027
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:39,600
Because they don't know. I mean, numbers, that's why I have scientific notation.

1028
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,021
People don't, can't understand numbers.

1029
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:44,585
The other really great example that he talks about is the, uh,

1030
00:43:44,985 --> 00:43:46,767
the three doors goat probability problem.

1031
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:50,030
So, three doors, two doors have goats, one door has a car.

1032
00:43:50,471 --> 00:43:51,071
You pick a door.

1033
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:53,374
Right, so you choose door one.

1034
00:43:53,994 --> 00:43:54,995
The game show host says,

1035
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:57,178
okay, I'm going to flip over one of these that's a goat.

1036
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:58,919
Flips over, let's say door three.

1037
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,291
Do you change?

1038
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:02,795
What's your probability of two closed doors?

1039
00:44:03,295 --> 00:44:04,056
What's your probability?

1040
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:06,600
Do you change your choice, or do you keep it the same?

1041
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:08,603
The answer is, of course you change your choice.

1042
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:09,585
Because now.

1043
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:11,328
The probability has changed.

1044
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,350
The probability of your first choice is you're 33% right.

1045
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:18,791
The other two doors were 66% accuracy.

1046
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,731
You've already eliminated one of them,

1047
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:25,433
so it's 66% likely that the second door is the car,

1048
00:44:25,473 --> 00:44:27,814
and only 33% likely that the first door is the car.

1049
00:44:28,154 --> 00:44:29,294
It's completely counterintuitive.

1050
00:44:30,455 --> 00:44:31,635
I was a pretty good math student as a kid.

1051
00:44:32,596 --> 00:44:35,099
couldn't figure this out. Like, that's 50-50. How can that be?

1052
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,941
But if you actually run through simulations of this,

1053
00:44:37,382 --> 00:44:41,767
he's exactly right. 66%. And that's a significant difference in probability.

1054
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,732
The third book is Don't Think of an Elephant by George Lakoff.

1055
00:44:46,777 --> 00:44:50,259
It's a left-leaning Democrat strategy book.

1056
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:52,560
And if your politics don't align that way,

1057
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,681
you should bite your lip and read it anyway.

1058
00:44:55,061 --> 00:44:57,502
It's about how the Republican Party in the 80s

1059
00:44:57,702 --> 00:45:00,684
reinvented their brand and framed issues

1060
00:45:00,724 --> 00:45:03,225
in a different way to make it popular for people.

1061
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,547
Compassionate conservatism, 1,000 points of light,

1062
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:08,107
all this stuff.

1063
00:45:08,727 --> 00:45:10,548
And the canonical example is, do you

1064
00:45:10,568 --> 00:45:11,589
want to save 33% of people, or you want

1065
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:12,189
to let 66% of the people die?

1066
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,097
I want to save 33% of the people, right?

1067
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:19,718
It's how you frame that question,

1068
00:45:19,738 --> 00:45:20,959
even though they're functionally the same.

1069
00:45:21,479 --> 00:45:23,540
Same outcome, different framing.

1070
00:45:25,941 --> 00:45:27,782
Thanks for the Feedback by Stone and Heen

1071
00:45:27,822 --> 00:45:29,123
is a book I just started reading.

1072
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:31,704
Because I think you are a servant leader,

1073
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:35,446
how you receive feedback is really critical.

1074
00:45:38,588 --> 00:45:41,269
You will get feedback from all your leads and your team.

1075
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,331
Some of it will be valid, some of it will not be valid.

1076
00:45:45,522 --> 00:45:49,343
And feedback, I mean, people have a hard time even accepting good feedback.

1077
00:45:49,643 --> 00:45:51,444
You know, oh, no, it was nothing, really.

1078
00:45:53,205 --> 00:45:55,946
Negative feedback is even harder because you're usually put on the defensive.

1079
00:45:57,687 --> 00:45:59,508
I'm guilty of that sometimes. I think we all are.

1080
00:46:00,128 --> 00:46:03,369
But how you receive it is critical in growing as a producer.

1081
00:46:04,009 --> 00:46:07,491
And how you push back is critical in helping the person giving feedback grow.

1082
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:10,092
It's an art. It's something to think about.

1083
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:12,773
And I think these are all well worth reading.

1084
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:16,448
Someone else has suggested Predictably Irrational,

1085
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:19,709
which is a book that a lot of free-to-play people have read

1086
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:21,130
because people make all sorts of weird

1087
00:46:22,391 --> 00:46:24,672
behavioral economics decisions when purchasing free-to-play goods,

1088
00:46:24,732 --> 00:46:28,033
but I haven't finished it, so I didn't put it on the list,

1089
00:46:28,053 --> 00:46:29,013
but it's also worth reading.

1090
00:46:31,294 --> 00:46:35,796
So, I'll sum up saying production is sort of this invisible craft, right?

1091
00:46:35,816 --> 00:46:38,317
I was at a game board night with some Valve people,

1092
00:46:38,357 --> 00:46:39,638
and they're like, oh, I'm a programmer at Valve.

1093
00:46:39,678 --> 00:46:40,118
Of course you are.

1094
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:44,911
What do you do, Bernie?

1095
00:46:44,951 --> 00:46:45,371
I'm a producer.

1096
00:46:45,411 --> 00:46:47,172
And they all took one step back, like, oh.

1097
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:51,634
So it's pretty fair to say, I think, that we laughed about it.

1098
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,476
And production really varies by discipline.

1099
00:46:54,496 --> 00:46:56,117
You've been an art producer, maybe different than design

1100
00:46:56,137 --> 00:46:56,497
producer.

1101
00:46:56,817 --> 00:46:59,359
It varies by project, team.

1102
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:02,120
The PZ2 team is different than the Peggle2 team.

1103
00:47:03,461 --> 00:47:06,262
Destiny is different than Halo.

1104
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:07,903
And even by studio, right?

1105
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:14,052
Producers go into a studio with no portfolio.

1106
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:18,155
So one of the people actually hired me at PopCup was here.

1107
00:47:18,275 --> 00:47:20,297
And he could only, well, I had nothing to show him.

1108
00:47:21,097 --> 00:47:25,401
If you're an artist, you have very concrete things

1109
00:47:25,421 --> 00:47:25,921
to show off.

1110
00:47:26,462 --> 00:47:27,343
You look at a portfolio.

1111
00:47:27,383 --> 00:47:28,864
One of the great things about the team I'm working on now

1112
00:47:28,904 --> 00:47:30,625
is I'm learning a lot about what makes a good animator.

1113
00:47:30,966 --> 00:47:32,047
It is, when they point it out, it's

1114
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:33,488
very obvious what makes a good animator.

1115
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:36,756
Engineers also maybe not have code samples,

1116
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:38,196
but they can walk through technical solves.

1117
00:47:38,997 --> 00:47:40,318
They can talk about systems they authored

1118
00:47:40,818 --> 00:47:42,459
or claim they authored on games.

1119
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:45,140
And designers can do the same thing.

1120
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:46,681
You go in with nothing.

1121
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:50,143
And that's something you have to live with and embrace,

1122
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:52,785
that every team is a time you have to prove yourself.

1123
00:47:53,585 --> 00:47:54,145
Don't forget that.

1124
00:47:56,226 --> 00:47:57,707
So I want to thank people for the feedback.

1125
00:47:58,448 --> 00:47:59,408
All the teams I've worked on.

1126
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:04,481
Especially in the last few years at PopCap and Bungie have taught me innumerable things about production.

1127
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:08,644
I've learned more in the last three years than I have the rest of the time in the game industry.

1128
00:48:09,544 --> 00:48:13,887
Richard had me give a talk at PAX. Brian, Laura are people I work with now,

1129
00:48:14,447 --> 00:48:16,488
and they've really talked, they've given me feedback on this talk.

1130
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:20,751
I ran this through with Mike Soden and Mark Scattergood. I've stolen ideas from all of you,

1131
00:48:22,312 --> 00:48:24,113
and that's okay because I've credited you.

1132
00:48:25,281 --> 00:48:26,302
And to you, thank you.

1133
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:29,365
The act of actually writing this talk

1134
00:48:29,845 --> 00:48:31,387
has reminded me of the things I need to remember.

1135
00:48:31,427 --> 00:48:33,268
We all get caught up in how we build games

1136
00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:35,270
and hitting deadlines, and we don't think enough

1137
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,811
about what we're doing and why we're doing it.

1138
00:48:37,552 --> 00:48:41,396
I read somewhere that the act of talking about a problem

1139
00:48:42,056 --> 00:48:43,457
and then actually writing it down

1140
00:48:43,578 --> 00:48:45,199
changes the neurochemical outcome.

1141
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:49,279
outcome of your brain and it impacts your memory differently.

1142
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,661
And the act of writing this talk has helped me redefine some of the things that I've been

1143
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,161
thinking about.

1144
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:56,001
So thank you for coming.

1145
00:48:58,242 --> 00:48:58,482
That's it.

1146
00:48:59,082 --> 00:48:59,922
So I have time for questions.

1147
00:49:07,684 --> 00:49:08,844
Does anyone have any questions?

1148
00:49:08,884 --> 00:49:09,945
You can come talk to me afterwards.

1149
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:10,105
Yeah.

1150
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:10,205
Sure.

1151
00:49:12,145 --> 00:49:12,265
Sure.

1152
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:12,705
Thank you.

1153
00:49:18,577 --> 00:49:18,897
Yeah.

1154
00:49:33,089 --> 00:49:34,331
I think it's always really good.

1155
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,513
I think that's an area actually I sometimes.

1156
00:49:38,948 --> 00:49:40,489
So the question is, what about positive meddling?

1157
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:42,150
When your team hits a milestone,

1158
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,811
they've ground through something hard,

1159
00:49:44,872 --> 00:49:45,472
do you want to meddle?

1160
00:49:46,313 --> 00:49:47,734
Of course, I wouldn't call that meddling.

1161
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:48,914
I think that that's rewarding people

1162
00:49:48,934 --> 00:49:50,095
in recognizing their effort.

1163
00:49:50,896 --> 00:49:53,737
Meddling, I think, is too many cooks in the kitchen

1164
00:49:53,777 --> 00:49:54,638
sort of thing, right?

1165
00:49:55,499 --> 00:49:57,760
The idea is to let the team work and know when to back off.

1166
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,642
And it's hard because I would imagine

1167
00:50:00,682 --> 00:50:01,863
most producers here are pretty assertive

1168
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:03,824
and they want to help fix things and we're problem solvers

1169
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:05,405
and we want to get in there and prove

1170
00:50:05,425 --> 00:50:08,707
that we're worth the head count.

1171
00:50:10,113 --> 00:50:11,293
That's the kind of meddling I'm talking about.

1172
00:50:11,353 --> 00:50:12,513
I think rewarding a team,

1173
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:14,534
and that's actually something I think I wish I were better at,

1174
00:50:14,634 --> 00:50:16,374
and I've had managers who have been really good

1175
00:50:16,394 --> 00:50:17,574
at recognizing work.

1176
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:19,875
PopCap used to have a thing where they would give

1177
00:50:20,555 --> 00:50:21,895
a $100 gift certificate to people

1178
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:26,976
who have really shown exceptional leadership and effort,

1179
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:28,977
and you could nominate anybody on the team for that.

1180
00:50:29,657 --> 00:50:31,157
So those are things that I think are really valuable

1181
00:50:31,177 --> 00:50:31,997
in a team culture.

1182
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:33,657
People like to be thanked.

1183
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:35,298
They like to be recognized.

1184
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:37,798
They don't need money or bonuses, although that is good.

1185
00:50:39,259 --> 00:50:42,819
just the recognition in front of your team is great.

1186
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:44,899
We used to do a sprint demo at PVC2,

1187
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:47,520
and we used to, at the end of the two weeks,

1188
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,400
we'd get everyone in front of the monitors,

1189
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,960
and we'd run through what everyone worked on.

1190
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:54,061
And I was worried that people would seem to think it was cheesy.

1191
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:56,361
But after everyone's demo, they would clap.

1192
00:50:56,661 --> 00:50:57,982
And I think people were really into it.

1193
00:50:58,142 --> 00:50:59,662
Like, they were really proud of their work,

1194
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:01,602
even the kind of curmudgeonly engineers, like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1195
00:51:01,922 --> 00:51:03,643
But they loved it. Like, they had to show off their work.

1196
00:51:03,663 --> 00:51:05,103
So I think the recognition is super important.

1197
00:51:07,543 --> 00:51:08,243
Any other questions?

1198
00:51:10,464 --> 00:51:11,224
Yes, hey.

1199
00:51:12,324 --> 00:51:14,305
Hi, I'm Russell Grain from Opaque Multimedia.

1200
00:51:16,165 --> 00:51:18,786
A lot of the time in smaller studios and that sort of

1201
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:22,226
stuff, the role of producer seems to get wrapped up with

1202
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,247
the role of team leader.

1203
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:29,228
And I was just wondering how you felt the in-depth or

1204
00:51:29,488 --> 00:51:32,368
almost excessive domain knowledge of some areas

1205
00:51:33,269 --> 00:51:34,389
interact with that role.

1206
00:51:36,909 --> 00:51:37,409
It's interesting.

1207
00:51:37,949 --> 00:51:38,630
When I got to PVC2.

1208
00:51:39,983 --> 00:51:41,644
There are two people I want to earn the trust of right away.

1209
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:44,545
It was the lead designer and the lead engineer.

1210
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:48,007
I don't want to say that no one else was important.

1211
00:51:48,047 --> 00:51:50,128
They were all important. I love you all, my children.

1212
00:51:51,669 --> 00:51:53,050
But those are the two people

1213
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,171
I want to earn the trust of right away,

1214
00:51:54,271 --> 00:51:57,212
because that was the person who told us what we were gonna do

1215
00:51:57,533 --> 00:51:58,533
and how we were gonna do it.

1216
00:51:59,134 --> 00:52:03,136
So in that sense, being a leader really means

1217
00:52:03,176 --> 00:52:04,717
about earning their trust and letting you...

1218
00:52:05,097 --> 00:52:07,298
letting them trust you to speak for them.

1219
00:52:08,773 --> 00:52:10,535
On small teams, I think that's equally true,

1220
00:52:11,116 --> 00:52:12,998
and you have to be comfortable with the fact

1221
00:52:13,018 --> 00:52:15,160
that you don't have domain knowledge over everything.

1222
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,502
I mean, I had opinions about design,

1223
00:52:16,562 --> 00:52:18,764
and sometimes I even had the relevant insights

1224
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:22,308
about engineering, but they were clearly

1225
00:52:22,388 --> 00:52:23,329
neither of those things.

1226
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:23,950
So...

1227
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:28,899
On small teams or large teams, you still have to earn that trust.

1228
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:33,545
People will look at you as an authority figure because you're the sort of repository of this

1229
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:34,086
backlog.

1230
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:34,807
You have a list.

1231
00:52:35,228 --> 00:52:38,932
You, in theory, are thinking about dates and all the things that the team shouldn't be

1232
00:52:38,993 --> 00:52:39,533
worried about.

1233
00:52:41,195 --> 00:52:43,759
Jason Booth said also, never do something that you can let a producer do.

1234
00:52:46,315 --> 00:52:49,156
which is true, actually.

1235
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:52,197
So even on small teams, I think that small teams

1236
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:55,839
require even more because there's more multiple hat wearing.

1237
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:59,040
Does that answer your question?

1238
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,822
I was also potentially concerned with how

1239
00:53:03,302 --> 00:53:05,323
someone who's had a lot of art experience

1240
00:53:05,403 --> 00:53:08,985
may inadvertently prioritize art above other things

1241
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:11,086
because they came from that art background.

1242
00:53:15,687 --> 00:53:19,009
That's true, and I think that's also one of the reasons why it's important to build relationships

1243
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,090
with multiple leads on the team.

1244
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,412
I have none of those backgrounds.

1245
00:53:23,432 --> 00:53:27,996
I mean, I was a programmer as a kid and did none of the—you know, I drew a little bit,

1246
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:28,836
but I'm not an artist.

1247
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:29,677
I'm not a programmer.

1248
00:53:29,697 --> 00:53:31,798
I did a little testing, but I'm not a QA guy.

1249
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:36,381
So I was pretty neutral, and I was very utilitarian about the relationships I needed to rely on

1250
00:53:36,441 --> 00:53:36,661
first.

1251
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:41,673
If you're an artist and you're a producer, I think that's a bias that you have to worry,

1252
00:53:41,993 --> 00:53:46,756
you have to work against, your own cognitive bias of, I tend to see things in my own worldview.

1253
00:53:47,076 --> 00:53:49,857
And you have to work to make sure you hear things that are not in your worldview.

1254
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:56,741
So having a relationship between yourself and disciplines that aren't in your wheelhouse

1255
00:53:57,141 --> 00:53:58,422
is probably extra important for them.

1256
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:02,224
So if that's your case, I'd tell that person to spend a lot of time with the design and

1257
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:02,825
engineering leads.

1258
00:54:06,302 --> 00:54:07,362
Yes, any other questions?

1259
00:54:08,303 --> 00:54:08,643
Yes, sir.

1260
00:54:08,963 --> 00:54:11,164
Hey, I had a question just with your background

1261
00:54:11,184 --> 00:54:13,045
and working with experienced developers,

1262
00:54:13,145 --> 00:54:14,946
you know, guys that have worked in the game industry for,

1263
00:54:14,966 --> 00:54:16,486
you know, 10 years or something.

1264
00:54:17,707 --> 00:54:20,148
Taking their feedback with how you're running your process

1265
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:22,869
on a specific project, and, you know,

1266
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,570
they might have a lot of opinions

1267
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:25,811
on how they want to run the project,

1268
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:27,191
but they don't really want to take the time

1269
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:28,932
away from their work to, like, sit in the meetings

1270
00:54:28,972 --> 00:54:29,532
and stuff like that.

1271
00:54:30,013 --> 00:54:31,773
Just curious about your experience with that

1272
00:54:31,793 --> 00:54:33,014
and how you handle those situations.

1273
00:54:35,037 --> 00:54:37,598
Now, that's the view is good from the cheap seats problem.

1274
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:42,280
I think it's important to be gracefully accepting

1275
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:42,980
of that feedback.

1276
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:45,861
Understand that there are things that they think

1277
00:54:46,062 --> 00:54:48,663
are maybe not addressed by what you're doing.

1278
00:54:49,003 --> 00:54:50,744
Maybe their solution isn't the right solution.

1279
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:53,705
And that's the part about accepting feedback

1280
00:54:53,725 --> 00:54:55,486
that is really personal,

1281
00:54:55,806 --> 00:54:59,447
because it feels like your domain is being encroached on.

1282
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:00,988
I mean, I got into an argument in public

1283
00:55:01,028 --> 00:55:02,409
on one of my dev teams with an engineer

1284
00:55:03,339 --> 00:55:05,901
argued with me about process, and I regret doing it in public.

1285
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:07,623
I mean, that was not a cool thing.

1286
00:55:08,864 --> 00:55:10,225
And I spent a lot of time with him

1287
00:55:10,345 --> 00:55:12,127
trying to figure out what his main concerns were.

1288
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:14,649
And his main concerns were, I don't like being told

1289
00:55:14,709 --> 00:55:15,630
what to do and when to do it.

1290
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,652
So once we understood that,

1291
00:55:18,872 --> 00:55:20,554
I had a much better working relationship with him.

1292
00:55:20,894 --> 00:55:22,996
So it's often not the main thing that they're talking about.

1293
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:24,377
Like, hey, you should do it this way.

1294
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:26,499
You should get at the underlying issue.

1295
00:55:26,939 --> 00:55:28,701
The underlying issue was they didn't want to be scheduled.

1296
00:55:29,561 --> 00:55:31,863
So they were put on work that wasn't as mission critical.

1297
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:34,309
And that worked out okay,

1298
00:55:34,649 --> 00:55:36,030
but I understood that they didn't like

1299
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,471
being held accountable to schedules.

1300
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:40,252
Yes?

1301
00:55:40,272 --> 00:55:40,312
Hi.

1302
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,493
woman in audience I was wondering

1303
00:55:43,513 --> 00:55:46,574
if you have any tips for when we get into crunch mode.

1304
00:55:47,194 --> 00:55:51,536
I find sometimes team members can get almost paralyzed

1305
00:55:51,636 --> 00:55:53,977
or, you know, they actually just don't function well at all.

1306
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:55,818
Do you have any tips for managing crunch mode

1307
00:55:55,858 --> 00:55:56,938
and keeping your team motivated?

1308
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,220
So I think the thing we did...

1309
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:07,231
when we crunched on PVC2, I remember, in fact,

1310
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:08,732
our lead producers in the room,

1311
00:56:09,112 --> 00:56:11,893
we went in a room and we really went over all the work.

1312
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,694
And we spent a lot of time cutting things.

1313
00:56:15,134 --> 00:56:17,095
And it was really actually useful for me

1314
00:56:17,135 --> 00:56:19,576
to have someone above me to come and say,

1315
00:56:20,656 --> 00:56:21,916
nope, is that really important?

1316
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:24,577
I was so close to the work, I had a hard time letting go of things.

1317
00:56:24,857 --> 00:56:25,758
And that happens also.

1318
00:56:26,218 --> 00:56:29,139
So we spent a lot of time, Mohan and Alan and I,

1319
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,201
going through a list of work and really whittling it down

1320
00:56:33,741 --> 00:56:35,402
to the point where everyone was really unhappy.

1321
00:56:35,782 --> 00:56:36,823
You know, Mohan walked out of there being,

1322
00:56:36,843 --> 00:56:38,164
oh shit, we cut all this stuff

1323
00:56:38,224 --> 00:56:39,125
and this would have been great.

1324
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:41,686
So, you know, they say in law,

1325
00:56:41,726 --> 00:56:43,087
like a good settlement is where both parties

1326
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:43,728
walk away unhappy.

1327
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:45,249
Like, we really cut stuff down.

1328
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:47,870
And only then do we bring the whole team in

1329
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:48,631
to look at the work.

1330
00:56:50,502 --> 00:56:52,784
And some of the work, people refused to let go of.

1331
00:56:52,844 --> 00:56:55,506
Things that were cut, some developers just took it personally and said,

1332
00:56:55,526 --> 00:56:56,367
I'm going to do it anyway.

1333
00:56:56,767 --> 00:56:57,968
That happened a few times on our team.

1334
00:56:58,388 --> 00:57:02,251
So I think you have to let them understand the goal, the deadlines,

1335
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:05,414
and that you as leadership have done everything

1336
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:08,557
you can to trim the work down to a manageable point.

1337
00:57:08,957 --> 00:57:11,499
Anything else, like you can pull chairs off of a, you can pull a.

1338
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:14,203
legs off a chair, but when you hit three,

1339
00:57:14,283 --> 00:57:15,664
you can't really take a leg away.

1340
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:17,066
So we were down to three legs.

1341
00:57:17,086 --> 00:57:18,767
This is the last stable thing we have.

1342
00:57:19,448 --> 00:57:22,151
If they trust you've done that and you crunch,

1343
00:57:22,251 --> 00:57:23,572
I think the team feels a lot better.

1344
00:57:23,592 --> 00:57:26,375
And I think the difference between a crunch and a death march

1345
00:57:26,395 --> 00:57:27,836
is a crunch has a targeted goal.

1346
00:57:27,896 --> 00:57:29,418
Like, I want to finish these three things.

1347
00:57:29,878 --> 00:57:31,640
A death march is a sort of interminable,

1348
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,502
I'm gonna work until I fall over.

1349
00:57:34,062 --> 00:57:35,383
And that drives people crazy.

1350
00:57:35,443 --> 00:57:37,525
I think when people have clear goals that they can get to

1351
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:39,847
that's achievable, not impossible,

1352
00:57:40,247 --> 00:57:42,289
the team is much more likely to rally around that

1353
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:44,710
than just work, you know,

1354
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:46,992
don't, you know, the EA spouse thing,

1355
00:57:47,032 --> 00:57:49,194
leave at, you know, 11 p.m.

1356
00:57:49,294 --> 00:57:51,716
or 9 to 11 or your core hours or something.

1357
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,638
That stuff is really morale-breaking.

1358
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:57,320
I think a good crunch is team-generated.

1359
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,561
We're gonna do this.

1360
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:00,802
I can't refuse to let the game ship without these things.

1361
00:58:01,183 --> 00:58:01,863
We're gonna take it on.

1362
00:58:03,716 --> 00:58:07,284
Externally driven crunch is really hard to mitigate the morale impact.

1363
00:58:08,005 --> 00:58:10,511
You can lessen it, but it's hard to mitigate that impact.

1364
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:20,112
I noticed you talked about the Eeyores on teams.

1365
00:58:20,452 --> 00:58:23,855
And I was just wondering if you could explain a little bit how

1366
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:26,817
you find that fine line of balancing your concerns

1367
00:58:26,877 --> 00:58:29,059
with what they're saying, which is probably very real,

1368
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,361
with them bringing the entire team down.

1369
00:58:31,381 --> 00:58:33,002
Because one of the things I had learned

1370
00:58:33,022 --> 00:58:35,264
throughout my personal experience in animation

1371
00:58:35,284 --> 00:58:38,967
and games is that negativity can be a real threat to your team.

1372
00:58:39,368 --> 00:58:41,349
But at the same time, you want to pay attention to that,

1373
00:58:41,409 --> 00:58:43,071
because a lot of those fears are very real.

1374
00:58:44,759 --> 00:58:48,301
One of the things we talk about is on our team, leads especially, should never be negative

1375
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:48,721
in public.

1376
00:58:49,521 --> 00:58:52,583
We often talk and bitch to each other about, oh my god, this is terrible, I can't believe

1377
00:58:52,603 --> 00:58:56,945
we're doing this thing, but you can't present those doubts to the team because the team

1378
00:58:56,965 --> 00:58:58,165
needs to be focused and locked down.

1379
00:59:00,466 --> 00:59:03,808
I think the EOR, it's one of those, it's like that Star Trek episode where the empath used

1380
00:59:03,828 --> 00:59:07,710
to take on the pain of the other person and let them go, take their pain away.

1381
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:09,793
and take it in.

1382
00:59:09,974 --> 00:59:12,235
I think that that's the thing you've got to do with these Eeyores.

1383
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,676
They've got to know that they can come to you.

1384
00:59:13,956 --> 00:59:16,058
This is the therapist's role of being a producer.

1385
00:59:16,438 --> 00:59:18,019
Talk to you about their concerns and their fears.

1386
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,282
Your job is to not fan them, but to think about them and listen to them.

1387
00:59:22,302 --> 00:59:26,846
I mean, the act of listening and taking them seriously is super valuable.

1388
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:32,204
And ultimately, it's a thing for you to go through

1389
00:59:32,704 --> 00:59:34,605
and see, well, what are these fears are founded?

1390
00:59:35,225 --> 00:59:36,746
And in general, I give wide latitude

1391
00:59:36,786 --> 00:59:38,166
to the domain expertise of people.

1392
00:59:38,746 --> 00:59:40,987
If a tech artist who's got to implement

1393
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:43,188
all the stuff coming together is concerned about something,

1394
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:44,948
I'm going to be concerned about it

1395
00:59:45,128 --> 00:59:46,889
because it's their work on the line.

1396
00:59:46,929 --> 00:59:48,790
They're the pig, quite literally.

1397
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,830
And their, you know, audio is like that, too.

1398
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,251
They come at the end, and they see everything.

1399
00:59:53,731 --> 00:59:56,692
So that's how I would deal with it.

1400
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,220
Anyway, I'm getting a time cut.

1401
00:59:58,902 --> 00:59:59,945
You can talk to me afterwards.

1402
01:00:00,025 --> 01:00:00,827
Thanks again for coming.

1403
01:00:00,867 --> 01:00:01,569
I really appreciate it.
