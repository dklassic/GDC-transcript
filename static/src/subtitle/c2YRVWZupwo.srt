1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,302
I'm Kim Swift and I was a level designer and the team lead on Portal.

2
00:00:05,762 --> 00:00:08,363
And I'm Eric Wilpaugh and I was a writer on Portal.

3
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:15,145
So we're here to talk to you today a little bit about our techniques for integrating narrative and design

4
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:20,087
sort of phrased as a portal post mortem giving examples of what we particularly did.

5
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:26,696
So, in case you're wondering, post-mortem means we will be talking about stuff that's

6
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:27,136
in the game.

7
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:30,498
So if you haven't played the game and you're one of those people that gets all squealy

8
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:34,981
and upset, you know, whenever someone tells you something that you hadn't heard about

9
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:39,304
a game, then, you know, you might want to leave the room, you know, or not.

10
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:39,904
That's my two.

11
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:50,850
So here's what we're going to try and cover to be a first of all, I'm going to make a real brief case of why you should care about anything we're going to tell you.

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:01:02,252
Secondly, I'm going to go real quickly into our narrative philosophy, which is sort of our crackpot theory of how gameplay and narrative should be combined.

13
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:09,574
And third of all, we're going to talk about how we took the crackpot theory and tried to apply it to our development process.

14
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:14,877
So in particular, why should you care about how we did this on Portal?

15
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:20,280
Well, first of all, we had a really small team with about only 10 people at once working

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,761
on the game.

17
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:23,222
It usually was anywhere between like five and seven.

18
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:28,185
And it's been pretty popular and, you know, for a surprise.

19
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:32,688
And despite the game being kind of unorthodox.

20
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:38,331
So after all is said and done, we actually don't really have any regrets, unlike this

21
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:38,631
poor guy.

22
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:50,962
So, you know, now, why would you care about how we put together our narrative and design?

23
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:57,426
So, by itself, our story wouldn't really make a whole great novel.

24
00:01:57,626 --> 00:02:00,188
You know, don't get me wrong, the dialogue's just really, really funny.

25
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:03,210
He's probably about the funniest manual ever made, just in case you were wondering.

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,452
Set in a bar pretty high for the talk.

27
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:06,492
Sorry about that.

28
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,854
Nothing funny.

29
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:13,577
See, there's no ad living now from a point of view.

30
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:21,603
And on its own, the gameplay, it'd be alright, but honestly, a little on the dry side, honestly

31
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:25,725
it would be a race to see which one would fail the fastest on its own, but because

32
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:30,147
we had a really tight integration of both our story and our gameplay, it seemed to

33
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:32,508
really resonate with people and, you know, it worked.

34
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,254
Like Kim said, our team size kind of imposed a lot of constraints on our design choices.

35
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:45,539
So, our design methods from the beginning had to be low impact on both our time and energy budgets.

36
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,303
But this kind of helped us creatively sidestep a lot of our constraints.

37
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:54,286
For instance, Gladys being a disembodied voice.

38
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,254
might not have actually occurred to us if we'd had a ton of animators and a ton of resources

39
00:03:00,294 --> 00:03:04,199
to make her a little robot buddy that followed you around or something, and yet it kind of

40
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:09,965
turned out to be just the perfect solution to the narrative and portal.

41
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:14,370
So here's a crackpot theory.

42
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:17,774
The idea is that games tell two stories.

43
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:22,735
There's a story story, which is sort of the sum total of the game's dialogue cutscenes.

44
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:30,657
And then there's the gameplay story, which is the story described by the actions the player takes in the game world.

45
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:37,919
And if you lower the delta between those two stories, the closer you put them together, the more satisfying your game will be.

46
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,439
Or at least that was our theory.

47
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:46,466
There's a lot of games that I think suffer from a high-story Delta, but since the Game

48
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:50,290
Developers Conference, if I run down a lot of them, it's going to be like super dick

49
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:50,611
moves.

50
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,893
So I'm not going to do that.

51
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:54,334
I don't really want to die today.

52
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:59,279
Yeah, I'm going to mention one game that I actually like a lot, so it should be non-controversial.

53
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,220
It's also kind of old.

54
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:07,147
is Clive Barker's Undying, which is a first-person shooter that was released like six years ago.

55
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:12,730
And it's a good shooter, and regardless of what you may think about his style, Clive Barker,

56
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,632
and that's him wearing super scary pair of pants.

57
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:23,657
He's a talented writer who actually, in interviews, I think seems to care a lot about the story in his games.

58
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:36,612
So, Clyde Barker's on Dying. You play this World War I war hero who goes to Scotland to visit the castle of one of your war buddies.

59
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:43,218
And the castle is sort of infested with ghouls, and you're shooting a lot of monsters and

60
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:45,339
there's a lot of death and destruction all around.

61
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,582
But pretty frequently as you're going through the mansion, the game all of a sudden stops

62
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:55,045
to play one of these cutscenes where you sort of calmly interrogate one of the members

63
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:55,685
of the staff.

64
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:58,927
You know, you're sort of, you know, what do you do, how are you doing, how are you feeling,

65
00:04:58,967 --> 00:04:59,548
stuff like that.

66
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:08,313
Meanwhile, at no point does your character just grab the help by the label and say, you know, like there are monsters five feet around that corner

67
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:14,736
killing everyone they come across, you need to run. Now, the two stories make absolutely no sense when you smush them together.

68
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:24,600
An idea, or I'm dying, is one of the first times that I remember a good game sort of being undermined by a disconnect

69
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,222
between the story the gameplay was telling and the story the story itself was telling.

70
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:35,824
So, with all that in mind, our fundamental portal narrative design goal was that the

71
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:40,505
story story would never ever intrude or contradict the gameplay story.

72
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:43,866
For us, the less was always more, and we were ruthless about it.

73
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:48,127
We were ruthless about trimming the narrative fat, tightening our belts, and then trimming

74
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:48,767
it even more.

75
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,128
Portal was going to be a lean storytelling machine if it killed us.

76
00:05:52,588 --> 00:05:56,949
And usually it meant killing me, because it was a lot of good lines that had to get

77
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:57,209
cut.

78
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:58,530
And we're really sorry about that.

79
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,310
It was worth it.

80
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:03,012
So, enough about how we feel about games,

81
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:04,773
like let's talk about how we practically

82
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:05,613
applied these feelings.

83
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,334
First of all, we're gonna talk a little bit

84
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:08,774
about our playtesting process,

85
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:10,555
which by the way, in case you were wondering,

86
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:11,415
it's really important.

87
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,697
Second, reflecting story in your environment.

88
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:17,678
Next, evolving narrative out of gameplay,

89
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:18,979
and then again, vice versa,

90
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:20,779
evolving gameplay out of narrative.

91
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:27,682
So, playtesting is probably the most important thing we ever did on Portal.

92
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,883
You know, actually sit down and watch people play your game.

93
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:36,625
Don't just, you know, have some other company playtest the game and then send your report

94
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:37,165
afterwards.

95
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:42,887
It's, you know, just not going to be as valuable to you as just sitting down, having someone

96
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:46,708
play your game, and you watch them and see how they react to it.

97
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,709
You can find out what your players actually want by watching them.

98
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,772
In the case of Portal, we adjusted our gameplay to what players looked like they needed.

99
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:56,912
Did they need more training?

100
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:58,793
Because clearly they were really confused here.

101
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:03,256
You know, maybe they needed more reinforcement of what we trained them on.

102
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,637
Because they wanted to use those new skills.

103
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:14,282
And in addition to that, we also adjusted our story to enhance essentially what our players were feeling at that time.

104
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:21,351
Yeah, and frequent play tests help keep us objective about our design decisions.

105
00:07:22,312 --> 00:07:26,417
Watching play tests is a great way to expose pretty quickly what isn't working.

106
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:31,583
One rule we had narrative-wise was, at the end of a play test, we would ask play testers

107
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:31,923
to just...

108
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:36,129
Tell us the portal story back beat by beat and if they couldn't tell it to us

109
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:42,134
We took that as a real clear sign that they just weren't interested that we were failing and the fix for it

110
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:49,960
Almost always was just to cut more story cut more exposition. It usually meant cutting something that initially seemed

111
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:55,585
Essential to the story and as it turned out it just made it stronger every time we cut something

112
00:07:56,546 --> 00:08:00,369
Says something about the writer. Yeah, I'm sorry

113
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,695
Another thing is, playtest early and often, on the far side there, you can see what the

114
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:10,279
first room in the game actually looked like, you know, maybe a couple weeks into development.

115
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:14,622
And then on the other side, you can see what it finally shipped, you know, as.

116
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:22,791
And we literally started testing this room the first week that we got to Valve and started working on the game.

117
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:28,395
We hacked portals together in some horrible way, but we're glad it doesn't exist anymore.

118
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:34,240
And we were already making better decisions about what our levels were like.

119
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,482
So I don't know, it's kind of hard to make out.

120
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:42,587
But in the first picture, there's kind of like this shimmery force field, which was the original cage for the player.

121
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:47,853
And we got rid of this pretty quickly because our playtesters just didn't understand what it was.

122
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:53,878
They would walk up to the forest field and they were wondering why they couldn't walk through it.

123
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:58,121
So they would just trace the edge of the cage five times and get really confused.

124
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,304
So we changed it to glass just to fix that problem.

125
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:06,685
So not only did our play testing help us

126
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:08,785
get a better narrative and get better gameplay,

127
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:10,726
it also helped us refine our art direction.

128
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:14,147
As you can notice in the later picture,

129
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:16,467
it's a lot cleaner, it's a lot simpler.

130
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:19,008
We extracted any of the elements

131
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:21,749
that didn't really have any relevance to the player

132
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:24,850
and it really helped us teach the players

133
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,650
what they needed to know.

134
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:34,378
So, as just kind of a digression, I labeled this slide advice because this is the only

135
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:38,040
one I'm fully behind as advice of anything we're going to say today.

136
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,541
This is actually good advice.

137
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:47,184
If you're writing a funny game, first of all, God help you because it's unpleasant because

138
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:53,087
tough guy dialogue is just about as macho the 50th time you hear it as the first time,

139
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:56,168
whereas funny dialogue is funny once, maybe.

140
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,774
About three years ago, I worked on a game called Psychonauts that I helped write back there.

141
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:09,920
There's more people clapping than bought it.

142
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:20,689
Now I lost my train of thought, working at Psychonauts, Double Fine, oh, so Double Fine

143
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:26,992
is kind of structured, everybody sits in one big room, there's 40 people maybe, sitting

144
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:32,556
in one big room, and it's, you know, the two and a half years that I was there, no game

145
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:35,758
development, it's 12 hours a day, six, seven days a week.

146
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:41,101
And so I've had to sit there in the middle of this pit of people working on Psychonauts

147
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:46,684
hearing my supposedly funny dialogue blaring out of 40 monitors to just brim stony silence.

148
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:56,089
And it was just, it was torture, it was psychological torture for me because Tim wisely had his own

149
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,870
office somewhere where you didn't have to hear the brim stony silence.

150
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:08,017
So, yeah. This is you writing a funny game, you are going to exist in a black cloud of

151
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:13,301
despair for however long it takes you to make the game. But, so here's the advice.

152
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:21,251
Trust your instincts, try and remember your initial reaction, people's initial reactions

153
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:25,593
to seeing it and, you know, do whatever you can do to not despair.

154
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:31,415
But the first part, the part that helped us a lot, again, on Portal, is play tests.

155
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:36,957
The more often you play test, the more often you actually get to see someone, hear in your

156
00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:39,058
dialogue, seeing the game for the first time.

157
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:44,960
And it's honest to God, whatever the benefits of play testing are for the design team, for

158
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,801
a writer.

159
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:51,365
But it is the only way really to maintain your sanity during the two or three years

160
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:52,606
that's going to take you to make the game.

161
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:53,207
Or Prozac.

162
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:53,907
Yeah.

163
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:55,068
And all, yeah.

164
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:56,049
Medication.

165
00:11:56,729 --> 00:12:02,834
So another thing we tried to do when we had to cut exposition was to, if we didn't want

166
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:06,436
to cut it all together, was to try and embed exposition in the environment.

167
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:19,784
When we were initially talking about it, we had some e-mail ideas for embedding an e-mail and we were actually using e-mail to talk about putting an e-mail and at some point we discovered that reading e-mail wasn't actually that fun.

168
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:25,447
Did you enjoy reading that last e-mail? I was like, no, it wasn't that exciting. We probably shouldn't have put it in the game.

169
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:31,833
So that was one of our rules, and the idea was try and be creative about reflecting

170
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:38,039
and storing the environment, and again, easy to say be creative, but if you apply a ruleset

171
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:42,022
and then you're ruthless about the rules, it's amazing how creative you can get in a

172
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:47,307
big hurry if it's a choice between coming up with some novel way to embed your exposition

173
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:49,489
to the environment and simply cutting it all together.

174
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:54,732
So what we did in Portal, at least one of the things we did, was to have these little

175
00:12:54,752 --> 00:12:57,073
wall scribblings in the behind-the-scenes areas of the game.

176
00:12:57,613 --> 00:13:01,174
And honestly, these were really quick and easy to do, like they really only took like

177
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:02,154
one or two days tops.

178
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,035
And they were pretty effective at telling a story.

179
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:08,776
So here's an example of the room.

180
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:12,677
And you know, I'm going to show you a little bit of what I'm going to show you today.

181
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:13,299
Put yourself in the position of your characters.

182
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,460
What would they do in the situation of the game?

183
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,642
So in this case, we had this idea for a character

184
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:20,922
that we called the Ratman.

185
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:25,065
And he was supposed to be a fellow escaped test subject,

186
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,646
just like you, and he's a little loopy.

187
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:31,768
And we originally wanted you to actually meet this NPC

188
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:35,370
at some point in the game, but we had two artists.

189
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:38,372
It wasn't really feasible.

190
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:44,195
So rather than just sort of cut our back story on this guy, we decided to manifest

191
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:45,195
him here in these rooms.

192
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:52,399
So I asked myself if I was trapped inside an insidious facility bent on my destruction

193
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,760
run by a homicidal AI, what would I do to pass the time?

194
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,433
So, another big tool we used was to try and evolve our narrative out of gameplay.

195
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:07,697
Like Kim said, we tried to write to enhance what playtesters were feeling,

196
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:11,339
which required me to try and keep the story as wet as possible.

197
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,384
A big, big hurdle to overcome to just not get attached to any piece of writing.

198
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:21,107
And, yeah, because it was just going to disappear at any given time,

199
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,629
and we'd have to think up something else.

200
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,491
And the same goes for gameplay, too.

201
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,732
Don't get too attached to anything.

202
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:28,933
You might need to cut it, and it's probably for the best.

203
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:34,116
So here's an example of that, like the way to companion cube.

204
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:37,618
So we're going to talk about this first from a game design

205
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:40,539
standpoint of one day we sat down and decided

206
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,561
we wanted to make what we called the box marathon level.

207
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,622
So where essentially you've got your cube at the beginning

208
00:14:46,062 --> 00:14:47,943
of the map, and then you take it all the way through to the end

209
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:49,584
of the map, and put it on a button.

210
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,385
It's supposed to be a big, long obstacle course.

211
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:56,932
So the first thing that we tried was having sort of this moving platform, you know, over

212
00:14:56,972 --> 00:15:01,377
a goo pit where you'd have to stand on it with your box and avoid stuff, kind of similar

213
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:03,780
actually to the last test chamber that we shipped.

214
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:08,725
And you know what? It pissed players off, like, to no end.

215
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:14,949
They would end up destroying the box by dropping it in the goo, and they'd get really annoyed because they had to go back to the beginning of the map,

216
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:19,331
and, you know, they didn't really want to carry this stupid thing with them everywhere.

217
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,412
So we went back to the drawing board.

218
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:27,696
The first thing we did was remove the moving platforms over the goo, you know, so you couldn't destroy the box,

219
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:33,239
and we added more gameplay events where having the box is necessary for you to solve the puzzle.

220
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:43,725
So here's a couple examples. One side there you can see that we use the cube to kind of make a dynamic set of stairs there to get up those platforms.

221
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:54,571
And then on the other side, it's a puzzle where you have to put the box on one of these buttons and then go stand in another button and get this energy ball through those doors into a catcher thing.

222
00:15:55,512 --> 00:16:00,156
And these work pretty well in terms of making players at least somewhat take the box with

223
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:05,700
them and not hate it, but players were still kind of forgetting it.

224
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,503
They'd leave it at one puzzle and then go to the next puzzle and go, oh crap, and then

225
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:11,424
have to go back to the beginning and grab their box.

226
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:19,329
So we said, okay, maybe if we redesign this room so that way you're always kind of facing

227
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:20,630
this button and taking a look at it.

228
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,512
So that worked pretty well, at least, to remind players, by the way, you need this at the

229
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:26,112
end of the map.

230
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:34,277
But, you know, we needed something else, like players really weren't getting that attached to the box and there were still a few people that would kind of forget it behind.

231
00:16:34,357 --> 00:16:37,699
And so, Eric to the rescue over here.

232
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:46,983
Though as much as possible we tried to, you know, put hints for our players, you know, in the environment, whether it be through lighting or geometry.

233
00:16:47,363 --> 00:16:52,926
You know, when all else fails, great dialogue really was a great tool for us to give a hint to the player.

234
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:59,792
Yeah, I've been reading, luckily, these declassified government interrogation manuals, and one

235
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,253
of the things...

236
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,994
They're awesome.

237
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:02,655
I recommend them.

238
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:03,636
They put it up on them.

239
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:05,297
They're really cool.

240
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:12,844
But one of the things they talked about was that isolation leads interrogation subjects

241
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:16,087
to start becoming attached to inanimate objects.

242
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:18,670
And kind of just something clicked.

243
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,711
It was like, well, you're sort of alone this whole time.

244
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:26,134
And maybe if Plattus psychologically

245
00:17:26,194 --> 00:17:28,535
needles you a little bit, you know, it would work.

246
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,696
And crazily, I mean, they know what they're doing.

247
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,517
They're government interrogation specialists.

248
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:33,077
They were right.

249
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:34,198
Yeah, it totally worked.

250
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,278
It's super duper work.

251
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:38,260
No one ever forgot their box after we put in that dialogue.

252
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,740
That's for sure.

253
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:41,702
And sort of as an afterthought, you know,

254
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:43,522
we put these pink hearts, they're so pretty,

255
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:46,583
on the cube, just to kind of cue back to the dialogue,

256
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,124
there's something special about this box

257
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:49,784
and you should take it with you and take care of it.

258
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,965
Yeah, that worked.

259
00:17:53,345 --> 00:17:57,447
And honestly, this was a really great thing for us

260
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,687
just because it had a dual function

261
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,828
as far as the ending of this map went.

262
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,409
And the first thing is, well,

263
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:11,463
At the time that we were finishing up this map, we were also working on our ending boss battle,

264
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:13,447
and we had settled at the time on...

265
00:18:14,574 --> 00:18:18,155
just disintegrating these little parts of Gladys.

266
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:21,636
And we had an incinerator in the map,

267
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:23,716
and we didn't train our players.

268
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:26,297
So obviously they had no idea what they were doing,

269
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:28,857
and they'd have to press the switch

270
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:30,278
to open up the incinerator,

271
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,858
and they completely ignored it,

272
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,138
and then they would wander around the room

273
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,359
and then get really angry at us.

274
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,739
So we obviously had to train this somewhere,

275
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,980
and we had a great idea of where to put the training.

276
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,381
Yeah, originally, up until almost the last minute,

277
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:46,702
at the end of the companion cube level,

278
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:49,623
you just had to just leave the companion cube.

279
00:18:49,643 --> 00:18:51,643
You had to abandon it because you couldn't bring it with you

280
00:18:51,683 --> 00:18:52,504
into the elevator.

281
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:55,865
And Gladys made some reference to it being euthanized.

282
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:58,245
And it was sort of sad, but it wasn't really

283
00:18:58,265 --> 00:18:59,986
a good ending to the level.

284
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:04,127
So putting the incinerator there and having you

285
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:08,348
be forced to euthanize it was just an awesome way to end it.

286
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,816
and and in addition to that it was also a great place to train the player

287
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:17,044
because there is no stress there is no pressure for the stress of killing

288
00:19:17,185 --> 00:19:18,267
well yeah it was a little stressful

289
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:25,433
But more like, you know, there was nothing shooting at you or, you know, they didn't have a clock ticking down, like, oh my god, I've got to do this in 10 seconds.

290
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:34,556
And we did that because, well, players do not learn anything when they're completely stressed out, like, they just won't absorb anything.

291
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:37,937
So putting the training there was pretty good.

292
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:44,638
Also, it provided a really great point to our narrative as well, because, you know,

293
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,624
you get to incinerate Gladys the same way she made you incinerate your best friend.

294
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:55,370
The whole companion cube saga was just a really great example of how the gameplay kind of

295
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,214
influenced the story which then turned around and influenced the gameplay.

296
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:04,980
Okay, so having said all that about how it's gameplay, gameplay, gameplay, no narrative,

297
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:11,605
we did reach a point where we discovered that gameplay wasn't really working by itself.

298
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:15,948
And this was the original ending of Portal.

299
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,872
Honestly, the biggest obstacle to us when making Portal was our ending boss battle.

300
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,553
You know, we look at other games, okay, we know what a boss battle will look like in

301
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:33,655
a first person shooter or an RPG, but what in the world is a boss battle going to look

302
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:35,835
like in a weird environmental puzzle game?

303
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:40,717
Yeah, the first thing you'd think, or at least the first thing we thought was that the boss

304
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:44,298
monster for a puzzle game should be a deviously complex puzzle.

305
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:46,979
And that sort of innocuous sounding conclusion

306
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:50,780
really just gave us a lot of headaches and pain.

307
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,402
So we're gonna show you a few examples

308
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,343
of some things that we tried as boss battles

309
00:20:57,543 --> 00:20:59,943
and eventually abandoned for one reason or another.

310
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:03,785
So the first one that we tried was James Bond lasers.

311
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:11,512
So, literally, they were big giant lasers that would follow the player around trying

312
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:15,636
to zap them, and obviously we cut this.

313
00:21:17,258 --> 00:21:19,620
Here's, I know, aren't they pretty, isn't that nice?

314
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:25,666
These are training maps that we had for the James Bond style lasers.

315
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:31,333
where essentially you'd have to place your portal in front of the laser and then place

316
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:35,057
one on a wall and then redirect the laser at that weird orange thing sitting in that

317
00:21:35,097 --> 00:21:35,597
glass wall.

318
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:41,324
and, you know, break through and be able to get to the other side where you would meet

319
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:41,725
Gladys.

320
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:44,947
That's Gladys there in her giant shimmery cube face.

321
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:47,189
Don't you love temp art?

322
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:48,090
It's great stuff.

323
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:54,655
And once again, you'd have to redirect those lasers at those, you know, which you find

324
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:57,378
out are orange plugs supplying Gladys with power.

325
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,960
And you know, the end.

326
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:03,403
Yeah, it was not good.

327
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,244
The lasers were extremely boring to dodge

328
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:07,785
and kind of difficult to tune

329
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:10,165
because we would make them follow the player kind of fast

330
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:11,406
and then it would be unfair

331
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:14,587
and if we slowed them down, then they're boring.

332
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,188
They were also really difficult to aim,

333
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:18,648
believe it or not, through a portal.

334
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:19,509
It was kind of a pain.

335
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,149
And it was also hard to tell

336
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:22,770
if you were hit by the lasers too,

337
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,471
so we abandoned this idea

338
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:28,071
and instead chose to use a rocket launcher.

339
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:36,403
So the second attempt that we had was portal combat.

340
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,926
Um, sorry, I had fun with Photoshop one day.

341
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:52,869
So, you know, we had a lot of players, you know, test our games that were hardcore first-person shooter players.

342
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:57,651
So they were like, we need more action and you need to jump around and be a crazy portal ninja.

343
00:22:57,731 --> 00:22:59,951
And so we were like, yeah, okay, sure, we'll get a shot.

344
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,437
And, you know, it didn't really work out very well.

345
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,804
Here's a picture of a level that we actually shipped in the game.

346
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:10,729
And this is what it originally looked like.

347
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,691
So this was supposed to be the first time

348
00:23:13,731 --> 00:23:14,672
that you would meet Gladys,

349
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:17,453
and you can see that there's a rocket launcher there.

350
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:18,614
We had put it in at that point.

351
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:20,655
And you would have to redirect your portal,

352
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:24,697
redirect the rockets and use your portals

353
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:27,238
to shoot Gladys in the face.

354
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,660
But then that's Gladys, yeah.

355
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,780
She's a bunch of roller mines.

356
00:23:32,762 --> 00:23:35,943
So this was, yeah, it was okay.

357
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:42,230
But we then made it a little bit more complex, so she would rise to the top of this room

358
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:46,275
and then all of these little pillboxes would pop open with turrets in them

359
00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:51,180
and the rocket launcher was still on and you'd have to try and redirect the laser and hit her again.

360
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:57,246
And all the meanwhile the turrets are firing at you, the rocket launcher is firing at you and just not fun.

361
00:23:58,449 --> 00:24:01,891
So, yeah, the high-intensity gameplay sucked.

362
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:07,173
In fact, it sucked so bad that I'm talking when you're supposed to be reading this, is that true?

363
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:07,914
No, no, it's all right.

364
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:10,475
But anyway, I'll finish it. It sucked. It was bad.

365
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:14,597
It sucked so much, I'm not gonna let Kim talk about it, but it sucked, because I hated it so much.

366
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:21,240
No one paid attention to Gladys, any of her dialogue, because there's just way too much stuff going on.

367
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,162
And we had playtesters who'd come in who were sort of hardcore counter-striker shooter fans,

368
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,806
and they were able to wring a little bit of enjoyment out of it,

369
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:35,252
but the vast majority of our playtesters who had sort of gotten used to the slower-paced cerebral nature of Portal

370
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:43,519
were just frustrated and confused and dissatisfied, which was absolutely not the way we kind of wanted to send them out the door.

371
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:48,444
So, the final attempt was to have a chase sequence.

372
00:24:53,688 --> 00:24:55,489
And that's Gladys there as the kitten.

373
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:58,270
Isn't she cute?

374
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,611
So here's kind of what that looked like.

375
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,912
This is actually a continuation of the previous section,

376
00:25:03,113 --> 00:25:05,594
where Gladys would rise up to the top of the ceiling.

377
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,174
Well, after you hit her with the second rocket,

378
00:25:07,194 --> 00:25:10,516
she'd rise up even more and would zoom down this hallway.

379
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:17,764
And you would actually have to follow her by flinging a couple times and getting up into this hallway.

380
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:25,572
Honestly, the pacing was just horrible because players wouldn't necessarily see where she would go.

381
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:29,717
They didn't know where they were going, so they would wander around for a while, and

382
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:33,858
they'd eventually realize, oh, I don't think I've been there before, and, you know, kind

383
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,879
of get up there.

384
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,400
But, you know, if it's a chase sequence, it's supposed to be action-packed, you're supposed

385
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,982
to be going, going, going, and, you know, instead players are just wandering around confused.

386
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:52,146
And then, once you actually got up into this hallway, we wanted to make it seem like, oh, Gladys had sprung some sort of trap and to kill you.

387
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:59,128
So we had all these pistons kind of like break out of the walls and, you know, try and crush you or, you know, block you from getting further.

388
00:25:59,848 --> 00:26:03,289
And we also, you know, had these turrets and stuff pop down from the ceiling.

389
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:06,830
And if you actually played the game, you can see that these hallways are kind of similar to what we shipped.

390
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,531
And we took a lot of stuff out because...

391
00:26:11,032 --> 00:26:16,895
Yeah, this, I'm going to bother reading down, this failed in every way it's possible for a level like that to fail.

392
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:25,059
It had bad pacing, players didn't really know what was going on, was glad us making the pistons come out at you,

393
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:32,422
and every solution we came up with to try and fix those were either too expensive for us to do or just made the gameplay even worse.

394
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:37,826
So a complex boss battle, yeah, it didn't work.

395
00:26:38,726 --> 00:26:40,647
And the thing that we actually learned from all this

396
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:43,528
was that the more complex that we made our puzzles,

397
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,310
the slower the pacing actually got,

398
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,631
because players would have to stop and think

399
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:49,911
about what they were gonna do next.

400
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:54,894
And if you watch an action movie and you get to the climactic sequence, there's something

401
00:26:54,954 --> 00:26:55,934
happening all the time.

402
00:26:56,534 --> 00:27:02,516
And in our game, when we wanted it to be climactic because we made everything more complex, it

403
00:27:02,936 --> 00:27:04,857
did the opposite thing than what we expected.

404
00:27:05,877 --> 00:27:13,560
So it's funny to us now, but we were desperately screwed at this point because episode 2 was

405
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,120
winding up.

406
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,101
T.F., after 10 years, was going to beat us out.

407
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:23,136
And, you know, the episode two guys are running around,

408
00:27:23,156 --> 00:27:24,876
they're like, our final battle is going to be

409
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:27,197
100 striders, and you're going to be driving a car

410
00:27:27,237 --> 00:27:28,757
and running into little mini striders.

411
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:31,257
They're like, what are you guys doing?

412
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:35,578
Like, it's a secret.

413
00:27:35,598 --> 00:27:38,659
So, but again, once again, our old friend PlayTesting

414
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:39,239
helped us.

415
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,760
There was a point, and I don't know why we didn't realize it

416
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,740
earlier on, but there was one piece of feedback

417
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,761
that we were getting, that there was a point in the game

418
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:50,042
that PlayTesters felt, excuse me,

419
00:27:50,922 --> 00:27:53,283
was both climactic and satisfying.

420
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:54,843
And it's the fire pit.

421
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:58,824
It happened about 2 thirds of the way through the game.

422
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:03,225
The testing proper, the regular testing.

423
00:28:03,285 --> 00:28:06,106
Well, I'm going to take a drink of water.

424
00:28:06,606 --> 00:28:09,666
It's almost over, and Gladys is kind of talking you out.

425
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:13,147
You're riding this platform into a fire pit.

426
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:17,430
And you eventually, you escape out of here.

427
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,831
But playtesters were just consistently telling us,

428
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:23,953
not only was this dramatic and exciting,

429
00:28:24,493 --> 00:28:26,854
they kept telling us that it was actually like,

430
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,835
it was a really tough puzzle that I felt super satisfied

431
00:28:29,935 --> 00:28:33,977
to solve, which absolutely made no sense to us.

432
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:34,377
Because,

433
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:34,577
yeah.

434
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:50,990
Yeah, I know, it's a good thing.

435
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,452
Portal, Portal 2 is just going to be this picture over and over.

436
00:28:54,472 --> 00:29:02,576
When it comes right down to it, at that point in the game, that's about the easiest puzzle in Portal.

437
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:09,020
You place a portal on the wall next to the fire pit, and then you place one in the safe area, and you just hop through it.

438
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,120
That's it.

439
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:15,184
So we then had to sit down and reflect.

440
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,946
Like, what in the world made this so climactic?

441
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:21,268
And one of the things that we learned was that, well,

442
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:22,328
it had time pressure.

443
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:24,329
You know, there was only a limited amount of time

444
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:25,370
while you're on that platform

445
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,711
before you're gonna get burned alive

446
00:29:26,871 --> 00:29:28,952
to place your portals and escape.

447
00:29:31,074 --> 00:29:37,438
I think I've said before, you know, time pressure makes people think something that is a lot more complicated than it actually is.

448
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:45,882
Another thing was it had a really high visual impact. I mean, you can't really go wrong with a platform heading straight into a giant pit of fire for visual impact.

449
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:51,625
And, you know, it's something that our players have never seen before in the game, and so it's, you know, something new.

450
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:55,809
is also a dramatic high point, because for the first time,

451
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:59,551
Gladys is pretty openly trying to kill you.

452
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:05,074
And also for the first time, you're able to assert a little bit of control over your environment and escape from her.

453
00:30:05,835 --> 00:30:11,698
And like Kim was saying, all of those three things combined made it so that an easy puzzle

454
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:15,500
was sort of feeling like a much more complicated puzzle.

455
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:20,804
which allowed us, led us to the realization that we've been holding on to this idea

456
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:24,647
that we needed a complex puzzle at the end and it simply just wasn't true.

457
00:30:25,948 --> 00:30:28,489
So here's what we actually shipped in the game is Boss Battle.

458
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:31,890
You can see Gladys there with her little personality spheres.

459
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,551
And then next to her was a hatch where a rocket launcher would pop up.

460
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:40,493
And you'd have to reorient the rockets and hit Gladys, take one of those spheres,

461
00:30:40,853 --> 00:30:47,075
and then put it in the incinerator by getting to the activation switch with your portals,

462
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:49,555
and then getting back to the incinerator and tossing it in.

463
00:30:49,956 --> 00:30:50,816
The end, done.

464
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:57,341
So, taking the four lessons we learned, this is how we applied them to the final claddus battle.

465
00:30:57,381 --> 00:30:58,582
First of all, it was time pressure.

466
00:30:59,803 --> 00:31:04,647
We were ourselves under some time pressure, so instead of getting fancy, we actually just had a timer

467
00:31:04,707 --> 00:31:06,428
counting down to something that would kill you.

468
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:12,553
And we decided that thing that would kill you would be some neurotoxin, because it was also really cheap

469
00:31:12,613 --> 00:31:14,214
just to make a green particle system.

470
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:18,997
You laughed, but it's seriously true.

471
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:19,318
Yeah, 100% true.

472
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:24,043
So, you know, visual impact.

473
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,484
Well, on one side of the screen, you know, on the far side over there,

474
00:31:27,425 --> 00:31:30,988
you can see a piece of concept art that an artist at Valve, Jason Braschel,

475
00:31:31,168 --> 00:31:32,309
did for us. Thanks, Jason.

476
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:35,851
And on the other side there, you can see what we actually shipped.

477
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:38,854
So everything in this room visually is pointing at Gladys.

478
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:41,776
You know, got the geometry of the stairs leading up to her,

479
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,137
got all the lights pointing at her.

480
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:48,100
But you know, after all this time of hearing Gladys heckle you and harass you, you know,

481
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,861
we wanted to make this room have some serious impact.

482
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:56,642
And you know, I think it did its job pretty well, and you know, it's not like any other

483
00:31:56,682 --> 00:32:01,023
room in the game, and so I think it really gave players a sense of satisfaction.

484
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:07,485
And then in terms of a high dramatic moment, putting some time pressure.

485
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:13,492
to the puzzle, made it so that I only had to write, like, six minutes of decent dialogue,

486
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:19,798
which is in stark contrast to all our previous attempts, which required me to write infinity

487
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:22,740
minutes of excellent dialogue.

488
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,002
Which makes Eric crack.

489
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:28,426
Yeah, that was a bad time for me, writing the infinity minutes of dialogue.

490
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:35,012
And finally the easy puzzle, you know when all of a sudden done portal is a puzzle game

491
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:39,935
but all the things that we learned led us back towards you know we need to simplify this

492
00:32:39,955 --> 00:32:45,159
puzzle so adding time pressure and then you know having it be a very dramatic room and

493
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,282
have a lot of really interesting points made by Gladys, scaling back the puzzle allowed

494
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:53,064
players to really absorb this moment and have a good time.

495
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:59,852
And, you know, honestly, at least for me, there's nothing more frustrating than getting

496
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:05,637
to the finale of a game and not being able to beat that stupid boss battle and see the

497
00:33:05,677 --> 00:33:09,800
ending of the game, which, in our case, we really wanted people to see or rather hear.

498
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:23,659
So, we wanted to leave players, you know, with a real sense of satisfaction, and, you know, scratch that.

499
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:28,442
We wanted players to feel genuinely happy and leave the game with a smile on their face.

500
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:35,845
So, yeah, we sat down and kind of made a list of what makes people happy, and then we kind of made a list of what we could put in a game,

501
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:38,346
and then put it into Excel, and PivotTable, and...

502
00:33:38,707 --> 00:33:44,590
The catchy song kind of floated to the top and this is Jonathan Colton who we got to

503
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,611
write our catchy song.

504
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:47,372
Who is wearing his best hat by the way.

505
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:54,596
And so you know when all of a sudden a lot of this actually came out of our constraints.

506
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:59,738
We had a small team, we had a limited amount of time and frankly we just couldn't make

507
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:08,003
a giant FMV epic finale of Doom and the cost to happiness ratio of putting a song over

508
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:09,904
some scrolling text was really high.

509
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:20,463
So, the moral of the whole thing for us was just try to fully embrace your constraints as fuel for creativity.

510
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:26,928
Honestly, without the constraints that we had, I truly believe Portal would not be as good a game as it turned out to be.

511
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,972
And in addition to that, you know, have faith in yourself, have faith in your writing,

512
00:34:32,713 --> 00:34:37,535
and in the skills of your team, because they're your best resources, you know.

513
00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:43,439
And once again, play test, play test, play test, and when you're done with that, play

514
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:48,361
test some more, because honestly, you will get the most valuable information for your

515
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:52,163
game out of watching your play test, and it'll make for a better player experience in the

516
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:52,343
end.

517
00:34:52,363 --> 00:34:57,086
That's it.

518
00:34:57,646 --> 00:34:57,866
That's it.

519
00:35:10,787 --> 00:35:14,810
So we deliberately kind of kept our top short because, you know, we kind of assume people

520
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,791
had questions because we keep getting asked questions.

521
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:21,154
And so, you know, we wanted to just kind of make our point and then leave the floor open

522
00:35:21,174 --> 00:35:23,115
to you guys to, you know, ask us whatever you want.

523
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:24,956
So questions?

524
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:28,739
You?

525
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:29,819
Is there a microphone?

526
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:33,022
Oh, okay. Okay, fine.

527
00:35:33,062 --> 00:35:33,943
Can you hear me okay?

528
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:34,283
Yeah.

529
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:34,523
Yeah.

530
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:44,127
Okay, so my question is you touched earlier on not using emails for voice recording for like, like, story segments in your environment.

531
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:49,949
Um, and, you know, we're most probably, I think, however, a lot of successful games use this a lot.

532
00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:52,891
Most notably Resident Evil and most recently Bioshock.

533
00:35:53,212 --> 00:35:54,273
And they're all bad games.

534
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:55,414
Next question.

535
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:55,514
No.

536
00:36:10,093 --> 00:36:13,995
Oh, yeah, I have no idea. None of these are actually prescriptive.

537
00:36:14,075 --> 00:36:17,857
You know, go for it if you want. It was just a personal choice we made.

538
00:36:17,997 --> 00:36:23,440
I think it can work out just personally. I don't like to read that much.

539
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,322
I don't like to read in-game. I mean, I like to read books.

540
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:30,544
But when I'm in a game, I just want it to kind of happen and we not have to read that much.

541
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:34,047
And Eric, we had been talking about this before, and Eric made a really good point, which was,

542
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:38,331
You know, how often do you use a voice recorder to leave secret messages for your friends

543
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:38,791
and family?

544
00:36:38,811 --> 00:36:39,792
Well, I mean, yeah, that's the thing.

545
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:43,174
These futuristic games, there's always like, oh, we're in the future, and everybody's

546
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:44,275
leaving messages on PDAs.

547
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:50,600
I can go buy PDA for $8 at Best Buy now, and nobody's using it to deliver messages to me

548
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:50,900
ever.

549
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,141
So, yeah, we just...

550
00:36:52,581 --> 00:36:57,544
So that's our own personal hangup with those two things, but I think they're fine in games.

551
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:00,328
Uh, guy standing at the mic?

552
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:01,788
Oh, there's people at the mic.

553
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:04,930
This isn't plugged in, so if I start standing here anyway, it would look like a good place to stand.

554
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,452
Yeah, it's a great place to stand, gotta say.

555
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:13,255
I wanted to ask this question because I thought it was exactly the type of thing that I think of Eric normally really against.

556
00:37:13,977 --> 00:37:18,919
Why does Gladys have an incinerator in her room other than just in her room?

557
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:21,161
There's actually kind of a funny story.

558
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:26,924
So the question was, why does Gladys have an incinerator sitting in her room?

559
00:37:27,805 --> 00:37:30,706
And the answer is actually kind of fun.

560
00:37:32,388 --> 00:37:37,130
Like, we were talking sort of like a backstory, and they're one of, like, so they created

561
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,751
this giant AI, and they weren't really sure at Aperture Science if she was going to go

562
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:46,813
out of control, so they made this room so that way, you know, if she did completely

563
00:37:46,853 --> 00:37:49,533
lose her mind, they could, you know, incinerate her and get rid of her.

564
00:37:50,494 --> 00:37:55,437
There's a red phone in there that is supposed to be, there was a guy who, that was his job

565
00:37:55,457 --> 00:37:59,379
to sit there and call somebody, if it looked like the AI was going rogue, and then they

566
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:02,841
come and throw it in the thing, and it sadly didn't work.

567
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:07,543
It really was bad by aperture science, they're sort of half geniuses, half morons, so.

568
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:18,574
So you mentioned playtesting as a really critical step, but also not outsourcing it to another group.

569
00:38:18,934 --> 00:38:25,180
How do you go about selecting and acquiring a steady supply of new players throughout your process?

570
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,882
How did you guys go about doing that?

571
00:38:27,102 --> 00:38:32,227
So the question was, how did we go about getting new playtesters all the time to playtest our game?

572
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,452
Do you know how easy it is to go walk out to the nearest GameStop and say,

573
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:39,874
hey, we've got this game, do you want to come play it?

574
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:43,296
And I mean, yeah, it's just like, yeah, of course.

575
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:47,799
And also we had friends and family come in and play tests.

576
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,260
Gabe's kids actually play tested for us.

577
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,501
You want me to say something?

578
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:54,383
Oh, just in Valves, there's a lot of people working at Valves

579
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,544
who are kind of heads down on their own projects.

580
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,745
So we had a lot of people who could just come in,

581
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:00,866
you know, from other parts of the company as well.

582
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:05,898
And did you ever have people come back for like additional tests or was it sort of a

583
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:09,927
you test once and that's all the useful information.

584
00:39:10,232 --> 00:39:12,272
So the question was, do we have people come back

585
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:13,072
and playtest again?

586
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:16,353
Usually we would have people playtest once,

587
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:20,535
but we had a few playtesters, mainly at Valve,

588
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:24,036
who seemed to really like Portal and were stubborn,

589
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,576
so they wouldn't really get frustrated easily,

590
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,737
so when we would have a puzzle that we wanted to try out

591
00:39:28,777 --> 00:39:30,097
that was really, really rough,

592
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:32,738
and we just wanted to see if the concept was good,

593
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:34,539
we would usually grab one of those guys

594
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,299
and have them sit down and chug through it.

595
00:39:40,918 --> 00:39:49,162
In the developer commentary, you said there will be more portal games, and obviously your

596
00:39:49,182 --> 00:39:55,244
first couple of sides show you're having a lot of success, and when that happens you

597
00:39:55,264 --> 00:40:01,727
get a lot of resources, you won't be a little tiny team, so what kind of, are you afraid

598
00:40:01,787 --> 00:40:07,830
or how will you overcome the challenge of not having as many constraints, and next year

599
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:08,950
you have to say the question.

600
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:14,432
Oh, so how will we make a next portal if there is one?

601
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:19,954
How can we keep some of our design philosophies if we have a lot more resources?

602
00:40:20,414 --> 00:40:21,074
It's a good question.

603
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:21,734
I don't know.

604
00:40:21,754 --> 00:40:23,174
I'm scared to tell you the truth.

605
00:40:23,194 --> 00:40:24,955
I know how it's going to work.

606
00:40:25,395 --> 00:40:29,076
I'm trying to just bask in the moment now about people bugging me about the next one.

607
00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:33,537
Let me enjoy it for one minute.

608
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:37,038
No, but seriously, I don't know.

609
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,501
I, yeah, I don't know.

610
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:53,572
A little bit of a personal flashback for me, but as I remember toward the end of Narbacular

611
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:58,336
Drop, there is a puzzle where you're required to

612
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:05,879
to aim through one of the doorways and put a portal on the wall on the other side in

613
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:16,201
essence to shoot through, which was very elegant as a way of pushing the mechanics of the game

614
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:19,062
to its limit, I suppose.

615
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:27,444
And I noticed, of course, that in Portal, you chose for one reason or another not to

616
00:41:27,504 --> 00:41:29,464
allow the player to fire the...

617
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:32,350
the portal gun through one portal.

618
00:41:33,814 --> 00:41:37,375
I can think of a couple of reasons why you might have done that, but I was just wondering

619
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:45,496
if it was for technical purposes or as part of a larger idea of some sort.

620
00:41:45,696 --> 00:41:51,198
So the question was, so in our Baccalaureate Drop, we gave players the ability of being

621
00:41:51,238 --> 00:41:58,039
able to shoot one portal through another portal, and we decided to not do that for portal,

622
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,120
not because it was technically technology-wise impossible.

623
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:06,304
but more for a design purpose, like, you know,

624
00:42:06,744 --> 00:42:09,467
we wanted players to learn something in particular

625
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,610
in a certain level, and so giving the players

626
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,212
suddenly the ability to bypass all the training

627
00:42:15,252 --> 00:42:17,955
that we had tried so hard to construct

628
00:42:18,155 --> 00:42:20,657
and, you know, just seemed like

629
00:42:20,797 --> 00:42:22,619
shooting ourselves in the foot, essentially.

630
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:38,275
In the first trailer for a portal, the portals seemed to have sort of an almost liquid quality to them.

631
00:42:38,655 --> 00:42:40,396
Now they're more like holes in the wall.

632
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:47,220
Also, they were a blue and a red part of the portal, and now it's a blue and an orange one.

633
00:42:49,702 --> 00:42:51,803
What triggered this change?

634
00:42:52,725 --> 00:42:56,927
So the question was, why did we change the look and color of our portals?

635
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:03,752
Well, honestly, we went through just a bunch of just iterations and as far as blue and

636
00:43:03,812 --> 00:43:08,455
orange goes, you know, we liked orange better than red.

637
00:43:08,475 --> 00:43:13,178
I mean, it really just boils down to that, like, we liked the color choice better in

638
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:18,982
the end and, you know, we left it sort of up to our artists, like, you know, what do

639
00:43:19,022 --> 00:43:20,142
you want the portals to look like?

640
00:43:22,204 --> 00:43:26,925
and the liquid quality, and it was kind of like they were rippling at the edges.

641
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:34,067
Yeah, so I think what you're referring to as far as the liquid quality of how the portals were looking was

642
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:40,068
that was an opening shader for it, and we just decided to change it.

643
00:43:41,149 --> 00:43:43,309
Honestly, it just sort of, we decided one day.

644
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,211
I just wanted to leave a comment.

645
00:43:47,231 --> 00:43:49,812
I just want to thank you guys for the end of the turret level.

646
00:43:50,332 --> 00:43:54,394
The most satisfying thing that I felt in that game was picking up that last turret and walking

647
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:58,336
into the elevator to the field and watching it just turn into a ball of ash.

648
00:43:58,796 --> 00:44:00,037
I want to thank you guys for that.

649
00:44:00,297 --> 00:44:01,397
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

650
00:44:01,877 --> 00:44:04,959
Yeah, we also really like the way they screened too.

651
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:13,555
So I have a question. I'm a student and you guys started out as an indie developer.

652
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:18,517
So I'm just wondering if you have any suggestions for students and what not

653
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:22,819
who are hoping to get into the game industry and break in like you guys did.

654
00:44:23,481 --> 00:44:28,405
So the question is, do we have any advice for student developers on how to break into

655
00:44:28,425 --> 00:44:28,906
the industry?

656
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:35,411
Make games, make as many as you can, and fail, because honestly failing, you'll learn a lot

657
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:35,912
of stuff.

658
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:39,996
Like, I can't tell you how many times we've failed on our game designs working at DigiPen.

659
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:43,999
Like, yeah, one of them worked out, but you know, we had three others that were not the

660
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:44,700
best games ever.

661
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,404
And honestly, you can't tell me how many times you've failed on our game designs, but you

662
00:44:47,824 --> 00:44:49,105
Practice makes perfect, right?

663
00:44:49,185 --> 00:44:52,407
So the more things that you have on your resume

664
00:44:52,487 --> 00:44:55,188
and your portfolio to show to game developers that,

665
00:44:55,248 --> 00:44:56,929
look, I did all these projects,

666
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:58,470
I worked on them from start to finish,

667
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,992
it obviously shows that I have commitment to the project,

668
00:45:03,072 --> 00:45:03,313
right?

669
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:06,995
So make games, like whether it be a mod

670
00:45:07,215 --> 00:45:11,377
or a student project, just make as many as you possibly can

671
00:45:11,757 --> 00:45:12,878
and have fun with them.

672
00:45:13,698 --> 00:45:13,938
Thank you.

673
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,164
So when I spoke to people that also played

674
00:45:19,204 --> 00:45:21,486
portal about the fire pit puzzle, one of the things

675
00:45:21,506 --> 00:45:23,087
that we talked about a lot was the fact

676
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:26,069
that we felt like we had broken the game somehow

677
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,071
by escaping like this final ending,

678
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:31,474
and that there was this moment of sort of shock and confusion

679
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:34,456
about what to do next when you suddenly had gotten past

680
00:45:34,496 --> 00:45:36,498
what you imagined was the game's end.

681
00:45:36,998 --> 00:45:38,500
And that was a very powerful moment in the way

682
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,601
that it defied conventional game narrative.

683
00:45:40,661 --> 00:45:42,623
So I'm wondering if that, I don't know,

684
00:45:42,144 --> 00:45:45,466
that defying a conventional game narrative was something that was intentional

685
00:45:45,806 --> 00:45:48,508
in the design of the level, or whether that was just something that

686
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,689
that was an accidental occurrence from what you set up.

687
00:45:51,169 --> 00:45:53,791
Honestly, that was one of the very first things...

688
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:54,531
I've written the question.

689
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,031
Oh, sorry.

690
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,952
Oh, I forgot the question.

691
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:59,274
I was just going to talk about it.

692
00:45:59,714 --> 00:46:05,837
No, was it intentional the sort of way that you feel maybe like you've broken the game

693
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:07,358
after the fire pit?

694
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,082
And I guess there was some unintentionality there because that's one thing that virtually

695
00:46:13,142 --> 00:46:13,943
never changed.

696
00:46:14,703 --> 00:46:20,326
The beats as far as you start in the relaxation ball at some point during the game, although

697
00:46:20,366 --> 00:46:24,648
I think maybe it was earlier in the game at one point, you escape the fire pit and then

698
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:26,969
you would eventually meet Gladys, was in there before...

699
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:33,454
anything. I mean, the test levels with no dialogue basically had that structure, just

700
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:38,438
because we had this intuitive feeling that it would work, and it just ended up working

701
00:46:38,578 --> 00:46:45,242
better than we thought. So we can take some credit for it, but not total credit. It just

702
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:45,963
worked really well.

703
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:53,630
So, when I first heard about Portal, I went and played Narbacular Drop really thoroughly,

704
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:56,513
and when I played Portal, I noticed there were a lot of similarities.

705
00:46:56,853 --> 00:47:01,237
The one big difference was that Portal had all this humor, a profound amount of humor in it,

706
00:47:01,257 --> 00:47:05,160
and I was wondering what the decision was, how you decided to throw in the comedy.

707
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:09,604
So the question is, why did we decide to throw in comedy for Portal,

708
00:47:09,664 --> 00:47:11,545
because Narbacular Drop really wasn't that funny.

709
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:20,374
And, you know, there's something inherently funny about portals, like, you know, especially,

710
00:47:20,394 --> 00:47:23,436
you know, you put one of them, like, both of them on the floor, and you drop a box,

711
00:47:23,516 --> 00:47:27,179
and you see it, like, popping out back and forth, like, there's something kind of funny

712
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:31,622
and visceral about it, and, and, well, honestly, Eric's really damn funny.

713
00:47:31,923 --> 00:47:37,367
Yeah, well, I mean, given a choice, that was kind of in my comfort zone, like, if my task

714
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:38,968
at Bow was to write...

715
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:46,653
stuff for Portal. If nobody was going to object, I would just make it funny, because that would be

716
00:47:46,673 --> 00:47:48,574
something I was more likely to succeed at.

717
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:49,994
Because you like despairing?

718
00:47:51,055 --> 00:47:51,375
Yeah.

719
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:56,517
Hi. I have no problems harvesting Adam from Little Sisters.

720
00:47:57,057 --> 00:48:00,819
I love kicking innocent bystanders to bloody pulp in lots of games.

721
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:04,700
But why, why, why, why did you have to kill off the companion Q?

722
00:48:08,863 --> 00:48:10,864
So why did we kill off the companion cube?

723
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:14,245
Well, I think we explained that in the speech, didn't we?

724
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,186
You can thank the United States Secret Service.

725
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:21,948
Actually, I don't think it was a Secret Service.

726
00:48:22,148 --> 00:48:24,729
I'm a secreter than the Secret Service.

727
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:26,750
I have two questions, and the second one's quick.

728
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,891
The first one is, it sounds like there's

729
00:48:28,911 --> 00:48:31,292
a lot of trial and error and rework that went into Portal.

730
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:34,773
Did you have to do anything to smooth that over with management,

731
00:48:35,393 --> 00:48:36,894
set their expectations or anything like that?

732
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:43,937
So the question is, there's a lot of trial and error with the game, obviously, and did

733
00:48:43,957 --> 00:48:48,079
we have to convince our management that that was perhaps a good idea.

734
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:54,522
And honestly, the way management works at Valve is a lot different than it does at other

735
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:55,142
game companies.

736
00:48:55,162 --> 00:48:56,703
We don't really have producers there.

737
00:48:58,003 --> 00:49:01,004
We have team leads that basically, you know...

738
00:49:01,645 --> 00:49:04,747
maybe do like administrative stuff every once in a while and do some PR.

739
00:49:05,248 --> 00:49:09,430
But, you know, honestly, the people working on the game get to make the decisions about the game

740
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,412
and have direct impact on what they're working on.

741
00:49:12,632 --> 00:49:16,214
And, you know, we've found that it just makes for a much more, you know,

742
00:49:16,814 --> 00:49:19,716
satisfied group of people making games.

743
00:49:20,256 --> 00:49:20,756
Fantastic.

744
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:26,460
Also, like the playtesting, the commitment to playtesting wasn't our insight.

745
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:26,760
That's...

746
00:49:27,762 --> 00:49:34,547
That's the valve philosophy. That's how they make games. If we hadn't done that, then we would have been in deep trouble.

747
00:49:34,668 --> 00:49:40,152
Okay, fantastic. Second question. Is Glados still alive? And when will we see her again?

748
00:49:43,256 --> 00:49:45,117
So the question is, is Gladys still alive?

749
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,558
And when will we see her again?

750
00:49:47,238 --> 00:49:49,520
Well, did she not listen to the last song?

751
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,681
The song is called Still Alive.

752
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:56,164
That's kind of a failure of writing if you don't know that she's still alive.

753
00:49:56,204 --> 00:50:00,367
It tends to be 100% still alive, thank you.

754
00:50:00,827 --> 00:50:02,908
And as far as when you'll see her again, who knows?

755
00:50:04,391 --> 00:50:12,060
Alright, hi. I had a question about your development background and how you guys scored yourself like an awesome seed by working with Val.

756
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:17,106
So, were you still making a question?

757
00:50:17,366 --> 00:50:17,927
Well, no, go ahead.

758
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:19,108
Oh, okay. So the question is...

759
00:50:19,128 --> 00:50:21,431
How do you guys score yourself like a position to work with Val?

760
00:50:22,474 --> 00:50:27,217
So the question was, how did we end up, like, hooking up with Valve to make Portal?

761
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:33,280
So, as far as, like, the team goes, with the exception of Eric, we were all students at

762
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:37,563
DigiPen Institute of Technology, and we created a game called Neurobacular Drop, which was

763
00:50:37,803 --> 00:50:40,465
our student project for our senior year.

764
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:48,188
It was, you know, the predecessor to Portal, you know, you had two portals on the wall and it was an environmental puzzle game.

765
00:50:49,009 --> 00:50:52,450
And every year, Digipent has an expo for graduating seniors.

766
00:50:52,690 --> 00:51:00,552
And Valve came by, took a look at our project and thought it was interesting enough to drag us over to Valve and have us present the game to Gabe Newell.

767
00:51:01,332 --> 00:51:04,593
And after about 15 minutes through our presentation,

768
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:11,776
told us to be quiet and then asked us what we were planning on doing after we

769
00:51:11,796 --> 00:51:16,197
graduated. We were like well hopefully you know paying a loan, getting a job,

770
00:51:16,818 --> 00:51:25,240
eating food and you know he offered us a job on the spot essentially to come in

771
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:31,602
and create portal using a source engine and you know that's how we ended up

772
00:51:31,642 --> 00:51:33,523
there and and Eric's got a different story.

773
00:51:33,964 --> 00:51:39,670
Yeah, I worked, I'd been just doing a lot of writing and then I went and I worked at

774
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:44,275
Double Fine for a couple of years and then I left Double Fine and I was just back to

775
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:48,580
freelance writing and for me it was just I got a mail one day from Gabe Newell and said

776
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,382
do you want to come work at Val?

777
00:51:54,442 --> 00:51:59,366
I have another quick question, why didn't you guys submit this to IGF?

778
00:51:59,486 --> 00:52:00,807
It seems like a perfect candidate.

779
00:52:02,128 --> 00:52:05,150
Was it the reason you guys got picked up by Valve?

780
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:10,756
So the question was, why didn't we submit the game to IGF?

781
00:52:11,597 --> 00:52:14,959
So Narbacular Drop actually was in the IGF student showcase

782
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,921
three years ago.

783
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:20,483
The Japan submits the games that they find

784
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:24,086
to be interesting to student showcase and the IGF.

785
00:52:24,146 --> 00:52:28,750
We didn't make the indie professional section,

786
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,051
but we made it to the student showcase.

787
00:52:31,832 --> 00:52:32,072
Thank you.

788
00:52:34,805 --> 00:52:37,667
Hi, how did the element of cake come into fruition?

789
00:52:39,108 --> 00:52:41,609
So the question is, how did the element of cake

790
00:52:41,669 --> 00:52:42,510
come into fruition?

791
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,412
It kind of started off as like an inside joke.

792
00:52:45,512 --> 00:52:47,733
I mean, really, it just was one of those things.

793
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:50,935
I think originally when we sat down to you guys were showing

794
00:52:50,975 --> 00:52:53,556
me the game, there was something about cake in there.

795
00:52:53,596 --> 00:52:57,419
And it just seemed like it's a comedy tool, obsess over one

796
00:52:57,479 --> 00:53:00,180
thing that maybe you wouldn't expect to obsess over.

797
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,062
And we just, it really didn't have any deeper meaning than

798
00:53:03,102 --> 00:53:03,302
that.

799
00:53:03,664 --> 00:53:05,244
Yeah, we were just kind of having fun.

800
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:08,606
Yeah, fun work, work fun.

801
00:53:08,646 --> 00:53:10,167
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

802
00:53:10,508 --> 00:53:11,748
We were working very hard.

803
00:53:12,409 --> 00:53:12,949
And having fun.

804
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:15,530
You're turning out to be sarcastic, it was hard working.

805
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:17,372
Yeah, no, no, it was hard working.

806
00:53:17,452 --> 00:53:18,012
I'm awesome.

807
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:18,452
Alright.

808
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:19,913
Jeez.

809
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,754
The conference is turning ugly.

810
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:26,142
Hi guys, two quick questions.

811
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:31,005
First, was there any reasoning behind making all the characters

812
00:53:31,165 --> 00:53:34,668
and the references in GLaDOS quotes and such female?

813
00:53:35,728 --> 00:53:37,790
So the question is, why did we decide

814
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,851
to make our characters female, GLaDOS,

815
00:53:39,971 --> 00:53:41,192
and the main character?

816
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:44,775
So as far as the main character goes,

817
00:53:46,196 --> 00:53:47,717
Gabe actually made a suggestion one day.

818
00:53:47,997 --> 00:53:50,559
We were at the time looking to find

819
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:56,322
what we wanted to be the main character or protagonist of Portal.

820
00:53:57,062 --> 00:54:00,223
And you can see some of our earlier shots of the game.

821
00:54:00,263 --> 00:54:03,764
There's like a balding dude as the main character.

822
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:04,864
And that was just 10-part.

823
00:54:04,904 --> 00:54:08,825
Like it was something that we used a citizen model from Half-Life 2

824
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:12,425
and just kind of fixed them up a little bit and put them in just for our testing purposes.

825
00:54:13,046 --> 00:54:17,447
But anyways, Gabe came up to us while we were looking to figure out

826
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,447
what we wanted our main character to be and said,

827
00:54:19,487 --> 00:54:20,587
well, why don't you make it a girl?

828
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:21,087
And we're like...

829
00:54:21,588 --> 00:54:26,170
Alright, sure. I mean, it really didn't stretch beyond that, the sort of little, what-if.

830
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,190
Okay, why not?

831
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:31,112
It's like post-feminist. It didn't even occur to us not to make it a girl.

832
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:34,354
No big deal.

833
00:54:34,474 --> 00:54:40,056
And as far as glados, well, there was the awesome glados pun, which kind of made it seem like we had...

834
00:54:40,116 --> 00:54:44,498
It had to be female, but really, we knew an actress, I mean, casting is hard,

835
00:54:44,758 --> 00:54:48,000
because we knew this person was going to have to carry the game, so we needed an actress...

836
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,301
Or an actor.

837
00:54:50,222 --> 00:54:56,564
or actor, actor or actress, who A, was good, and B, wouldn't be offended when, you know,

838
00:54:56,584 --> 00:55:01,326
the first third of our recording sessions were just us playing her text-to-speech and saying,

839
00:55:01,886 --> 00:55:05,527
say this exactly like that back to us, because actors say that sort of thing.

840
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:10,109
But she was super nice about it. And so that kind of informed that.

841
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:15,751
Okay. And the other one is just to officially shut my friend up. Is cellist high board?

842
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:20,820
No, another failure of writing. Chell is not a cyborg.

843
00:55:21,141 --> 00:55:26,229
There's no, she's not a cyborg. That was those ridiculous cheese things.

844
00:55:26,249 --> 00:55:26,870
Cyber shoes?

845
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:27,932
Yeah, her future shoes.

846
00:55:32,841 --> 00:55:34,622
Hey, this might have already been addressed at some point,

847
00:55:34,662 --> 00:55:36,363
but I got in late, so I have to ask anyways.

848
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:38,944
Obviously, Portal was a very short game

849
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:42,046
that met a lot of very popular success.

850
00:55:42,466 --> 00:55:45,688
Do you think this might start making a movement back

851
00:55:45,748 --> 00:55:48,809
towards the idea of shorter games being on the market?

852
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:50,530
I mean, right now, the huge pressure

853
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:54,992
is everybody wants 20 plus, 30 plus, 40 plus hour games,

854
00:55:55,072 --> 00:55:58,714
because everyone wants to get as much out of the game

855
00:55:58,774 --> 00:56:01,235
as they possibly can for what they're

856
00:56:01,255 --> 00:56:02,256
paying out of their wallet.

857
00:56:03,217 --> 00:56:10,560
Yeah, I mean, I, oh sorry, do you think Portal would influence more developers to make shorter

858
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:15,603
games because according to the questioner, people want longer and longer games, although

859
00:56:15,683 --> 00:56:21,886
I'm not 100% sure about that. You know, everybody at Valve, all the people I know who play games

860
00:56:21,906 --> 00:56:23,587
who are adults now, the...

861
00:56:24,608 --> 00:56:29,071
common complaint is they never finish a game. Nobody ever finishes a game that I know who

862
00:56:29,131 --> 00:56:34,394
is in 14. They don't have time and also they have 40 hours a week to play World of Warcraft

863
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:44,040
2. That's a year gaming time. So there are some practical constraints on how long we

864
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:49,223
are going to make it, but if we could have done anything, I really wanted to make a game

865
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:57,933
Pete everybody who played it would be able to finish you know you'd be able to it's weird to be playing these games are trying to tell a story in a game where

866
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:03,779
Almost everybody it just sort of peters out you know you just stop playing at some point and never finish it right

867
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,301
Thank you very much

868
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:14,285
Hello, two-part question. The first part is, you mentioned that a lot of dialogue had been cut from the game.

869
00:57:14,906 --> 00:57:21,510
I was wondering if any of it had gotten recorded and or put through the process of being somewhat final for Gladys.

870
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:27,133
And if so, is there any chance you could release it on one of your websites?

871
00:57:27,253 --> 00:57:33,397
Because as a member of the portal mapping community, we would give our ITs to have extra Gladys dialogue.

872
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:42,886
So, the question was how much of final dialogue got cut and could we release it?

873
00:57:43,066 --> 00:57:47,769
So, it wasn't a lot of final dialogue, virtually everything went through the text to speech

874
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:50,812
as temp audio and a lot of it got cut.

875
00:57:51,374 --> 00:57:57,439
at that point. And some of the stuff that got cut, a lot of it I'm just not super proud of,

876
00:57:57,499 --> 00:58:03,084
so I wouldn't want to give it to anybody. And if it is good, I'm going to use it somewhere else.

877
00:58:05,486 --> 00:58:07,808
Not to be mean?

878
00:58:07,908 --> 00:58:11,731
Yeah, not to be mean, but probably the chances are somewhat slim.

879
00:58:12,652 --> 00:58:13,873
I had to try. Thank you.

880
00:58:16,617 --> 00:58:21,361
My question is, were there any considerations for making a multiplayer or cooperative experience?

881
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:27,306
So the question was, were there any considerations for making Portal a co-op or a multiplayer game?

882
00:58:28,106 --> 00:58:29,067
Yeah, we thought about it.

883
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:35,191
Actually, I don't know if we ship this or not, but we played around for a little while

884
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:38,533
actually having multiple sets of portals, and it is technically possible.

885
00:58:39,913 --> 00:58:45,195
We just didn't really have the time to think through what would the gameplay be that was

886
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:45,495
fun.

887
00:58:46,615 --> 00:58:50,537
The immediate conclusion that we actually tried a little bit was, oh my gosh, portals

888
00:58:50,577 --> 00:58:54,338
and deathmatch, and it's less fun than you'd think it is, honestly.

889
00:58:55,238 --> 00:58:56,299
It's actually kind of frustrating.

890
00:59:01,879 --> 00:59:07,821
Hi, you had a lot of really good advice about keeping it wet, keeping the project wet, not

891
00:59:07,861 --> 00:59:12,504
getting too attached to ideas and being willing to cut things or make changes later.

892
00:59:12,524 --> 00:59:18,766
I'm just wondering what your experience was for balancing that with the need to get a

893
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:24,049
project done and the kind of tendency of a project to kind of gain momentum the further

894
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:26,690
it goes along and be harder to make changes later than earlier.

895
00:59:27,691 --> 00:59:37,275
So the question was how do we temper a game, you know, the longer you work on it, the harder

896
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:42,016
it is to, you know, sort of cut things and is that kind of what you were saying?

897
00:59:42,056 --> 00:59:42,437
Yeah, okay.

898
00:59:42,797 --> 00:59:43,637
You said it better than I do.

899
00:59:45,399 --> 00:59:49,942
And playtesting, you will know right away if your idea is good or bad.

900
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:55,005
You know, if you watch your players and they are just totally frustrated out of your mind,

901
00:59:55,045 --> 01:00:00,448
and you can't really, you know, necessarily like pinpoint ways to fix it, then cut it.

902
01:00:01,529 --> 01:00:05,652
Because, so, you know, one of the things that we do making our levels, at least,

903
01:00:05,892 --> 01:00:10,855
is we try and get them up and running once we come up with an idea, okay, we want, you know, such and such objectives.

904
01:00:12,797 --> 01:00:16,059
As we try and get it up and running within like two to five days, like really, really fast,

905
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:17,859
and then we start running play tests through it.

906
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:23,442
And if we play test it like maybe, you know, three or four times and we find that it's just really not working out,

907
01:00:23,842 --> 01:00:30,885
then it's going to the cutting floor, or going back again to design phase and, you know, re-mangling it to work.

908
01:00:32,146 --> 01:00:46,554
So we never really got to a point where, you know, it was really, really difficult to cut something because, you know, we were always play testing and getting reinforcement for whether or not our ideas were good or bad directly from, you know, people we consider our customers.

909
01:00:46,574 --> 01:00:48,134
Thank you.

910
01:00:48,575 --> 01:00:48,735
Yep.

911
01:00:51,016 --> 01:00:58,160
If your development team were, or your development process were a style of painting, what would it be?

912
01:01:00,734 --> 01:01:09,661
Wow. So, if our development process were a style of painting, what would it be?

913
01:01:13,964 --> 01:01:14,544
Maybe a...

914
01:01:14,564 --> 01:01:18,387
Cubist?

915
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:20,889
I don't know. Yeah, Cubist painting.

916
01:01:21,129 --> 01:01:21,710
Have a good one.

917
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:24,071
Yeah, I'm out of it too.

918
01:01:29,657 --> 01:01:30,157
Sorry.

919
01:01:31,978 --> 01:01:37,321
So Chell obviously has a very good set of DNA, and you mentioned that it was Gabe's

920
01:01:37,381 --> 01:01:41,464
idea to make her female, and Gordon Freeman has good DNA.

921
01:01:41,584 --> 01:01:42,645
Is there any?

922
01:01:45,146 --> 01:01:49,729
So the question is, are Chell and Gordon going to hook up, essentially?

923
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:51,410
I don't know.

924
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:55,632
I mean, you guys have access to Gary's mod, right?

925
01:01:55,672 --> 01:01:56,653
You can do what you want.

926
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:07,937
Yeah, I was just wondering, you kept on talking about how you cut off a lot of things in the

927
01:02:08,017 --> 01:02:12,979
narrative and like cut off a lot of exposition and stuff like that, and just really streamline

928
01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:13,579
the process.

929
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:18,880
And I was just wondering, do you think that it's possible, I mean, do you think there's

930
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:24,501
a way to make exposition and narrative like interesting and fun for the playtesters?

931
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:33,167
So the question is, do I think there's a way to, I think you're saying is there a way

932
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,028
to include a lot more exposition and still make it entertaining?

933
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:42,332
I mean for me personally, I'm sure there's somebody who's a genius who could do it, but

934
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:50,677
I personally don't, I mean I like it when there is less, my own personal taste is less.

935
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:55,341
So for me, probably, probably not.

936
01:02:56,261 --> 01:02:57,582
I do as little as possible.

937
01:02:58,102 --> 01:03:02,665
Games aren't good at telling like, long expository stories then?

938
01:03:02,785 --> 01:03:06,086
Yeah, I guess I'm not good at it, but I'm also not good at sitting through it.

939
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:08,207
I mean, I just don't like it that much in games.

940
01:03:08,468 --> 01:03:13,210
When I play a game, I like it to be as concise as possible.

941
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:18,193
Honestly, game writer, but I'm not even 100% convinced that games are the best medium

942
01:03:18,273 --> 01:03:20,634
for telling epic, long stories.

943
01:03:21,936 --> 01:03:25,757
I kind of think of what I do is more of like providing a film score.

944
01:03:25,777 --> 01:03:30,379
You know, movies aren't about the music, but the music is definitely an important part

945
01:03:30,499 --> 01:03:33,220
that enhances the experience of watching the movie.

946
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:37,982
So the writing is something that enhances the experience of why you're there, which is playing the game.

947
01:03:38,703 --> 01:03:43,066
And honestly, for me, there's something to be said for leaving things to people's imagination.

948
01:03:43,507 --> 01:03:48,911
You don't have to have someone sitting there next to you dictating to you exactly what's going on at all times.

949
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,573
You know, people are smart, giving credit.

950
01:03:52,373 --> 01:03:59,179
And I know for me personally, it's kind of fun just sort of imagining up what I think some of the storyline is.

951
01:04:02,402 --> 01:04:08,784
Playing through portals, one of the biggest surprises that I had was finding references to Black Mesa inside of it,

952
01:04:08,884 --> 01:04:13,226
and then references to Aperture and the Borealis inside the Half-Life 2 Episode 2.

953
01:04:13,886 --> 01:04:19,408
Around what point in development did you make the decision to drop portals into the Half-Life universe?

954
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:28,412
So the question is, when did we decide to cross-reference between the two games of Episode 2 and Portal?

955
01:04:30,493 --> 01:04:33,356
kind of like, you know, maybe in the middle of development or so, we...

956
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:37,439
Well, middle of development for you, but I think when I came on it, that was in the...

957
01:04:38,262 --> 01:04:42,744
the earlier meetings. That was just one of the constraints on the game. Initially, because

958
01:04:42,784 --> 01:04:45,746
I think they weren't sure exactly where they were going to position it, and also because

959
01:04:45,786 --> 01:04:50,409
we were still using a lot of half-life art. So it sort of made sense to tie them together.

960
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:56,253
As Portal kind of got its own identity, we worried less and less about it. Like, you

961
01:04:56,273 --> 01:05:00,155
know, we're not going to have to have the G-Man appear or something. We can kind of make it

962
01:05:00,175 --> 01:05:03,217
a little bit more subtle and not have to dwell on it too much.

963
01:05:04,057 --> 01:05:05,158
Thanks.

964
01:05:05,198 --> 01:05:05,818
Two questions.

965
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,061
I have a friend who says that the best games teach us something.

966
01:05:09,941 --> 01:05:11,262
What do we have to learn from Portal?

967
01:05:11,962 --> 01:05:15,444
So the question is what do we have to learn from Portal

968
01:05:15,504 --> 01:05:17,545
because the best games teach people something?

969
01:05:17,845 --> 01:05:18,825
You know what I say? It takes one.

970
01:05:19,686 --> 01:05:21,167
That's a tough one.

971
01:05:23,588 --> 01:05:23,828
Well...

972
01:05:23,848 --> 01:05:26,929
If anybody has an idea, just get out of the house.

973
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,052
Don't trust anyone or something.

974
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:33,233
Don't trust anyone.

975
01:05:33,253 --> 01:05:34,194
The cake is a lie.

976
01:05:34,314 --> 01:05:36,655
The cake is a lie.

977
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:44,639
We definitely wanted to explore the idea of manipulating space and thinking about a 3D space in a different way.

978
01:05:45,219 --> 01:05:51,262
And so, you know, throughout Portal, we're kind of teaching you to look at a situation in a way that you haven't before.

979
01:05:52,024 --> 01:05:54,025
So I don't know if that kind of answers your question.

980
01:05:54,245 --> 01:05:54,605
You'll do.

981
01:05:55,525 --> 01:05:59,927
Also, I noticed that the companion cube is kind of silent.

982
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:02,768
Does it have any dialogue in the sequel?

983
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:07,070
So the question is, will a companion cube

984
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:08,791
have dialogue in the sequel to Portal?

985
01:06:10,672 --> 01:06:13,833
I don't know about this sequel, but you're talking about it.

986
01:06:13,694 --> 01:06:17,336
So this might be a little bit proprietary, but I'm curious.

987
01:06:18,236 --> 01:06:24,498
How did you guys and Orvald figure out, or when did you figure out it was an evolutionary process, how you were going to sell the game?

988
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:29,603
So the question is, when did we figure out how we were going

989
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,264
to market and sell Portal?

990
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:35,007
So when we initially started Portal,

991
01:06:36,328 --> 01:06:39,050
it was supposed to be just a seriously short game,

992
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:41,612
like maybe like, I don't know, 15 minutes, just

993
01:06:41,632 --> 01:06:42,933
like a quick tech demo.

994
01:06:44,774 --> 01:06:48,337
And then the further we got on the game,

995
01:06:48,757 --> 01:06:50,399
our constraints would change.

996
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:56,105
And I guess about the middle of portals development,

997
01:06:57,686 --> 01:07:00,368
we had started talking about doing the orange box.

998
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:05,793
And it would just sort of seem like a really reasonable conclusion

999
01:07:05,893 --> 01:07:07,674
that it should be packaged with...

1000
01:07:08,436 --> 01:07:16,199
Other games that you know have a lot of clout and are awesome games and you know from our standpoint like that's that's great

1001
01:07:16,259 --> 01:07:16,560
You know

1002
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:24,423
We're we were seriously honored to be packaged with you know TF2 and episode 2 because we think they're truly awesome games

1003
01:07:26,865 --> 01:07:33,089
You said that you used the play testing as kind of a method by which you tested whether or not the players got the storyline.

1004
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:42,094
And I wondered, as the game length grew, how, when you compartmentalize the testing, because grabbing people for 8-hour, 10-hour play sessions isn't always possible,

1005
01:07:42,694 --> 01:07:46,657
did you get them to give you that feedback, even if they're only playing maybe one or two levels?

1006
01:07:47,937 --> 01:07:49,178
Uh, well, a lot of action.

1007
01:07:49,678 --> 01:07:51,019
Oh, sorry. Uh, how did we...

1008
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,642
get people to experience the entire story if they didn't playtest the whole game.

1009
01:07:56,682 --> 01:08:01,183
Luckily, because Portal was a pretty short game throughout most of its development,

1010
01:08:01,223 --> 01:08:05,525
no point was it so long that it would take people eight hours to get through it.

1011
01:08:05,545 --> 01:08:07,685
Please don't hit me in the face.

1012
01:08:07,705 --> 01:08:07,985
Sorry.

1013
01:08:08,165 --> 01:08:13,247
What was I going to say?

1014
01:08:13,347 --> 01:08:16,208
If somebody didn't finish the game, we weren't super worried about asking.

1015
01:08:16,248 --> 01:08:18,308
We did occasionally have playtesters who didn't make it through.

1016
01:08:18,348 --> 01:08:18,788
But most of them...

1017
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,070
We sat and watched them for the entire time, and they made it through.

1018
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:27,533
I know that this question has kind of been beaten to death a bit, but it was about the

1019
01:08:27,653 --> 01:08:31,374
storyline, you saying less is more.

1020
01:08:31,754 --> 01:08:37,357
Would you say that that policy applies to other genres besides just portal, or is it

1021
01:08:37,377 --> 01:08:38,817
just mostly for that type of...

1022
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:46,863
I mean, there's definitely, oh, does Less is More in terms of story apply to other genres?

1023
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:52,287
And again, I don't know, I don't have a sure-fire solution for every genre.

1024
01:08:52,307 --> 01:08:55,069
I mean, in terms of my enjoyment of a game, Less is More.

1025
01:08:55,589 --> 01:09:07,117
So, but again, if you're making a giant RPG, you probably need to say who baguette whom and where the hammer came from.

1026
01:09:10,181 --> 01:09:16,328
So Portal and Half-Life 2 have a very different tone in terms of the writing and the sort

1027
01:09:16,368 --> 01:09:17,789
of themes, the thematic elements.

1028
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:22,715
If you ever do try and tie the universe together and do something with the cross-referencing

1029
01:09:22,735 --> 01:09:25,277
you've done, do you have any ideas for how you might resolve that?

1030
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:32,843
Well, so how do we resolve the differences in tone between Half-Life universe and the

1031
01:09:32,863 --> 01:09:34,143
sort of Aputure universe?

1032
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:38,385
And actually, it was something I thought about, and I honestly don't think it's that big

1033
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:43,707
a problem, because the Aputure universe, the tone that you're seeing, is mostly gladus,

1034
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,007
right?

1035
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:48,168
You're seeing things, even though you're playing a character, you're actually kind of experiencing

1036
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:50,229
the world through Gladus' eyes.

1037
01:09:52,091 --> 01:09:57,193
So, if Chell is out in the Half-Life universe, no action that you took as a player is really

1038
01:09:57,233 --> 01:10:02,035
in direct contradiction to anything that would happen in the Half-Life universe.

1039
01:10:02,275 --> 01:10:08,498
Inside the sort of Aputure Science Fun House, there's a different set of maybe tonal rules.

1040
01:10:09,218 --> 01:10:14,320
Physics-wise, they're the same places, and even art-style-wise, so I'm not super-duper

1041
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:14,800
worried about it.

1042
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:15,561
Is that Paul?

1043
01:10:15,881 --> 01:10:16,321
Yeah, it is.

1044
01:10:19,956 --> 01:10:21,856
uh... is there any chance of an art book

1045
01:10:23,217 --> 01:10:23,377
uh...

1046
01:10:23,737 --> 01:10:25,217
just say that again

1047
01:10:25,598 --> 01:10:28,839
is there any chance of an art book uh... is there any chance of an art book

1048
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:33,480
uh... i'm talking about it with anyone that is interesting idea they're

1049
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,781
talking about it in more than orange box sort of thing uh...

1050
01:10:38,022 --> 01:10:42,063
most of our concept are honestly with jason brashill designing the uh...

1051
01:10:42,765 --> 01:10:46,788
the gladus battle which is some awesome awesome artwork which you can

1052
01:10:46,808 --> 01:10:49,150
there's actually a print i think that you can buy of it

1053
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:51,533
uh... look at the website yeah

1054
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:57,338
but uh... a lot of the other stuff there i mean compared to tf or half-life

1055
01:10:57,558 --> 01:10:59,800
the there isn't a lot of really awesome

1056
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:04,404
uh... concept i mean we've got a lot of thumbnails of stuff but uh... like

1057
01:11:04,464 --> 01:11:06,086
there are a whole lot of like really

1058
01:11:06,648 --> 01:11:11,710
you know, great, you know, pictures that we have, you know,

1059
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:17,291
rachel did maybe, like maybe six or so, but essentially,

1060
01:11:17,311 --> 01:11:19,412
you know, we've just got a lot of thumbnails of, you know,

1061
01:11:19,432 --> 01:11:23,934
the turrets and the gun and a bunch of other stuff.

1062
01:11:24,794 --> 01:11:26,595
Also, why are the portals ovoided?

1063
01:11:27,355 --> 01:11:29,536
So the question is, why are the portals ovals?

1064
01:11:30,056 --> 01:11:32,436
Well, ovals look better than rectangles.

1065
01:11:34,598 --> 01:11:40,021
You know, we wanted something to kind of fit the bounds of where the actual, like, you

1066
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:44,403
know, where you can pass through the portal to be, and so we kind of just build an oval,

1067
01:11:44,644 --> 01:11:49,546
you know, through the rectangle where the portal, you know, technically is.

1068
01:11:52,782 --> 01:11:57,003
The game alludes to a lot of backstory that isn't really fully explained, like the fact

1069
01:11:57,043 --> 01:12:00,164
that you're a test subject for no explained reason.

1070
01:12:00,644 --> 01:12:04,544
How much of that backstory is actually written and referenced to, and how much of that did

1071
01:12:04,564 --> 01:12:08,725
you just sort of say, oh, we'll let the player kind of use his imagination?

1072
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:15,227
So the question is how much backstory is there that isn't in the game?

1073
01:12:15,787 --> 01:12:17,267
And there's a fair amount.

1074
01:12:17,447 --> 01:12:18,067
There's a lot.

1075
01:12:18,287 --> 01:12:18,487
Ah, yeah.

1076
01:12:19,888 --> 01:12:25,090
A lot of, I don't know, there's probably a 15-page document about Aputure Science.

1077
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:29,651
There's actually a little bit of it is on the Aputure Science website, kind of hidden

1078
01:12:29,671 --> 01:12:30,412
in there somewhere.

1079
01:12:31,172 --> 01:12:34,853
And I'd written up a bunch of stuff in the beginning just to kind of help me.

1080
01:12:35,453 --> 01:12:37,574
And actually, at that point, I thought maybe I'd get more in there.

1081
01:12:37,674 --> 01:12:43,696
But, and I sent it to Jonathan, too, that kind of helped him get into the sort of mindset

1082
01:12:43,736 --> 01:12:44,396
of the whole thing.

1083
01:12:44,817 --> 01:12:46,317
But yeah, there is a bunch.

1084
01:12:49,918 --> 01:12:58,962
Hi, I think I speak for a lot of people on this, that Portal really was a huge triumph

1085
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:06,225
because it was so creative and it won so many awards and it's got so much acclaim and it's

1086
01:13:06,245 --> 01:13:06,845
so different.

1087
01:13:07,665 --> 01:13:11,947
I was wondering if you could speak a little bit on how you think that's affecting the

1088
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:13,248
community of games as a whole.

1089
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:21,380
So the question, so it's like how portal impacts the community of games as well?

1090
01:13:21,821 --> 01:13:25,607
Yeah, and the approach to making games as a creative medium.

1091
01:13:29,213 --> 01:13:30,093
I don't really know.

1092
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:32,813
Yeah, I mean it's kind of too early to tell, I hope it.

1093
01:13:33,293 --> 01:13:37,714
I mean, because since we made Portal, we made a game that we sort of like, so if more people

1094
01:13:37,754 --> 01:13:43,195
make games like Portal, I would probably like them, so that's good.

1095
01:13:44,136 --> 01:13:48,357
But I mean, you just look at it this year, it seems like the independent games are...

1096
01:13:48,797 --> 01:13:50,177
Getting really good.

1097
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:50,957
Awesome.

1098
01:13:51,017 --> 01:13:56,098
Yeah, they're higher production quality and also higher profile, so maybe it'll mean

1099
01:13:56,178 --> 01:13:58,058
people take risks on, you know...

1100
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,682
with more oddball games.

1101
01:14:02,726 --> 01:14:03,206
Good evening.

1102
01:14:04,067 --> 01:14:08,507
So I had a question about, in terms of, like, my background

1103
01:14:08,547 --> 01:14:10,408
is film and that sort of media.

1104
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,188
So my question to you as writers and developers of this game

1105
01:14:13,768 --> 01:14:15,649
is, what are your influences?

1106
01:14:15,769 --> 01:14:17,069
What did you look like?

1107
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:21,390
What did you think of as inspiration for Portal or

1108
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:23,190
inspiration to get into the game industry?

1109
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:26,831
And how does that influence how you

1110
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:28,871
attack this game, this project?

1111
01:14:29,492 --> 01:14:35,894
So the question was, do we have any influences that kind of inspired us to make Portal or

1112
01:14:35,914 --> 01:14:37,995
against the gaming industry?

1113
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:45,678
So for me personally, like every other person on the planet, Miyamoto is definitely an inspiration.

1114
01:14:47,419 --> 01:14:54,241
I grew up with Nintendo games and I was kind of raised on them, so from an early age, I

1115
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,302
wanted to be a game designer.

1116
01:14:57,703 --> 01:15:03,884
And, you know, as far as just kind of interesting games that actually get published, you know,

1117
01:15:03,984 --> 01:15:06,005
Katamari Dimashi was a really great one.

1118
01:15:06,565 --> 01:15:08,666
Do you have inspiration?

1119
01:15:08,906 --> 01:15:12,546
Oh, well, direct inspiration for Portal was...

1120
01:15:13,407 --> 01:15:16,067
There's a book by... Who's the Dune guy?

1121
01:15:17,648 --> 01:15:19,648
Frank Herbert called Destination Boyd.

1122
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:26,933
It's about people that clones that go into space and they're tasked with building an AI.

1123
01:15:27,353 --> 01:15:32,557
And there's always this fail-safe mechanism because the AIs always go crazy and kill everyone.

1124
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:37,840
And the crew doesn't really know that that's what happens and then they blow up the ship.

1125
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:42,123
And it just fails and fails and fails because the AI goes rogue and they blow up the ship.

1126
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:46,126
There's like one mole guy in there who knows that he's supposed to blow up the ship.

1127
01:15:46,426 --> 01:15:47,967
So that was an inspiration for that.

1128
01:15:47,987 --> 01:15:49,028
In the game industry, I just...

1129
01:15:49,769 --> 01:15:53,410
Okay, no Isaac Asimov for anything like that or uh?

1130
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:57,091
Not you know, I'm honestly not when I was a kid I read a lot of science fiction

1131
01:15:57,111 --> 01:16:00,831
But I don't read a lot of science fiction now and so but I mean I know as mob

1132
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:06,693
I'm sure indirectly Robert Sheckley is a we actually named a character in episode 2 Sheckley after Robert Sheckley

1133
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:11,814
Just because he writes kind of funny science fiction. Yeah, I was a kid. I love this stuff. Thank you

1134
01:16:13,774 --> 01:16:21,456
Because we have to catch a plane at some point, so if we can just do these three, and there's nobody else, that's easy.

1135
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:28,257
Hey, I have a question specifically for Eric. If the portal design process was an animal, what would it be?

1136
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:38,019
That's Anna, who used to sit right next to me at Double Fine, so that was her joke question, I'm not going to answer.

1137
01:16:44,085 --> 01:16:47,366
Okay, so my question pertains to the current slides.

1138
01:16:48,567 --> 01:16:49,147
The slides.

1139
01:16:49,167 --> 01:16:56,390
Yeah, we were actually waiting for someone to actually ask us what in the world did we put on the slide.

1140
01:16:57,011 --> 01:16:59,312
What's the significance of the two shots?

1141
01:16:59,712 --> 01:17:06,175
And if you were each one of the characters in each of the pictures, which would you be?

1142
01:17:08,856 --> 01:17:09,816
Eric's the one crying.

1143
01:17:12,639 --> 01:17:17,840
I don't know, it's friendship and fire.

1144
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:23,722
Two pictures we just had, we couldn't quite fit into the talk in any meaningful way.

1145
01:17:24,263 --> 01:17:26,923
And we thought they were pretty funny.

1146
01:17:26,943 --> 01:17:31,245
I think one of those is the crying guys, is my Steam community ID too.

1147
01:17:32,765 --> 01:17:33,666
And that's Ray Moore.

1148
01:17:36,548 --> 01:17:39,712
Hi, so I was actually wondering about the development team.

1149
01:17:40,613 --> 01:17:42,375
Because you're female and that's kind of unusual.

1150
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:44,057
How many girls are on the team?

1151
01:17:44,597 --> 01:17:47,581
So the question was how many girls were on the portal team?

1152
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:51,966
There were two, myself and one of the artists, Realm Lovejoy.

1153
01:17:52,529 --> 01:17:52,849
Right on.

1154
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,572
Do you think that helps in the creativity process

1155
01:17:55,612 --> 01:17:58,335
in making a unique game, having that different perspective?

1156
01:17:59,576 --> 01:18:03,360
So the question was, does having females on a game team

1157
01:18:04,761 --> 01:18:07,885
make for a better game, giving you a unique perspective?

1158
01:18:07,965 --> 01:18:09,847
And I don't know.

1159
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:18,192
No, I mean, honestly, I think whenever you're on a game team, no matter what your gender,

1160
01:18:18,313 --> 01:18:22,234
you want to make a game that you would enjoy to play yourself, like that's the dream, right?

1161
01:18:22,854 --> 01:18:28,976
So I mean, I guess that could, by extension, mean that we made a game that perhaps girls

1162
01:18:29,016 --> 01:18:34,338
could like too, but honestly, I hope that it's fun for everybody, personally.

1163
01:18:34,518 --> 01:18:36,658
Having girls on the team makes the room smell better.

1164
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:39,341
Thank you.
