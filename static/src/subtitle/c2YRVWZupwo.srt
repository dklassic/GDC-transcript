1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
I'm Kim Swift, and I was a level designer and the team lead on Portal.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.160
And I'm Eric Wolpaw, and I was a writer on Portal.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.560
So we're here to talk to you today a little bit about our techniques for integrating narrative

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:22.600
and design, sort of phrased as a Portal postmortem, giving examples of what we particularly did.

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.680
So in case you were wondering, postmortem means we will be talking about stuff that's

6
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.680
in the game.

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.280
So if you haven't played the game and you're one of those people that gets all squealy

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.440
and upset whenever someone tells you something that you hadn't heard about a game, then you

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.880
might want to leave the room.

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.880
Or not.

11
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
That's fine too.

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.880
So here's what we're going to try and cover today.

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.120
First of all, I'm going to make a real brief case of why you should care about anything

14
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.120
we're going to tell you.

15
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.080
Secondly, I'm going to go real quickly into our narrative philosophy, which is sort of

16
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:03.080
our crackpot theory of how gameplay and narrative should be combined.

17
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.000
And third of all, we're going to talk about how we took the crackpot theory and tried

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.520
to apply it to our development process.

19
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.840
So in particular, why should you care about how we did this on Portal?

20
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.260
Well, first of all, we had a really small team with about only ten people at once working

21
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.640
on the game.

22
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.520
Usually it was anywhere between five and seven.

23
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.040
And it's been pretty popular, and we're surprised, despite the game being kind of unorthodox.

24
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.960
So after all is said and done, we actually don't really have any regrets.

25
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.000
Unlike this poor guy.

26
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.080
So now, why would you care about how we put together our narrative and design?

27
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.000
So by itself, our story wouldn't really make a whole great novel.

28
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.440
Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is just really, really funny.

29
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.360
He's probably about the funniest man you'll ever meet, just in case you were wondering.

30
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.360
Set the bar pretty high for the talk.

31
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.360
Sorry about that.

32
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.360
Nothing funny in this.

33
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.360
There's no ad-libbing now from this point on.

34
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.360
And on its own, the gameplay, it'd be all right.

35
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.360
But honestly, a little on the dry side.

36
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:25.320
Honestly, it would be a race to see which one would fail the fastest on its own.

37
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.080
But because we had a really tight integration of both our story and our gameplay, it seemed

38
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.400
to really resonate with people, and it worked.

39
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.160
And like Kim said, our team size kind of imposed a lot of constraints on our design choices.

40
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.160
So our design methods from the beginning had to be low impact on both our time and energy

41
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
budgets.

42
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.440
But this kind of helped us creatively sidestep a lot of our constraints.

43
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.440
For instance, Gladys being a disembodied voice might not have actually occurred to us if

44
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.440
we'd had a ton of animators and a ton of resources to make her a little robot buddy that followed

45
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.440
you around or something.

46
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:12.680
And yet it kind of turned out to be just the perfect solution to the narrative in Portal.

47
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.320
So here's a crackpot theory.

48
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.160
The idea is that games tell two stories.

49
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.200
There's a story story, which is sort of the sum total of the game's dialogue and cutscenes.

50
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.320
And then there's the gameplay story, which is the story described by the actions the

51
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.600
player takes in the game world.

52
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.320
And if you lower the delta between those two stories, the closer you put them together,

53
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.120
the more satisfying your game will be.

54
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.160
Or at least that was our theory.

55
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.440
There's a lot of games that I think suffer from a high story delta, but since it's a

56
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.000
game developers conference, if I run down a lot of them, it's going to be like super

57
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
dick moves.

58
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So I'm not going to do that.

59
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.240
I'm going to mention one game that I actually like a lot, so it should be non-controversial

60
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.520
and it's also kind of old, is Clive Barker's Undying, which is a first-person shooter that

61
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.960
was released like six years ago.

62
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.760
And it's a good shooter.

63
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.280
And regardless of what you may think about his style, Clive Barker, and that's him wearing

64
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.000
super scary pair of pants, he's a talented writer who actually, in interviews, I think

65
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.040
seems to care a lot about the story in his games.

66
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:33.040
So Clive Barker's Undying, you play this World War I war hero who goes to Scotland

67
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.560
to visit the castle of one of your war buddies.

68
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.600
And the castle is sort of infested with ghouls.

69
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.000
And you're shooting a lot of monsters and there's a lot of death and destruction all

70
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
around.

71
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.560
But pretty frequently, as you're going through the mansion, the game all of a sudden stops

72
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.000
to play one of these cut scenes where you sort of calmly interrogate one of the members

73
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
of the staff.

74
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You know, you're sort of, what do you do?

75
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
How are you doing?

76
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
How are you feeling?

77
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Stuff like that.

78
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.240
Meanwhile, at no point does your character just grab the help by the label and say, you

79
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.920
know, like, there are monsters five feet around that corner killing everyone they come across.

80
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.360
You need to run now.

81
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.240
The two stories make absolutely no sense when you smoosh them together.

82
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:23.440
And Undying is one of the first times that I remember a good game sort of being undermined

83
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.640
by a disconnect between the story the gameplay was telling and the story the story itself

84
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.640
was telling.

85
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.760
So, with all that in mind, our fundamental Portal narrative design goal was that the

86
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.840
story story would never ever intrude or contradict the gameplay story.

87
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.800
For us, less was always more.

88
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.040
And we were ruthless about it.

89
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.100
We were ruthless about trimming the narrative fat, tightening our belts, and then trimming

90
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.100
it even more.

91
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.700
So, Portal was going to be a lean storytelling machine if it killed us.

92
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.820
And usually it meant killing you.

93
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.820
Killing me.

94
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.500
Because it was a lot of good lines that had to get cut.

95
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.500
And we're really sorry about that.

96
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.900
But it was, yeah, it was worth it.

97
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.140
So enough about how we feel about games.

98
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.340
Like, let's talk about how we practically applied these feelings.

99
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.380
First of all, we're going to talk a little bit about our playtesting process, which,

100
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.220
by the way, in case you were wondering, it's really important.

101
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.020
Second, reflecting story in your environment.

102
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.780
Next, evolving narrative out of gameplay.

103
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.980
And then again, vice versa, evolving gameplay out of narrative.

104
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.940
So playtesting is probably the most important thing we ever did on Portal.

105
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.180
You know, actually sit down and watch people play your game.

106
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.900
Don't just have some other company playtest the game and then send you a report afterwards.

107
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.020
It's just not going to be as valuable to you as just sitting down, having someone play

108
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.780
your game, and you watch them and see how they react to it.

109
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.540
You can find out what your players actually want by watching them.

110
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.900
In the case of Portal, we adjusted our gameplay to what players looked like they needed.

111
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.220
Did they need more training?

112
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.020
Because clearly they were really confused here.

113
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.100
Maybe they needed some more reinforcement of what we trained them on.

114
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.780
Because they wanted to use those new skills.

115
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.700
And in addition to that, we also adjusted our story to enhance, essentially, what our

116
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.980
players were feeling at that time.

117
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:22.620
Yeah, and frequent playtests helped keep us objective about our design decisions.

118
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.780
Watching playtests is a great way to expose pretty quickly what isn't working.

119
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.540
One rule we had, narrative-wise, was at the end of a playtest, we would ask playtesters

120
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.980
to just tell us the Portal story back, beat by beat.

121
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.780
And if they couldn't tell it to us, we took that as a real clear sign that they just weren't

122
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.300
interested, that we were failing.

123
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.580
And the fix for it, almost always, was just to cut more story, cut more exposition.

124
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.340
It usually meant cutting something that initially seemed essential to the story.

125
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.100
And as it turned out, it just made it stronger every time we cut something.

126
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.020
It says something about the writing.

127
00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.020
Yeah.

128
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.020
Oh, I'm sorry.

129
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.420
Another thing is playtest early and often.

130
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:08.740
On the far side there, you can see what the first room in the game actually looked like,

131
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.820
you know, maybe a couple weeks into development.

132
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.220
And then on the other side, you can see what it finally shipped, you know, as.

133
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.740
And we literally started playtesting this room the first week that we got to Valve and

134
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.900
started working on the game.

135
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.780
We, you know, hacked portals together in some horrible way that, you know, we're glad doesn't

136
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.820
exist anymore.

137
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:35.140
And we were already making better decisions about what our levels were like.

138
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.500
So I don't know, it's kind of hard to make out, but in the first picture, there's kind

139
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.340
of like this shimmery force field, which was, you know, the original cage for the player.

140
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.340
And we got rid of this pretty quickly because our playtesters, you know, just didn't understand

141
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.340
what it was.

142
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.940
They would, you know, walk up to the force field and they, you know, were wondering why

143
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.980
they couldn't walk through it.

144
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.660
So they would just kind of like trace the edge of the cage like five times and get really

145
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.720
confused.

146
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.780
So we changed it to glass just to fix that problem.

147
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:08.580
So, you know, not only did our playtesting help us get a better narrative and get better

148
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.660
gameplay, it also helped us refine our art direction.

149
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:17.180
You know, as you can notice in the later picture, it's a lot cleaner, it's a lot simpler.

150
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.340
We extracted any of the elements that, you know, didn't really have any relevance to

151
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.340
the player.

152
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:28.260
And it really helped us teach the players what they needed to know.

153
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:34.060
So as just kind of a digression, yeah, I labeled this slide advice because this is

154
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.820
the only one I'm fully behind as advice of anything we're going to say today.

155
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.500
This is actually good advice.

156
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:47.140
If you're writing a funny game, first of all, God help you because it's unpleasant.

157
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.780
Because tough guy dialogue is just about as macho the 50th time you hear it as the first

158
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.780
time.

159
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.380
Whereas funny dialogue is funny once maybe.

160
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.700
About three years ago, I worked on a game called Psychonauts.

161
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.700
Yay!

162
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:10.220
There's more people clapping than bought it.

163
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:17.820
Now I lost my train of thought.

164
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.820
Working on Psychonauts.

165
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.820
Double Fine.

166
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.940
Oh, so Double Fine is kind of structured.

167
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.300
Everybody sits in one big room.

168
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.980
It's 40 people maybe.

169
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.380
Sitting in one big room.

170
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.180
And it's, you know, the two and a half years that I was there, no game development, it's

171
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.740
12 hours a day, six, seven days a week.

172
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.180
And so I had to sit there in the middle of this pit of people working on Psychonauts

173
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:48.300
hearing my supposedly funny dialogue blaring out of 40 monitors to just grim, stony silence.

174
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.740
And it was just, it was torture.

175
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:56.900
It was psychological torture for me because Tim wisely had his own office somewhere where

176
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.700
you didn't have to hear the grim, stony silence.

177
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.860
So yeah, this is you writing a funny game.

178
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.940
You are going to exist in a black cloud of despair for however long it takes you to make

179
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.460
the game.

180
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.420
But so here's the advice.

181
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.420
Trust your instincts.

182
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.460
Try and remember your initial reaction, people's initial reactions to seeing it.

183
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.700
And you know, do whatever you can do to not despair.

184
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:31.620
But the fourth part, the part that helped us a lot, again on Portal, is playtest.

185
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.900
More often you playtest, the more often you actually get to see someone, hearing your

186
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.260
dialogue, seeing the game for the first time.

187
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:45.260
And it, honest to God, whatever the benefits of playtesting are for the design team, for

188
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:51.340
a writer, it is the only way really to maintain your sanity during the two or three years

189
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.820
it's going to take you to make the game.

190
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.820
Or Prozac.

191
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.820
Yeah, and I'll, yeah, medication.

192
00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.820
So another thing we tried to do when we had to cut exposition was to, if we didn't want

193
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.140
to cut it all together, was to try and embed exposition in the environment.

194
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.020
When we were initially talking about it, we had some email, ideas for embedding it in

195
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:16.580
email, and we were actually using email to talk about putting it in email, and at some

196
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.140
point we discovered that reading email wasn't actually that fun.

197
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.060
He's like, did you enjoy reading that last email?

198
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.540
I was like, no, it wasn't that exciting, we probably shouldn't put it in the game.

199
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.900
So that was one of our rules.

200
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.500
And the idea was, try and be creative about reflecting the story in the environment.

201
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:39.020
And again, easy to say, be creative, but if you apply a rule set and then you're ruthless

202
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:43.180
about the rules, it's amazing how creative you can get in a big hurry if it's a choice

203
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:48.300
between coming up with some novel way to embed your exposition in the environment and simply

204
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.900
cutting it all together.

205
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.700
So what we did in Portal, at least one of the things we did, was to have these little

206
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.740
wall scribblings in the behind the scenes areas of the game.

207
00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.340
And honestly, these are really quick and easy to do, like they really only took like one

208
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.140
or two days tops.

209
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.940
And they were pretty effective at telling a story.

210
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.540
So here's an example of the room.

211
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.700
And you know, put yourself in the position of your characters.

212
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.980
What would they do in the situation of the game?

213
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.860
So in this case, we had this idea for a character that we called the Ratman.

214
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.900
And he was supposed to be a fellow escaped test subject, just like you, and he's a little

215
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.900
loopy.

216
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:34.220
And we originally wanted you to actually meet this NPC at some point in the game, but we

217
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.780
had two artists.

218
00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.060
So it wasn't really feasible.

219
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.580
So rather than just sort of cut our backstory on this guy, we decided to manifest him here

220
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.100
in these rooms.

221
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.620
So you know, I asked myself, if I was trapped inside an insidious facility, bent on my destruction,

222
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:59.020
run by a homicidal AI, what would I do to pass the time?

223
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.940
So another big tool we used was to try and evolve our narrative out of gameplay.

224
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.980
Like Kim said, we tried to write to enhance what playtesters were feeling, which required

225
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.540
me to try and keep the story as wet as possible.

226
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.900
It was a big, big hurdle to overcome to just not get attached to any piece of writing.

227
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.860
And yeah, because it was just going to disappear at any given time, and we'd have to think

228
00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.860
up something else.

229
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.660
And the same goes for gameplay too.

230
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.100
Don't get too attached to anything.

231
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.740
Like you know, you might need to cut it, and it's probably for the best.

232
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.300
So here's an example of that.

233
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.780
The Way to Companion Cube.

234
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.780
So we're going to talk about this first from a game design standpoint of one day, we sat

235
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.700
down and decided we wanted to make what we called the box marathon level.

236
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.740
So where essentially you've got your cube at the beginning of the map, and then you

237
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.620
take it all the way through to the end of the map and put it on a button.

238
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.540
It's supposed to be a big, long obstacle course.

239
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.820
So the first thing that we tried was having sort of this moving platform, you know, over

240
00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.300
a goo pit where you'd have to stand on it with your box and avoid stuff.

241
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.940
Kind of similar actually to the last test chamber that we shipped.

242
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.060
And you know what?

243
00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.540
It pissed players off, like to no end.

244
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:13.340
They would end up destroying the box by dropping it in the goo, and they'd get really annoyed

245
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.260
because they had to go back to the beginning of the map, and you know, they didn't really

246
00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.820
want to carry this stupid thing with them everywhere.

247
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.540
So we went back to the drawing board.

248
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.980
The first thing we did was remove the moving platforms over the goo, you know, so you couldn't

249
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.540
destroy the box.

250
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:34.860
And we added more gameplay events where having the box is necessary for you to solve a puzzle.

251
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.500
So here's a couple examples.

252
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.220
On one side there you can see that we used the cube to, you know, kind of make a dynamic

253
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.020
set of stairs there to get up those platforms.

254
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.420
And then on the other side, it's a puzzle where you have to, you know, put the box on

255
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.060
one of these buttons and then, you know, go stand on another button and get this energy

256
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.660
ball through those doors into a, you know, catcher thing.

257
00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.140
And these worked pretty well in terms of making players at least somewhat take the box with

258
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.100
them and not hate it.

259
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.820
And but, you know, players were still kind of forgetting it.

260
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.340
They'd leave it at one puzzle and then, you know, go to the next puzzle and go, oh crap,

261
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:14.020
and then have to go back to the beginning and grab their box.

262
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:19.320
So we said, okay, maybe if we redesign this room so that way you're always kind of facing

263
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.340
this button and taking a look at it.

264
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.460
So that worked pretty well, at least to remind players, by the way, you need this at the

265
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.460
end of the map.

266
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.340
But, you know, we needed something else.

267
00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.180
Like players really weren't getting that attached to the box and there were still a few people

268
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.420
that would kind of forget it behind.

269
00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.220
And so, Eric to the rescue over here.

270
00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:43.300
Though as much as possible we tried to, you know, put hints for our players, you know,

271
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.580
in the environment, whether it be through lighting or geometry, you know, when all else

272
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.140
fails, great dialogue really was a great tool for us to give a hint to the player.

273
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:59.220
Yeah, I'd been reading, luckily, these declassified government interrogation manuals.

274
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.100
And one of the things, they're awesome.

275
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.100
I recommend them.

276
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.100
They're really cool.

277
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:12.820
But one of the things they talked about was that isolation leads interrogation subjects

278
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:17.140
to start becoming attached to inanimate objects.

279
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.620
And kind of just something clicked.

280
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.340
It was like, well, you're sort of alone this whole time.

281
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:28.700
Maybe if Clatus psychologically needles you a little bit, you know, it would work.

282
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.820
And crazily, I mean, they know what they're doing.

283
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.620
They're government interrogation specialists.

284
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.620
They were right.

285
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.620
Yeah, it totally worked.

286
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.860
It's super duper worked.

287
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.060
No one ever forgot their box after we put in that dialogue, that's for sure.

288
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.420
And sort of as an afterthought, you know, we put these pink hearts, they're so pretty,

289
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.580
on the cube just to kind of cue back to the dialogue that there's something special about

290
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.180
this box and you should take it with you and take care of it.

291
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.180
Yeah, that worked.

292
00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:59.900
And honestly, this was a really great thing for us just because it had a dual function

293
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.660
as far as the ending of this map went.

294
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:09.300
And the first thing is, well, at the time that we were finishing up this map, we were

295
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.100
also working on our ending boss battle.

296
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:19.500
And we had settled at the time on just disintegrating these little parts of Clatus.

297
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.860
And we had an incinerator in the map and we didn't train our players.

298
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.740
So obviously, they had no idea what they were doing.

299
00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.980
And you know, they'd have to press the switch to open up the incinerator and they just,

300
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.060
they completely ignored it.

301
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.060
And then they would wander around the room and then get really angry at us.

302
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.300
So we obviously had to train this somewhere and we had a great idea of where to put the

303
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.300
training.

304
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:47.380
Yeah, originally, up until almost the last minute at the end of the companion cube level,

305
00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.700
you just had to just leave the companion cube.

306
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.620
You had to abandon it because you couldn't bring it with you into the elevator.

307
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.700
And Clatus made some reference to it being euthanized.

308
00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.980
And it was sort of sad, but it wasn't really a good ending to the level.

309
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:07.180
So putting the incinerator there and having you be forced to euthanize it was just an

310
00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.260
awesome way to end it.

311
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.420
And in addition to that, it was also a great place to train the player because there was

312
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.840
no stress.

313
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840
There was no pressure for...

314
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.840
Well, the stress of killing it.

315
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.840
Well, yeah, it was a little stressful.

316
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.880
But more like, you know, there was nothing shooting at you or, you know, they didn't

317
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.880
have a clock ticking down.

318
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.080
Like, oh my God, I've got to do this in 10 seconds.

319
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.880
And we did that because, well, players do not learn anything when they're completely

320
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.880
stressed out.

321
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.540
Like, they just won't absorb anything.

322
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.080
So putting the training there was pretty good.

323
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:45.640
Also it provided a really great point to our narrative as well because, you know, you

324
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.720
get to incinerate Clatus the same way, you know, she made you incinerate your best friend.

325
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:55.080
Yeah, the whole companion cube saga was just a really great example of how the gameplay

326
00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.000
kind of influenced the story, which then turned around and influenced the gameplay.

327
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.120
Okay, so having said all that about how it's gameplay, gameplay, gameplay, no narrative,

328
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:13.120
we did reach a point where we discovered that gameplay wasn't really working by itself.

329
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.520
And this was the original ending of Portal.

330
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:23.560
Honestly, the biggest obstacle to us when making Portal was our ending boss battle.

331
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.520
You know, we look at other games, okay, we know what a boss battle will look like in

332
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:33.600
a first person shooter or an RPG, but what in the world is a boss battle going to look

333
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.080
like in a weird environmental puzzle game?

334
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.680
Yeah, the first thing you'd think, or at least the first thing we thought, was that the boss

335
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.120
monster for a puzzle game should be a deviously complex puzzle.

336
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.120
And that sort of innocuous sounding conclusion really just gave us a lot of headaches and

337
00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.600
pain.

338
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:57.280
So we're going to show you a few examples of some things that we tried as boss battles

339
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.300
and eventually abandoned for one reason or another.

340
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.860
So the first one that we tried was James Bond lasers.

341
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:12.460
So literally, they were big giant lasers that would follow the player around trying to zap

342
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.340
them, and obviously we cut this.

343
00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.980
Here's, I know, aren't they pretty?

344
00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.540
Isn't that nice?

345
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:27.140
These are training maps that we had for the James Bond style lasers, where essentially

346
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.900
you'd have to place your portal in front of the laser and then place one on a wall

347
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:37.940
and then redirect the laser at that weird orange thing sitting in that glass wall and

348
00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:42.100
break through and be able to get to the other side, where you would meet GLaDOS.

349
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.260
That's GLaDOS there in her giant shimmery cube phase.

350
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.460
Don't you love temp art?

351
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.820
It's great stuff.

352
00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:55.380
And once again, you'd have to redirect those lasers at those, which you find out are orange

353
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.740
plugs supplying GLaDOS with power.

354
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.780
And you know, the end.

355
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.140
But yeah, it was not good.

356
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.140
The lasers were extremely boring to dodge and kind of difficult to tune, because we

357
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:12.340
would make them follow the player kind of fast and then it would be unfair, and if we

358
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.420
slowed them down, then they're boring.

359
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.620
They were also really difficult to aim, believe it or not, through a portal.

360
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.220
It was kind of a pain.

361
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:25.360
And it was also hard to tell if you were hit by the lasers too, so we abandoned this idea

362
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.340
and instead chose to use a rocket launcher.

363
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.720
So the second attempt that we had was Portal Combat.

364
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:45.720
Sorry, I had fun with Photoshop one day.

365
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:52.720
So, you know, we had a lot of players test our game that were hardcore first-person shooter

366
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.720
players.

367
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.080
We were like, you need more action, and you need to jump around and be a crazy portal

368
00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.080
ninja, and so we were like, yeah, okay, sure, we'll give it a shot.

369
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.080
And, you know, it didn't really work out very well.

370
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.080
Here's a picture of a level that we actually shipped in the game.

371
00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.080
And this is what it originally looked like.

372
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.080
So, this was supposed to be the first time that you would meet GLaDOS, and you can see

373
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.080
that there's a rocket launcher there.

374
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.080
We had put it in at that point.

375
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:26.440
And you would have to redirect the rockets and use your portals to shoot GLaDOS in the

376
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.440
face.

377
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.440
And that's GLaDOS, yeah, she's a bunch of roller minds.

378
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.440
So, you know, this was, you know, it was okay.

379
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.440
But we then made it a little bit more complex.

380
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.440
So she would rise to the top of this room, and then all of these little pillboxes would

381
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.440
pop open with turrets in them.

382
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.800
And the rocket launcher was still on, and you would have to try and, you know, redirect

383
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.800
the laser and hit her again.

384
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.800
And all the meanwhile, the turrets are firing at you, the rocket launcher is firing at you,

385
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.800
and it's just not fun.

386
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.800
So, yeah, the high-intensity gameplay sucked.

387
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.800
In fact, it sucked so bad that I'm talking when you're supposed to be reading.

388
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.800
Is that true?

389
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.800
No, no, it's all right.

390
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.800
Anyway, I'll finish it.

391
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.800
It sucked.

392
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.800
It was bad.

393
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800
It sucked so much, I'm not going to let Kim talk about it.

394
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.800
It sucked because I hated it so much.

395
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.160
No one paid attention to GLaDOS, any of her dialogue, because there was just way too much

396
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.160
stuff going on.

397
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.160
And we had playtesters who'd come in who were sort of hardcore Counter-Strike or shooter

398
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.160
fans, and they were able to bring a little bit of enjoyment out of it.

399
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.160
But the vast majority of our playtesters, who had sort of gotten used to the slower

400
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:40.160
paced, cerebral nature of Portal, were just frustrated and confused and dissatisfied,

401
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.520
which was absolutely not the way we kind of wanted to send them out the door.

402
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.520
So, the final attempt was to have a chase sequence.

403
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.520
And that's GLaDOS there as the kitten.

404
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.520
Isn't she cute?

405
00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.520
So, here's kind of what that looked like.

406
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.520
This is actually a continuation of the previous section, where GLaDOS would rise up to the

407
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.520
top of the ceiling.

408
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.520
Well, after you hit her with the second rocket, she'd rise up even more and would zoom down

409
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.880
this hallway.

410
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:16.880
And you would actually have to follow her by flinging a couple times and getting up

411
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.880
into this hallway.

412
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:24.880
And honestly, the pacing was just horrible, because players wouldn't necessarily see where

413
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.880
she would go, and so they didn't know where they were going.

414
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.880
So, they would wander around for a while, and they'd eventually realize, oh, I don't

415
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.880
think I've been there before, and kind of get up there.

416
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.880
But if it's a chase sequence, it's supposed to be action-packed.

417
00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.240
You're supposed to be going, going, going.

418
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.240
And instead, players are just wandering around confused.

419
00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:48.240
And then, once you actually got up into this hallway, we wanted to make it seem like, oh,

420
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.240
GLaDOS had sprung some sort of trap to kill you.

421
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:58.240
So, we had all these pistons kind of break out of the walls and try and crush you or

422
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.240
block you from getting further.

423
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.240
And we also had these turrets and stuff pop down from the ceiling.

424
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.240
And if you actually played the game, you can see that these hallways are kind of similar

425
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.240
to what we shipped.

426
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.600
And we took a lot of stuff out.

427
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.600
Because...

428
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.600
Yeah.

429
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.600
This, I'm not even going to bother reading down.

430
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.600
This failed in every way that's possible for a level like that to fail.

431
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.600
It had bad pacing.

432
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.600
Players didn't really know what was going on with GLaDOS making the pistons come out

433
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.600
at you.

434
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.600
And every solution we came up with to try and fix those were either too expensive for

435
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.600
us to do or just made the gameplay even worse.

436
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.960
So, a complex boss battle?

437
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.960
Yeah, it didn't work.

438
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.960
And the thing that we actually learned from all this was that the more complex that we

439
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.960
made our puzzles, the slower the pacing actually got.

440
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.960
Because players would have to stop and think about what they were going to do next.

441
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.960
And, you know, if you watch an action movie and you get to the climactic sequence, there's

442
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.960
something happening all the time.

443
00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:02.960
And in our game, when we wanted it to be climactic, because we made everything more complex, it

444
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.320
did the opposite thing than what we expected.

445
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:12.320
So, it's funny to us now, but we were desperately screwed at this point.

446
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:18.320
Because Episode 2 was winding up and TF, after 10 years, was going to beat us out.

447
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:24.320
And, you know, the Episode 2 guys are running around, they're like, our final battle is

448
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.320
going to be 100 Striders and you're going to be driving a car and running into little

449
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.320
mini Striders.

450
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.320
What are you guys doing?

451
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320
It's a secret.

452
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:39.680
So, but again, once again, our old friend playtesting helped us.

453
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.680
There was a point, and I don't know why we didn't realize it earlier on, but there was

454
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.680
one piece of feedback that we were getting, that there was a point in the game that playtesters

455
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:53.680
felt, excuse me, was both climactic and satisfying.

456
00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.680
And it's the fire pit.

457
00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.040
It happened about two-thirds of the way through the game.

458
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:06.040
The testing, proper, the regular testing, hold on, I'm going to take a drink of water,

459
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:12.040
is almost over and GLaDOS is kind of talking you out, you're riding this platform into

460
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:18.040
a fire pit, and you eventually, you escape out of here.

461
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:24.040
But playtesters were just consistently telling us, not only was this dramatic and exciting,

462
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.400
they kept telling us that it was actually like, it was a really tough puzzle that I

463
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:34.400
felt super satisfied to solve, which absolutely made no sense to us.

464
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.400
Because...

465
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.400
That's a good picture.

466
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.400
Yeah, I know, it's a good picture.

467
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.760
Portal 2 is just going to be this picture over and over again.

468
00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.760
When it comes right down to it, at that point in the game, that's about the easiest puzzle

469
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.760
in Portal.

470
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.760
You place a portal on the wall next to the fire pit, and then you place one in a safe

471
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.760
area, and you just hop through it.

472
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.760
That's it.

473
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:18.760
So, we then had to sit down and reflect, like, what in the world made this so climactic?

474
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.120
And one of the things that we learned was that, well, it had time pressure.

475
00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.120
You know, there was only a limited amount of time while you were on that platform before

476
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.120
you were going to get burned alive to place your portals and escape.

477
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:34.120
And, you know, as I think I've said before, time pressure makes people think something

478
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.120
that is a lot more complicated than it actually is.

479
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.120
Another thing was it had a really high visual impact.

480
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.120
I mean, you can't really go wrong with a platform heading straight into a giant pit of fire

481
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.120
for visual impact.

482
00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.480
But, you know, it's something that our players had never seen before in the game, and so

483
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.480
it was, you know, something new.

484
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:58.480
There's also a dramatic high point, because for the first time, GLaDOS is pretty openly

485
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.480
trying to kill you, and also for the first time, you're able to assert a little bit of

486
00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.480
control over your environment and escape from her.

487
00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:11.480
And, like Kim was saying, all of those three things combined made it so that an easy puzzle

488
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:18.840
was sort of feeling like a much more complicated puzzle, which allowed us, led us to the realization

489
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.840
that we'd been holding onto this idea that we needed a complex puzzle at the end, and

490
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.840
it simply just wasn't true.

491
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.840
So here's what we actually shipped in the game as boss battle.

492
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.840
You can see GLaDOS there with her little personality spheres, and then next to her was a hatch

493
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.840
where a rocket launcher would pop up, and you'd have to reorient the rockets and hit

494
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:44.200
GLaDOS, take one of those spheres, and then put it in the incinerator by, you know, getting

495
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.200
to the activation switch with your portals, and then getting back to the incinerator and

496
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.200
tossing it in.

497
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.200
The end.

498
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.200
Done.

499
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.200
So, taking the four lessons we learned, this is how we applied them to the final GLaDOS

500
00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.200
battle.

501
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.200
First of all was time pressure.

502
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.200
We were ourselves under some time pressure, so instead of getting fancy, we actually just

503
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.200
had a timer counting down to something that would kill you.

504
00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.560
And we decided that thing that would kill you would be some neurotoxin, because it was

505
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.560
also really cheap just to make a green particle system.

506
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.560
You laugh, but it's seriously true.

507
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.560
Yeah, that's 100% true.

508
00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.560
So, you know, visual impact.

509
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.560
Well, on one side of the screen, you know, on the far side over there, you can see a

510
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.560
piece of concept art that an artist at Valve, Jason Braschel, did for us.

511
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560
Thanks, Jason.

512
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.560
And on the other side there, you can see what we actually shipped.

513
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.920
So everything in this room, visually, is pointing at GLaDOS.

514
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.920
You know, got the geometry of the stairs leading up to her, got all the lights pointing at

515
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.920
her.

516
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.920
You know, after all this time of hearing GLaDOS heckle you and harass you, you know, we wanted

517
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.920
to make this room have some serious impact.

518
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.920
And, you know, I think it did its job pretty well.

519
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.920
And, you know, it's not like any other room in the game, and so I think it really gave

520
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.920
players a sense of satisfaction.

521
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:08.280
And then in terms of a high dramatic moment, putting some time pressure to the puzzle made

522
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:14.280
it so that I only had to write like six minutes of decent dialogue, which is in stark contrast

523
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:20.280
to all our previous attempts, which required me to write infinity minutes of excellent

524
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.280
dialogue.

525
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.280
Which makes Eric crack.

526
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.280
That was a bad time for me, writing infinity minutes of dialogue.

527
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.640
And finally, the easy puzzle.

528
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.640
You know, when all is said and done, Portal is a puzzle game.

529
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.640
But all the things that we learned led us back towards, you know, we need to simplify

530
00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.640
this puzzle.

531
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.640
So adding time pressure and then, you know, having it be a very dramatic room and have

532
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.640
a lot of really interesting points made by GLaDOS.

533
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.640
Scaling back the puzzle allowed players to really absorb this moment and have a good

534
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.640
time.

535
00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
And, you know, honestly, at least for me, there's nothing more frustrating than getting

536
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000
to the finale of a game and not being able to beat that stupid boss battle and see the

537
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
ending of the game, which in our case, we really wanted people to see, or rather hear.

538
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
So we wanted to leave players, you know, with a real sense of satisfaction.

539
00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.360
You know, you scratch that.

540
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:28.360
We wanted players to feel genuinely happy and leave the game with a smile on their face.

541
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.360
So, yeah, we sat down and we kind of made a list of what makes people happy.

542
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:37.360
And then we kind of made a list of what we could put in a game and then put it into Excel

543
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.360
and pivot table.

544
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.360
And the catchy song kind of floated to the top.

545
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.360
And this is Jonathan Colton, who we got to write our catchy song.

546
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.360
Who is wearing his best hat, by the way.

547
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:54.720
And so, you know, when all is said and done, a lot of this actually came out of our constraints.

548
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.720
You know, we had a small team.

549
00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.720
We had a limited amount of time.

550
00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:03.720
And, you know, frankly, we just couldn't make a giant FMV epic finale of Doom.

551
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:08.720
And, you know, the cost to happiness ratio of putting a song over some scrolling text

552
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.720
was really high.

553
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:19.080
So, the moral of the whole thing for us was just try to fully embrace your constraints

554
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.080
as fuel for creativity.

555
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:25.080
Honestly, without the constraints that we had, I truly believe Portal would not be as

556
00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.080
good a game as it turned out to be.

557
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.080
And in addition to that, you know, have faith in yourself.

558
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.080
Have faith in your writing.

559
00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:37.080
And in the skills of your team, because, you know, they're your best resources.

560
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.440
And, once again, playtest, playtest, playtest.

561
00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.440
And when you're done with that, playtest some more.

562
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:49.440
Because, honestly, you will get the most valuable information for your game out of watching

563
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440
your playtest.

564
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.440
And it'll make for a better player experience in the end.

565
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.440
So...

566
00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.800
Thank you.

567
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.800
So we deliberately kind of kept our talk short because, you know, we kind of assumed people

568
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.800
had questions because we keep getting asked questions.

569
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.800
And so, you know, we wanted to just kind of make our point and then leave the floor open

570
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.800
to you guys to, you know, ask us whatever you want.

571
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.800
So, questions?

572
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.800
You...

573
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.800
Is there a microphone?

574
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800
I'm pointing at that guy.

575
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.800
Oh, okay.

576
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.800
Okay, fine.

577
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800
Can you hear me okay?

578
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800
Yeah.

579
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.800
Yeah.

580
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.800
Okay, so my question is, you touched earlier on not using emails or voice recording for,

581
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.800
like, story segments in your environment.

582
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.800
And, you know, most of my experience, however, a lot of successful games use this a lot.

583
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.800
Most notably Resident Evil and most recently BioShock.

584
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.800
And they're all bad games.

585
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.160
Next question.

586
00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.160
Oh, yeah, I have no idea.

587
00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.160
None of these were actually prescriptive.

588
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.160
You know, go for it if you want.

589
00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.160
It was just a personal choice we made.

590
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.160
I think it can work.

591
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.160
I just personally, I don't like...

592
00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160
I don't...

593
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.160
I mean, for me, I don't like to read that much.

594
00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.520
I don't like to read in-games.

595
00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.520
I mean, I like to read books.

596
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.520
But when I'm in a game, I just want it to kind of happen and not have to read that much.

597
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.520
And Eric, you know, we were talking about this before, and Eric made a really good point,

598
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.520
which was, you know, how often do you use a voice recorder to leave secret messages

599
00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.520
for your friends and family?

600
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520
Well, I mean, yeah, that's the thing.

601
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.520
These futuristic games, there's always, like, oh, we're in the future, and everybody's leaving

602
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.520
messages on PDAs.

603
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:49.520
I can go buy a PDA for $8 at Best Buy now, and nobody's using it to deliver messages

604
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.520
to me ever.

605
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.520
So, yeah, we just...

606
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:57.880
So that's our own personal hang-up with those two things, but I think they're fine in games.

607
00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.880
Guys standing with mics?

608
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.880
Oh, there's people with mics.

609
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.880
This isn't plugged in, so if I start to stand here anyway, it'd look like a good place to stand.

610
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.880
Yeah, it's a great place to stand.

611
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.880
Yeah.

612
00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.880
I wanted to ask this question because I thought it was exactly the type of thing that I think

613
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.880
of Eric normally railing against.

614
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.880
Why does GLaDOS have an incinerator in her room, other than just...

615
00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.880
It's actually kind of a funny story.

616
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.240
So the question was, why does GLaDOS have an incinerator sitting in her room?

617
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.240
And the answer is actually kind of fun.

618
00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:36.240
Like, we were talking sort of like a back story, and they wanted to, like...

619
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.240
So they created this giant AI, and they weren't really sure at Aperture Science if she was

620
00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.240
going to go out of control.

621
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.240
So they made this room so that way, you know, if she did completely lose her mind, they

622
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.240
could, you know, incinerate her and get rid of her.

623
00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.240
Right.

624
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.600
There's a red phone in there that is supposed to be...

625
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.600
There was a guy who...

626
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.600
That was his job, to sit there and call somebody if it looked like the AI was going rogue,

627
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.600
and then they'd come and throw it in the thing, and it sadly didn't work.

628
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.600
Nope.

629
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.600
It was bad by Aperture Science.

630
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.600
They're sort of half geniuses, half morons.

631
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.600
Thanks.

632
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:18.600
So you mentioned playtesting as a really critical step, but also not outsourcing it to another group.

633
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.960
How do you go about selecting and acquiring a steady supply of new players throughout

634
00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.960
your process?

635
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.960
How did you guys go about doing that?

636
00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.960
So the question was, how did we go about getting new playtesters all the time to playtest our

637
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960
game?

638
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.960
Do you know how easy it is to go walk out to the nearest GameStop and say, hey, we've

639
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.960
got this game, do you want to come play it?

640
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.960
I mean, you know, the answer is like, yeah, of course.

641
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.960
And also we had, you know, friends and family come in and playtest.

642
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.320
Gabe's kids actually playtested for us.

643
00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.320
You were going to say something?

644
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.320
Oh, just in Valve, there's a lot of people working at Valve who are kind of heads down

645
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.320
on their own projects.

646
00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.320
So we had a lot of people who could just come in, you know, from other parts of the company

647
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.320
as well.

648
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.320
And did you ever have people come back for, like, additional tests?

649
00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:10.320
Or was it sort of a, you test once, and that's all the useful information?

650
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.320
So the question was, do we have people come back and playtest again?

651
00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:20.680
Usually we would have people playtest once, but we had a few playtesters, mainly at Valve,

652
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.680
who seemed to really like Portal and were stubborn.

653
00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.680
So, you know, they wouldn't really get frustrated easily.

654
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.680
So when we would have a puzzle that we wanted to try out that was really, really rough and

655
00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.680
we just wanted to see if the concept was good, we would usually grab one of those guys and

656
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.680
have them sit down and chug through it.

657
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.680
Thank you.

658
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.680
Hi.

659
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:48.040
In the developer commentary, you said there will be more Portal games, and obviously,

660
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:53.040
you know, your first couple sides show, you know, you're having a lot of success.

661
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.040
And when that happens, you get a lot of resources, you will be a little tiny team.

662
00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:03.040
So what kind of, are you, you know, afraid, or how will you overcome the challenge of

663
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.040
not having as many constraints?

664
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.040
And next.

665
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040
You have to say the question.

666
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.400
Oh, so how will we make a next Portal if there is one?

667
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:20.400
How can we keep some of our design philosophies if we have a lot more resources?

668
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.400
And it's a good question.

669
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.400
I don't know.

670
00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.400
I'm scared to tell you the truth.

671
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.400
I don't know how it's going to work.

672
00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.400
I'm trying to just bask in the moment now about people bugging me about the next one.

673
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.400
Just let me enjoy it for one minute.

674
00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.400
No, but seriously, I don't know.

675
00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.760
Yeah, I don't know.

676
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.760
A little bit of a personal flashback for me.

677
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:57.760
But as I remember, toward the end of Narbacular Drop, there is a puzzle where you're required

678
00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:05.760
to aim through one of the doorways and put, you know, a Portal on the wall on the other side.

679
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:16.120
In essence, to shoot through, which was very elegant as a way of pushing the mechanics of the game

680
00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.120
to its limit, I suppose.

681
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:28.120
And I noticed, of course, that in Portal, you chose for one reason or another not to allow

682
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.120
the player to fire the Portal gun through one portal.

683
00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:37.480
And I can think of a couple of reasons why you might have done that, but I was just wondering

684
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:45.480
if it was, I guess, for technical purposes or as part of a larger idea of some sort.

685
00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.480
So the question was, did we...

686
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:52.480
So in Narbacular Drop, we gave players the ability of being able to shoot one portal

687
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.480
through another portal.

688
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.480
And we decided to, you know, not do that for Portal because...

689
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:02.840
Not because it was, you know, technically impossible, technology-wise, you know, impossible.

690
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.840
But more for a design purpose.

691
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.840
Like, you know, we wanted players to learn something in particular in a certain level.

692
00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:16.840
And so giving the players suddenly the ability to bypass all the training that we had tried so hard

693
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:22.840
to construct and, you know, just seemed like shooting ourselves in the foot, essentially.

694
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.840
Thank you.

695
00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:37.840
In the first trailer for Portal, the portals seemed to have sort of an almost liquid quality to them.

696
00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.840
Now they're more like holes in the wall.

697
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.840
Also, they were a blue and a red portal.

698
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.840
And now it's a blue and an orange one.

699
00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.840
What triggered this change?

700
00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.840
So the question was, why did we change the look and color of our portals?

701
00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840
Yeah.

702
00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.200
Well, honestly, we went through just a bunch of just iterations.

703
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:08.200
And as far as blue and orange goes, you know, we liked orange better than red.

704
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.200
I mean, it really just boils down to that.

705
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.200
Like, we liked the color choice better in the end.

706
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.200
And, you know, we left it sort of up to our artists.

707
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.200
Like, you know, what do you want the portals to look like?

708
00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.200
And the liquid quality?

709
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.200
It was kind of like they were rippling at the edges.

710
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:33.560
Yeah, so I think what you're referring to as far as the liquid quality of how the portals were looking was

711
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.560
that was an opening shader for it.

712
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.560
And we just decided to change it.

713
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.560
Like, honestly, it just sort of, we decided one day.

714
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.560
I just wanted to leave a comment.

715
00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.560
I just wanted to thank you guys for the end of the turret level.

716
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.560
The most satisfying thing that I felt in that game was picking up that last turret

717
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.920
and walking into the elevator through the field and watching it just turn into a ball of ash.

718
00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.920
Thank you guys for that.

719
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.920
Yeah, no problem.

720
00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.920
We also really like the way they screen, too.

721
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.920
So I have a question.

722
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.920
I'm a student, and you guys started out as an indie developer.

723
00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.920
So I'm just wondering if you have any suggestions for students and whatnot

724
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.920
who are hoping to get into the game industry and break in like you guys did.

725
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.920
So the question is, do we have any advice for student developers on how to break into the industry?

726
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.920
Make games. Make as many as you can.

727
00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.920
And fail, because honestly, failing, you'll learn a lot of stuff.

728
00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.920
I can't tell you how many times we failed on our game designs working at DigiPen.

729
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.920
Like, yeah, one of them worked out, but we had three others that were not the best games ever.

730
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.920
And honestly, practice makes perfect, right?

731
00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.280
So the more things that you have on your resume and in your portfolio

732
00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.280
to show to game developers that, look, I did all these projects.

733
00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.280
I worked on them from start to finish.

734
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.280
It obviously shows that I have commitment to the project, right?

735
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.280
So make games.

736
00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.280
Whether it be a mod or a student project,

737
00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.280
just make as many as you possibly can and have fun with them.

738
00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.280
Thank you.

739
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.280
Yeah.

740
00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.640
So when I spoke to people that also played Portal about the fire pit puzzle,

741
00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.640
one of the things that we talked about a lot was the fact that

742
00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.640
we felt like we had broken the game somehow by escaping this final ending.

743
00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.640
And that there was this moment of sort of shock and confusion about what to do next

744
00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.640
when you suddenly had gotten past what you imagined was the game's end.

745
00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.640
And that was a very powerful moment in the way that it defied conventional game narrative.

746
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.640
So I'm wondering if that defying of conventional game narrative

747
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
was something that was intentional in the design of the level

748
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
or whether that was just something that was an accidental occurrence from what you set up.

749
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Honestly, that was one of the very first things...

750
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Repeat the question.

751
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Oh, sorry. Well, I forgot the question.

752
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
I was just going to talk about it.

753
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:07.000
No, was it intentional the sort of way that you feel maybe like you've broken the game after the fire pit?

754
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
And I guess there was some unintentionality there

755
00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.360
because that's one thing that virtually never changed.

756
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:19.360
The beats as far as you start in the relaxation vault at some point during the game,

757
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.360
although I think maybe it was earlier in the game at one point,

758
00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.360
you escape the fire pit and then you would eventually meet GLaDOS.

759
00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.360
It was in there before anything.

760
00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.360
I mean, the test levels with no dialogue basically had that structure

761
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.360
just because we had this intuitive feeling that it would work

762
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.360
and it just ended up working better than we thought.

763
00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.360
So we can take some credit for it, but not total credit.

764
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.360
It just worked really well.

765
00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.360
Thank you.

766
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.360
Thanks.

767
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.360
So when I first heard about Portal, I went and played Nervecular, dropped really thoroughly.

768
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.360
And when I played Portal, I noticed there were a lot of similarities.

769
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.360
The one big difference was that Portal had all this humor, a profound amount of humor in it.

770
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.360
And I was wondering what the decision was and how you decided to throw in the comedy.

771
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.360
So the question is, why did we decide to throw in comedy for Portal?

772
00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.360
Nervecular dropped really wasn't that funny.

773
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:18.360
And there's something inherently funny about Portals.

774
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:23.360
Especially, you put both of them on the floor and you drop a box in

775
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.360
and you see it popping out back and forth.

776
00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.360
There's something kind of funny and visceral about it.

777
00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.360
And well, honestly, Eric's really damn funny.

778
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.360
Yeah, well, I mean, given a choice, that was kind of in my comfort zone.

779
00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.720
Like, if my task at Valve was to write stuff for Portal,

780
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.720
if nobody was going to object, I would just make it funny.

781
00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.720
I mean, that would be something I was more likely to succeed at.

782
00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.720
Because you like despairing.

783
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.720
Yeah.

784
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.720
Hi, I have no problems harvesting Adam from Little Sisters.

785
00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.720
I love kicking innocent bystanders through bloody pulp and lots of games.

786
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.720
But why, why, why, why did you have me kill off the companion cube?

787
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.720
So, why did we kill off the companion cube?

788
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.720
Well, I think we explained that in the speech, didn't we?

789
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.720
You can thank the United States Secret Service.

790
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.720
Actually, I don't think it was the Secret Service.

791
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.720
Secreter than the Secret Service.

792
00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.720
I have two questions and the second one's quick.

793
00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.720
The first one is, it sounds like there's a lot of trial and error

794
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:30.720
and rework that went into Portal.

795
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.720
Did you have to do anything to smooth that over with management?

796
00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.080
Set their expectations or anything like that?

797
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:42.080
So, the question is, there's a lot of trial and error with the game, obviously.

798
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:47.080
And did we have to, you know, convince our management that that was perhaps a good idea?

799
00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:54.080
And honestly, the way management works at Valve is a lot different than it does at other game companies.

800
00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.080
We don't really have producers there.

801
00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.080
You know, we have team leads that basically, you know,

802
00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:04.440
maybe do like the administrivious stuff every once in a while and do some PR.

803
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.440
But, you know, honestly, the people working on the game get to make the decisions about the game

804
00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.440
and have direct impact on what they're working on.

805
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.440
And, you know, we found that it just makes for a much more, you know,

806
00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.440
satisfied group of people making games.

807
00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.440
Fantastic.

808
00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.440
Also, like the playtesting, the commitment to playtesting wasn't our insight.

809
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.440
That's the Valve philosophy.

810
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.800
I mean, that's how they make games.

811
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.800
If we hadn't done that, then we would have been in deep trouble.

812
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.800
Okay, fantastic.

813
00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.800
Second question, is GLaDOS still alive and when will we see her again?

814
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800
Who's still alive?

815
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.800
So, the question is, is GLaDOS still alive and when will we see her again?

816
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.800
Well, did you not listen to the last song?

817
00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.800
The song is called Still Alive.

818
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.800
That's kind of a failure of writing if you don't know if she's still alive.

819
00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.800
100% still alive. Thank you.

820
00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:02.800
And as far as when you'll see her again, who knows?

821
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.800
Alright, hi.

822
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.800
I had a question about your development background

823
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.800
and how you guys scored yourself an awesome seat by working with Valve.

824
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.800
So, were you still making a question?

825
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.800
Well, no, go ahead.

826
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.800
How did you score yourself a position to work with Valve?

827
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:26.800
So, the question was, how did we end up hooking up with Valve to make Portal?

828
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.160
So, as far as the team goes, with the exception of Eric,

829
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.160
we were all students at DigiPen Institute of Technology

830
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.160
and we created a game called Nervacular Drop,

831
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.160
which was our student project for our senior year.

832
00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.160
And it was the predecessor to Portal.

833
00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.160
You had two portals on the wall and it was an environmental puzzle game.

834
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.160
And every year DigiPen has an expo for graduating seniors.

835
00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.160
And Valve came by, took a look at our project,

836
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.520
and thought it was interesting enough to drag us over to Valve

837
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.520
and have us present the game to Gabe Newell.

838
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:04.520
And after about 15 minutes through our presentation,

839
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.520
Gabe told us to be quiet and then asked us

840
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.520
what we were planning on doing after we graduated.

841
00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:17.520
And we were like, well, hopefully paying our loans, getting a job, eating food.

842
00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:23.520
And he offered us a job on the spot, essentially,

843
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.880
to come in and create Portal using a source engine.

844
00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.880
And, you know, that's how we ended up there.

845
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.880
And Eric's got a different story.

846
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.880
Yeah, I'd been just doing a lot of writing,

847
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.880
and then I went and I worked at Double Fine for a couple of years.

848
00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.880
And then I left Double Fine and I was just back to freelance writing.

849
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.880
For me, it was just, I got a mail one day from Gabe Newell

850
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.880
and said, do you want to come work at Valve?

851
00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.240
I have another quick question.

852
00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.240
Yeah, go ahead.

853
00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.240
Why didn't you guys submit this to IGF?

854
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.240
It seems like a perfect candidate.

855
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.240
Was it the reason because you guys got picked up by Valve?

856
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:10.240
So, the question was, why didn't we submit the game to IGF?

857
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.240
So, Narbacular Drop actually was in the IGF Student Showcase,

858
00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.240
I think, three years ago.

859
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.240
DigiPen submits the games that they find to be

860
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.240
interesting to Student Showcase and the IGF.

861
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.240
We didn't make the, you know, indie professional,

862
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.240
I guess, section, but we made it to the Student Showcase.

863
00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.240
Thank you.

864
00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.240
Hi, how did the element of cake come into fruition?

865
00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.240
So, the question is, how did the element of cake come to fruition?

866
00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.240
It kind of started off as like an inside joke, sort of.

867
00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.240
I mean, really, it just was one of those things.

868
00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.600
Originally, when we sat down, you guys were showing me the game,

869
00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.600
there was something about cake in there, and it just seemed

870
00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.600
like it's a comedy tool, obsess over one thing

871
00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.600
that maybe you wouldn't expect to obsess over.

872
00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.600
And we just, it really didn't have any deeper meaning than that.

873
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.600
Yeah, we were just kind of having fun.

874
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.600
Fun work, work fun.

875
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.600
Yes, yes, yes. We were working very hard.

876
00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.600
And having fun.

877
00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.960
Yeah, no, no, it was hard work.

878
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.960
Geez.

879
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.960
Conference is turning ugly.

880
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.960
Hey, guys, two quick questions.

881
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.960
First, was there any reasoning behind making, like,

882
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.960
all the characters and the references and GLaDOS quotes and such female?

883
00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.960
So, the question is, why did we decide to make our characters female,

884
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.960
GLaDOS and, you know, the main character?

885
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.960
So, as far as the main character goes,

886
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.960
Gabe actually made a suggestion one day.

887
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.960
We were, at the time, looking to find what we wanted, you know,

888
00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.960
to be the main character, protagonist of Portal.

889
00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.960
And you can see, like, some of our, you know, earlier shots of the game,

890
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.960
there's, like, a balding dude as the main character.

891
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.960
And that was just hemp art.

892
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.960
Like, it was something that we, you know, used a citizen model

893
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.960
from Half-Life 2 and just kind of fixed him up a little bit

894
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.960
and put him in just for our testing purposes.

895
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.960
And then, Gabe came up to us while we were looking to figure out

896
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:19.960
what we wanted our main character to be and said,

897
00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:21.960
well, why don't you make it a girl?

898
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.960
And we're like, all right, sure.

899
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.960
I mean, it really didn't stretch beyond that.

900
00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.960
We sort of, well, what if?

901
00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:29.960
Okay, why not?

902
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:31.960
It's like post-feminist.

903
00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:33.960
It didn't even occur to us not to make it a girl.

904
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.960
It was no big deal.

905
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.960
And as far as GLaDOS, well, there was the awesome GLaDOS pun,

906
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.960
which kind of made it seem like we had to, it had to be female.

907
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:43.960
But really, we knew an actress.

908
00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.320
It's hard because we knew this person was going to have to carry the game.

909
00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.320
So, we needed an actress.

910
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.320
Or actor.

911
00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.320
Or actor, actor or actress, who A, was good,

912
00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.320
and B, wouldn't be offended when, you know, the first third

913
00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.320
of our recording sessions were just us playing her text-to-speech

914
00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.320
and saying, say this exactly like that back to us.

915
00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.320
Because actors hate that sort of thing.

916
00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.320
But she was super nice about it.

917
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.320
And so, that kind of informed that.

918
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.320
Okay.

919
00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.680
And the other one is just to officially shut my friend up.

920
00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.680
Is Chell a cyborg?

921
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.680
No.

922
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.680
Another failure of writing.

923
00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.680
Chell is not a cyborg.

924
00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.680
There's no, she's not a cyborg.

925
00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.680
Those ridiculous shoes.

926
00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:27.680
Cyber shoes?

927
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.680
Yeah, her future shoes.

928
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.680
Hey, this might have already been addressed at some point,

929
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.680
but I got in late, so I have to ask anyways.

930
00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.680
Obviously, Portal was a very short game

931
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.680
that met a lot of very popular demand.

932
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.680
And it was a very popular success.

933
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.680
Do you think this might start making a movement

934
00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.680
back towards the idea of shorter games being on the market?

935
00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.680
I mean, right now, the huge pressure is, you know,

936
00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.680
everybody wants 20 plus, 30 plus, 40 plus hour games

937
00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.680
because everyone wants to get as much out of the game

938
00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.680
as they possibly can for, you know, what they're paying out of their wallet.

939
00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.680
Yeah, I mean, I, oh, sorry.

940
00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.680
Do you think Portal would influence more developers

941
00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.040
to make shorter games because of the,

942
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.040
well, according to the questioner,

943
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.040
people want longer and longer games.

944
00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.040
Although I'm not 100% sure about that.

945
00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.040
You know, everybody at Valve,

946
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.040
all the people I know who play games who are adults now,

947
00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.040
the common complaint is they never finish a game.

948
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.040
You know, nobody ever finishes a game that I know who isn't 14.

949
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.040
They just, they don't have time.

950
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.040
And also, they have 40 hours a week to play World of Warcraft, too.

951
00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.040
Cuts in their gaming time.

952
00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.400
But, so, you know, there are some practical constraints

953
00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.400
on how long we're going to make it.

954
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.400
But, you know, if we could have done anything,

955
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.400
I really wanted to make a game that

956
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.400
everybody who played it would be able to finish.

957
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.400
You know, you'd be able to,

958
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.400
it's weird to be playing these games

959
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.400
or trying to tell a story in a game where

960
00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.400
almost everybody, it just sort of peters out.

961
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.400
You know, you just stop playing at some point

962
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.400
and never finish it.

963
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:04.400
Thank you very much.

964
00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:05.760
Alright. Okay.

965
00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:07.760
Hello. Two-part question.

966
00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:09.760
The first part is,

967
00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.760
you mentioned that a lot of dialogue

968
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:13.760
had been cut from the game.

969
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:15.760
I was wondering if any of it had gotten recorded

970
00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:17.760
and or put through the process

971
00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.760
of being somewhat final for GLaDOS.

972
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.760
And, if so,

973
00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:23.760
is there any chance you could release it

974
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:25.760
on one of your websites?

975
00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:27.760
Because as a member of the portal mapping community,

976
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.760
we would give our eye teeth to have extra GLaDOS dialogue.

977
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.760
So, I think,

978
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.760
so, the question was

979
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.760
how much of final dialogue got cut

980
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.760
and could we release it?

981
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:43.760
So, a lot,

982
00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.760
it wasn't a lot of final dialogue.

983
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.760
Virtually everything went through the text-to-speech

984
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.760
as temp audio.

985
00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:51.760
And a lot of it got cut at that point.

986
00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:53.760
And some of the stuff that got cut,

987
00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.760
you know, a lot of it I'm just not super proud of.

988
00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.760
So, I wouldn't want to give it to anybody.

989
00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.760
And some of it is good.

990
00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.760
And if it is good,

991
00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.120
I'll put it somewhere else.

992
00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.120
Fair enough.

993
00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.120
Not to be mean.

994
00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.120
Yeah, not to be mean,

995
00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.120
but probably the chances are somewhat slim.

996
00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.120
I had to try.

997
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.120
Thank you.

998
00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.120
My question is,

999
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.120
were there any considerations for making

1000
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.120
a multiplayer or cooperative experience?

1001
00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.120
So, the question was,

1002
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.120
were there any considerations for making

1003
00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.120
Portal a co-op or a multiplayer game?

1004
00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.120
Yeah, we thought about it.

1005
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.120
Actually, the,

1006
00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.120
I'm not sure if it's possible or not,

1007
00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.120
but we played around for a little while

1008
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.120
actually having multiple sets of portals.

1009
00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.120
And it is technically possible.

1010
00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.120
We just, you know,

1011
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.120
didn't really have the time to think through

1012
00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120
what would the gameplay be that was fun.

1013
00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.120
You know, sort of the immediate conclusion

1014
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.120
that we actually kind of tried a little bit

1015
00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.120
was, oh my gosh, Portal's in Deathmatch

1016
00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.120
and it's less fun than you think it is.

1017
00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.120
Honestly.

1018
00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.120
It's actually kind of frustrating.

1019
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.120
So.

1020
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.120
Hi.

1021
00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.120
I had a lot of really good advice

1022
00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.120
about keeping it wet,

1023
00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.120
keeping the project wet,

1024
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.120
not getting too attached to ideas

1025
00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.120
and being willing to cut things

1026
00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.120
or make changes later.

1027
00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.120
I'm just wondering how,

1028
00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.120
what your experience was for balancing that

1029
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.120
with the need to get a project done

1030
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.120
and the kind of tendency of a project

1031
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.120
to kind of gain momentum

1032
00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.120
the further it goes along

1033
00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.120
and be harder to make changes later than earlier.

1034
00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.120
So, the question was,

1035
00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.120
how do we temper

1036
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.120
a game,

1037
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.120
you know, the longer you work on it

1038
00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.120
the harder it is to, you know,

1039
00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.120
sort of cut things and

1040
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.120
is that kind of what you were saying?

1041
00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.120
Yeah, okay.

1042
00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.120
You said it better than I do.

1043
00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.120
And play testing.

1044
00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.120
You will know right away

1045
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.120
if your idea is good or bad.

1046
00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.120
You know, if you watch your players

1047
00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.120
and they are just totally frustrated

1048
00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.120
out of your mind

1049
00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.120
and you can't really, you know,

1050
01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.120
necessarily pinpoint ways to fix it,

1051
01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.480
because,

1052
01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.480
so, you know, one of the things that we do

1053
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.480
making our levels at least

1054
01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.480
is we try and get them up and running

1055
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.480
once we come up with an idea,

1056
01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480
okay, we want, you know,

1057
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.480
such and such objectives

1058
01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.480
as we try and get it up and running

1059
01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.480
within like two to five days,

1060
01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480
like really, really fast.

1061
01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.480
And then we start running play tests through it.

1062
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.480
And if we play test it like maybe,

1063
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.480
you know, three or four times

1064
01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480
and we find that it's just really not working out,

1065
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.480
then it's going to the cutting floor

1066
01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.480
and we're going to have to cut it.

1067
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.480
So, we never really got to a point where,

1068
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.480
you know, it was really, really difficult

1069
01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.480
to cut something because,

1070
01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480
you know, we were always play testing

1071
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.480
and getting reinforcement

1072
01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.480
for whether or not our ideas were good or bad

1073
01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480
directly from, you know,

1074
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480
people we consider our customers.

1075
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.480
Thank you.

1076
01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.480
Yep.

1077
01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.480
If your development team were,

1078
01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.480
or your development process

1079
01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.480
were a style of painting,

1080
01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.480
what would it be?

1081
01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.480
Wow.

1082
01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.480
So, if our development process

1083
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.480
were a style of painting,

1084
01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.480
what would it be?

1085
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480
Uh,

1086
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480
uh,

1087
01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480
maybe,

1088
01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480
maybe a,

1089
01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480
gosh, I don't know.

1090
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.480
Yeah, that's a good,

1091
01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.480
cubist painting.

1092
01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.480
Uh, you know,

1093
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.480
you have a good one?

1094
01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.480
Yeah, I'm out of material.

1095
01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.840
Sorry.

1096
01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.840
So, um, Chell obviously has

1097
01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.840
a very good set of DNA

1098
01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.840
and you mentioned that it was

1099
01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840
Gabe's idea to make her female

1100
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.840
and Gordon Freeman has good DNA.

1101
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.840
Is there any?

1102
01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.840
So, the question is,

1103
01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.840
are Chell and Gordon going to hook up?

1104
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.840
Uh, essentially.

1105
01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:50.840
Uh, I don't know.

1106
01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:52.840
I mean, you guys, you know,

1107
01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.840
have access to Gary's mod, right?

1108
01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.840
You can do what you want.

1109
01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.200
Yeah, I was wondering,

1110
01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.200
um,

1111
01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.200
you kept on talking about

1112
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.200
how you cut off a lot of things

1113
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.200
in the narrative and, like,

1114
01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.200
cut off a lot of exposition

1115
01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200
and stuff like that

1116
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.200
and just really streamlined the process

1117
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.200
and I was just wondering,

1118
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.200
do you think that it's possible,

1119
01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.200
I mean, do you think

1120
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.200
there's a way to make exposition

1121
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200
and narrative, like, interesting

1122
01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.200
and fun for the play testers?

1123
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.200
Do you see where we're going to get at?

1124
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.200
Oh, so the question is,

1125
01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.200
do I think there's a way to,

1126
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.200
I think you're saying,

1127
01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.200
is there a way to include a lot more exposition

1128
01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.200
and still make it entertaining?

1129
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.200
I mean, for me personally,

1130
01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.200
I'm sure there's somebody

1131
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.200
who's a genius who could do it,

1132
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.200
but I personally don't,

1133
01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.200
I mean, I like it when there is less.

1134
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.200
Uh, you know,

1135
01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.200
my own personal taste is less.

1136
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.200
Uh, so for me, probably,

1137
01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.200
probably not.

1138
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560
I try and do as little as possible.

1139
01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.560
So you believe that games aren't good at telling,

1140
01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560
like, long expository stories, then?

1141
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.560
Uh, yeah, I guess I'm not good at it,

1142
01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.560
but I'm also not good at sitting through it.

1143
01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.560
I mean, I just don't like it that much in games.

1144
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.560
When I play a game,

1145
01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.560
I like it to be as concise as possible

1146
01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:12.560
because, honestly,

1147
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.560
I'm a game writer,

1148
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.560
but I'm not even 100% convinced

1149
01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560
that games are the best medium

1150
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.560
for, like, telling epic, long stories.

1151
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.560
I kind of think of what I do

1152
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.560
as more of, like,

1153
01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.920
guiding a film score.

1154
01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.920
You know, movies aren't about the music,

1155
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.920
but the music is definitely an important part

1156
01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:31.920
that enhances the experience of watching the movie.

1157
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.920
So the writing is something

1158
01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.920
that enhances the experience of why you're there,

1159
01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920
which is playing the game.

1160
01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920
And honestly, for me,

1161
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.920
there's something to be said

1162
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.920
for leaving things to people's imagination.

1163
01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.920
You don't have to have someone

1164
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920
sitting there next to you dictating to you

1165
01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
exactly what's going on at all times.

1166
01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920
Like, you know, people are smart.

1167
01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:53.920
Give them credit.

1168
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.280
But for me, personally,

1169
01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.280
it's kind of fun just sort of imagining up,

1170
01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.280
you know, what I think some of the storyline is.

1171
01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.280
Thank you.

1172
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.280
Playing through portals,

1173
01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.280
one of the biggest surprises that I had

1174
01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:07.280
was finding references to Black Mesa

1175
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.280
inside of it,

1176
01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.280
and then references to Aperture

1177
01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.280
and the Borealis inside the Half-Life 2 Episode 2.

1178
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.280
Around what point in development

1179
01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.280
did you make the decision

1180
01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.280
to drop portals into the Half-Life universe?

1181
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.280
So the question is,

1182
01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.280
when did we decide

1183
01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280
to, you know, sort of cross-reference

1184
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.280
between the two games of Episode 2 and Portal?

1185
01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.280
Kind of like, you know,

1186
01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.280
maybe in the middle of development or so?

1187
01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.280
Well, middle of development for you,

1188
01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.280
but I think when I came on,

1189
01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.280
that was in the earlier meetings.

1190
01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.280
That was just one of the constraints

1191
01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.280
on the game,

1192
01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.280
initially because I think they weren't sure

1193
01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.280
exactly where they were going to position it,

1194
01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.280
and also because we were still using

1195
01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.280
a lot of Half-Life art.

1196
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.280
So it sort of made sense to tie them together

1197
01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.280
as Portal kind of got its own identity

1198
01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.280
and we worried less and less about it.

1199
01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.280
Like, you know, we're not going to

1200
01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.280
have to have the G-Man appear or something.

1201
01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.280
We can kind of make it a little bit more subtle

1202
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.280
and not have to dwell on it too much.

1203
01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.280
Thanks.

1204
01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.280
Two questions.

1205
01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.280
I have a friend who says

1206
01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.280
that the best games teach us something.

1207
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.280
What do we have to learn from Portal?

1208
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.280
So the question is,

1209
01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.280
what do we have to learn from Portal

1210
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.280
because the best games teach people something?

1211
01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.280
You want to take this one?

1212
01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.280
That's a tough one.

1213
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.280
If anybody has an idea,

1214
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.280
just shout it out.

1215
01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.280
Don't trust anyone with something.

1216
01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.280
Don't trust anyone.

1217
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.280
The cake is a lie.

1218
01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.280
The cake is a lie.

1219
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.280
There's your cake.

1220
01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.280
No, I mean, we definitely wanted to

1221
01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.280
explore the idea of manipulating space

1222
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.280
and thinking about, you know,

1223
01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.280
a 3D space in a different way.

1224
01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.280
And so, you know, throughout Portal,

1225
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.280
we're kind of teaching you to look at

1226
01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.280
a situation in a way that you haven't before.

1227
01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.280
So I don't know if that kind of answers

1228
01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.280
your question.

1229
01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.280
It'll do.

1230
01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.280
Also, I noticed that the companion cube

1231
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.280
was kind of silent.

1232
01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.280
Does it have any dialogue in the sequel?

1233
01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.280
So the question is,

1234
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.280
will the companion cube have dialogue

1235
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.280
in the sequel to Portal?

1236
01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280
I don't know about this sequel

1237
01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.280
that you're talking about.

1238
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.280
This might be a little bit proprietary,

1239
01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.280
but I'm curious.

1240
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.280
How did you guys and Orval

1241
01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.280
figure out, or when did you figure out,

1242
01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280
or was it an evolutionary process,

1243
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280
when you were going to sell the game?

1244
01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.280
So the question is,

1245
01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.280
when did we figure out

1246
01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.280
how we were going to market and sell Portal?

1247
01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280
So when we initially started Portal,

1248
01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.280
it was supposed to be

1249
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.280
just a seriously short game,

1250
01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.280
maybe like, I don't know,

1251
01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.280
15 minutes, just like a quick tech demo.

1252
01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.280
And then the further we got on the game,

1253
01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.280
our constraints would change.

1254
01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.280
And I guess about

1255
01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.280
a year or so after we started,

1256
01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.280
we were like,

1257
01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.640
we're going to sell it.

1258
01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.640
And I guess about

1259
01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.640
the middle of Portal's development,

1260
01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.640
we had started talking about

1261
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.640
doing the Orange Box,

1262
01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.640
and it just sort of

1263
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.640
seemed like a really

1264
01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.640
reasonable conclusion that

1265
01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.640
it should be packaged with

1266
01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640
other games that

1267
01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640
have a lot of clout

1268
01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.640
and are awesome games.

1269
01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.640
And from our standpoint,

1270
01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.640
that's great.

1271
01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:20.640
We were seriously honored

1272
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.640
to do an episode two

1273
01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.640
because we think they're

1274
01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.640
truly awesome games.

1275
01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.640
You said that you used

1276
01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.640
the playtesting as kind of

1277
01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.640
a method by which you tested

1278
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640
whether or not the players

1279
01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640
got the storyline.

1280
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.640
And I wondered,

1281
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.640
as the game length grew,

1282
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.640
how, when you compartmentalized

1283
01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.640
the testing, because grabbing

1284
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640
people for 8-hour or 10-hour

1285
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640
play sessions isn't always

1286
01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640
possible, did you get them

1287
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
through?

1288
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Oh, sorry.

1289
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
How did we get people

1290
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
to experience the entire story

1291
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
if they didn't playtest

1292
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
the whole game?

1293
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Luckily, because Portal

1294
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
was a pretty short game

1295
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
throughout most of its value,

1296
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
at no point was it so long

1297
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
that it would take people

1298
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
8 hours to get through it.

1299
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Please don't hit me in the face.

1300
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Sorry.

1301
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
What was I going to say?

1302
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
So, if somebody didn't finish

1303
01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.360
the game, we didn't take it

1304
01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.360
through, but most of them,

1305
01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.360
we sat and watched them

1306
01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.360
for the entire time

1307
01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.360
and they made it through.

1308
01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.360
I know that this question

1309
01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.360
has kind of been beaten

1310
01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.360
to death a bit, but it

1311
01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.360
was about storyline.

1312
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.360
You're saying less is more.

1313
01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.360
Would you say that that

1314
01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.360
policy applies to other

1315
01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.360
genres besides just Portal,

1316
01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.360
or is it just mostly for

1317
01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.360
that type of niche?

1318
01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.720
I don't know.

1319
01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.720
I don't have a surefire

1320
01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.720
solution for every genre.

1321
01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720
In terms of my enjoyment

1322
01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.720
of a game, less is more.

1323
01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.720
But again, if you're

1324
01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.720
making a giant RPG,

1325
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.720
you probably need to say

1326
01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.720
who begat whom

1327
01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.720
and where the hammer came from.

1328
01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:10.720
So, Portal and Half-Life 2

1329
01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:12.720
have a very different tone

1330
01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.720
in terms of the writing

1331
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.080
and the sort of themes,

1332
01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.080
the thematic elements.

1333
01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.080
If you ever do try and tie

1334
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.080
the universes together

1335
01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.080
and do something with

1336
01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.080
the cross-referencing you've done,

1337
01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.080
do you have any ideas

1338
01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.080
for how you might resolve that?

1339
01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.080
Well, so how do we resolve

1340
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.080
the differences in tone

1341
01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.080
between Half-Life universe

1342
01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.080
and the sort of Aperture universe?

1343
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:40.080
And actually, it was

1344
01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.080
something I thought about

1345
01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.080
and I honestly don't think

1346
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.440
you're seeing GLaDOS, right?

1347
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.440
You're seeing things,

1348
01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.440
even though you're playing a character,

1349
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.440
you're actually kind of

1350
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.440
experiencing the world

1351
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440
through GLaDOS's eyes.

1352
01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440
And so if Chell is out

1353
01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.440
in the Half-Life universe,

1354
01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.440
no action that you took

1355
01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.440
as a player is really

1356
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.440
in direct contradiction

1357
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.440
to anything that would

1358
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.440
happen in the Half-Life universe.

1359
01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.440
Inside the sort of

1360
01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440
Aperture science funhouse,

1361
01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.800
it's a little bit different

1362
01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.400
in terms of the

1363
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.400
art style-wise.

1364
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.400
So I'm not super-duper

1365
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.400
worried about it.

1366
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.400
Is that Paul?

1367
01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.400
Yeah, it is.

1368
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.400
Is there any chance

1369
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.400
of an art book?

1370
01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.400
Say that again, please?

1371
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.400
Is there any chance

1372
01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.400
of an art book?

1373
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.400
Is there any chance

1374
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.400
of an art book?

1375
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.400
I don't know,

1376
01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.360
I haven't seen the

1377
01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.360
GLaDOS battle,

1378
01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.360
which there's some

1379
01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.360
awesome artwork.

1380
01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.360
There's actually a print

1381
01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.360
I think that you can buy of it.

1382
01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.360
Or look at it on the website.

1383
01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.360
But a lot of the other stuff,

1384
01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.360
compared to TF or Half-Life,

1385
01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.360
there isn't a lot of

1386
01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.360
really awesome concept art.

1387
01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.360
I mean, we've got a lot

1388
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.360
of thumbnails and stuff,

1389
01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.360
but there aren't a whole lot

1390
01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.360
of really great pictures

1391
01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.360
that are ratcheted

1392
01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.360
maybe six or so.

1393
01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.360
But essentially,

1394
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.360
we've just got a lot

1395
01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.360
of thumbnails of the

1396
01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360
turrets and the gun

1397
01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.360
and a bunch of other stuff.

1398
01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360
Also, why are the portals

1399
01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.360
ovoid?

1400
01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360
So the question is,

1401
01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.360
why are the portals ovals?

1402
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.360
Well, ovals look better

1403
01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.360
than rectangles.

1404
01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.360
We wanted something

1405
01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.360
to kind of fit the

1406
01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.320
where you can pass

1407
01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.320
through the portal to be.

1408
01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.320
So we kind of just

1409
01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.320
filled an oval

1410
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.320
through the rectangle

1411
01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.320
where the portal

1412
01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320
technically is.

1413
01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.320
The game alludes to

1414
01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.320
a lot of backstory

1415
01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.320
that isn't really

1416
01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.320
fully explained,

1417
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.320
like the fact that

1418
01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.320
you're a test subject

1419
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.320
for no explained reason.

1420
01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.320
How much of that backstory

1421
01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320
is actually written

1422
01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.280
in the game?

1423
01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.280
So the question is,

1424
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.280
how much backstory

1425
01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.280
is there that isn't

1426
01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.280
in the game?

1427
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.280
And there's a fair amount.

1428
01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.280
There's a lot.

1429
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.280
There's a lot of,

1430
01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.280
I don't know,

1431
01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.280
there's probably

1432
01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.280
a 15-page document

1433
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.280
about Aperture Science.

1434
01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:31.280
There's actually a little

1435
01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.280
bit of it is on

1436
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.280
the Aperture Science

1437
01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.280
website kind of hidden

1438
01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.280
in there somewhere.

1439
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.280
And I'd written up

1440
01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280
a bunch of stuff

1441
01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.280
in the beginning

1442
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.280
just to kind of help me.

1443
01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.240
And I sent it to Jonathan

1444
01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.240
too that kind of

1445
01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.240
helped him get into

1446
01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.240
the sort of mindset

1447
01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.240
of the whole thing.

1448
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.240
But yeah,

1449
01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.240
there is a bunch.

1450
01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.240
Hi.

1451
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.240
I think

1452
01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.240
I speak for a lot

1453
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.240
of people on this

1454
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.240
that Portal

1455
01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.240
really was a huge

1456
01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.240
triumph because

1457
01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.240
it was so creative

1458
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240
and it won

1459
01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.240
so many awards

1460
01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.240
and it's got so much

1461
01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:05.240
acclaim

1462
01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.240
and it's so different.

1463
01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.240
I was wondering

1464
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200
if you could talk a little

1465
01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.200
bit on how you think

1466
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.200
that's affecting

1467
01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.200
the community of games

1468
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.200
as a whole.

1469
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.200
So the question,

1470
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.200
so it's like how

1471
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.200
Portal impacts

1472
01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.200
the community of games

1473
01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.200
as a whole?

1474
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.200
Yeah,

1475
01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200
and the approach

1476
01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.200
to making games

1477
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.200
as a creative medium.

1478
01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.200
I don't really know.

1479
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.200
Yeah, I mean it's

1480
01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.200
kind of too early

1481
01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.200
to tell.

1482
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.200
I hope it,

1483
01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.200
I mean,

1484
01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.200
because since we made Portal

1485
01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.200
we made a game

1486
01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.200
that we sort of like.

1487
01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.160
So if I make a game

1488
01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.160
that I think is

1489
01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.160
really cool,

1490
01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.160
I would probably,

1491
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.160
I will probably

1492
01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.160
like them.

1493
01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.160
So that's good.

1494
01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.160
But I mean,

1495
01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.160
you just look at it

1496
01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.160
this year,

1497
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160
it seems like

1498
01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.160
the independent games

1499
01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.160
are

1500
01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.160
Getting really

1501
01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:55.160
awesome.

1502
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.160
Awesome, yeah.

1503
01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.160
They're higher

1504
01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.160
production quality

1505
01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.160
and also higher

1506
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.160
profile.

1507
01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.160
So maybe it'll mean

1508
01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.160
people take risks

1509
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.160
on, you know,

1510
01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.160
more oddball games.

1511
01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.160
Good evening.

1512
01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160
Hello.

1513
01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.160
So I had a question

1514
01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.160
about in terms of,

1515
01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.160
like,

1516
01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.160
the game industry

1517
01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.160
and that sort of media.

1518
01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.160
So my question to you

1519
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.160
as writers and developers

1520
01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.160
of this game is

1521
01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.160
what are your influences?

1522
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.160
What did you look,

1523
01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.160
like,

1524
01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.160
what did you think of

1525
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.160
as inspiration

1526
01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.160
for Portal

1527
01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.160
or inspiration

1528
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.160
to get into the game industry?

1529
01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160
And, you know,

1530
01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.160
how does that influence

1531
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.160
how you attack this game,

1532
01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.160
this project?

1533
01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160
So the question was,

1534
01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.160
do we have any influences

1535
01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160
that kind of inspired us

1536
01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.160
to make Portal

1537
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160
or get into the gaming industry?

1538
01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.160
So,

1539
01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.160
I think that's

1540
01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.160
a really good question.

1541
01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.160
I think that's

1542
01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.160
a really good question.

1543
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160
I think that's

1544
01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160
a really good question.

1545
01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.160
So,

1546
01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.160
for me personally,

1547
01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.160
like every other person

1548
01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.160
on the planet,

1549
01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160
you know,

1550
01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.160
Miyamoto is definitely

1551
01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.160
an inspiration.

1552
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.160
You know,

1553
01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.160
I grew up with

1554
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.160
Nintendo games

1555
01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.160
and I was kind of

1556
01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.160
raised on them.

1557
01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.160
So,

1558
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.160
you know,

1559
01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.160
from an early age,

1560
01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160
like,

1561
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.160
you know,

1562
01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.160
I wanted to be

1563
01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.160
a game designer.

1564
01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.160
And, you know,

1565
01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.160
as far as

1566
01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.160
just kind of

1567
01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.160
interesting games

1568
01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.160
that actually

1569
01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.160
get published,

1570
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.160
you know,

1571
01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.160
Katamari Damacy

1572
01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.160
was a really great one.

1573
01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.160
Do you have

1574
01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.160
any other

1575
01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.160
inspirations?

1576
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.160
Do you have inspiration?

1577
01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.160
Oh, well,

1578
01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.160
direct inspiration

1579
01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.160
for Portal

1580
01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.160
was,

1581
01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.160
there's a book

1582
01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.160
by,

1583
01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.160
who's the Dune guy?

1584
01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160
Frank Herbert.

1585
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.160
Frank Herbert

1586
01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.160
called Destination Void

1587
01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.160
that was,

1588
01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.160
it's about people

1589
01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.160
that,

1590
01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160
clones that go into space

1591
01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.160
and they're

1592
01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.160
tasked with

1593
01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.160
building an AI

1594
01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.160
and there's always,

1595
01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.160
like,

1596
01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.160
this fail-safe mechanism

1597
01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.160
because the AIs

1598
01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.160
always go crazy

1599
01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.160
and kill everyone

1600
01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.160
and they,

1601
01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.160
the crew doesn't really

1602
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.160
know that that's

1603
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.160
what happens

1604
01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.160
and then they blow up the ship

1605
01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.160
and it just fails

1606
01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.160
and fails and fails

1607
01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.160
because the AI goes rogue

1608
01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.160
and they blow up the ship.

1609
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.160
There's,

1610
01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.160
there's like one mole

1611
01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.160
guy in there

1612
01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.160
who knows that he's supposed

1613
01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.160
to blow up the ship.

1614
01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.160
So that was an inspiration

1615
01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.160
for that.

1616
01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.160
The game industry,

1617
01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.160
I just,

1618
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.160
I don't know.

1619
01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.160
Okay.

1620
01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.160
No Isaac Asimov

1621
01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.160
or anything like that?

1622
01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.160
Or,

1623
01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.160
no,

1624
01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.160
you know,

1625
01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.160
I'm honestly not,

1626
01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.160
when I was a kid

1627
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.160
I read a lot of science fiction

1628
01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.160
but I don't read a lot

1629
01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.160
of science fiction now.

1630
01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.160
Interesting.

1631
01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.160
So,

1632
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.160
I'm going to go with

1633
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.160
Robert Sheckley

1634
01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.160
after Robert Sheckley

1635
01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.160
just because he writes

1636
01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160
kind of funny science fiction.

1637
01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.160
Yeah.

1638
01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160
When I was a kid

1639
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.160
I loved his stuff.

1640
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.160
Thank you.

1641
01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.160
Thanks.

1642
01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.160
Oh,

1643
01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.160
you know what,

1644
01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.160
just because we have to

1645
01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.160
catch a plane at some point

1646
01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:20.160
so these,

1647
01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.160
if we can just do these

1648
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.160
three and then,

1649
01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.160
and there's nobody else

1650
01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.160
so that's easy.

1651
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.160
Hey,

1652
01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.160
I have a question

1653
01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.160
specifically for Eric.

1654
01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.160
If the portal design process

1655
01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.160
was an animal,

1656
01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.160
what would it be?

1657
01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.160
That's Anna

1658
01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160
who used to sit

1659
01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.160
right next to me

1660
01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.160
at Double Fine.

1661
01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.160
So,

1662
01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.160
that was her joke question

1663
01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.160
I'm not going to answer.

1664
01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.160
Okay,

1665
01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.160
so my question

1666
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.160
pertains to the current slides.

1667
01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.160
Yeah,

1668
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.160
we were actually waiting

1669
01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.160
for someone to actually

1670
01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.160
ask us what in the world

1671
01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.160
did we put on the slide.

1672
01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.160
What's the significance

1673
01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.160
of the two shots?

1674
01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.160
And if you were

1675
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.160
each one of the characters

1676
01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160
in each of the pictures,

1677
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.160
which would you be?

1678
01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160
Eric's the one crying.

1679
01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160
I don't know,

1680
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.160
it's just,

1681
01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.160
it's friendship

1682
01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.160
and,

1683
01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.160
and fire.

1684
01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.160
Over two pictures

1685
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.160
we just had,

1686
01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.160
we couldn't quite fit

1687
01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.160
into the talk

1688
01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.160
in any meaningful way.

1689
01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.160
So,

1690
01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.160
and we thought

1691
01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.160
they were pretty funny.

1692
01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.160
I think one of those

1693
01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.160
is my,

1694
01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.160
the crying guy's

1695
01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.160
is my Steam community ID too.

1696
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.160
And that's Rudy Ray Moore.

1697
01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.160
That's awesome.

1698
01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.160
Hi,

1699
01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.160
so I was actually

1700
01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.160
wondering about

1701
01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.160
the development team.

1702
01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.160
Because you're female

1703
01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.160
and that's kind of unusual,

1704
01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.160
how many girls

1705
01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.160
are on the team?

1706
01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.160
So,

1707
01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.160
the question was

1708
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.160
how many girls

1709
01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.160
were on the Portal team?

1710
01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.160
There were two,

1711
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.160
myself

1712
01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.160
and one of the artists,

1713
01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.160
Realm Lovejoy.

1714
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.160
Right on.

1715
01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.160
Do you think that

1716
01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.160
that helps in the creativity process

1717
01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.160
in making like a unique game,

1718
01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.160
having that different perspective
