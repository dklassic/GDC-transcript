1
00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:05,874
I'm Kim Swift, and I was a level designer and team lead on Portal.

2
00:00:05,874 --> 00:00:09,137
And I'm Eric Wilpon, and I was a writer on Portal.

3
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:15,583
So, we're here to talk to you today a little bit about our techniques for integrating narrative and design,

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:20,148
sort of phrased as a Portal postmortem, giving examples of what we particularly did.

5
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:26,535
So, in case you were wondering, post-mortem means we will be talking about stuff that's

6
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:27,156
in the game.

7
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:30,838
So if you haven't played the game and you're one of those people that gets all squealy

8
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:36,283
and upset whenever someone tells you something that you hadn't heard about a game, then you

9
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:38,965
might want to leave the room.

10
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:39,405
Or not.

11
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:39,925
That's fine too.

12
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:45,129
So here's what we're going to try and cover today.

13
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,110
First of all, I'm going to make a real brief case of why you should care about anything

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,170
we're going to tell you.

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,411
Secondly, I'm going to go real quickly into our narrative philosophy, which is sort of

16
00:00:55,411 --> 00:01:02,733
our crackpot theory of how gameplay and narrative should be combined.

17
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:07,854
And third of all, we're going to talk about how we took the crackpot theory and tried

18
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:09,694
to apply it to our development process.

19
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,953
So in particular, why should you care about how we did this on Portal?

20
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:21,378
Well, first of all, we had a really small team with about only 10 people at once working on the game.

21
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:23,100
Usually it was anywhere between like 5 and 7.

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,545
And it's been pretty popular and, you know, we're surprised.

23
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:32,948
And, you know, despite the game being kind of unorthodox.

24
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:37,872
So after all is said and done, we actually don't really have any regrets.

25
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:38,573
Unlike this poor guy.

26
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:53,263
So now, why would you care about how we put together a narrative and design?

27
00:01:53,263 --> 00:02:00,248
So by itself, our story wouldn't really make a whole great novel.

28
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:05,272
Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is just really, really funny.

29
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:13,939
He's probably about the funniest man you'll ever meet, just in case you were wondering.

30
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:20,473
And, you know, on its own, the gameplay, it'd be alright, but honestly, a little on the

31
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:25,199
dry side, honestly it would be a race to see which one would fail the fastest on its own.

32
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,105
But because we had a really tight integration of both our story and our gameplay, it seemed

33
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:32,669
to really resonate with people and, you know, it worked.

34
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:40,083
Like Kim said, our team size kind of imposed a lot of constraints on our design choices.

35
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:46,786
So our design methods from the beginning had to be low impact on both our time and energy budgets.

36
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:50,367
But this kind of helped us creatively sidestep a lot of our constraints.

37
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:54,928
For instance, Gladys being a disembodied voice.

38
00:02:55,149 --> 00:03:00,215
might not have actually occurred to us if we'd had a ton of animators and a ton of resources

39
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:03,419
to make her a little robot buddy that followed you around or something.

40
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:12,610
And yet, it kind of turned out to be just the perfect solution to the narrative in Portal.

41
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,493
So here's a crackpot theory.

42
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,422
The idea is that games tell two stories.

43
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:22,666
There's a story story, which is sort of the sum total of the game's dialogue and cut scenes.

44
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:31,193
And then there's the gameplay story, which is the story described by the actions the player takes in the game world.

45
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:38,819
And if you lower the delta between those two stories, the closer you put them together, the more satisfying your game will be.

46
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,580
Or at least that was our theory.

47
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:44,315
There's a lot of games that I think suffer from a high story delta, but this is a game

48
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:49,597
developers conference, if I run down a lot of them, it's going to be like super dick

49
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:49,777
moves.

50
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:51,338
So I'm not going to do that.

51
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:54,620
I'm going to mention one game that I actually like a lot, so it should be non-controversial

52
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,381
and it's also kind of old.

53
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,142
I'm going to mention one game that I actually like a lot, so it should be non-controversial

54
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:00,303
and it's also kind of old.

55
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:07,692
is Clyde Barker's Undying, which is a first-person shooter that was released like six years ago.

56
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:09,312
And it's a good shooter.

57
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:12,994
And regardless of what you may think about his style, Clyde Barker,

58
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:16,215
and that's him wearing a super scary pair of pants,

59
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:20,697
he's a talented writer who actually, in interviews,

60
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:23,718
I think seems to care a lot about the story in his games.

61
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:33,049
So, uh, Clyde Barker's Undying, you play this World War I, uh, war hero who goes to Scotland

62
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:36,654
to visit the castle of one of your, uh, war buddies.

63
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:41,198
and the castle is sort of infested with ghouls.

64
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,700
Yeah, and you're shooting a lot of monsters and there's a lot of death and destruction

65
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,741
all around.

66
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:49,743
But pretty frequently as you're going through the mansion, the game all of a sudden stops

67
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:55,026
to play one of these cut scenes where you sort of calmly interrogate one of the members

68
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:55,526
of the staff.

69
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:57,087
You know, you're sort of, you know, what do you do?

70
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:57,848
How are you doing?

71
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:58,988
How are you feeling?

72
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:00,029
Stuff like that.

73
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:05,532
Meanwhile, at no point does your character just grab the help by the label and say, you know, like,

74
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:09,874
there are monsters five feet around that corner, killing everyone they come across.

75
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,134
You need to run. Now.

76
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:16,097
The two stories make absolutely no sense when you smush them together.

77
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:22,460
And I'm Dying is one of the first times that I remember a good game sort of being

78
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:29,203
undermined by a disconnect between the story the gameplay was telling and the story the story itself was telling.

79
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:40,367
So, with all that in mind, our fundamental Portal narrative design goal was that the story story would never ever intrude or contradict the gameplay story.

80
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:44,087
For us, less was always more, and we were ruthless about it.

81
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:49,288
We were ruthless about trimming the narrative fat, tightening our belts, and then trimming it even more.

82
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:57,390
Portal was going to be a lean storytelling machine if it killed us, and usually it meant killing me, because it was a lot of good lines that had to get cut.

83
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,770
And we're really sorry about that.

84
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,430
Yeah, it was worth it.

85
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:04,793
So, enough about how we feel about games, like, let's talk about how we practically

86
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:06,174
applied these feelings.

87
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:09,315
First of all, we're going to talk a little bit about our playtesting process, which,

88
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:11,776
by the way, in case you were wondering, it's really important.

89
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:15,738
Second, reflecting story in your environment.

90
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:17,659
Next, evolving narrative out of gameplay.

91
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:20,820
And then again, vice versa, evolving gameplay out of narrative.

92
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:27,542
So playtesting is probably the most important thing we ever did on Portal.

93
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:31,984
You know, actually sit down and watch people play your game.

94
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:37,705
Don't just, you know, have some other company playtest the game and then send you a report afterwards.

95
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:42,387
It's, you know, just not going to be as valuable to you as just sitting down,

96
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:47,708
having someone play your game, and you watch them and see how they react to it.

97
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,749
You can find out what your players actually want by watching them.

98
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,789
In the case of Portal, we adjusted our gameplay to what players looked like they needed.

99
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:59,792
Did they need more training, because clearly they were really confused here?

100
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:05,736
Maybe they needed some more reinforcement of what we trained them on, because they wanted

101
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:08,138
to use those new skills.

102
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:13,602
In addition to that, we also adjusted our story to enhance what our players were feeling

103
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:14,383
at that time.

104
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:21,499
Yeah, and frequent playtests help keep us objective about our design decisions.

105
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:26,402
Watching playtests is a great way to expose pretty quickly what isn't working.

106
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:31,905
One rule we had narrative-wise was at the end of a playtest, we would ask playtesters to just...

107
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:34,848
tell us the portal story back beat by beat.

108
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,249
And if they couldn't tell it to us,

109
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:38,071
we took that as a real clear sign

110
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,333
that they just weren't interested, that we were failing.

111
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,636
And the fix for it almost always

112
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:46,618
was just to cut more story, cut more exposition.

113
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:49,341
It usually meant cutting something

114
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:52,864
that initially seemed essential to the story.

115
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:54,565
And as it turned out, it just made it stronger

116
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:56,507
every time we cut something.

117
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:58,068
Says something about the writing.

118
00:07:58,068 --> 00:07:59,049
Oh, I'm sorry.

119
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,671
Another thing is playtest early and often.

120
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:08,638
On the far side there you can see what the first room in the game actually looked like,

121
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:10,560
you know, maybe a couple weeks into development.

122
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,245
And then on the other side you can see what it finally shipped, you know, as.

123
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:21,550
And we literally started playtesting this room the first week that we got to Valve

124
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:29,457
and started working on the game. We, you know, hacked portals together in some horrible way that, you know, we're glad doesn't exist anymore.

125
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:35,042
And we were already making better decisions about what our levels were like.

126
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:40,567
So, I don't know, it's kind of hard to make out, but in the first picture, there's kind of like this shimmery force field,

127
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,628
which was, you know, the original cage for the player.

128
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,313
And we got rid of this pretty quickly because our playtesters, you know, just didn't understand

129
00:08:47,313 --> 00:08:48,254
what it was.

130
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:52,978
They would, you know, walk up to the force field and they, you know, were wondering why

131
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:53,919
they couldn't walk through it.

132
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,442
So they would just kind of like trace the edge of the cage like five times and get really

133
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:58,103
confused.

134
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:01,704
So, we changed it to glass, just to fix that problem.

135
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:08,366
So, you know, not only did our playtesting help us get a better narrative and get better

136
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:11,166
gameplay, it also helped us refine our art direction.

137
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:17,068
You know, as you can notice in the later picture, it's a lot cleaner, it's a lot simpler.

138
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:21,329
We extracted any of the elements that, you know, didn't really have any relevance to

139
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:25,710
the player, and it really helped us teach the players what they needed to know.

140
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:36,139
So, as just kind of a digression, I labeled this slide advice because this is the only one I'm fully behind as advice.

141
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:40,041
Of anything we're going to say today, this is actually good advice.

142
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:44,743
If you're writing a funny game, first of all, God help you.

143
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:46,985
Because it's unpleasant.

144
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:53,568
Because tough guy dialogue is just about as macho the 50th time you hear it as the first time.

145
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:56,069
Whereas funny dialogue is funny once, maybe.

146
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:09,360
About three years ago, I worked on a game called Psychonauts.

147
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,961
Yay!

148
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:14,144
There's more people clapping than bought it.

149
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:17,517
Now I lost my train of thought.

150
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,259
We're going to talk about Double Fine.

151
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,543
Double Fine is kind of structured.

152
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:24,486
Everybody sits in one big room.

153
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:28,270
There's 40 people, maybe, sitting in one big room.

154
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,174
And it's, you know, the two and a half years that I was there,

155
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:35,859
no game development, it's 12 hours a day, 6, 7 days a week.

156
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:41,022
And so I had to sit there in the middle of this pit of people working on Psychonauts,

157
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:48,145
hearing my supposedly funny dialogue blaring out of 40 monitors to just grim, stony silence.

158
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:53,808
And it was just, it was torture. It was psychological torture for me,

159
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:59,431
because Tim wisely had his own office somewhere where you didn't have to hear the grim, stony silence.

160
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:03,636
So, yeah, this is you writing a funny game.

161
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:08,759
You are going to exist in a black cloud of despair

162
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:12,361
for however long it takes you to make the game.

163
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,342
But, so here's the advice.

164
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:20,090
Trust your instincts, try and remember your initial reaction,

165
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,831
people's initial reactions to seeing it,

166
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,593
and do whatever you can do to not despair.

167
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:28,894
But the fourth part, the part that helped us a lot,

168
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:31,135
again, on Portal, is playtest.

169
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:34,096
The more often you playtest, the more often

170
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:37,738
you actually get to see someone, hearing your dialogue,

171
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,079
seeing the game for the first time.

172
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,160
And it, honest to God, whatever the benefits of playtesting

173
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,861
are for the design team, for a writer.

174
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:51,366
But it is the only way really to maintain your sanity during the two or three years

175
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:52,967
it's going to take you to make the game.

176
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:53,708
Or Prozac.

177
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:53,848
Yeah.

178
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:54,648
And I'll, yeah, medication.

179
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:59,672
So another thing we tried to do when we had to cut exposition was to, if we didn't want

180
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:06,698
to cut it all together, was to try and embed exposition in the environment.

181
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:12,303
When we were initially talking about it, we had some email ideas for embedding in an email,

182
00:12:12,303 --> 00:12:16,804
and we were actually using email to talk about putting in an email.

183
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:21,086
And at some point, we discovered that reading email wasn't actually that fun.

184
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:23,007
He's like, did you enjoy reading that last email?

185
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:26,768
I was like, no, it wasn't that exciting. We probably shouldn't put it in the game.

186
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,656
So that was one of our rules.

187
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:31,918
And the idea was try and be creative about reflecting the

188
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,559
story in the environment.

189
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,522
And again, easy to say be creative, but if you apply a

190
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:40,004
rule set and then you're ruthless about the rules, it's

191
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:42,906
amazing how creative you can get in a big hurry if it's a

192
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:46,809
choice between coming up with some novel way to embed your

193
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:49,050
exposition in the environment and simply

194
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:49,651
cutting it all together.

195
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:54,709
So what we did in Portal, at least one of the things we did, was to have these little

196
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:57,490
wall scribblings in the behind-the-scenes areas of the game.

197
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,991
And honestly, these were really quick and easy to do.

198
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:02,293
They really only took one or two days tops.

199
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,794
And they were pretty effective at telling a story.

200
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:05,374
So here's an example of the room.

201
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:16,207
put yourself in the position of your characters. What would they do in the situation of the

202
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:21,868
game? So in this case, we had this idea for a character that we called the Ratman. And

203
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:26,649
you know, he was supposed to be a fellow escaped test subject just like you, and he's, you

204
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:32,311
know, a little loopy. And we originally wanted you to actually meet this NPC at some point

205
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,731
in the game, but you know, we had two artists.

206
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:38,953
It wasn't really feasible.

207
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:44,676
So rather than just sort of cut our backstory on this guy, we decided to manifest him here

208
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:45,536
in these rooms.

209
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:52,439
So I asked myself, if I was trapped inside an insidious facility, bent on my destruction,

210
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:55,781
run by a homicidal AI, what would I do to pass the time?

211
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:03,592
So, another big tool we used was to try and evolve our narrative out of gameplay.

212
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:08,096
Like Kim said, we tried to write to enhance what playtesters were feeling,

213
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:11,600
which required me to try and keep the story as wet as possible.

214
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,685
It was a big, big hurdle to overcome to just not get attached to any piece of writing.

215
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:21,029
And, you know, because it was just going to disappear at any given time,

216
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,690
and we'd have to think up something else.

217
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:24,486
And the same goes for gameplay too.

218
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:25,967
Don't get too attached to anything.

219
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,288
Like, you know, you might need to cut it

220
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:30,690
and it's probably for the best.

221
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,652
So here's an example of that, like,

222
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,673
the way to companion cube.

223
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,695
So we're gonna talk about this first

224
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:39,357
from a game design standpoint of one day,

225
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:41,438
we sat down and decided we wanted to make

226
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:43,240
what we called the box marathon level.

227
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,941
So where essentially you've got your cube

228
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:46,442
at the beginning of the map,

229
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:47,723
and then you take it all the way through

230
00:14:47,723 --> 00:14:49,264
to the end of the map and put it on a button.

231
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,426
It's supposed to be a big, long obstacle course.

232
00:14:52,427 --> 00:15:00,718
So the first thing that we tried was having sort of this moving platform, you know, over a goo pit where you'd have to stand on it with your box and avoid stuff.

233
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:03,862
Kind of similar, actually, to the last test chamber that we shipped.

234
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:08,329
And you know what? It pissed players off to no end.

235
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:12,331
They would end up destroying the box by dropping it in the goo,

236
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:14,992
and they'd get really annoyed because they had to go back to the beginning of the map,

237
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:19,714
and they didn't really want to carry this stupid thing with them everywhere.

238
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:21,655
So we went back to the drawing board.

239
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:26,357
The first thing we did was remove the moving platforms over the goo,

240
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,258
so you couldn't destroy the box,

241
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:33,180
and we added more gameplay events where having the box is necessary for you to solve the puzzle.

242
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:35,833
So here's a couple of examples.

243
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:41,478
On one side there, you can see that we used the cube to kind of make a dynamic set of

244
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:43,721
stairs there to get up those platforms.

245
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:48,445
And then on the other side, it's a puzzle where you have to put the box on one of these

246
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:53,831
buttons and then go stand on another button and get this energy ball through those doors

247
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:54,631
into a catcher thing.

248
00:15:55,382 --> 00:16:00,129
And these worked pretty well in terms of making players at least somewhat take the box with

249
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,834
them and not hate it.

250
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,717
But, you know, players were still kind of forgetting it.

251
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:09,463
They'd leave it at one puzzle and then go to the next puzzle and go, oh crap, and then

252
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:11,445
have to go back to the beginning and grab their box.

253
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:19,329
So, we said, okay, maybe if we redesign this room so that way you're always kind of facing

254
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:20,550
this button and taking a look at it.

255
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,893
So, that worked pretty well, at least to remind players, by the way, you need this at the

256
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:26,413
end of the map.

257
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,251
But, you know, we needed something else.

258
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:31,813
Like, players really weren't getting that attached to the box,

259
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:36,656
and there were still a few people that would kind of forget it behind, and...

260
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:38,477
So, Eric to the rescue, over here.

261
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:41,359
Though, as much as possible, we tried to, you know,

262
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:43,941
put hints for our players, you know, in the environment,

263
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:46,762
whether it be through lighting or geometry,

264
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:48,924
you know, when all else fails,

265
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,966
great dialogue really was a great tool for us to give a hint to the player.

266
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:59,973
Yeah, I'd been reading, luckily, these declassified government interrogation manuals.

267
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:02,175
And one of the things...

268
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:03,677
They're awesome. I recommend them.

269
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:04,097
They put it up on the...

270
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:04,978
They're really cool.

271
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:12,845
But one of the things they talked about was that isolation leads interrogation subjects

272
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:16,109
to start becoming attached to inanimate objects.

273
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:19,150
And kind of just something clicked.

274
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,892
It was like, well, you're sort of alone this whole time.

275
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:26,074
And maybe if Gladys psychologically

276
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:28,555
needles you a little bit, it would work.

277
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,697
And crazily, I mean, they know what they're doing.

278
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:33,138
They're government interrogation specialists.

279
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:33,578
They were right.

280
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:34,579
Yeah, it totally worked.

281
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:35,799
It's super duper worked.

282
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:38,341
No one ever forgot their box after we put in that dialogue,

283
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:38,841
that's for sure.

284
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:42,925
And sort of as an afterthought, we put these pink hearts,

285
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:45,846
they're so pretty, on the cube just to kind of cue back

286
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,406
to the dialogue that there's something special

287
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:49,106
about this box and you should take it with you

288
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:50,807
and take care of it.

289
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:53,207
Yeah, that worked.

290
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:58,088
And honestly, this was a really great thing for us

291
00:17:58,088 --> 00:17:59,488
just because it had a dual function

292
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:02,429
as far as the ending of this map went.

293
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:05,430
And the first thing is, well,

294
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:11,707
At the time that we were finishing up this map, we were also working on our ending boss battle,

295
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:13,251
and we had settled at the time on...

296
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:19,707
just disintegrating these little parts of Gladys.

297
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:23,610
And we had an incinerator in the map, and we didn't train our players.

298
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,953
So obviously they had no idea what they were doing, and they'd have to press this switch

299
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:31,955
to open up the incinerator, and they just completely ignored it.

300
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:34,357
And then they would wander around the room and get really angry at us.

301
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:39,860
So we obviously had to train them somewhere, and we had a great idea of where to put the

302
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,020
training.

303
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:46,043
Yeah, originally up until almost the last minute at the end of the companion cube level,

304
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,344
you just had to just leave the companion cube.

305
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:52,485
You had to abandon it because you couldn't bring it with you into the elevator

306
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:56,066
and GLaDOS made some reference to it being euthanized.

307
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:59,987
And it was sort of sad, but it wasn't really a good ending to the level.

308
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:08,428
So putting the incinerator there and having you be forced to euthanize it was just an awesome way to end it.

309
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:14,285
And in addition to that, it was also a great place to train the player because there was no stress.

310
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:15,286
There was no pressure for...

311
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:17,149
What about the stress of killing him?

312
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:18,551
Well, yeah, it was a little stressful.

313
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:22,884
But more like, you know, there was nothing shooting at you or, you know, they didn't

314
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:25,926
have a clock ticking down, like, oh my god, I've got to do this in ten seconds.

315
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:31,930
And we did that because, well, players do not learn anything when they're completely

316
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,510
stressed out.

317
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,412
Like, they just won't absorb anything.

318
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:38,334
So putting the training there was pretty good.

319
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:44,719
Also, it provided a really great point to our narrative as well because, you know,

320
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:49,744
you get to incinerate Gladys the same way she made you incinerate your best friend.

321
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:55,151
Yeah, the whole companion cube saga was just a really great example of how the gameplay

322
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:59,276
kind of influenced the story, which then turned around and influenced the gameplay.

323
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:05,283
Okay, so having said all that about how it's gameplay, gameplay, gameplay, no narrative,

324
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:12,628
we did reach a point where we discovered that gameplay wasn't really working by itself.

325
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,010
And this was the original ending of Portal.

326
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:23,491
Honestly, the biggest obstacle to us when making Portal was our ending boss battle.

327
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:27,512
You know, we look at other games, okay, we know what a boss battle will look like in

328
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:33,654
a first-person shooter or an RPG, but what in the world is a boss battle going to look

329
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:36,015
like in a weird environmental puzzle game?

330
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:40,757
Yeah, the first thing you'd think, or at least the first thing we thought, was that the boss

331
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:44,318
monster for a puzzle game should be a deviously complex puzzle.

332
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,552
And that sort of innocuous sounding conclusion

333
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:51,515
really just gave us a lot of headaches and pain.

334
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:54,838
So we're gonna show you a few examples

335
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:57,360
of some things that we tried as boss battles

336
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,223
and eventually abandoned for one reason or another.

337
00:21:01,223 --> 00:21:03,865
So the first one that we tried was James Bond lasers.

338
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:13,580
So, literally, they were big giant lasers that would follow the player around trying

339
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,341
to zap them.

340
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:17,263
And obviously we cut this.

341
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:18,503
Here's, I know, aren't they pretty?

342
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:19,204
Isn't that nice?

343
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:26,108
These are training maps that we had for the James Bond style lasers.

344
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:31,334
where essentially you'd have to place your portal in front of the laser and then place

345
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:35,078
one on a wall and then redirect the laser at that weird orange thing sitting in that

346
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:35,659
glass wall.

347
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:40,295
and you know, break through and be able to get to the other side

348
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:41,675
where you would meet GLaDOS.

349
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:46,337
That's GLaDOS there in her giant shimmery cube phase.

350
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,258
Don't you love temp art? It's great stuff.

351
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:53,580
And once again, you'd have to redirect those lasers at those, you know,

352
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,381
which you find out are orange plugs supplying GLaDOS with power.

353
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:00,562
And, you know, the end.

354
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,395
Yeah, it was not good.

355
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:08,278
The lasers were extremely boring to dodge and kind of difficult to tune because we would

356
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:12,621
make them follow the player kind of fast and then it would be unfair and if we slowed them

357
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:14,723
down then they're boring.

358
00:22:14,723 --> 00:22:18,646
They were also really difficult to aim, believe it or not, through a portal.

359
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:19,946
It was kind of a pain.

360
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:22,929
And it was also hard to tell if you were hit by the lasers too.

361
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:28,092
So we abandoned this idea and instead chose to use a rocket launcher.

362
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:36,403
So, uh, the second attempt that we had was Portal Combat.

363
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:45,306
Um, sorry, I had fun with Photoshop one day.

364
00:22:45,306 --> 00:22:52,869
Um, so, uh, you know, we had a lot of players, uh, you know, test our game that were hardcore first-person shooter players.

365
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:57,571
So they were like, we need more action, and, and, uh, you need to jump around and be a crazy portal ninja.

366
00:22:57,571 --> 00:23:00,032
And, and so we were like, yeah, okay, sure, we'll give it a shot.

367
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,862
And, uh, you know, it didn't really work out very well.

368
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:07,848
Uh, here's a picture of a level that we actually shipped in the game.

369
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:11,298
And this is what it originally looked like.

370
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:14,659
So this was supposed to be the first time that you would meet GLaDOS.

371
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,440
And you can see that there's a rocket launcher there.

372
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,080
We had put it in at that point.

373
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,822
And you would have to redirect your portal, you know, port, bleh, redirect the rockets

374
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:27,743
and use your portals to, you know, shoot GLaDOS in the face.

375
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:29,683
But then that's GLaDOS, yeah.

376
00:23:29,683 --> 00:23:32,724
She's a bunch of roller minds.

377
00:23:32,724 --> 00:23:37,025
So you know, this was, you know, it was okay.

378
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:40,383
But we then made it a little bit more complex.

379
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:45,265
So she would rise to the top of this room, and then all of these little pillboxes would

380
00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:48,966
pop open with turrets in them, and the rocket launcher was still on, and you'd have to try

381
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:51,106
and redirect the laser and hit her again.

382
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:56,648
And all the meanwhile, the turrets are firing at you, the rocket launcher's firing at you,

383
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:57,308
and it's just not fun.

384
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:02,071
So, yeah, the high-intensity gameplay sucked.

385
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:06,473
In fact, it sucked so bad that I'm talking when you're supposed to be reading.

386
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:06,793
Is that true?

387
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:07,414
No, no, it's all right.

388
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:08,854
Anyway, I'll finish.

389
00:24:08,854 --> 00:24:09,375
It sucked.

390
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:09,875
It was bad.

391
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:13,237
It sucked so much, I'm not going to let Kim talk about it.

392
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:14,978
It sucked because I hated it so much.

393
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:20,420
No one paid attention to GLaDOS, any of her dialogue, because there was just way too much

394
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,121
stuff going on.

395
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:25,923
And we had playtesters who'd come in who were sort of hardcore Counter-Strike or Shooter

396
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:26,203
fans.

397
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,666
and they were able to bring a little bit of enjoyment out of it,

398
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,828
but the vast majority of our playtesters,

399
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:36,153
who had sort of gotten used to the slower-paced cerebral nature of Portal,

400
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:40,338
were just frustrated and confused and dissatisfied,

401
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:43,901
which was absolutely not the way we kind of wanted to send them out the door.

402
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:48,546
So the final attempt was to have a chase sequence.

403
00:24:53,587 --> 00:24:55,488
And that's Gladys there as the kitten.

404
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:56,229
Isn't she cute?

405
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:59,571
So here's kind of what that looked like.

406
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:04,954
This is actually a continuation of the previous section where Gladys would rise up to the

407
00:25:04,954 --> 00:25:05,594
top of the ceiling.

408
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:09,957
Well, after you hit her with the second rocket, she'd rise up even more and would zoom down

409
00:25:09,957 --> 00:25:10,797
this hallway.

410
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:16,072
And you would actually have to follow her, and by, you know, flinging a couple times

411
00:25:16,072 --> 00:25:18,713
and getting up into this hallway.

412
00:25:18,713 --> 00:25:24,355
And honestly, the pacing was just horrible because, you know, players wouldn't necessarily

413
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,255
see where she would go, and so they...

414
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:27,916
didn't know where they were going.

415
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,957
So they would wander around for a while,

416
00:25:29,957 --> 00:25:31,478
and they'd eventually realize,

417
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:34,459
oh, I don't think I've been there before,

418
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:35,740
and kind of get up there.

419
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,880
But if it's a chase sequence,

420
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,561
it's supposed to be action-packed.

421
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:40,022
You're supposed to be going, going, going,

422
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:42,003
and instead players are just wandering around confused.

423
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:48,035
And then once you actually got up into this hallway, we wanted to make it seem like,

424
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:52,818
oh, Gladys had sprung some sort of trap and to kill you.

425
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:56,961
So we had all these pistons kind of like break out of the walls and, you know, try and crush

426
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:59,683
you or, you know, block you from getting further.

427
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,146
And we also, you know, had these turrets and stuff pop down from the ceiling.

428
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:06,268
And if you actually played the game, you can see that these hallways are kind of similar

429
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:06,929
to what we shipped.

430
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:08,070
We, you know, we took a lot of stuff out.

431
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,330
Because...

432
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,951
Yeah, this I'm not even going to bother reading down.

433
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:17,094
This failed in every way it's possible for a level like that to fail.

434
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:20,055
It had bad pacing.

435
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:22,037
Players didn't really know what was going on,

436
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:24,999
was Gladys making the pistons come out at you,

437
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:28,041
and every solution we came up with to try and fix those

438
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:32,463
were either too expensive for us to do or just made the gameplay even worse.

439
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:38,362
So, complex boss battle, yeah, it didn't work.

440
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:40,624
And the thing that we actually learned from all this

441
00:26:40,624 --> 00:26:44,147
was that the more complex that we made our puzzles,

442
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:46,689
the slower the pacing actually got

443
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,030
because players would have to stop

444
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,972
and think about what they were gonna do next.

445
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:54,594
And, you know, if you watch an action movie and you get to the climactic sequence, there's

446
00:26:54,594 --> 00:26:56,474
something happening all the time.

447
00:26:56,474 --> 00:27:02,316
And in our game, when we wanted it to be climactic because we made everything more complex, it

448
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:05,217
did the opposite thing than what we expected.

449
00:27:05,217 --> 00:27:14,441
So it's funny to us now, but we were desperately screwed at this point because Episode 2 was

450
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:18,162
winding up and TF, after 10 years, was going to beat us out.

451
00:27:21,075 --> 00:27:23,115
And, you know, the episode two guys are running around,

452
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:25,636
they're like, our final battle is going to be 100 striders,

453
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:27,056
and you're going to be driving a car

454
00:27:27,056 --> 00:27:28,797
and running into little mini striders.

455
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:31,157
They're like, what are you guys doing?

456
00:27:31,157 --> 00:27:31,517
Like, it's a secret.

457
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:35,758
So, but again, once again,

458
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:39,299
our old friend play testing helped us.

459
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,180
There was a point, and we,

460
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,300
I don't know why we didn't realize it earlier on,

461
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,501
but there was one piece of feedback that we were getting,

462
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:49,642
that there was a point in the game that play testers felt,

463
00:27:49,642 --> 00:27:50,062
excuse me,

464
00:27:50,858 --> 00:27:53,219
was both climactic and satisfying.

465
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:54,419
And it's the fire pit.

466
00:27:54,419 --> 00:28:00,082
It happened about two-thirds of the way through the game.

467
00:28:00,082 --> 00:28:02,983
The testing proper, the regular testing...

468
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:05,764
Hold on, I'm going to take a drink of water.

469
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:09,666
It was almost over and GLaDOS is kind of talking you out.

470
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:13,108
You're riding this platform into a fire pit.

471
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:18,037
and you eventually escape out of here.

472
00:28:18,037 --> 00:28:22,978
But playtesters were just consistently telling us,

473
00:28:22,978 --> 00:28:26,819
not only was this dramatic and exciting,

474
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:30,039
they kept telling us that it was actually like,

475
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:35,561
it was a really tough puzzle that I felt super satisfied to solve,

476
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:41,942
which absolutely made no sense to us.

477
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:43,102
Because...

478
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:48,348
That's a good picture.

479
00:28:48,348 --> 00:28:48,788
Yeah, I know.

480
00:28:48,788 --> 00:28:51,189
It's a good picture.

481
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,431
Portal 2 is just going to be this picture over and over.

482
00:28:54,431 --> 00:29:02,096
When it comes right down to it, at that point in the game, that's about the easiest puzzle

483
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:02,597
in Portal.

484
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:07,780
You place a portal on the wall next to the fire pit, and then you place one in the safe

485
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,841
area, and you just hop through it.

486
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:10,181
That's it.

487
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:15,488
So we then had to sit down and reflect.

488
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:19,069
Like, what in the world made this so climactic?

489
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:21,050
And one of the things that we learned was that,

490
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,651
well, it had time pressure.

491
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:24,271
You know, there was only a limited amount of time

492
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:25,372
while you were on that platform

493
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,852
before you were gonna get burned alive

494
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,914
to place your portals and escape.

495
00:29:29,914 --> 00:29:30,634
And, you know, as I.

496
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:35,357
I think I've said before, you know, time pressure makes people think something that is a lot

497
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,018
more complicated than it actually is.

498
00:29:38,018 --> 00:29:40,720
Another thing was it had a really high visual impact.

499
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,083
I mean, you can't really go wrong with a platform heading straight into a giant pit of fire

500
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,603
for visual impact.

501
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:50,706
And you know, it's something that our players had never seen before in the game, and so

502
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:51,666
it was, you know, something new.

503
00:29:51,863 --> 00:29:55,866
It was also a dramatic high point because for the first time,

504
00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:59,910
GLaDOS is pretty openly trying to kill you.

505
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:05,874
And also for the first time, you're able to assert a little bit of control over your environment and escape from her.

506
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:12,079
And like Kim was saying, all of those three things combined made it so that an easy puzzle

507
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,521
was sort of feeling like a much more complicated puzzle.

508
00:30:16,402 --> 00:30:23,147
which led us to the realization that we'd been holding on to this idea that we needed a complex puzzle at the end,

509
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:24,688
and it simply just wasn't true.

510
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,462
So here's what we actually shipped in the game as boss battle.

511
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:34,486
You can see Gladys there with her little personality spheres and then next to her was a hatch where

512
00:30:34,486 --> 00:30:39,629
a rocket launcher would pop up and you'd have to reorient the rockets and hit Gladys, take

513
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:45,293
one of those spheres and then put it in the incinerator by, you know, getting to the activation

514
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:49,936
switch with your portals and then getting back to the incinerator and tossing it in

515
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:50,656
the end.

516
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:50,796
Done.

517
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:57,351
So taking the four lessons we learned, this is how we applied them to the final Gladys battle.

518
00:30:57,351 --> 00:30:59,671
First of all was time pressure.

519
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:03,313
We were ourselves under some time pressure, so instead of getting fancy,

520
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:07,094
we actually just had a timer counting down to something that would kill you.

521
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:10,916
And we decided that thing that would kill you would be some neurotoxin

522
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:18,639
because it was also really cheap just to make a green particle system.

523
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:19,920
You laugh, but it's seriously true.

524
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,040
100% true.

525
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:24,094
So, you know, visual impact.

526
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:27,374
Well, on one side of the screen, you know, on the far side over there,

527
00:31:27,374 --> 00:31:31,575
you can see a piece of concept art that an artist at Valve, Jason Braschel, did for us.

528
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:32,876
Thanks, Jason.

529
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,857
And on the other side there, you can see what we actually shipped.

530
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:39,037
So everything in this room, visually, is pointing at Gladys.

531
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:43,138
You know, got the geometry of the stairs leading up to her, got all the lights pointing at her.

532
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:48,340
And, you know, after all this time of hearing Gladys heckle you and harass you, you know,

533
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,481
we wanted to make this room have some serious impact.

534
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:54,362
And you know, I think it did its job pretty well.

535
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:56,082
And you know, it's not like any other room in the game.

536
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,943
And so I think it really gave players a sense of satisfaction.

537
00:31:58,943 --> 00:32:01,024
And then in terms of a high dramatic moment, putting some time pressure.

538
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:13,836
to the puzzle made it so that I only had to write like six minutes of decent dialogue,

539
00:32:13,836 --> 00:32:18,139
which is in stark contrast to all our previous attempts,

540
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:22,923
which required me to write infinity minutes of excellent dialogue.

541
00:32:22,923 --> 00:32:24,805
Which makes Eric crack.

542
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:28,448
That was a bad time for me, writing infinity minutes of dialogue.

543
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:31,410
And finally, the easy puzzle.

544
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,173
You know, when all is said and done, Portal is a puzzle game,

545
00:32:35,173 --> 00:32:38,816
but all the things that we learned led us back towards,

546
00:32:38,816 --> 00:32:40,517
you know, we need to simplify this puzzle.

547
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:43,299
So adding time pressure and then, you know,

548
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:45,000
having it be a very dramatic room

549
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,101
and have a lot of really interesting points

550
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:50,043
made by Gladys, scaling back the puzzle

551
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:52,345
allowed players to really absorb this moment

552
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,126
and have a good time.

553
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:59,891
And, you know, honestly, at least for me, there's nothing more frustrating than getting

554
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:05,657
to the finale of a game and not being able to beat that stupid boss battle and see the

555
00:33:05,657 --> 00:33:10,242
ending of the game, which, in our case, we really wanted people to see, or rather hear.

556
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:21,638
So we wanted to leave players with a real sense of satisfaction.

557
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:23,659
And you know, you scratch that.

558
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:28,922
We wanted players to feel genuinely happy and leave the game with a smile on their face.

559
00:33:28,922 --> 00:33:32,844
So yeah, we sat down and kind of made a list of what makes people happy.

560
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,946
And then we kind of made a list of what we could put in a game

561
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:38,347
and then put it into Excel and pivot table.

562
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:44,576
Our catchy song kind of floated to the top, and this is Jonathan Colton, who we got to

563
00:33:44,576 --> 00:33:45,697
write our catchy song.

564
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:47,357
He was wearing his best hat, by the way.

565
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:54,439
And so, you know, when all is said and done, a lot of this actually came out of our constraints.

566
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:59,041
You know, we had a small team, we had a limited amount of time, and, you know, frankly, we

567
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:03,162
just couldn't make a giant FMV epic finale of Doom.

568
00:34:03,162 --> 00:34:09,104
And you know, the cost to happiness ratio of putting a song over some scrolling text

569
00:34:09,104 --> 00:34:10,045
was really high.

570
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:20,523
So the moral of the whole thing for us was just try to fully embrace your constraints as fuel for creativity.

571
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:26,969
Honestly, without the constraints that we had, I truly believe Portal would not be as good a game as it turned out to be.

572
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:33,056
And in addition to that, you know, have faith in yourself, have faith in your writing, and

573
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:38,279
in the skills of your team, because, you know, they're your best resources, you know.

574
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:43,821
And once again, playtest, playtest, playtest, and when you're done with that, playtest some

575
00:34:43,821 --> 00:34:49,104
more, because honestly, you will get the most valuable information for your game out of

576
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:52,745
watching your playtest, and it'll make for a better player experience in the end.

577
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:52,785
So...

578
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:15,169
So we deliberately kind of kept our talk short because we kind of assumed people had questions

579
00:35:15,169 --> 00:35:17,151
because we keep getting asked questions.

580
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:22,795
And so we wanted to just kind of make our point and then leave the floor open to you

581
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:29,200
guys to ask us whatever you want.

582
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,841
So questions?

583
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,042
Is there a microphone?

584
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,121
Oh, okay.

585
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:32,401
Okay, fine.

586
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:34,482
Can you hear me okay?

587
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:34,822
Yeah.

588
00:35:34,822 --> 00:35:35,102
Yeah.

589
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:40,885
Okay, so my question is, you touched earlier on not using emails or voice recording for

590
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:43,226
like story segments in your environment.

591
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:49,850
And you know, most of us probably agree, however, a lot of successful games use this a lot,

592
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,932
most notably Resident Evil and most recently Bioshock.

593
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:58,388
And they're all bad games.

594
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:05,811
Next question.

595
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:15,436
Oh, yeah, I have no idea. None of these were are actually prescriptive, you know, go go go for it

596
00:36:15,436 --> 00:36:19,258
If you want it, it was just a personal choice we made I think it it can work

597
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:23,541
I just personally I don't like I don't I mean for me, I don't like to read that much

598
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:25,042
I don't like to read in games

599
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:27,383
I mean, I like to read books, but when I'm in a game

600
00:36:27,383 --> 00:36:30,986
I just want it to kind of happen and not have to read that and and Eric

601
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:34,128
you know we had talking about this before and Eric made a really good point which was

602
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:37,951
How often do you use a voice recorder to leave secret messages for your friends and family?

603
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:38,991
Well, I mean, yeah, that's the thing.

604
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:44,216
These futuristic games, there's always like, oh, we're in the future, and everybody's leaving messages on PDAs.

605
00:36:44,216 --> 00:36:50,981
I can go buy a PDA for $8 at Best Buy now, and nobody's using it to deliver messages to me ever.

606
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:57,546
So, yeah, we just – so that's our own personal hang-up with those two things, but I think they're fine in games.

607
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:01,029
Uh, guys standing at the microphone.

608
00:37:01,029 --> 00:37:01,889
Oh, there's people at the mic.

609
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:05,872
This isn't plugged in so if I start to stand here anyway, it'd look like a good place to stand.

610
00:37:05,872 --> 00:37:08,553
Yeah, it's a great place to stand.

611
00:37:08,553 --> 00:37:08,853
Yeah.

612
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:13,777
I want to ask this question because I thought it was exactly the type of thing that I think of Eric normally railing against.

613
00:37:13,957 --> 00:37:17,879
Why does GLaDOS have an incinerator in her room?

614
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:18,439
Other than just...

615
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:20,481
It's actually kind of a funny story.

616
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:27,665
So the question was, why does GLaDOS have an incinerator sitting in her room?

617
00:37:27,665 --> 00:37:30,647
And the answer is actually kind of fun.

618
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,823
like uh... we were talking sort of like a back story and they wanted to like

619
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:41,527
so they created this giant AI and they weren't really sure at Aperture Science if she was

620
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:42,968
going to go out of control

621
00:37:42,968 --> 00:37:47,452
so they made this room so that way you know if she did completely lose her mind

622
00:37:47,452 --> 00:37:49,574
they could you know incinerate her and get rid of her

623
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:56,912
Right. There's a red phone in there that is supposed to be there was a guy who that was his job to sit there and call somebody.

624
00:37:56,912 --> 00:38:01,837
If it looked like the A.I. was going rogue and then they throw it in the thing.

625
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:04,360
And it sadly didn't work. No, it was bad.

626
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:10,086
But after science, they're sort of half geniuses, half half morons.

627
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:10,306
Thanks.

628
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:18,900
So you mentioned playtesting as a really critical step, but also not outsourcing it to another group.

629
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:25,745
How do you go about selecting and acquiring a steady supply of new players throughout your process?

630
00:38:25,745 --> 00:38:27,066
How did you guys go about doing that?

631
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:32,850
So the question was, how did we go about getting new playtesters all the time to playtest our game?

632
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:37,433
Do you know how easy it is to go walk out to the nearest GameStop and say,

633
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:39,694
hey, we've got this game, do you want to come play it?

634
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:44,417
And I mean, you know, it's just like, yeah, of course.

635
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:48,119
And also we had, you know, friends and family come in and playtest.

636
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,561
Gabe's kids actually playtested for us.

637
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,642
You want me to say something?

638
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:54,323
Oh, just in Valve, there's a lot of people working at Valve

639
00:38:54,323 --> 00:38:56,565
who are kind of heads down on their own projects.

640
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:59,107
So we had a lot of people who could just come in,

641
00:38:59,107 --> 00:39:00,968
you know, from other parts of the company as well.

642
00:39:01,596 --> 00:39:09,971
And did you ever have people come back for additional tests or was it sort of a you test once and that's all the useful information?

643
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:13,624
So the question was, do we have people come back and playtest again?

644
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:20,429
Usually we would have people playtest once, but we had a few playtesters, mainly at Valve,

645
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:24,211
who seemed to really like Portal and were stubborn.

646
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:26,613
So they wouldn't really get frustrated easily.

647
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:30,215
So when we would have a puzzle that we wanted to try out that was really, really rough and

648
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:34,698
we just wanted to see if the concept was good, we would usually grab one of those guys and

649
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:37,080
have them sit down and chug through it.

650
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:48,841
Hi. In the developer commentary, you said there will be more portal games and obviously

651
00:39:48,841 --> 00:39:55,344
your first couple of sides show you're having a lot of success and when that happens you

652
00:39:55,344 --> 00:40:02,688
get a lot of resources, you won't be a little tiny team, so what kind of, are you afraid

653
00:40:02,688 --> 00:40:09,091
or how will you overcome the challenge of not having as many constraints?

654
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:15,653
So how will we make a next portal if there is one?

655
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:20,294
How can we keep some of our design philosophies if we have a lot more resources?

656
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:23,155
And it's a good question. I don't know. I'm scared to tell you the truth.

657
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:26,455
I don't know how it's going to work.

658
00:40:26,455 --> 00:40:33,037
I'm trying to just bask in the moment now about people bugging me about the next one.

659
00:40:33,037 --> 00:40:35,298
Just let me enjoy it for one minute.

660
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:37,118
No, but seriously, I don't know.

661
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:41,069
Yeah, I don't know.

662
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:52,335
A little bit of a personal flashback for me, but as I remember toward the end of Narbacular

663
00:40:52,335 --> 00:40:58,578
Drop, there is a puzzle where you're required to

664
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:04,192
to aim through one of the doorways

665
00:41:04,192 --> 00:41:08,054
and put a portal on the wall on the other side,

666
00:41:08,054 --> 00:41:12,196
in essence, to shoot through, which

667
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:13,757
was very elegant as a way of pushing

668
00:41:13,757 --> 00:41:20,140
the mechanics of the game to its limit, I suppose.

669
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,522
And I noticed, of course, that in Portal,

670
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,983
you chose for one reason or another

671
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:29,405
not to allow the player to fire the.

672
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:32,453
the portal gun through one port.

673
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:43,451
I can think of a couple of reasons why you might have done that, but I was just wondering if it was for technical purposes or as part of a larger idea of some sort.

674
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:51,875
So the question was, did we, so in Arbacalar Drop we gave players the ability of being able to shoot one portal through another portal,

675
00:41:51,875 --> 00:42:01,160
and we decided to not do that for portal because, not because it was technically impossible, technology wise, impossible,

676
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,161
but because it was technically impossible.

677
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,344
But more for a design purpose, like, you know,

678
00:42:06,344 --> 00:42:09,908
we wanted players to learn something in particular

679
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:10,688
in a certain level.

680
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:13,531
And so giving the players suddenly the ability

681
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,275
to bypass all the training that we had tried

682
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:19,798
so hard to construct and, you know,

683
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:22,140
just seemed like shooting ourselves in the foot,

684
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,721
essentially.

685
00:42:27,707 --> 00:42:38,595
In the first trailer for Portal, the portals seemed to have sort of an almost liquid quality to them.

686
00:42:38,595 --> 00:42:41,377
Now they're more like holes in the wall.

687
00:42:41,377 --> 00:42:47,661
Also, they were a blue and a red portal, and now it's a blue and an orange one.

688
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:51,844
What triggered this change?

689
00:42:52,524 --> 00:42:57,368
So the question was, why did we change the look and color of our portals?

690
00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:57,808
Yeah.

691
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:05,353
Well, honestly, we went through just a bunch of just iterations, and as far as blue and orange goes,

692
00:43:05,353 --> 00:43:08,796
you know, we liked orange better than red.

693
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:10,877
I mean, it really just boils down to that.

694
00:43:10,877 --> 00:43:18,242
Like, we liked the color choice better in the end, and, you know, we left it sort of up to our artists.

695
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:20,484
Like, you know, what do you want the portals to look like?

696
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:23,911
And the liquid quality?

697
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:27,154
It was kind of like they were rippling at the edges.

698
00:43:27,154 --> 00:43:33,420
Yeah, so I think what you're referring to as far as the liquid quality of how the portals

699
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:40,466
were looking was that was an opening shader for it, and we just decided to change it.

700
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:43,930
Like, honestly, it just sort of, we decided one day.

701
00:43:44,857 --> 00:43:47,199
I just wanted to leave a comment.

702
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:49,882
I just wanted to thank you guys for the end of the turret level.

703
00:43:49,882 --> 00:43:54,508
The most satisfying thing that I felt in that game was picking up that last turret and walking

704
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:58,592
into the elevator through the field and watching it just turn into a ball of ash.

705
00:43:58,592 --> 00:44:00,274
Thank you guys for that.

706
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:01,115
Yeah, no problem.

707
00:44:01,115 --> 00:44:05,260
Yeah, we also really like the way they scream too.

708
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:14,215
So I have a question. I'm a student and you guys started out as an indie developer.

709
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:18,618
So I was just wondering if you have any suggestions for students and whatnot

710
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:22,840
who are hoping to get into the game industry and break in like you guys did.

711
00:44:23,378 --> 00:44:28,999
So, the question is, do we have any advice for student developers on how to break into the industry?

712
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,860
Make games. Make as many as you can.

713
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,001
And fail. Because honestly, failing, you'll learn a lot of stuff.

714
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:40,042
Like, I can't tell you how many times we failed on our game designs working at DigiPen.

715
00:44:40,042 --> 00:44:46,604
Like, yeah, one of them worked out, but, you know, we had three others that were not the best games ever.

716
00:44:46,604 --> 00:44:47,324
And honestly...

717
00:44:47,784 --> 00:44:49,185
Practice makes perfect, right?

718
00:44:49,185 --> 00:44:52,287
So the more things that you have on your resume

719
00:44:52,287 --> 00:44:54,988
and in your portfolio to show to game developers

720
00:44:54,988 --> 00:44:57,010
that look, I did all these projects,

721
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,031
I worked on them from start to finish,

722
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:02,233
you know, it obviously shows that I have commitment

723
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:03,954
to the project, right?

724
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:06,955
So make games, like whether it be a mod

725
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:09,417
or you know, a student project,

726
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:12,779
just make as many as you possibly can

727
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:13,819
and have fun with them.

728
00:45:13,819 --> 00:45:14,340
Thank you.

729
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:21,031
So when I spoke to people that also played Portal about the fire pit puzzle,

730
00:45:21,031 --> 00:45:26,375
one of the things that we talked about a lot was the fact that we felt like we had broken the game somehow

731
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:32,158
by escaping like this final ending and that there was this moment of sort of shock and confusion about what to do next

732
00:45:32,158 --> 00:45:36,981
when you suddenly had gotten past what you imagined was the game's end.

733
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:40,803
And that was a very powerful moment in the way that it defied conventional game narrative.

734
00:45:40,803 --> 00:45:41,924
So I'm wondering if that...

735
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:47,487
that defying of conventional game narrative was something that was intentional in the design of the level,

736
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:51,110
or whether that was just something that was an accidental occurrence from what you set up?

737
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,711
Honestly, the... that was one of the very first things...

738
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:54,672
Repeat the question.

739
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:54,952
Oh, sorry.

740
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,733
Oh, I forgot the question.

741
00:45:56,733 --> 00:45:57,734
I was just going to talk about it.

742
00:45:57,734 --> 00:46:07,399
No, was it intentional, the sort of way that you feel maybe like you've broken the game after the fire pit?

743
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:13,805
And I guess there was some unintentionality there because that's one thing that virtually never changed.

744
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:19,887
The beats as far as you start in the relaxation vault at some point during the game,

745
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:22,468
although I think maybe it was earlier in the game at one point,

746
00:46:22,468 --> 00:46:25,990
you escape the fire pit and then you would eventually meet Gladys,

747
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,290
was in there before...

748
00:46:27,973 --> 00:46:33,817
anything. I mean, the test levels with no dialogue basically had that structure just

749
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:40,601
because we had this intuitive feeling that it would work, and it just ended up working

750
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:45,764
better than we thought. So we can take some credit for it, but not total credit. It just

751
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:47,445
worked really well.

752
00:46:49,212 --> 00:46:54,075
So when I first heard about Portal, I went and played Narbacular Drop really thoroughly.

753
00:46:54,075 --> 00:46:56,897
And when I played Portal, I noticed there were a lot of similarities.

754
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:01,300
The one big difference was that Portal had all this humor, a profound amount of humor in it.

755
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,163
And I was wondering what the decision was and how you decided to throw in the comedy.

756
00:47:05,163 --> 00:47:09,606
So the question is, why did we decide to throw in comedy for Portal?

757
00:47:09,606 --> 00:47:12,047
Because Narbacular Drop really wasn't that funny.

758
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:18,451
And, you know, there's something inherently funny about portals, like, you know, especially,

759
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:22,835
you know, you put one of them, like, both of them on the floor and you drop a box in

760
00:47:22,835 --> 00:47:25,778
and you see it, like, popping out back and forth.

761
00:47:25,778 --> 00:47:27,960
Like, there's something kind of funny and visceral about it.

762
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,623
And well, honestly, Eric's really damn funny.

763
00:47:31,623 --> 00:47:35,907
Yeah, well, I mean, given a choice, that was kind of in my comfort zone.

764
00:47:35,907 --> 00:47:39,149
Like, if my task at Valve was to write...

765
00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:43,750
stuff for Portal, if nobody was going to object, I would just make it funny.

766
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:49,493
Because that would be something I was more likely to succeed at.

767
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:51,734
Because you like despairing.

768
00:47:51,734 --> 00:47:52,875
Yeah.

769
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:56,657
Hi, I have no problems harvesting Adam from Little Sisters.

770
00:47:56,657 --> 00:48:01,319
I love kicking innocent bystanders to bloody pulp in lots of games.

771
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:07,442
But why, why, why, why did you have me kill off the companion cube?

772
00:48:07,442 --> 00:48:07,903
Thank you.

773
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,103
So why did we kill off the companion cube?

774
00:48:13,103 --> 00:48:16,884
Well, I think we explained that in the speech, didn't we?

775
00:48:16,884 --> 00:48:19,946
You can thank the United States Secret Service.

776
00:48:19,946 --> 00:48:21,687
Actually, I don't think it was the Secret Service.

777
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:23,348
Secreter than the Secret Service.

778
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:26,749
I have two questions, and the second one is quick.

779
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:31,792
The first one is it sounds like there's a lot of trial and error and rework that went into Portal.

780
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:37,055
Did you have to do anything to smooth that over with management, set their expectations or anything like that?

781
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:43,937
So, the question is, there's a lot of trial and error with the game, obviously, and did

782
00:48:43,937 --> 00:48:48,699
we have to, you know, convince our management that that was perhaps a good idea.

783
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:54,522
And honestly, the way management works at Valve is a lot different than it does at other

784
00:48:54,522 --> 00:48:55,242
game companies.

785
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:57,203
We don't really have producers there.

786
00:48:57,203 --> 00:49:01,305
We have team leads that basically, you know...

787
00:49:01,585 --> 00:49:04,567
maybe do like the administrivious stuff every once in a while and do some PR.

788
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:09,430
But, you know, honestly the people working on the game get to make the decisions about the game

789
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,152
and have direct impact on what they're working on.

790
00:49:12,152 --> 00:49:16,775
And, you know, we found that it just makes for a much more, you know,

791
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:19,697
satisfied group of people making games.

792
00:49:19,697 --> 00:49:20,077
Fantastic.

793
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:26,701
Well, also, like the playtesting, the commitment to playtesting wasn't our insight.

794
00:49:26,701 --> 00:49:26,961
That's...

795
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:30,477
That's the Valve philosophy. That's how they make games.

796
00:49:30,477 --> 00:49:34,704
If we hadn't done that, then we would have been in deep, deep trouble.

797
00:49:34,704 --> 00:49:37,048
Okay, fantastic. Second question.

798
00:49:37,048 --> 00:49:40,174
Is GLaDOS still alive and when will we see her again?

799
00:49:41,884 --> 00:49:42,784
I'm still alive.

800
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:43,264
Gladys.

801
00:49:43,264 --> 00:49:48,365
So the question is, is Gladys still alive and when will we see her again?

802
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:49,866
Well, did you not listen to the last song?

803
00:49:49,866 --> 00:49:51,446
The song is called Still Alive.

804
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:56,008
That's kind of a failure of writing if you don't know if she's still alive.

805
00:49:56,008 --> 00:49:56,808
She is still alive.

806
00:49:56,808 --> 00:49:57,328
100% still alive.

807
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:57,768
Thank you.

808
00:49:57,768 --> 00:50:02,950
And as far as when you'll see her again, who knows?

809
00:50:04,382 --> 00:50:13,188
I had a question about your development background and how you guys scored yourself an awesome

810
00:50:13,188 --> 00:50:16,590
seat by working with Valve.

811
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:18,311
So were you still making a question?

812
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:18,771
Well, no, go ahead.

813
00:50:18,771 --> 00:50:19,092
Oh, okay.

814
00:50:19,092 --> 00:50:21,613
How did you score yourself a position to work with Valve?

815
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:27,715
So the question was, how did we end up, like, hooking up with Valve to make Portal?

816
00:50:27,715 --> 00:50:33,299
So as far as, like, the team goes, with the exception of Eric, we were all students at

817
00:50:33,299 --> 00:50:37,343
DigiPen Institute of Technology, and we created a game called Norbacular Drop, which was our

818
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:40,565
student project for our senior year.

819
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:44,759
It was the predecessor to Portal.

820
00:50:44,759 --> 00:50:49,582
You had two portals on the wall, and it was an environmental puzzle game.

821
00:50:49,582 --> 00:50:52,584
And every year, DigiPen has an expo for graduating seniors.

822
00:50:52,584 --> 00:50:55,246
And Valve came by, took a look at our project,

823
00:50:55,246 --> 00:50:58,389
and thought it was interesting enough to drag us over to Valve

824
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,291
and have us present the game to Gabe Newell.

825
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,433
And after about 15 minutes through our presentation,

826
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:05,734
Gabe started to talk to us.

827
00:51:06,034 --> 00:51:12,296
told us to be quiet, and then asked us what we were planning on doing after we graduated.

828
00:51:12,296 --> 00:51:19,279
And we were like, well, hopefully, you know, paying our loans, getting a job, eating food.

829
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:28,582
And, you know, he offered us a job on the spot, essentially, to come in and create Portal using a source engine.

830
00:51:28,582 --> 00:51:33,463
And, you know, that's how we ended up there, and Eric's got a different story.

831
00:51:33,944 --> 00:51:41,834
Yeah, I worked, I'd been just doing a lot of writing and then I went and I worked at Double Fine for a couple of years

832
00:51:41,834 --> 00:51:48,442
and then I left Double Fine and I was just back to freelance writing and for me it was just, I got a mail one day from Gabe Newell

833
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:50,505
and said, do you want to come work at Valve?

834
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,242
I have another quick question.

835
00:51:56,242 --> 00:51:59,065
Why didn't you guys submit this to IGF?

836
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:01,748
It seems like a perfect candidate.

837
00:52:01,748 --> 00:52:05,552
Was it the reason because you guys got picked up by Valve?

838
00:52:06,212 --> 00:52:13,498
So, Narbacular Drop actually was in the IGF Student Showcase, I think, three years ago.

839
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:24,367
DigiPen submits the games that they find to be interesting to the Student Showcase and the IGF.

840
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:30,292
We didn't make the indie professional, I guess, section, but we made it to the Student Showcase.

841
00:52:34,644 --> 00:52:39,087
Hi, how did the element of cake come into fruition?

842
00:52:39,087 --> 00:52:43,050
So the question is, how did the element of cake come to fruition?

843
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,571
It kind of started off as like an inside joke, sort of.

844
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:48,233
I mean, really, it just was one of those things, I think,

845
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:52,056
originally when we sat down, you guys were showing me the game,

846
00:52:52,056 --> 00:52:55,378
there was something about cake in there, and it just seemed

847
00:52:55,378 --> 00:52:57,680
like it's a comedy tool, obsess over one thing

848
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,141
that maybe you wouldn't expect to obsess over,

849
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:03,403
and we just, it really didn't have any deeper meaning than that.

850
00:53:03,662 --> 00:53:06,123
Yeah, we were just kinda having fun.

851
00:53:06,123 --> 00:53:08,906
Yeah, fun, fun work, work fun, common fun.

852
00:53:08,906 --> 00:53:10,427
Yes, oh yeah, yes, yes, yes.

853
00:53:10,427 --> 00:53:13,129
We were working very hard and having fun.

854
00:53:13,129 --> 00:53:16,171
You keep, you're like, turn around and be sarcastic.

855
00:53:16,171 --> 00:53:16,431
It was hard work.

856
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:17,352
Yeah, no, no, it was hard work.

857
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:17,772
Working.

858
00:53:17,772 --> 00:53:17,992
I'm, I'm, I'm.

859
00:53:17,992 --> 00:53:19,754
All right.

860
00:53:19,754 --> 00:53:20,034
Geez.

861
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:21,915
The conference is turning ugly.

862
00:53:24,419 --> 00:53:26,541
Hey guys, two quick questions.

863
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:29,363
First, was there any reasoning behind making

864
00:53:29,363 --> 00:53:33,086
all the characters and the references and GLaDOS quotes

865
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:34,627
and such female?

866
00:53:34,627 --> 00:53:37,810
So the question is, why did we decide

867
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,872
to make our characters female, GLaDOS,

868
00:53:39,872 --> 00:53:42,854
and the main character?

869
00:53:42,854 --> 00:53:44,595
So as far as the main character goes,

870
00:53:44,595 --> 00:53:47,678
Gabe actually made a suggestion one day.

871
00:53:47,678 --> 00:53:50,961
We were, at the time, looking to find

872
00:53:51,401 --> 00:53:53,701
what we wanted to be the main character,

873
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:56,962
or protagonist of Portal.

874
00:53:56,962 --> 00:54:00,243
And you can see some of our earlier shots of the game.

875
00:54:00,243 --> 00:54:03,744
There's a balding dude as the main character.

876
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:05,044
And that was just hemp art.

877
00:54:05,044 --> 00:54:08,845
It was something that we used a citizen model from Half-Life 2

878
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:10,765
and just kind of fixed him up a little bit

879
00:54:10,765 --> 00:54:13,026
and put him in just for our testing purposes.

880
00:54:13,026 --> 00:54:15,987
But anyways, Gabe came up to us

881
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:17,447
while we were looking to figure out

882
00:54:17,447 --> 00:54:18,907
what we wanted our main character to be

883
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:20,608
and said, well, why don't you make it a girl?

884
00:54:20,608 --> 00:54:21,188
And we're like,

885
00:54:21,288 --> 00:54:27,431
All right, sure. I mean, it really didn't stretch beyond that. You sort of, well, what if? Okay, why not?

886
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:31,653
It's like post-feminist. It didn't even occur to us not to make it a girl. It was no big deal.

887
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:38,436
And as far as GLaDOS, well, there was the awesome GLaDOS pun, which kind of made it seem like it had to be female.

888
00:54:38,436 --> 00:54:46,840
But really, we knew an actress. I mean, casting is hard because we knew this person was going to have to carry the game.

889
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,541
So we needed an actress.

890
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:49,341
Or an actor.

891
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:56,504
or actor, actor or actress, who A, was good, and B, wouldn't be offended when, you know,

892
00:54:56,504 --> 00:55:01,826
the first third of our recording sessions were just us playing her text-to-speech and

893
00:55:01,826 --> 00:55:06,768
saying, say this exactly like that back to us, because actors hate that sort of thing.

894
00:55:06,768 --> 00:55:08,109
But she was super nice about it.

895
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:10,850
And so that kind of informed that.

896
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:11,410
Okay.

897
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:14,732
And the other one is just to officially shut my friend up.

898
00:55:14,732 --> 00:55:15,832
Is Chella a cyborg?

899
00:55:17,804 --> 00:55:19,646
No, another failure of writing.

900
00:55:19,646 --> 00:55:21,108
Chell is not a cyborg.

901
00:55:21,108 --> 00:55:22,569
There's no she's not a cyborg.

902
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,952
She's got those ridiculous shoes.

903
00:55:24,952 --> 00:55:26,514
Cyber shoes?

904
00:55:26,514 --> 00:55:27,975
Yeah, her future shoes.

905
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:37,063
Hey, this might have already been addressed at some point, but I got in late, so I have to ask anyways.

906
00:55:37,063 --> 00:55:41,805
Obviously Portal was a very short game that met a lot of very popular success.

907
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:49,470
Do you think this might start making a movement back towards the idea of shorter games being on the market?

908
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:55,073
I mean, right now the huge pressure is, you know, everybody wants 20+, 30+, 40-plus hour games

909
00:55:55,073 --> 00:55:59,995
because everyone wants to get as much out of the game as they possibly can

910
00:55:59,995 --> 00:56:02,316
for, you know, what they're paying out of their wallet.

911
00:56:03,212 --> 00:56:05,273
Yeah, I mean, I...

912
00:56:05,273 --> 00:56:06,074
Oh, sorry.

913
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:12,879
Do you think Portal would influence more developers to make shorter games because of the...

914
00:56:12,879 --> 00:56:16,442
Well, according to the questioner, people want longer and longer games,

915
00:56:16,442 --> 00:56:17,503
although I'm not 100% sure about that.

916
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:23,067
You know, everybody at Valve, all the people I know who play games who are adults now,

917
00:56:23,067 --> 00:56:23,387
the...

918
00:56:24,606 --> 00:56:27,068
common complaint is they never finish a game.

919
00:56:27,068 --> 00:56:29,630
Nobody ever finishes a game that I know who isn't 14.

920
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:34,693
They just don't have time, and also they have 40 hours a week to play World of Warcraft,

921
00:56:34,693 --> 00:56:34,793
too.

922
00:56:34,793 --> 00:56:35,614
That's a year of gaming time.

923
00:56:35,614 --> 00:56:43,199
So there are some practical constraints on how long we were going to make it, but if

924
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:49,344
we could have done anything, I really wanted to make a game that

925
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:52,964
everybody who played it would be able to finish.

926
00:56:52,964 --> 00:56:56,430
You know, you'd be able to, it's weird to be playing these games

927
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:59,133
or trying to tell a story in a game where almost everybody,

928
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:00,195
it just sort of peters out.

929
00:57:00,195 --> 00:57:03,440
You know, you just stop playing at some point and never finish it.

930
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,703
All right. Thank you very much.

931
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:14,365
Hello. Two-part question. The first part is you mentioned that a lot of dialogue had been cut from the game.

932
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:21,490
I was wondering if any of it had gotten recorded and or put through the process of being somewhat final for GLADIS.

933
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:26,353
And if so, is there any chance you could release it on one of your websites?

934
00:57:26,353 --> 00:57:33,438
Because as a member of the portal mapping community, we would give our eye teeth to have extra GLADIS dialogue.

935
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:42,987
So, the question was, how much of final dialogue got cut and could we release it?

936
00:57:42,987 --> 00:57:45,589
So, it wasn't a lot of final dialogue.

937
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:50,913
Virtually everything went through the text-to-speech as temp audio, and a lot of it got cut.

938
00:57:51,316 --> 00:57:55,740
at that point and some of the stuff that got cut,

939
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:00,444
a lot of it I'm just not super proud of so I wouldn't want to give it to anybody.

940
00:58:00,444 --> 00:58:05,748
And some of it is good and if it is good, I'm going to use it somewhere else.

941
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,950
Fair enough.

942
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:13,514
Not to be mean but probably the chances are somewhat slim.

943
00:58:13,514 --> 00:58:14,515
I had to try. Thank you.

944
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:22,219
My question is were there any considerations for making a multiplayer or cooperative experience?

945
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:28,127
So the question was were there any considerations for making portal a co-op or a multiplayer game?

946
00:58:28,127 --> 00:58:29,148
Yeah, we thought about it

947
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:34,864
Actually, I don't know if we shipped this or not, but we played around for a little

948
00:58:34,864 --> 00:58:40,628
while actually having like multiple sets of portals and it is technically possible.

949
00:58:40,628 --> 00:58:45,051
We just didn't really have the time to think through like what would the gameplay be that

950
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:45,491
was fun.

951
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:50,815
You know, sort of the immediate conclusion that we actually kind of tried a little bit

952
00:58:50,815 --> 00:58:56,199
was, oh my gosh, portals in Deathmatch and it's less fun than you think it is, honestly.

953
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,280
It's actually kind of frustrating.

954
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:07,861
Hi, you had a lot of really good advice about keeping it wet, keeping the project wet, not

955
00:59:07,861 --> 00:59:12,523
getting too attached to ideas and being willing to cut things or make changes later.

956
00:59:12,523 --> 00:59:18,667
I'm just wondering how, what your experience was for balancing that with the need to get

957
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:24,049
a project done and the kind of tendency of a project to kind of gain momentum the further

958
00:59:24,049 --> 00:59:26,791
it goes along and be harder to make changes later than earlier.

959
00:59:27,602 --> 00:59:37,351
So the question was how do we temper a game, you know, the longer you work on it, the harder

960
00:59:37,351 --> 00:59:42,476
it is to, you know, sort of cut things and is that kind of what you were saying?

961
00:59:42,476 --> 00:59:42,797
Yeah, okay.

962
00:59:42,797 --> 00:59:43,718
You said it better than I do.

963
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:51,081
And play testing. You will know right away if your idea is good or bad.

964
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:54,864
You know, if you watch your players and they are just totally frustrated out of your mind,

965
00:59:54,864 --> 01:00:01,489
and you can't really, you know, necessarily pinpoint ways to fix it, then cut it.

966
01:00:01,489 --> 01:00:05,812
Because, so, you know, one of the things that we do, making our levels at least,

967
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:08,634
is we try and get them up and running once we come up with an idea.

968
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:12,137
Okay, we want, you know, such and such objectives.

969
01:00:12,773 --> 01:00:16,155
As we try and get it up and running within like two to five days, like really, really fast,

970
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:18,477
and then we start running playtests through it,

971
01:00:18,477 --> 01:00:21,019
and if we playtest it like maybe, you know, three or four times,

972
01:00:21,019 --> 01:00:23,800
and we find that it's just really not working out,

973
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,082
then it's going to the cutting floor,

974
01:00:26,082 --> 01:00:31,266
or going back again to design phase and, you know, re-mangling it to work.

975
01:00:32,112 --> 01:00:38,774
So we never really got to a point where it was really, really difficult to cut something

976
01:00:38,774 --> 01:00:46,877
because we were always playtesting and getting reinforcement for whether or not our ideas

977
01:00:46,877 --> 01:00:57,881
were good or bad directly from people we consider our customers.

978
01:01:00,753 --> 01:01:17,107
Wow. So, if our development process were a style of painting, what would it be?

979
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:19,228
Uh, uh, maybe, maybe a, um, no.

980
01:01:19,228 --> 01:01:20,009
Cubist?

981
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:24,233
Gosh, I don't know. Yeah, that's a good one. Cubist painting.

982
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:26,875
Uh, you know, do you have a good one?

983
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:27,595
Yeah, I'm out of material.

984
01:01:29,621 --> 01:01:32,002
Sorry.

985
01:01:32,002 --> 01:01:35,884
So, um, Chell obviously has a very good set of DNA.

986
01:01:35,884 --> 01:01:38,505
And you mentioned that it was Gabe's idea to make her female.

987
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:41,547
And Gordon Freeman has good DNA.

988
01:01:41,547 --> 01:01:43,068
Is there any...

989
01:01:43,068 --> 01:01:50,811
So the question is, are Chell and Gordon going to hook up, uh, essentially?

990
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:51,672
I don't know.

991
01:01:51,672 --> 01:01:55,974
I mean, you guys, you know, have access to Gary's mod, right?

992
01:01:55,974 --> 01:01:56,975
You can do what you want.

993
01:01:56,975 --> 01:01:57,095
Yeah.

994
01:01:58,243 --> 01:02:06,229
Yeah, I was wondering, you kept on talking about how you cut off a lot of things in the

995
01:02:06,229 --> 01:02:12,193
narrative and like cut off a lot of exposition and stuff like that and just really streamline

996
01:02:12,193 --> 01:02:13,334
the process.

997
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:18,958
And I was just wondering, do you think that it's possible, I mean, do you think there's

998
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:25,442
a way to make exposition and narrative like interesting and fun for the playtesters?

999
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,210
You see what we're going to get at?

1000
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,771
Oh, so the question is, do I think there's a way to...

1001
01:02:30,771 --> 01:02:37,434
I think you're saying, is there a way to include a lot more exposition and still make it entertaining?

1002
01:02:37,434 --> 01:02:41,875
I mean, for me personally, I'm sure there's somebody who's a genius who could do it,

1003
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:48,278
but I personally don't... I mean, I like it when there is less.

1004
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:50,719
You know, my own personal taste is less.

1005
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,630
So for me, probably not.

1006
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,650
I'm just trying to do as little as possible.

1007
01:02:56,650 --> 01:03:02,172
So you believe that games aren't good at telling long, expository stories then?

1008
01:03:02,172 --> 01:03:06,052
Yeah, I guess I'm not good at it, but I'm also not good at sitting through it.

1009
01:03:06,052 --> 01:03:07,933
I mean, I just don't like it that much in games.

1010
01:03:07,933 --> 01:03:12,574
When I play a game, I like it to be as concise as possible.

1011
01:03:12,574 --> 01:03:18,495
Because honestly, I'm a game writer, but I'm not even 100% convinced that games are the best medium

1012
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:20,655
for telling epic, long stories.

1013
01:03:21,897 --> 01:03:25,578
I kind of think of what I do as more of like providing a film score.

1014
01:03:25,578 --> 01:03:27,939
You know, movies aren't about the music,

1015
01:03:27,939 --> 01:03:33,961
but the music is definitely an important part that enhances the experience of watching the movie.

1016
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:38,123
So the writing is something that enhances the experience of why you're there, which is playing the game.

1017
01:03:38,425 --> 01:03:43,669
And honestly for me, there's something to be said for leaving things to people's imagination.

1018
01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:47,892
You don't have to have someone sitting there next to you dictating to you exactly what's

1019
01:03:47,892 --> 01:03:49,033
going on at all times.

1020
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,154
Like, you know, people are smart.

1021
01:03:51,154 --> 01:03:52,695
Give them credit.

1022
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:52,936
You know?

1023
01:03:52,936 --> 01:03:57,379
And I know for me personally, it's kind of fun just sort of imagining up, you know, what

1024
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:59,921
I think some of the storyline is.

1025
01:04:02,355 --> 01:04:08,799
Playing through Portals, one of the biggest surprises that I had was finding references to Black Mesa inside of it,

1026
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:13,862
and then references to Aperture and the Borealis inside the Half-Life 2 Episode 2.

1027
01:04:13,862 --> 01:04:19,346
Around what point in development did you make the decision to drop Portals into the Half-Life universe?

1028
01:04:19,346 --> 01:04:28,492
So the question is, when did we decide to, you know, sort of cross-reference between the two games of Episode 2 and Portal?

1029
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,167
Kind of like, you know, maybe in the middle of development or so.

1030
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:37,560
Well, middle of development for you, but I think when I came on it was, that was in the...

1031
01:04:38,217 --> 01:04:41,219
the earlier meetings, that was just one of the constraints on the game.

1032
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:45,182
Initially because I think they weren't sure exactly where they were going to position it,

1033
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:48,465
and also because we were still using a lot of Half-Life art,

1034
01:04:48,465 --> 01:04:50,887
so it sort of made sense to tie them together.

1035
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:55,891
As Portal kind of got its own identity, we worried less and less about it.

1036
01:04:55,891 --> 01:04:59,314
Like, you know, we're not going to have to have the G-Man appear or something.

1037
01:04:59,314 --> 01:05:03,878
We can kind of make it a little bit more subtle and not have to dwell on it too much.

1038
01:05:03,878 --> 01:05:04,658
Thanks.

1039
01:05:04,658 --> 01:05:05,899
Two questions.

1040
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,321
I have a friend who says that the best games teach us something.

1041
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:11,482
What do we have to learn from Portal?

1042
01:05:11,482 --> 01:05:18,846
So the question is, what do we have to learn from Portal because the best games teach people

1043
01:05:18,846 --> 01:05:19,226
something?

1044
01:05:19,226 --> 01:05:22,188
You want to take this one?

1045
01:05:22,188 --> 01:05:24,269
That's a tough one.

1046
01:05:24,269 --> 01:05:27,190
I don't know, if anybody has an idea, just shout it out.

1047
01:05:28,814 --> 01:05:30,234
Don't trust anyone with something.

1048
01:05:30,234 --> 01:05:33,496
Don't trust anyone.

1049
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:34,416
The cake is a lie.

1050
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:35,177
The cake is a lie.

1051
01:05:35,177 --> 01:05:45,141
No, I mean, we definitely wanted to explore the idea of manipulating space and thinking about, you know, a 3D space in a different way.

1052
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:51,263
And so, you know, throughout Portal, we're kind of teaching you to look at a situation in a way that you haven't before.

1053
01:05:52,004 --> 01:05:53,864
So I don't know if that kind of answers your question.

1054
01:05:53,864 --> 01:05:54,905
It'll do.

1055
01:05:54,905 --> 01:06:00,368
Also, I noticed that the companion cube was kind of silent.

1056
01:06:00,368 --> 01:06:03,809
Does it have any dialogue in the sequel?

1057
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:10,713
So the question is, will a companion cube have dialogue in the sequel to Portal?

1058
01:06:10,713 --> 01:06:12,593
I don't know about this sequel that you're talking about.

1059
01:06:15,134 --> 01:06:19,676
This might be a little bit proprietary, but I'm curious, how did you guys and or Valve

1060
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:23,839
figure out, or when did you figure out, or was it an evolutionary process, how you were

1061
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:24,659
going to sell the game?

1062
01:06:25,464 --> 01:06:32,888
So the question is, when did we figure out how we were going to market and sell Portal?

1063
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:39,333
So when we initially started Portal, it was supposed to be a seriously short game, maybe

1064
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:42,935
like 15 minutes, just like a quick tech demo.

1065
01:06:42,935 --> 01:06:50,440
And then the further we got on the game, our constraints would change.

1066
01:06:51,081 --> 01:06:56,385
And I guess about the middle of Portal's development,

1067
01:06:56,385 --> 01:07:00,289
you know, we had started talking about doing the orange box,

1068
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:05,033
and it just sort of seemed like a really reasonable conclusion

1069
01:07:05,033 --> 01:07:07,556
that it should be packaged with.

1070
01:07:08,376 --> 01:07:12,578
other games that have a lot of clout and are awesome games.

1071
01:07:12,578 --> 01:07:16,560
And from our standpoint, that's great.

1072
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:22,443
We were seriously honored to be packaged with TF2 and Episode 2

1073
01:07:22,443 --> 01:07:25,024
because we think they're truly awesome games.

1074
01:07:26,828 --> 01:07:31,251
You said that you used the playtesting as kind of a method by which you tested whether

1075
01:07:31,251 --> 01:07:32,911
or not the players got the storyline.

1076
01:07:32,911 --> 01:07:38,674
And I wondered, as the game length grew, how, when you compartmentalized the testing, because

1077
01:07:38,674 --> 01:07:44,017
grabbing people for eight-hour or ten-hour play sessions isn't always possible, did you

1078
01:07:44,017 --> 01:07:48,539
get them to give you that feedback, even if they're only playing maybe one or two levels?

1079
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:49,820
Well, a lot of that's...

1080
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,440
Question?

1081
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:50,760
Oh, sorry.

1082
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,180
How did we...

1083
01:07:51,736 --> 01:07:56,658
get people to experience the entire story if they didn't playtest the whole game.

1084
01:07:56,658 --> 01:08:01,201
Luckily, because Portal was a pretty short game throughout most of its development,

1085
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:06,663
at no point was it so long that it would take people eight hours to get through it.

1086
01:08:06,663 --> 01:08:07,704
Please don't hit me in the face.

1087
01:08:07,704 --> 01:08:08,144
Sorry.

1088
01:08:08,144 --> 01:08:09,124
The, um, what was I going to say?

1089
01:08:09,124 --> 01:08:14,507
So if somebody didn't finish the game, we weren't super worried about asking them.

1090
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:18,869
We did occasionally have playtesters who didn't make it through, but most of them...

1091
01:08:19,394 --> 01:08:28,245
We sat and watched them for the entire time and they made it true.

1092
01:08:39,647 --> 01:08:47,050
I mean, there's definitely, oh, does less is more in terms of story apply to other genres?

1093
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:52,272
And again, I don't know. I don't have a surefire solution for every genre.

1094
01:08:52,272 --> 01:08:55,914
I mean, in terms of my enjoyment of a game, less is more.

1095
01:08:55,914 --> 01:09:07,379
So, but again, if you're making a giant RPG, you probably need to say who begat whom and where the hammer came from.

1096
01:09:10,207 --> 01:09:14,851
So Portal and Half-Life 2 have a very different tone in terms of the writing and the sort

1097
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:17,313
of themes, the thematic elements.

1098
01:09:17,313 --> 01:09:22,637
If you ever do try and tie the universes together and do something with the cross-referencing

1099
01:09:22,637 --> 01:09:25,360
you've done, do you have any ideas for how you might resolve that?

1100
01:09:26,092 --> 01:09:34,318
Well, so how do we resolve the differences in tone between Half-Life universe and the sort of Aperture universe?

1101
01:09:34,318 --> 01:09:38,941
And actually, it was something I thought about, and I honestly don't think it's that big a problem,

1102
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:44,365
because the Aperture universe, the tone that you're seeing is mostly GLaDOS, right?

1103
01:09:44,365 --> 01:09:46,647
You're seeing things, even though you're playing a character,

1104
01:09:46,647 --> 01:09:50,310
you're actually kind of experiencing the world through GLaDOS's eyes.

1105
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:51,310
And...

1106
01:09:52,091 --> 01:10:02,375
So if Chell is out in the Half-Life universe, no action that you took as a player is really in direct contradiction to anything that would happen in the Half-Life universe.

1107
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:08,598
Inside the sort of Aperture Science fun house, there's a different set of maybe tonal rules.

1108
01:10:08,598 --> 01:10:13,120
Physics-wise, they're the same places, and even art style-wise.

1109
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,622
So I'm not super-duper worried about it.

1110
01:10:15,622 --> 01:10:16,062
Is that Paul?

1111
01:10:16,062 --> 01:10:16,482
Yeah, it is.

1112
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:22,136
Is there any chance of an art book?

1113
01:10:22,136 --> 01:10:25,537
Say that again, please.

1114
01:10:25,537 --> 01:10:27,198
Is there any chance of an art book?

1115
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:28,839
Is there any chance of an art book?

1116
01:10:28,839 --> 01:10:32,460
I don't know. I haven't talked about it with anyone, but it's an interesting idea.

1117
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:38,723
Yeah, they're talking about it. I think it would be more of an orange box sort of thing.

1118
01:10:38,723 --> 01:10:41,784
Most of our concept art, honestly, was Jason Braschel designing the...

1119
01:10:42,653 --> 01:10:47,276
the Gladys battle which are some awesome, awesome artwork which you can, there's actually

1120
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:50,098
a print I think that you can buy of it.

1121
01:10:50,098 --> 01:10:51,139
Or look at on the website.

1122
01:10:51,139 --> 01:10:52,539
Yeah, or you can look at it and print it out.

1123
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:58,783
But a lot of the other stuff there, I mean compared to TF or Half-Life, the, there isn't

1124
01:10:58,783 --> 01:11:01,065
a lot of really awesome concept art.

1125
01:11:01,065 --> 01:11:05,748
I mean we've got a lot of thumbnails and stuff but like there aren't a whole lot of like

1126
01:11:05,748 --> 01:11:05,968
really.

1127
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:12,481
you know, great, you know, pictures that we have, you know,

1128
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:16,324
ratcheted maybe, like maybe six or so,

1129
01:11:16,324 --> 01:11:18,986
but essentially, you know, we've just got a lot of thumbnails

1130
01:11:18,986 --> 01:11:23,109
of, you know, the turrets and the gun

1131
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:23,730
and a bunch of other stuff.

1132
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:26,552
Also, why are the portals ovoid?

1133
01:11:26,552 --> 01:11:30,035
So the question is, why are the portals ovals?

1134
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,517
Well, ovals look better than rectangles.

1135
01:11:34,571 --> 01:11:40,017
You know, we wanted something to kind of fit the bounds of where the actual, like, you

1136
01:11:40,017 --> 01:11:41,839
know, where you can pass through the portal to be.

1137
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:48,166
And so we kind of just filled an oval, you know, through the rectangle where the portal,

1138
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:49,607
you know, technically is.

1139
01:11:52,282 --> 01:12:00,604
The game alludes to a lot of backstory that isn't really fully explained, like the fact that you're a test subject for no explained reason.

1140
01:12:00,604 --> 01:12:06,445
How much of that backstory is actually written and referenced to and how much of that did you just sort of say,

1141
01:12:06,445 --> 01:12:09,726
oh, we'll let the player kind of use his imagination?

1142
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:14,887
So the question is, how much backstory is there that isn't in the game?

1143
01:12:14,887 --> 01:12:18,648
And there's a fair amount. There's a lot.

1144
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:25,180
A lot of, I don't know, there's probably a 15-page document about Aperture Science.

1145
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:29,163
There's actually a little bit of it is on the Aperture Science website,

1146
01:12:29,163 --> 01:12:31,205
kind of hidden in there somewhere.

1147
01:12:31,205 --> 01:12:35,429
And I'd written up a bunch of stuff in the beginning just to kind of help me.

1148
01:12:35,429 --> 01:12:39,512
And actually, at that point, I thought maybe I'd get more in there.

1149
01:12:39,512 --> 01:12:41,033
But, and I sent it to Jonathan too.

1150
01:12:41,033 --> 01:12:44,796
That kind of helped him get into the sort of mindset of the whole thing.

1151
01:12:44,796 --> 01:12:46,358
But, yeah, there is a bunch.

1152
01:12:49,877 --> 01:12:58,861
Hi, I think I speak for a lot of people on this that Portal really was a huge triumph

1153
01:12:58,861 --> 01:13:06,245
because it was so creative and it won so many awards and it's got so much acclaim and it's

1154
01:13:06,245 --> 01:13:06,805
so different.

1155
01:13:06,805 --> 01:13:12,068
I was wondering if you could speak a little bit on how you think that's affecting the

1156
01:13:12,068 --> 01:13:13,308
community of games as a whole.

1157
01:13:15,515 --> 01:13:21,063
So the question, so it's like how Portal impacts the community of games?

1158
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:27,232
Yeah, and the approach to making games as a creative medium.

1159
01:13:29,053 --> 01:13:29,974
I don't really know.

1160
01:13:29,974 --> 01:13:32,134
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of too early to tell.

1161
01:13:32,134 --> 01:13:35,635
I hope it, I mean, because since we made Portal,

1162
01:13:35,635 --> 01:13:37,055
we made a game that we sort of like.

1163
01:13:37,055 --> 01:13:39,375
So if more people make games like Portal,

1164
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:41,476
I would probably, I will probably like them.

1165
01:13:41,476 --> 01:13:41,996
So that's good.

1166
01:13:41,996 --> 01:13:44,436
But I mean, you just look at it this year,

1167
01:13:44,436 --> 01:13:47,557
it seems like the independent games are-

1168
01:13:47,557 --> 01:13:49,417
Getting really awesome.

1169
01:13:49,417 --> 01:13:50,738
Awesome, yeah.

1170
01:13:50,738 --> 01:13:54,298
They're higher production quality and also higher profile.

1171
01:13:54,298 --> 01:13:58,119
So maybe it'll mean people take risks on, you know,

1172
01:13:59,092 --> 01:14:00,746
with more oddball games.

1173
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:09,495
Good evening. So I had a question about, in terms of, like, my background is film and

1174
01:14:09,495 --> 01:14:14,279
that sort of media, so my question to you as writers and developers of this game is

1175
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:20,545
what are your influences? What did you look, like, what did you think of as inspiration

1176
01:14:20,545 --> 01:14:25,048
for Portal or inspiration to get into the game industry? And, you know, how does that

1177
01:14:25,048 --> 01:14:28,972
influence how you attack this game, this project?

1178
01:14:29,522 --> 01:14:35,947
So the question was, do we have any influences that kind of inspired us to make Portal or

1179
01:14:35,947 --> 01:14:38,669
get into the gaming industry?

1180
01:14:38,669 --> 01:14:46,775
So for me personally, like every other person on the planet, Miyamoto is definitely an inspiration.

1181
01:14:46,775 --> 01:14:54,001
I grew up with Nintendo games and I was kind of raised on them, so from an early age I

1182
01:14:54,001 --> 01:14:55,282
wanted to be a game designer.

1183
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:03,622
And, you know, as far as just kind of interesting games that actually get published, you know,

1184
01:15:03,622 --> 01:15:06,023
Katamari Damacy was a really great one.

1185
01:15:06,023 --> 01:15:08,984
Do you have inspiration?

1186
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:17,387
Oh, well, direct inspiration for Portal was, there's a book by, who's the Dune guy?

1187
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:19,748
Frank Herbert called Destination Void.

1188
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:24,313
that was, it's about people that, clones that go into space

1189
01:15:24,313 --> 01:15:26,534
and they're tasked with building an AI

1190
01:15:26,534 --> 01:15:29,736
and there's always like this fail-safe mechanism

1191
01:15:29,736 --> 01:15:32,498
because the AIs always go crazy and kill everyone

1192
01:15:32,498 --> 01:15:36,481
and they, the crew doesn't really know that that's what happens

1193
01:15:36,481 --> 01:15:37,862
and then they blow up the ship

1194
01:15:37,862 --> 01:15:39,463
and it just fails and fails and fails

1195
01:15:39,463 --> 01:15:42,305
because the AI goes rogue and they blow up the ship.

1196
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:44,226
There's like one mole guy in there

1197
01:15:44,226 --> 01:15:46,627
who knows that he's supposed to blow up the ship.

1198
01:15:46,627 --> 01:15:47,568
So that was an inspiration for that.

1199
01:15:47,568 --> 01:15:49,009
The game industry, I just...

1200
01:15:49,688 --> 01:15:53,629
Okay, no Isaac Asimov or anything like that or

1201
01:15:53,629 --> 01:15:59,391
Honestly not when I was a kid I read a lot of science fiction, but I don't read a lot of science fiction now

1202
01:15:59,391 --> 01:16:00,931
So but I mean I know as mob

1203
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:06,493
I'm sure indirectly Robert Shackley is a we actually named a character in episode 2 Shackley after Robert Shackley

1204
01:16:06,493 --> 01:16:12,294
Just because he writes kind of funny science fiction. Yeah, I was kid. I loved his stuff. Thank you

1205
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:16,911
Oh, you know what, just because we have to catch a plane at some point.

1206
01:16:16,911 --> 01:16:22,674
So these if we can just do these three and then and there's nobody else that that's easy.

1207
01:16:22,674 --> 01:16:26,335
Hey, I have a question specifically for Eric.

1208
01:16:26,335 --> 01:16:30,956
If the portal design process was an animal, what would it be?

1209
01:16:30,956 --> 01:16:34,958
That's Anna, who used to sit right next to me at Double Fine.

1210
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:38,119
So that's that was her joke question. I'm not going to answer.

1211
01:16:44,044 --> 01:16:49,547
Okay, so my question pertains to the current slides.

1212
01:16:49,547 --> 01:16:56,731
We're actually waiting for someone to actually ask us what in the world did we put on the

1213
01:16:56,731 --> 01:16:57,011
slide.

1214
01:16:57,011 --> 01:16:59,352
What's the significance of the two shots?

1215
01:16:59,352 --> 01:17:09,157
And if you were each one of the characters in each of the pictures, which would you be?

1216
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:11,278
Eric's the one crying.

1217
01:17:12,767 --> 01:17:17,551
I don't know, it's just, it's friendship and fire.

1218
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:23,937
Over two pictures we just had, we couldn't quite fit into the talk in any meaningful way.

1219
01:17:23,937 --> 01:17:25,979
And we thought they were pretty funny.

1220
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:30,643
I think one of those is my, the crying guys is my Steam community ID too.

1221
01:17:30,643 --> 01:17:34,226
And that's Rudy Ray Moore.

1222
01:17:34,226 --> 01:17:35,687
That's awesome.

1223
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:40,622
Hi, so I was actually wondering about the development team.

1224
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:42,943
Because you're female and that's kind of unusual,

1225
01:17:42,943 --> 01:17:44,544
how many girls are on the team?

1226
01:17:44,544 --> 01:17:47,406
So the question was how many girls were on the Portal team.

1227
01:17:47,406 --> 01:17:51,988
There were two, myself and one of the artists, Realm Lovejoy.

1228
01:17:52,503 --> 01:17:59,546
Right on. Do you think that that helps in the creativity process in making like a unique game having that different perspective?

1229
01:17:59,546 --> 01:18:03,407
So the question was, you know, does having females on a game team

1230
01:18:03,407 --> 01:18:09,430
you know make for a better game giving you a unique perspective and

1231
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:09,890
I don't know

1232
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:17,512
No, I mean, honestly, I think, you know, whenever you're on a game team, you know, no matter

1233
01:18:17,512 --> 01:18:21,294
what your gender, you want to make a game that you would enjoy to play yourself.

1234
01:18:21,294 --> 01:18:22,814
Like, that's the dream, right?

1235
01:18:22,814 --> 01:18:28,376
So I mean, I guess that could, you know, by extension mean that we made a game that perhaps,

1236
01:18:28,376 --> 01:18:33,938
you know, girls could like too, but, you know, honestly, it's, I hope that it's fun for everybody,

1237
01:18:33,938 --> 01:18:34,418
personally.

1238
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:37,939
Having girls on the team makes the room smell better.

1239
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:40,247
Thank you.

1240
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:40,728
Thank you.

1241
01:18:40,728 --> 01:18:41,089
Thank you.

1242
01:18:41,089 --> 01:18:41,811
Thank you.
