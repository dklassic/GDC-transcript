1
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:10,251
Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for being here and thank you for console for inviting

2
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:16,177
me over. It's been a long trip, but I'm super glad that it worked out and that I was able

3
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:16,857
to be here in person.

4
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:24,942
Today I'm going to be talking about a game called Hades and the content design in the

5
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:35,008
game and how we transitioned Supergiant's linear RPG design into the roguelike genre,

6
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,209
which includes...

7
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:38,631
A lot of variance and dynamic content.

8
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:43,554
So without further ado, I'll introduce myself.

9
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:50,059
So my name is Ed, I go by Ed, Eduardo, I both work.

10
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,042
I am a game designer at Supergiant Games.

11
00:00:53,982 --> 00:00:59,767
Supergiant Games has been around for over ten years, creating games such as Bastion,

12
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:02,208
Transistor, Pyre, and most recently Hades.

13
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,292
Prior to Supergiant Games, I got my start in the industry at Gazillion.

14
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:19,976
Gazillion was the creator of Marvel Heroes Omega, which was a free-to-play action RPG that was around for a couple of years.

15
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:26,660
Before that, I studied at DigiPen, Institute of Technology in Redmond, Washington.

16
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:29,982
I got a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Game Design there,

17
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:34,345
so a lot of my education was focused specifically around making games.

18
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:39,388
At DigiPen, we worked on a couple of student projects.

19
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:41,630
My senior project was Gardening of the Gears,

20
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:47,173
which we had the honor of taking to IGF Student Showcase and E3.

21
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:55,299
And yeah, so after Gazillion, I joined Supergiant

22
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,761
at the start of development for Hades around pre-production.

23
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,585
The design team at Supergiant consists of five people.

24
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:07,849
For my role on the design team specifically,

25
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,672
I tend to focus on the game's level design, the enemy design,

26
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:15,174
the encounters, and the boss fights of the game.

27
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,237
Supergiant is a really small team.

28
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:20,242
We shipped Hades with just under 20 people.

29
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,448
So we all wear a lot of hats, but we each

30
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:29,536
have our discipline, which we are primarily responsible for.

31
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:33,264
So what is this talk going to be?

32
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:36,326
We're going to be talking about the content of Hades

33
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:42,791
and how we found a balance between handcrafted design and dynamic content.

34
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:46,293
First off, we're going to be looking at constraints

35
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:51,317
and how Supergiant approaches finding the limitations of our game

36
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,838
and the aspirations of the game.

37
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:04,712
And from there we're going to be looking at the successes and the attempts we had at finding that variance within chambers, encounters, and finally the boss and endgame.

38
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:07,355
So without further ado...

39
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:14,050
For those of you who might not know, Hades is a roguelike action dungeon crawler where

40
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,931
you play as Zagreus, son of Hades, attempting to fight his way to the surface.

41
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:23,813
That is Lord Hades, and this is Zagreus, the player character.

42
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:30,605
Here is a quick view of the gameplay style.

43
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,907
So throughout your escapes of the underworld,

44
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:35,549
you will be encountering Olympian gods

45
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,350
who will present you with their boons

46
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,191
that upgrade your various abilities.

47
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:43,175
You move through the ever-shifting underworld

48
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:44,636
from chamber to chamber,

49
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:47,598
slaying the enemies you find in these chambers,

50
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,440
collecting your rewards,

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,541
and trying to make it as far as you can

52
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:53,383
to try and reach the surface.

53
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:59,997
Yeah. When you die in Hades, you return home.

54
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:04,801
The hub is where you spend the resources you collect in the game.

55
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:13,548
And it was important to us to make returning home as exciting as possible

56
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:19,392
and making it feel like death was just a natural part of this world.

57
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:29,260
So what is a roguelike? A roguelike is a subgenre of role-playing game characterized by a dungeon

58
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,364
crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement,

59
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:38,089
permanent death, and of the player character. That's straight out of Wikipedia.

60
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:42,333
A lot of people describe Hades as a roguelite,

61
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:46,397
which focus on some but not necessarily all of those principles.

62
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,701
With Hades in particular, for instance,

63
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,903
we knew that we weren't going to be a turn-based game.

64
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:56,967
But we wanted to explore some of these concepts,

65
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:01,031
such as permanent death and procedurally generated content.

66
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:04,655
And we took inspiration from a lot of games.

67
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:05,937
I'm just going to point out a few.

68
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,921
Rogue Legacy, Enter the Gungeon, Dead Cells,

69
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:15,186
all took interesting approaches to roguelike genres.

70
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:21,313
For Dead Cells, for instance, we really thought they did a great job

71
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,776
with the combat and action-oriented nature of the gameplay.

72
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:31,482
Rogue Legacy, we looked at how the content changed over time as you took on different

73
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,723
heroes with different attributes.

74
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:40,209
So after we looked at what others had done in the genre, we tried to find our take, like

75
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:42,631
what was Supergiant's roguelike going to be?

76
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:49,487
At Supergiant, we have a perception of constraints as positive.

77
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:54,429
It's a way for us to focus the creative development towards the things that we can do and the

78
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,671
things that we want to do, rather than as a negative.

79
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:03,714
So the first thing that we knew Hades was going to be about is you're going to die,

80
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:04,554
and you're going to die a lot.

81
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:09,957
But our goal is to make sure that you're getting better both mathematically and skillfully.

82
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:14,599
And what this meant was that we had a philosophy that every run should count in one way or

83
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:14,860
another.

84
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:25,528
When you die in Hades, our hope is that you are looking forward to progressing your relationships with the other inhabitants of the underworld.

85
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:31,092
You want to spend your currency on new abilities or upgrading your home.

86
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:38,698
We wanted to provide multiple avenues to make sure that it was an interesting experience going back, trying again.

87
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:43,840
But what this also meant is that every time you go back into the run, we wanted to make sure that it had variance,

88
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,602
that it was fun and interesting and unique in different ways,

89
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:54,265
and that it could potentially be interesting to do over tens or hundreds of runs.

90
00:06:55,526 --> 00:07:01,414
So, one of the early defining mindsets that we had actually came from a conversation with

91
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:03,998
Robin Walker, a friend from Valve.

92
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:10,807
They said that roguelike design has a high dynamic range with runs that diverge early.

93
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:15,329
This really helped shape how we approached our decision making

94
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,451
because it gave us goals to achieve rather than just creating content.

95
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,712
So, where did the variance come from?

96
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:31,473
Player abilities and rewards, the upgrades the player gets,

97
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:34,174
will drastically change how you...

98
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:37,758
in a run.

99
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,044
Narrative, it keeps progressing every time you die.

100
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:41,166
It advances in certain ways.

101
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:43,712
And where this talk is gonna focus,

102
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:45,416
which is on the content, the chambers,

103
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:46,218
encounters, and bosses.

104
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:51,242
So the first thing when approaching level design

105
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,462
was to learn about how levels were generated in other games.

106
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,023
Spelunky has a well-documented map generator

107
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:00,104
with a lot of information online.

108
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:05,305
It describes how rules are used to stitch together

109
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:11,946
templates of a map together with still some design intent,

110
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:17,167
having a path from the entrance to the exit,

111
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:18,328
making sure that there's some.

112
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:22,151
So spacing between how often you get rewards

113
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:24,333
and how often you get shops and stuff.

114
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:26,775
Heat Signature is another example of a game

115
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:30,558
that takes templates and stitches them together

116
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:31,319
into larger maps.

117
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,964
Binding of Isaac is a game that approaches chambers

118
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:39,125
in an interesting way.

119
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:41,287
It locks you in and forces you to fight the enemies

120
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:43,789
within that chamber, kind of forcing the player

121
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,171
to experience that difficulty.

122
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:55,979
So, we, taking what others have made, we ask ourselves,

123
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,682
what are our constraints and what are they gonna

124
00:08:59,102 --> 00:08:59,682
help us achieve?

125
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:02,064
So questions we ask at Supergiant is

126
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,185
what games can this team make?

127
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:07,369
Supergiant builds the games that we're gonna make

128
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:10,551
around the skills and aspirations of the team at Supergiant.

129
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:15,954
We also have our own custom engine and our custom technology,

130
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,496
and it allows us to make exactly what we want to make,

131
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:22,638
but it also means that we have to make games within our capabilities.

132
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,221
And from there, every time we make a design decision,

133
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:30,683
we ask ourselves, how can we fit those under those constraints?

134
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:34,647
So the first of those is that Hades has hand-painted chambers.

135
00:09:35,828 --> 00:09:40,193
So this is a GIF of the editor.

136
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:45,899
So our programmer, Dexter, made a tool that every couple of minutes,

137
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,203
the editor will take a screenshot of whatever the designer or artist is working on,

138
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:52,527
and at the end of the project, we can time-lapse it all together.

139
00:09:54,008 --> 00:10:00,770
One thing that's interesting to note here is at the start of the GIF you see the gray

140
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:08,752
box design and it actually only spends a couple of days and weeks in design before it gets

141
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:09,713
handed over to the artist.

142
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:11,813
But notice how quickly it goes from...

143
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:19,799
the grey box for the first pass, and then how long it takes in the polished state where

144
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,041
small tweaks are being made, things are being added to the foreground.

145
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:28,566
So this kind of shows how the environment art is actually just thousands of painted

146
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,287
assets layered over one another.

147
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:37,561
This is a very handcrafted approach, but it gets that visual fidelity that Supergiant

148
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:38,301
aspires for.

149
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:43,466
Our lighting and our collision is also, for the most part, placed by hand.

150
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:45,948
There's some dynamic lighting and collision.

151
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:55,316
This just goes hand in hand with trying to get the exact image that the artist is going for.

152
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:56,577
So what's the result of this?

153
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,200
Modifying any chambers was extremely costly.

154
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,525
If we wanted to change the interior cover to be taller or lower,

155
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:11,930
it required the artist to go in and redraw a large portion of the level.

156
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:18,977
and taking down a portion of a wall to create a secret chamber behind that just wasn't feasible with the style of

157
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:21,619
chamber that we were shooting for

158
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:27,985
and in our early prototypes of more dynamic chambers where you could

159
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:34,872
Stitch together different pieces or tear down walls. We actually noticed that the credit

160
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:37,354
quote-unquote, that you get from the player

161
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:40,376
as far as how different the map feels

162
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:43,098
is not that high for the amount of cost

163
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,861
it's taking us in time to create a room that

164
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:47,982
looks and feels good.

165
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:52,005
We found that spending our time building whole new maps

166
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,927
and having more of those maps to show the player

167
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:56,008
would actually get us a lot further in making

168
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,650
the game feel fresh, because it allowed us to make sure

169
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,191
that you don't see every room every run.

170
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:03,654
There's enough rooms to surprise you from time to time.

171
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:08,121
Next, we looked at run structure.

172
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:09,082
So what have others done?

173
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:11,343
One of the things that we looked at was Slay the Spire.

174
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:17,727
The chamber-to-chamber design of Slay the Spire was interesting to us because it aligned

175
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:22,510
with our hope that Hades would be a fast-paced, push-forward design.

176
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:29,515
And in Slay the Spire, you make your way through a varied dungeon, but you're only going in

177
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:29,995
one direction.

178
00:12:31,476 --> 00:12:33,956
So, our next constraint was no backtracking.

179
00:12:35,116 --> 00:12:40,138
Since we can't stitch huge rooms together, we made the design decision to create this

180
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:42,298
constraint that you can't go backwards, for the most part.

181
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:46,119
Sticks is going to break a lot of rules and that's going to be a theme throughout this

182
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:46,379
talk.

183
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,961
Sticks is the last chamber of the, or the last biome of the game, and that's kind of

184
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:55,161
where we broke a lot of our own rules.

185
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:55,401
But...

186
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:58,023
For the most part, you can't go backwards.

187
00:12:58,184 --> 00:13:02,347
And this builds on our previous decisions,

188
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:04,609
because if we're going to have a linear game,

189
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,992
going backwards is going to really ruin the pace.

190
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,456
So in order to keep the fast-paced action.

191
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:21,100
We we had this desire, but it wasn't a guarantee because we weren't sure if this was going to be enough to be interesting

192
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:25,743
For a larger run and then for multiple runs

193
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:30,625
It wasn't a guarantee that that was going to be enough to make the world feel like it was

194
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:33,507
shifting and new each time

195
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:40,100
So the result, if you can't go backwards,

196
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,200
then we have to make sure that you're experienced in combat.

197
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,701
The danger can't be in getting past the enemies,

198
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,281
it has to be in actually fighting the enemies.

199
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,242
So every enemy has to be killable.

200
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:53,803
We can't place enemies hiding in a very strategic position

201
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:56,124
that can only be killed by ranged attacks

202
00:13:56,204 --> 00:14:00,585
because the player might not have ranged attacks.

203
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:02,246
This also meant no puzzles.

204
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,788
Puzzles tend to have the setup,

205
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:06,509
and then the search for a solution,

206
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,471
and the execution once you have the Eureka moment.

207
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:12,632
But if you can't go backwards,

208
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,274
you can't really go for that exploration.

209
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,495
And we didn't like the feeling of missing out,

210
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:22,758
so the idea of having things locked behind certain god effects

211
00:14:23,658 --> 00:14:25,740
wasn't interesting because you would just encounter it,

212
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,981
realize that you don't have it, and kind of move on.

213
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:31,628
So that was just a decision that we wanted to avoid.

214
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,340
I kind of touched on this, unreliable player abilities.

215
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:40,342
In Hades, the player chooses what weapon they use

216
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:42,883
and what abilities they get, for the most part.

217
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:46,464
And it's never guaranteed what that skill set will be

218
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:47,725
on the content side.

219
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:50,566
So we can't make an enemy that can only be killed

220
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:53,267
by a single solution, whether that's ranged or melee

221
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:54,907
or a specific effect.

222
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:58,269
Every enemy has to be killable by multiple different

223
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:00,130
player builds and approaches.

224
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:03,142
Finally, we have active enemy caps.

225
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:07,805
So in Hades, we can only ever have a max of eight fully animated enemies at one time,

226
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:13,267
but we can have many more as long as it has a very simple animation set.

227
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:17,509
So these two enemies here, the wretched thug and the numskull, they're two enemies that

228
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:18,750
you encounter early in Tartarus.

229
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:26,133
The thug has full animations, a big windup, a full follow-through.

230
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:28,676
a very awesome-looking enemy.

231
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:31,579
The numskull, on the other hand,

232
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,462
all of its animations are actually single frames,

233
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:37,205
so the cost of the enemy is so much lower

234
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:39,868
that we're able to swarm the player with a bunch of them.

235
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:43,372
So this is just a limitation that we had to work through.

236
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:47,756
Similarly, the number of preloaded animations.

237
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:52,379
So this enemy has a memory cost that's much higher than this enemy.

238
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,362
We can only have a certain amount of animations at a time,

239
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,483
and that's just normal for any game.

240
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:03,606
So for us, we just have to keep that in account.

241
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:05,528
And of course, it's always a moving target during development.

242
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,728
So when you're designing an encounter,

243
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:10,431
sometimes you have to go back and make adjustments.

244
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:14,293
But the biggest impact that this actually had

245
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,155
on how we designed enemies in Hades is

246
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:21,357
we can't swap weapons or skins on bosses or enemies

247
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:23,078
just at random.

248
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,861
For instance, if we wanted to give this guy a big ax

249
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:29,102
that he throws instead of a big club.

250
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,363
That would be essentially the cost of an entirely new enemy,

251
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:36,005
because we would have to create whole new animations for that

252
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:37,966
and take those out separately.

253
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:42,788
So it just kind of focused our design decisions around

254
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:48,070
working within the visual design of a single enemy

255
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,771
rather than making super modular enemies.

256
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:58,595
So, with all that said, let's jump into what we actually did inside of Chambers.

257
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:03,798
So first off is exit door reward previews.

258
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,840
It was really important for us that the player was making decisions on what they were going

259
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,762
to get because we wanted the player to have agency over what build.

260
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:13,443
they were working towards.

261
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:21,524
So the variance in the Exedore rewards didn't come from what you would get, but what the

262
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:25,785
consequences of your choices of what you were going to go for.

263
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:36,328
So the mystery behind picking an upgrade that's going to make your player better is are you

264
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,468
going to get a combat encounter or are you going to get lucky and are you going to get

265
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:40,389
a fountain room.

266
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:51,701
This meant that over time, players kind of intuitively started getting to know the possibility space of what's behind certain door awards.

267
00:17:53,342 --> 00:18:09,472
And that's actually okay, because what we found is the key to keep the anticipation high and keep the tension is that the result of what those limited possibilities are have a huge impact on how the player has to react and has to adapt to that result.

268
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:11,254
So as long as...

269
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:17,183
The end result was impactful.

270
00:18:17,503 --> 00:18:19,207
It was okay for it to be a limited amount of things.

271
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:21,592
It still felt interesting and varied

272
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,476
every time you went through a door.

273
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,361
Sometimes we do telegraph what's behind a door.

274
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:33,144
So if you have these, that usually means you're going to mini boss fight,

275
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:37,526
and that's just to help make sure that the player knows what they're getting into,

276
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:42,469
but which mini boss fight you're going to get is still up in the air.

277
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,346
This is an example of the fountain room.

278
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:48,587
Nice, easy, free room.

279
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:52,549
When you get that as a player, you feel like you kind of cheated Hades a bit.

280
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:53,970
You got a free reward.

281
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:56,171
This is a mini boss fight.

282
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:02,335
Much harder encounter with the telegraph

283
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:04,776
of knowing that you're about to have to face that.

284
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:13,225
The other thing we did in Chambers is predetermined points randomization.

285
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:19,031
So if we can't modify the whole level, what we did is we picked very specific points inside

286
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:22,155
of Chambers that we knew that we could swap.

287
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:26,900
So whenever I put this table down in a gray box map...

288
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:32,444
the artist would be able to know, okay, I don't want to block this with any visual stuff.

289
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:39,889
I know that it could have a well on top of it, a taller cell shop, or a treasure trove.

290
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,011
This gives us some flexibility.

291
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:46,453
We did similar things for floor doors.

292
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:49,275
So these are portals that take you to other...

293
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:53,438
zones of the underworld, breakables,

294
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:57,181
we swap them with higher value ones,

295
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,343
fishing points can layer over rivers.

296
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,385
The thing to note here is like,

297
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:02,826
everything has the same footprint,

298
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:06,569
which means that when this is placed in the gray box level,

299
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,451
the artist can draw around it

300
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:10,653
and make sure that it looks good,

301
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:12,634
and no matter what's spawned on top of it,

302
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:17,979
we know that there won't be any weird looking after effects.

303
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:23,146
A lot of this is invisible to the player, where these can spawn.

304
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:31,668
It's predetermined by the designer, but if it's working right, the player won't notice

305
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:33,228
that it was a predetermined spot.

306
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,409
So this is actually a view into our editor.

307
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:43,731
These are spawn points placed around the map, and these are like guaranteed safe spaces

308
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:45,131
for an enemy to spawn.

309
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:51,096
So we don't actually have an algorithm for finding a place with no collision.

310
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:52,918
It's all hand placed.

311
00:20:53,779 --> 00:21:00,426
But there's enough of them around the map that for the player it should feel like any enemy can spawn anywhere.

312
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:04,448
But then we have rules surrounding where enemies can spawn.

313
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:07,990
So the first thing that's a little hard to see here, but a lot of these spawn points

314
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,450
have types.

315
00:21:09,471 --> 00:21:11,952
So this, for instance, is a ranged spawn point.

316
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:13,813
This is a support spawn point.

317
00:21:13,993 --> 00:21:15,974
And here is a melee spawn point.

318
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:18,656
We treated these as preferences.

319
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:25,800
So if possible, we want an enemy that is ranged to spawn in more...

320
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,162
Harder to reach areas like this little island up here and if possible

321
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:36,104
We want support units to spawn in the middle of maps where they might be backed up by other enemies

322
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:41,786
But there's more rules attached to that that actually take priority

323
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:47,068
So the player is going to be moving around so this is all ideal if we know that the player is coming in through

324
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:51,670
This side of the map, but as soon as the player starts fighting over here suddenly

325
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,891
What used to be an advantageous range position might not be so anymore

326
00:21:55,892 --> 00:22:00,816
What's more important actually is how close or how far away the spawn point is from the

327
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:01,096
player.

328
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:05,940
So if you can imagine, like, Zagreus is here.

329
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,362
There's a minimum spawn distance where we don't want enemies to spawn on top of you.

330
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,765
We want them to spawn a little bit further away.

331
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:14,587
But there's also a max distance.

332
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:16,208
We don't want them to spawn off screen.

333
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,510
So there's almost like a donut following.

334
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:25,355
Zag race around as you're making your way through the underworld and that donut is like the green zone of where enemies are allowed to spawn

335
00:22:27,717 --> 00:22:32,520
The main reason we don't want enemies to spawn far away is because of that immediacy we want the combat encounters to be

336
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:35,923
Quick and fast and if enemies are spawning off-screen

337
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:41,887
What ended up happening is the players were backtracking a lot through the levels trying to search for the enemy and we didn't want that

338
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,088
We wanted the encounters to be quick

339
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:45,369
and

340
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:46,530
challenging

341
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:57,555
map flipping. This happens all throughout Hades, so if we design the map in one orientation,

342
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,699
our engine is able to just flip this.

343
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:06,717
and make it look like it was designed in the other direction as well.

344
00:23:07,397 --> 00:23:14,782
This was an easy one for us because it feels like a different room when you're going through

345
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:20,646
it and if you don't see this room more than once per run, next time you're in Tartarus,

346
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:25,349
if you see the room in this orientation, your brain actually tricks you into feeling like

347
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:26,010
it's a different room.

348
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:29,612
Which was super effective and basically free.

349
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:34,376
What this also did is it helped us keep exit continuity.

350
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:36,719
So if we're going to serve content dynamically,

351
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,521
we still need to find a way to make sure

352
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:43,725
that the whole underworld feels like a cohesive place.

353
00:23:43,745 --> 00:23:45,307
We wanted to make it feel like a real place.

354
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:46,568
And part of that was to make sure

355
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:47,589
that if you exit a room from a room,

356
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:49,331
you're not going to be able to get out of it.

357
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:50,171
So we wanted to make sure that we

358
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:51,513
were able to keep the game dynamic.

359
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:56,777
We want to make sure that you're entering the next room from that same direction, so

360
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:59,799
it feels like you went from that same room to the next one.

361
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:06,243
And what map flipping lets us do is if a room only has an entrance from one direction, we

362
00:24:06,263 --> 00:24:10,887
can flip it, and suddenly that exit is in the other direction, so every room can match

363
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:15,490
up with any other room, which helps keep that continuity of space.

364
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:26,206
So, chambers, fairly limited in how much we could vary within them, so they were handcrafted

365
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:29,447
the way we would design any other linear game.

366
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:35,790
But we had discrete points of randomization within those chambers where we could serve

367
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,352
a set of known possibility spaces for the player.

368
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:45,974
As long as we kept the results of what you would get within that limited space really

369
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:46,494
high impact.

370
00:24:47,294 --> 00:24:49,656
It would maintain the tension.

371
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:51,857
But next up we had encounters.

372
00:24:51,897 --> 00:24:58,240
And encounters is where we really kind of had the opportunity to do a lot of procedurally

373
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,063
generated decisions and give the designers a lot more knobs to turn.

374
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:07,926
But this presented a whole new set of problems for us to solve.

375
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:12,428
Most importantly is how do we make things interesting when everything is possible?

376
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,392
We started off Hades making every encounter by hand.

377
00:25:18,832 --> 00:25:22,394
So we would say an early, easy Tardis encounter

378
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:25,496
has these two enemy types and this amount of enemies.

379
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:28,757
Because that's how Supergiant had designed games in the past.

380
00:25:30,498 --> 00:25:33,640
In a linear game, you design each encounter

381
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,961
and you make sure that the tension is ramping up over time

382
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:40,424
and new content is being introduced at a good pace.

383
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:44,185
But we've quickly realized as we added more and more stuff

384
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:47,626
is that we were creating every combination of enemy encounter

385
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:48,326
anyways.

386
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:50,967
There was very few instances where

387
00:25:50,987 --> 00:25:55,628
we didn't want this enemy to be in the same room

388
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:56,349
as the other enemy.

389
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,810
So as we added more and more stuff,

390
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,470
we realized that we need more parts of this process

391
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,831
to be procedural, because that's going

392
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:07,052
to give us the widest range of possibilities.

393
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:14,035
That said, there's very few rare cases in the game where we still have handcrafted encounters.

394
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:18,198
The first time you start Hades, the first room you get is our tutorial,

395
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:23,621
where we guarantee that you'll get a certain amount of enemies and certain types.

396
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:31,147
But starting to make more parts of the process procedural,

397
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,730
the question was how much control is the designer

398
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,851
gonna have over the algorithm?

399
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:38,533
What knobs are we gonna need to make sure that

400
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:42,256
encounters don't just feel like random things,

401
00:26:42,316 --> 00:26:47,019
but actually have pace behind them?

402
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,582
So we're gonna go through our encounters generator.

403
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:55,268
Encounters are actually created on demand.

404
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,252
We create encounters when we're gonna serve them.

405
00:26:58,353 --> 00:26:59,594
So if you're entering a room,

406
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:03,400
the encounter can take into account your current game state

407
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:07,366
and present something that is relevant

408
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:08,388
to the current state of the game.

409
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:14,713
So an encounter is given a difficulty rating based on your current position in a biome.

410
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:18,596
So if you are deep into Tartarus, you will have a higher difficulty rating.

411
00:27:19,697 --> 00:27:25,321
That encounter then is filled by enemies, and enemy types have a difficulty rating as

412
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:29,604
well, which is used to take up part of that difficulty pie.

413
00:27:34,034 --> 00:27:36,835
That encounter's difficulty pie is then split across waves.

414
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:39,476
So this is actually just a screenshot directly out of our scripts.

415
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:43,618
This means that a single wave encounter will have 100% of the difficulty rating.

416
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:47,800
Two-wave encounter will split the difficulty 50% first wave, 50% second wave.

417
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:53,543
Three wave encounters, 30% will be in the first wave,

418
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:57,305
then you'll have a little valley with only 15% of the difficulty,

419
00:27:57,405 --> 00:27:59,646
and then we always want the final wave to be the highest.

420
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:02,608
As you can see here, I crossed out five wave encounters.

421
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:04,168
At some point those existed in Hades,

422
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:06,150
and they felt like the game was never going to end

423
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,571
because you were stuck in the same room for minutes.

424
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:12,493
So we kept those there on the off chance

425
00:28:12,513 --> 00:28:13,613
that we would eventually want them.

426
00:28:13,954 --> 00:28:14,914
We ended up never using them.

427
00:28:19,134 --> 00:28:24,416
These values would change very slightly,

428
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:26,817
but whenever we changed anything here,

429
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:28,837
it would actually have a huge ramification

430
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:30,158
across the whole game's feel.

431
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:33,139
So the later we got into the project,

432
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:37,680
the more we stopped touching these values.

433
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:40,421
Once we found the pacing that we wanted,

434
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:44,263
this actually became its own constraint of like...

435
00:28:45,263 --> 00:28:48,525
We know we want this amount of difficulty rating at this point in Tartarus,

436
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:57,111
so if we wanted to change that, we would have to modify the enemies rather than the values.

437
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:04,996
So, the encounter generator in Hades has two styles of encounter that it can generate.

438
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:09,720
As we mentioned earlier, when transitioning from handcrafted,

439
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,744
the first thing we did was to randomly pair all enemies together

440
00:29:14,764 --> 00:29:16,826
and spread them across all the encounters.

441
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,121
These kind of became known as family encounters,

442
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:25,042
which are single wave encounters with a random set of two, three enemies.

443
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:26,963
There's very little structure to it.

444
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:29,604
But what we learned is that when everything is 100% random,

445
00:29:30,064 --> 00:29:34,526
it has the adverse effect of making it so that it doesn't feel unique,

446
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:36,827
it doesn't feel interesting, because you're seeing everything all the time.

447
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:43,828
That's why we, this is a visualization,

448
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:45,890
three enemy types in a wave.

449
00:29:47,091 --> 00:29:48,412
So how can we provide a little bit more

450
00:29:48,432 --> 00:29:50,894
of that hand-designed structure that you would have

451
00:29:51,094 --> 00:29:54,777
in a linear game into an algorithm

452
00:29:54,817 --> 00:29:56,238
that's randomly pairing enemies?

453
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:59,580
And what we got was highlight encounters.

454
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:01,822
So highlight encounters are multi-wave encounters

455
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:04,604
where one unit type is picked as a constant

456
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:07,226
and the first wave is always that unit alone.

457
00:30:08,488 --> 00:30:10,770
And then in subsequent waves, it will have backup.

458
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:16,035
So visualization of that, wave one will have one enemy type

459
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:17,077
and you will only see them.

460
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:19,619
Then we'll throw a different enemy type into the mix

461
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,621
to try and change the context.

462
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:23,944
And then wave three will have two new enemy types,

463
00:30:24,104 --> 00:30:25,385
which don't necessarily have to be the same

464
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:27,728
as the supporting ones at wave two,

465
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:30,551
but the highlight enemy is always there.

466
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:34,134
What this does is it gives the encounters a theme.

467
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:41,762
It's subtle, but it's noticeable because with your build,

468
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:43,784
you're approaching fighting that enemy in a unique way,

469
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:47,227
and if you now have to take into account different context,

470
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:51,211
it builds on that knowledge rather than just

471
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:54,174
throwing two completely different enemies into the mix.

472
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:58,156
This went hand in hand with our intro encounters.

473
00:30:58,296 --> 00:31:00,277
So the first time you see an enemy in Hades,

474
00:31:00,978 --> 00:31:02,379
you always see them alone.

475
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,500
And that's because in traditional RPG design,

476
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,482
that tends to be the best practice.

477
00:31:08,622 --> 00:31:11,344
You don't want to introduce a new challenge

478
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:14,586
when the player is distracted by other things.

479
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,547
You wanna make sure that they have full time to...

480
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:22,549
learn what the enemy can do before muddying the waters

481
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:24,990
and throwing in new context.

482
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:36,854
Our generic encounters also had rules based around enemies.

483
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:40,535
So it was a burden on the enemy to say

484
00:31:40,655 --> 00:31:42,596
when they could or could not be eligible.

485
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:49,300
And they had a lot of data requirements that would allow them to modify how they would be incorporated into encounters.

486
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:56,765
This guy here is a shield crystal. Its only job is to protect all of its friends.

487
00:31:57,946 --> 00:32:00,147
But alone it can't really do anything to the player.

488
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:05,711
So we would have things like block solo. So an encounter will never generate a highlight encounter

489
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:09,513
with the shield crystal because we don't want it to appear alone.

490
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,538
But it can come into any other encounter as a support unit.

491
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,461
Similarly, we have max count.

492
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,283
We use this on things like spawners.

493
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:20,728
We never want more than two or three spawners in a map

494
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:24,993
because those are exponential enemy generators,

495
00:32:25,474 --> 00:32:27,977
so we can limit how many of each enemy type is in there.

496
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,863
We also increased the active enemy counts

497
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:33,425
and the max enemy types.

498
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:35,788
You see the deeper you get into a biome,

499
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:38,372
so you'll see more enemies at the same time

500
00:32:38,432 --> 00:32:39,434
and more types of enemies

501
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:43,840
as we want the pacing to increase with the difficulty.

502
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:49,624
And similarly, we want the chambers to reflect the encounter that's going into them.

503
00:32:50,064 --> 00:32:56,889
So if we have smaller encounters early in the biome, we also want them to appear in smaller chambers and larger ones later.

504
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:07,416
This helps preserve the pacing and make sure that the player isn't searching large maps for just the one or two enemies that we want to spawn.

505
00:33:11,412 --> 00:33:12,634
So another note on difficulty ratings.

506
00:33:13,015 --> 00:33:14,998
We're going to go through an example, at least

507
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:15,579
in encounter here.

508
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:20,848
570 is the difficulty rating that this rolled.

509
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,773
But difficulty ratings are actually.

510
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:25,459
ended up being more of a minimum.

511
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,684
The reason for this is that as enemies are added into an encounter, they take up part

512
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:31,585
of the difficulty pie.

513
00:33:33,726 --> 00:33:38,150
But we always want to make sure that at least one of the enemy types that is chosen is in

514
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,390
there.

515
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:43,555
So oftentimes that will mean if a large enemy is the last one to get added into an encounter,

516
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:44,916
it will overflow.

517
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:45,696
But that's okay.

518
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,678
As soon as it overflows, it stops.

519
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:51,902
But that at least guarantees that every enemy is represented at least once.

520
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:54,243
So, here we go.

521
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:56,424
This is Elysium, the third biome of the game.

522
00:33:57,465 --> 00:34:00,526
The first wave selected the strongbow as the highlight unit.

523
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,987
Here you can see you're fighting three of them.

524
00:34:02,347 --> 00:34:05,069
I'm also using cheat mode, so I'm dealing way too much damage.

525
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:07,030
Wave two.

526
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:11,476
You'll get the strongbow here with an elite bright sword to back it up.

527
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:14,617
Notice that wave two is a lot smaller, just two enemies.

528
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:23,081
And then finally, wave three incorporates two whole new enemies, the shield and a witch

529
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:24,141
supporting the one strongbow.

530
00:34:26,303 --> 00:34:38,542
This is all throughout the game, but kind of provides that designer influence on an algorithm to keep some sort of structure behind it.

531
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:48,568
So elites starting at depth three can be introduced in A-level.

532
00:34:50,749 --> 00:34:52,130
Initially they were just simple stat boosts

533
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,191
but we kept adding to them and actually

534
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:56,252
by the end of Hades development,

535
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:58,553
elites have unique abilities that actually

536
00:35:00,894 --> 00:35:05,339
their behavior. Elites and regular versions of enemies can't appear on the same encounter.

537
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:10,364
The reason behind this is that we don't want an enemy to surprise a player because they

538
00:35:10,404 --> 00:35:16,230
missed some key visual indicator. So elites have a yellow outline, but in the middle of

539
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,693
combat that might be hard to see. So if they're going to have different abilities, we want

540
00:35:19,713 --> 00:35:20,234
to make sure that...

541
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:24,577
two enemies with the same silhouette aren't behaving differently.

542
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,641
So they kind of block that.

543
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:33,985
And enemies can have the ability to block any other enemy type from being in the encounter

544
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:34,266
with them.

545
00:35:34,286 --> 00:35:36,287
And it's kind of a first-come, first-served system.

546
00:35:36,307 --> 00:35:42,373
So if one enemy shows up and you don't want it with another enemy type, it will get first

547
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:42,633
dibs.

548
00:35:45,427 --> 00:35:47,709
Elites have a really, really good effect on pacing.

549
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:55,134
So if we just linearly create bigger and bigger encounters as you go through the game, it

550
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:57,955
won't feel exciting.

551
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:01,358
It'll just be a straight curve rather than having the peaks and valleys that you want.

552
00:36:02,098 --> 00:36:05,520
Elites help us maintain the difficulty increase.

553
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:09,302
It will vary how many enemies you see at any one time.

554
00:36:09,703 --> 00:36:16,166
So an elite will take a larger portion of the difficulty pie and keep the enemy count

555
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:17,246
low in certain encounters.

556
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:20,408
And then finally, special encounters.

557
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:27,732
So in order to keep new things coming at the player, we have one-time encounters.

558
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:31,674
We found that milestones are the most memorable parts of a run.

559
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:39,157
You might not remember every encounter, but you'll remember the things that only happened

560
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:39,437
once.

561
00:36:40,477 --> 00:36:44,219
So, large stretches of our combat are broken up by our rare special encounters.

562
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,540
Some examples of this are survival encounters where you have to survive for a certain number

563
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,902
of seconds, trial of the gods where you have to choose between two gods, the one you don't

564
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,603
choose gets angry at you and upgrades your...

565
00:36:56,583 --> 00:37:00,325
foes, Erebus challenges where you have to clear the whole encounter without getting

566
00:37:00,365 --> 00:37:04,548
hit, Thanatos, you have to compete for the most kills.

567
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:11,932
So a thing to notice for these encounters is that they're asking you to change your

568
00:37:11,952 --> 00:37:17,155
play style, which is important to break the player out of that environment.

569
00:37:19,076 --> 00:37:25,302
flow because the player will tend to do what's ever easiest to complete a combat encounter.

570
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:32,309
But an Airbus encounter will ask players who tend to just dive in head first, take a couple

571
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:34,171
hits but they'll take the enemy out before they die.

572
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,275
It's asking them to play more cautiously,

573
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:40,639
and Thanatos, competing for the most kills, is doing the opposite.

574
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:44,903
It's asking cautious players to maybe play a little bit more aggressively than they would have otherwise,

575
00:37:45,684 --> 00:37:49,448
to try and make sure that they get the final blow on the enemy for the kill.

576
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,632
So, pushing the player to go out of their comfort zone

577
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:59,877
keeps them engaged when they go back into their flow.

578
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:03,120
And then finally, mini-bosses were huge

579
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,501
to making biomes feel unique,

580
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:07,343
and that's why we put a lot of effort into making sure

581
00:38:07,363 --> 00:38:10,426
there's at least two or three options of mini-bosses.

582
00:38:10,846 --> 00:38:12,047
So, you never know which one you're gonna get,

583
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:14,369
and they tend to challenge different play styles.

584
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:16,511
So, sometimes you'll get the one that's easier

585
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:17,231
for your current build,

586
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,472
and sometimes you'll get the one that's harder.

587
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:25,319
So, how do we space encounters in a biome?

588
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:27,160
Let's look at an example with Tartarus.

589
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:31,143
So after room 3, you can get a fountain room.

590
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:33,826
After room 4, you can get an NPC story room.

591
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:34,866
After room...

592
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:36,768
Or between 5 and 8, you can get a shop.

593
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:39,590
Between 6 and 10, you can get a mini boss fight.

594
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:46,516
At room 12, you will always get the pre-boss, and at room 13, you will get the fury fight.

595
00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:52,703
An interesting thing to note here is the gaps where no special encounter can spawn.

596
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:56,067
So that's at the start of the run and right before the boss.

597
00:38:57,408 --> 00:39:02,755
We want to guarantee that the player is still having those like standard portions of combat

598
00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:07,280
so that they're not just going from special room to special room and not really playing.

599
00:39:08,401 --> 00:39:09,281
the difficulty of the game.

600
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:11,722
So we had those gaps.

601
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:14,484
The other thing to note is that a lot of these

602
00:39:14,524 --> 00:39:16,985
are guaranteed to be offered but not required to be taken.

603
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,266
So for instance, the shop and the mini boss

604
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:20,026
in the middle of the run,

605
00:39:21,087 --> 00:39:23,668
they will always be offered at some point in your run.

606
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:26,670
But if you have a room with multiple doors,

607
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,670
you can choose not to take it

608
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,351
if that's the choice you want to make on that run.

609
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,886
So, encounters became our most dynamic content.

610
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:37,409
We had a lot of knobs, we could change them in a lot of ways,

611
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,973
but we found that putting rules and knobs in place

612
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:46,377
helped us add some design intent to an otherwise completely random system

613
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,101
and emulate some of those decisions that would be made in a game

614
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,842
where we had full control over the pacing.

615
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,431
At the end of each biome, the player faces a boss fight.

616
00:39:57,851 --> 00:39:59,072
And as we discussed, the milestones

617
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:00,713
are the most memorable parts of a run.

618
00:40:00,873 --> 00:40:01,973
So we asked ourselves, what can we

619
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:05,235
do to make sure that these pieces of content

620
00:40:05,255 --> 00:40:08,396
that you will see every single run will remain

621
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:09,577
interesting over the long term?

622
00:40:09,997 --> 00:40:13,219
So bosses in Hades have phases that

623
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,860
get triggered at certain health thresholds.

624
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,361
And during those phase transitions,

625
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:21,342
that's where they can gain or lose abilities.

626
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:29,932
So for instance, Megara here, she will get the most screen time by default because she's

627
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:31,373
the first boss you'll see in the game.

628
00:40:32,113 --> 00:40:33,933
So what can we do to make her interesting?

629
00:40:34,713 --> 00:40:40,855
Well, at the first phase transition, she will pick between two ability sets.

630
00:40:41,475 --> 00:40:44,656
She will either get the projectile storm or the lightning patterns on the floor.

631
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:47,476
These challenge very different build styles.

632
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:52,578
But whichever one she doesn't get, she'll get at the final phase of her fight.

633
00:40:54,698 --> 00:40:57,019
These small changes make it so that it doesn't feel

634
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,240
the exact same every time you go in,

635
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,860
but they don't have a huge impact

636
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,001
on how you approach a biome.

637
00:41:02,702 --> 00:41:04,022
So that's where we decided that

638
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:06,043
if you're gonna see the first boss a lot,

639
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:08,324
what better way to make it varied

640
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:10,445
than just add two other bosses.

641
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:17,874
So, the Fury Sisters, Electo and Tassifany, also show up.

642
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:20,577
Their boss fights are completely different rooms.

643
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:22,740
They have completely different ability sets.

644
00:41:23,141 --> 00:41:27,246
And it's kind of mirrors our discovery that we had with Chambers, where small variations

645
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:28,528
on an existing...

646
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:35,510
The boss will feel a little different and a little interesting, but the best bang for

647
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:41,092
your buck you can get is if you have the budget to just create whole different variations

648
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:47,274
that will challenge the player in different ways and then just serve it randomly so you

649
00:41:47,314 --> 00:41:48,114
don't know which one you're going to get.

650
00:41:50,316 --> 00:41:56,307
Similar to Encounters, the Hydra was a similar problem

651
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:57,850
where you don't want to show everything you can do

652
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,691
every time you get to it.

653
00:42:00,683 --> 00:42:03,965
The role of the Hydra changed a lot over the course of development because when we shipped

654
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,087
early access, that was the final boss of the game.

655
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,148
We only had the two biomes.

656
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:09,990
And then we added Elysium and Styx on top of that.

657
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,593
So its role in the pacing of a run actually changed over time.

658
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:18,276
But where it landed was in that middle phase.

659
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:19,717
So we want to make sure that middle phase...

660
00:42:21,518 --> 00:42:23,220
a decent amount of variation.

661
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,101
So we gave it five different head types,

662
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:26,182
each with different abilities.

663
00:42:26,623 --> 00:42:28,645
Here you see the spawner, the wave maker,

664
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:30,747
and the head slammer.

665
00:42:31,928 --> 00:42:33,869
But similar to encounters where you don't wanna see

666
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:34,910
every enemy every time,

667
00:42:36,131 --> 00:42:37,373
you don't wanna see every head every time.

668
00:42:37,493 --> 00:42:40,175
So out of the five heads, only three will be chosen

669
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:42,157
for any one instance of the fight.

670
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:48,700
These elements are similar attempts at varying their abilities.

671
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,602
At the second phase, Theseus gets upgraded by a god the same way that Zagreus does.

672
00:42:54,022 --> 00:42:59,663
But the god that's chosen is always the one that you haven't encountered that run yet.

673
00:42:59,863 --> 00:43:01,404
And the reason for that is for visual clarity.

674
00:43:01,444 --> 00:43:05,845
We want to make sure that if you're using, in this case, Demeter abilities,

675
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:10,546
we want to make sure that it's not confusing which ones are going to be damaging

676
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:12,307
and which ones are going to be friendly.

677
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:17,550
It also guarantees that you're seeing more gods throughout the run.

678
00:43:19,111 --> 00:43:25,354
Finally, once we had added all the content to Hades, we could play a run from beginning

679
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:30,457
to end, and we had it in a state where we found that it was interesting, and for that

680
00:43:30,497 --> 00:43:35,841
new player experience, it was enough variety to get them through their first win.

681
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:37,862
But now our question was, how do we provide...

682
00:43:39,003 --> 00:43:43,305
this variance for potentially hundreds of runs for the long term.

683
00:43:45,527 --> 00:43:47,288
Our attempt at this was variety through challenge.

684
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:51,911
So up to this point, it was variety in how we serve content.

685
00:43:53,172 --> 00:44:01,218
Is there a way we can make it so that how hard the content is is what is keeping it

686
00:44:01,798 --> 00:44:02,018
unique?

687
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,321
So a lot of these features that you can turn on

688
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:09,123
are things that we thought were interesting,

689
00:44:09,323 --> 00:44:10,584
that could add variance to the game,

690
00:44:10,804 --> 00:44:15,327
but maybe it wasn't interesting for a player

691
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:16,627
who was just getting to know Hades,

692
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,148
who was just getting to know the game.

693
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:22,930
We didn't want to complicate the mechanics too much

694
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,651
while the player was still getting their bearings.

695
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:26,852
But at this point, we know you've completed the game once.

696
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:33,334
You might be ready for a little bit more complicated mechanics.

697
00:44:34,095 --> 00:44:36,415
But we also acknowledge that challenge isn't for everybody.

698
00:44:37,696 --> 00:44:41,037
Not everyone gets enjoyment out of just making the game harder and harder.

699
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:45,240
So we tried to incorporate different methods

700
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,861
of increasing difficulty,

701
00:44:47,681 --> 00:44:53,065
but we also added rewards to small increases in difficulty.

702
00:44:53,505 --> 00:44:54,986
So each time you go through the game

703
00:44:55,046 --> 00:44:59,449
with different weapons and attributes,

704
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:04,332
you get rewards for turning on bounties,

705
00:45:04,512 --> 00:45:06,393
but they reset when you switch weapons.

706
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:08,334
And this kind of naturally

707
00:45:10,155 --> 00:45:16,660
encourages the player to increase the difficulty but also turn it back down and then experiment

708
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:25,107
with the different conditions. This was actually kind of nerve-wracking because

709
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:30,291
Was it going to be successful to give the player control over their own variants?

710
00:45:31,212 --> 00:45:34,093
It's not something that is guaranteed to work.

711
00:45:34,814 --> 00:45:38,996
So a lot of our systems behind the rewards of this are there to encourage the player

712
00:45:39,016 --> 00:45:43,899
to not just turn it up to 11 and keep it there, but try and play around with the system a

713
00:45:43,939 --> 00:45:44,259
bit more.

714
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:50,665
So, some examples of this that went to the game benefits package.

715
00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:55,069
We always ask ourselves, how can we make elites more difficult, more interesting, more varied?

716
00:45:57,011 --> 00:46:01,816
In the back to boat instrument, you can turn this on and it gives elites things called

717
00:46:01,836 --> 00:46:03,197
elite attributes.

718
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,322
The player has mastery over the enemy abilities.

719
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:09,644
How do we challenge that?

720
00:46:12,026 --> 00:46:13,187
But also, how do we keep it fair?

721
00:46:14,307 --> 00:46:16,349
So, our first rule was all elite attributes

722
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:18,810
had to be visible at a glance,

723
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,892
because we can't, as we said earlier with our constraints,

724
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,755
we can't change the look of the enemy.

725
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:29,217
We can't add things to them.

726
00:46:29,658 --> 00:46:31,939
So, all the upgrades need to be visible at a glance,

727
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:35,261
and usually this was done through visual effects or UI.

728
00:46:35,782 --> 00:46:37,743
But if this enemy has an attack boost,

729
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:39,684
then it would have a red aura around it.

730
00:46:41,106 --> 00:46:45,912
Another thing that we were able to do is not every attribute has to work with any enemy.

731
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:47,513
So this is the skull crusher here.

732
00:46:47,714 --> 00:46:52,379
His whole thing is that he likes to launch himself up into the air, kind of zoom around

733
00:46:52,419 --> 00:46:56,724
on top of you with a big shadow, and then pick a point to drop down.

734
00:46:57,645 --> 00:47:01,228
And one of our elite attributes is teleportation.

735
00:47:01,648 --> 00:47:06,452
So we definitely didn't want an enemy that you couldn't target to be teleporting while

736
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:10,335
it's up in the sky or teleporting once it was already slammed on the floor.

737
00:47:10,415 --> 00:47:12,036
So it blocked that.

738
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:13,497
The other thing is...

739
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:16,139
Enemies could have multiple elite attributes,

740
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:19,061
but not every attribute had to work with one another.

741
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:22,563
This was really great,

742
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,905
because certain combinations felt extremely unfair.

743
00:47:25,565 --> 00:47:27,246
So if you have teleporting enemies all over the place,

744
00:47:27,426 --> 00:47:28,927
but then you also have lasers

745
00:47:29,128 --> 00:47:30,469
linking all the enemies together,

746
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:33,310
if enemies are doing both of those things,

747
00:47:33,591 --> 00:47:35,192
then you will just get blindsided

748
00:47:35,292 --> 00:47:38,334
by hits that you can't really control.

749
00:47:39,014 --> 00:47:40,235
So those two things block one another.

750
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:44,589
And finally, another instance of,

751
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:48,049
if we threw everything into every encounter,

752
00:47:48,249 --> 00:47:49,130
it wouldn't feel interesting.

753
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,690
So if every enemy was getting these attributes,

754
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,211
you would end up basically seeing every attribute,

755
00:47:54,351 --> 00:47:54,811
every room.

756
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:57,712
So this is another instance where we limited

757
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:58,812
how much you see per room.

758
00:47:58,872 --> 00:48:01,953
So only one enemy type gets chosen per room to be upgraded,

759
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:04,333
and that limits how much you see at a time,

760
00:48:05,013 --> 00:48:09,094
so that it spreads it out over the course of the encounter,

761
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,014
or the run.

762
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,058
Extreme measures, so as the player grows,

763
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:15,942
player grows, bosses have the potential

764
00:48:15,962 --> 00:48:16,863
to become less threatening.

765
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,130
So extreme measures offers often difficulty

766
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:24,495
and variance in the player, in the boss's abilities.

767
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:28,539
This was actually a really fun part of the design process

768
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:32,141
because this came in after the first iteration

769
00:48:32,181 --> 00:48:33,262
of the whole run was there.

770
00:48:33,802 --> 00:48:36,743
So this was a chance for us to look back at our older content

771
00:48:36,883 --> 00:48:40,685
and see what did we miss now that we know so much more

772
00:48:40,705 --> 00:48:43,667
about our game, which is not always an opportunity to get.

773
00:48:45,669 --> 00:48:51,596
So, for instance, for the furies, now not only do you not know which fury you're going

774
00:48:51,616 --> 00:48:56,742
to face, but now the other ones can show up in any random combination to support one another.

775
00:48:59,205 --> 00:49:02,269
In this instance, all three showed up to fight you in the same room.

776
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:09,654
Other examples is Lerny, the bone hydra,

777
00:49:09,734 --> 00:49:14,217
will get a whole new room littered with more lava rivers.

778
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:16,358
And then a nice fun surprise at the end

779
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:22,802
is before they were tethered to their specific spot,

780
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:24,603
in the final phase of this fight,

781
00:49:25,244 --> 00:49:28,326
they get unleashed so that they can zoom around the map,

782
00:49:28,486 --> 00:49:30,367
which is something that they couldn't do before

783
00:49:30,507 --> 00:49:32,368
and change up the ability.

784
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:43,138
power. These in the mentor get new toys to play with. It's intentionally small, it's

785
00:49:43,158 --> 00:49:52,286
kind of a spoiler, but they kind of go nuts. Hades will restrict your view, making the

786
00:49:52,806 --> 00:49:55,912
Encounter Harder, it will add a whole new face to the fight.

787
00:49:56,954 --> 00:49:59,037
And it introduces the concept of super elites,

788
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,321
which basically upgrade any of the elites

789
00:50:01,341 --> 00:50:03,325
from earlier in the game to super elites

790
00:50:03,365 --> 00:50:05,168
so that they're challenging with end game builds.

791
00:50:08,429 --> 00:50:11,311
And that's basically Hades.

792
00:50:11,631 --> 00:50:16,735
That's the approach that we took to make Hades feel

793
00:50:17,336 --> 00:50:20,458
interesting, hopefully, over many, many runs.

794
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,001
So just a quick summary of what we learned.

795
00:50:24,982 --> 00:50:27,103
First off, we embraced our constraints.

796
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:30,506
They helped focus the decisions around what we can do.

797
00:50:32,247 --> 00:50:35,810
Making a dynamic game was new for Supergiant.

798
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:36,891
It was like kind of a.

799
00:50:37,652 --> 00:50:40,615
spiritual exploration of like, is this something that we're comfortable with?

800
00:50:42,657 --> 00:50:47,582
So what we learned is if we're going to have handcrafted content, we want to have methods

801
00:50:47,602 --> 00:50:48,604
of serving it dynamically.

802
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:59,059
And a big way we can make that interesting is to serve a small number of possibilities,

803
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:05,282
but make sure that they all have high impact on the player decision-making, which makes

804
00:51:05,302 --> 00:51:08,223
the runs less predictable and increases its dynamic range.

805
00:51:08,824 --> 00:51:17,073
If we're going to have a randomization, it's more interesting to have rules and intention

806
00:51:17,113 --> 00:51:21,517
behind it, because if you see everything all the time, it makes everything feel the same,

807
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:28,264
and variety is more perceivable when constraints are within a certain possibility range.

808
00:51:30,022 --> 00:51:34,964
And finally, player control challenge, we found was interesting and for the most part

809
00:51:35,405 --> 00:51:41,227
it added a multiplier to all our efforts previously because as you play around with the possibility

810
00:51:41,247 --> 00:51:46,529
space it changes how you approach all the other pieces of content.

811
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,071
And that's my talk.

812
00:51:49,111 --> 00:51:49,931
Thank you so much for being here.

813
00:52:01,505 --> 00:52:02,745
Thank you so much, Eduardo.

814
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:04,386
And we have a few minutes for questions,

815
00:52:04,446 --> 00:52:06,887
if anyone would like to come down to the front

816
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:07,567
and ask anything.

817
00:52:15,811 --> 00:52:26,119
Tysiphany is the Furious Sister who is in charge of punishing the murderers of the Greek

818
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:34,685
heroes and that chamber was extremely fun to design because it's a chamber that actually

819
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,848
constricts over time, so it's as if she's gripping you.

820
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:45,517
Hi. So, yeah, that's a two-part question, actually.

821
00:52:45,977 --> 00:52:54,860
So, I get this vibe that the story is so, like, heavy and emotional and about fixing family relations and all that.

822
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:02,863
So, how come you guys came up with that? And second part, why Greek mythology?

823
00:53:03,523 --> 00:53:05,544
Why Greek... Yeah, that's a great question.

824
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:13,247
Greg is our narrative designer and creative director.

825
00:53:14,388 --> 00:53:16,250
He's probably the best person to answer this.

826
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:28,261
But in general, our goal was to explore a lot of the themes behind the idea of death

827
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,863
and what it means to be in a...

828
00:53:33,456 --> 00:53:40,418
It's an underworld, but also Greek mythology has a lot of family dynamics, which were interesting,

829
00:53:40,578 --> 00:53:48,480
and I think we thought that we had a unique perspective to offer of what those stories

830
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:49,280
meant.

831
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:56,282
So that's a great question that I unfortunately don't have the perfect answer to, but Greg

832
00:53:57,962 --> 00:53:59,183
would be happy to answer that.

833
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:03,617
There is one question from the stream.

834
00:54:04,938 --> 00:54:09,401
What was it like to experience the massive success of Hades, and was it overwhelming?

835
00:54:10,822 --> 00:54:15,565
It was definitely overwhelming in a great way.

836
00:54:17,626 --> 00:54:21,028
We knew that we had a game that we enjoyed to play

837
00:54:21,188 --> 00:54:23,249
over the course of development, which was kind of rare.

838
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:26,171
From the very get-go, we had fun playing Hades.

839
00:54:27,352 --> 00:54:28,732
So we knew that we had something

840
00:54:29,153 --> 00:54:32,615
that was at least interesting to people like us,

841
00:54:32,975 --> 00:54:36,197
but the response that I got was completely overwhelming.

842
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,699
The amount of love that we see online for it,

843
00:54:40,759 --> 00:54:42,940
and for us it's just...

844
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,501
There's so many people who said

845
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:46,122
that we didn't have them happiness during.

846
00:54:46,842 --> 00:54:49,903
a very otherwise dark time.

847
00:54:50,063 --> 00:54:51,623
So that's the most we could ask for.

848
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,684
And it was very surprising, but very humbling.

849
00:54:55,444 --> 00:54:55,684
Thank you.

850
00:54:59,245 --> 00:55:02,445
Hello.

851
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:05,726
Your levels were all hand-painted,

852
00:55:06,066 --> 00:55:09,567
and I'm sure, what was like the biggest challenges

853
00:55:09,627 --> 00:55:12,687
and stuff you would have changed with the process

854
00:55:12,907 --> 00:55:14,547
if you were to do the game again

855
00:55:14,848 --> 00:55:16,268
from your experiences today.

856
00:55:19,384 --> 00:55:20,224
That's a good question.

857
00:55:26,347 --> 00:55:31,130
There was always the possibility of randomizing the traps as well as the enemies.

858
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:37,253
And I think that would be a really interesting thing to still be able to explore.

859
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:43,157
We didn't really leave too much on the back burner.

860
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:44,798
Like everything that we wanted to put into the game,

861
00:55:44,898 --> 00:55:47,740
we were able to put in to Hades.

862
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:50,983
So I can't say for certain that there's something

863
00:55:51,023 --> 00:55:52,684
that I would have done completely differently.

864
00:55:52,704 --> 00:55:53,645
But...

865
00:56:00,312 --> 00:56:08,362
Yeah, if we had a method of changing the traps within an encounter, I think that would have

866
00:56:08,502 --> 00:56:11,265
also given rooms a very different personality.

867
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:14,449
So it would have been fun to explore that, but yeah.

868
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:16,211
Thank you.

869
00:56:16,392 --> 00:56:16,832
Yeah, thank you.

870
00:56:20,624 --> 00:56:25,808
Hi, so one of the most interesting parts of Hades for me are the weapons, because there

871
00:56:25,868 --> 00:56:29,751
are six different weapons and all of them have four different forms they can take on.

872
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:34,596
And then they are different based on the powers that you pick up during the runs.

873
00:56:34,696 --> 00:56:40,100
And I was wondering how it was to design with so many different capabilities of a run.

874
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,783
Yeah, that's a great question.

875
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:52,317
The weapons are definitely designed to play towards very different player styles.

876
00:56:53,758 --> 00:57:02,262
So some of them are more aggressive, more in your face, and some of them are more reserved,

877
00:57:02,402 --> 00:57:03,942
play safe, shoot from afar.

878
00:57:05,063 --> 00:57:09,545
And it was important to us to have those.

879
00:57:10,745 --> 00:57:14,426
It was important for Hades to have something for someone.

880
00:57:15,046 --> 00:57:18,207
So not every weapon had to be everyone's favorite,

881
00:57:18,307 --> 00:57:20,708
as long as it was somebody's favorite.

882
00:57:22,048 --> 00:57:28,250
And on the content side, it was just the content's job to support that

883
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:29,090
and make sure that there was...

884
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:33,973
Not every encounter had to be the most difficult or the most interesting for any particular weapon type,

885
00:57:34,634 --> 00:57:39,877
but certain encounters and maps were definitely designed around it being more interesting.

886
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:43,320
So for example, Asphodel is a lot harder as a melee

887
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:45,721
weapon because

888
00:57:46,662 --> 00:57:48,743
you have to take into account where you're standing a lot more,

889
00:57:49,223 --> 00:57:52,386
whereas if you have a ranged weapon, you're probably able to pick out a safer spot.

890
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:56,627
But in Elysium, enemies are really good at chasing you down,

891
00:57:56,967 --> 00:57:59,808
which means that if you're a ranged player,

892
00:58:00,308 --> 00:58:01,789
now you have to be a little bit more on the move.

893
00:58:02,809 --> 00:58:04,050
So it kind of goes hand in hand.

894
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:05,870
The weapons provide a play style,

895
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:07,971
and the content hopefully provides different contexts

896
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,551
to challenge that play style.

897
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:11,512
Yeah. Thank you very much.

898
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:11,992
Yeah, thank you.

899
00:58:15,513 --> 00:58:18,994
I was actually a bit curious about the Thanatos challenges,

900
00:58:19,434 --> 00:58:21,395
because when you enter such a room,

901
00:58:21,435 --> 00:58:22,315
you can have a very...

902
00:58:23,632 --> 00:58:27,273
You can have a lot of damage per second or very little.

903
00:58:27,793 --> 00:58:32,836
Is there any sort of constraints that change how often he attacks in that mode?

904
00:58:34,856 --> 00:58:36,737
We definitely...

905
00:58:37,077 --> 00:58:38,978
We went through a lot of iterations of Thanatos.

906
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:50,171
We knew, like it was a very particular balance of how fair it felt for him to be able to

907
00:58:50,451 --> 00:58:52,272
steal hits and how often he attacked.

908
00:58:52,872 --> 00:58:54,733
So he only really has two main ability sets.

909
00:58:55,333 --> 00:59:01,356
The first one is he marks an enemy who's marked for death and then there's also the AOE that

910
00:59:01,376 --> 00:59:03,656
will kill any enemy after like four seconds.

911
00:59:04,297 --> 00:59:12,124
So the knobs that we had there were how long those telegraphs existed before they one-shot

912
00:59:12,144 --> 00:59:12,724
killed the enemies.

913
00:59:14,546 --> 00:59:15,907
And the balance there was finding...

914
00:59:20,138 --> 00:59:25,860
how long most builds would take to take down a certain enemy, but certainly burst builds

915
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,441
tended to be better against him than damage over time builds.

916
00:59:30,481 --> 00:59:34,903
And that was just part of the nature of encountering him.

917
00:59:34,963 --> 00:59:40,245
Sometimes you will completely take every kill, and sometimes it'll be a close race, and sometimes

918
00:59:40,265 --> 00:59:40,925
you do lose to him.

919
00:59:43,226 --> 00:59:50,053
A key thing there was the reward that you chose for that room isn't dependent on whether you win, it's actually just a bonus.

920
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:57,480
So you'll still get the reward for finishing the encounter, and you'll be rewarded if you played aggressively and got the kills.

921
00:59:58,681 --> 01:00:06,448
But that reward the player, not punish the player, makes it so that your perception of the NPC is also positive.

922
01:00:06,489 --> 01:00:08,691
Because if he showed up, beat you, and took your reward...

923
01:00:10,112 --> 01:00:13,974
He wouldn't be a very likable character, he would be closer to Theseus.

924
01:00:14,054 --> 01:00:15,474
He's very likable.

925
01:00:15,574 --> 01:00:17,675
Exactly, that's the hope that we wanted for him.

926
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:23,898
I was a bit more curious, like, these constraints, are these determined, like, do you have an

927
01:00:24,158 --> 01:00:30,481
estimate that this weapon type with this primary god deals, is this and this aggressive, or

928
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:37,625
is this something you measure throughout the game, like, this player kills enemies this

929
01:00:37,705 --> 01:00:38,465
fast and so on?

930
01:00:40,035 --> 01:00:43,558
We didn't have specific stats on that,

931
01:00:43,618 --> 01:00:47,000
just because there's so many variations of builds

932
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:50,222
you can make with the weapon and god combinations.

933
01:00:50,682 --> 01:00:56,506
So we had a gut feeling, but we didn't necessarily

934
01:00:56,566 --> 01:01:00,289
know that certain builds would have x amount of damage.

935
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:01,770
And we don't modify the encounters

936
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:03,511
based on the player abilities.

937
01:01:04,712 --> 01:01:06,092
We designed the encounters to be.

938
01:01:08,675 --> 01:01:11,818
varied so that different encounters will challenge things,

939
01:01:11,898 --> 01:01:14,841
but sometimes it'll just be a little bit too hard

940
01:01:14,881 --> 01:01:15,782
or a little bit too easy,

941
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:17,644
and that's kind of the fun of the variance.

942
01:01:17,664 --> 01:01:18,565
Yeah.

943
01:01:19,326 --> 01:01:19,626
Thank you.

944
01:01:19,866 --> 01:01:20,407
Yeah, thank you.
