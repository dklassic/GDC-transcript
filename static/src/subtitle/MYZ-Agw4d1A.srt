1
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:17,777
We are here to set the record straight as technical designers on what this role is all

2
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:18,017
about.

3
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:22,841
Too many people still stutter when talking about what a tech designer is supposed to

4
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:28,305
do, how to manage one, let alone writing an accurate job description when hiring.

5
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:32,721
So in true tech design fashion, instead of taking this endeavor on by myself,

6
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:37,643
I've called and assembled my Avengers of tech design,

7
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:42,125
whom I've had the benefit of either studying with or working alongside of.

8
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:46,668
I consider them not only dear friends, but role models and mentors.

9
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:51,710
Together, we combine for just shy of a century's worth of experience

10
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,431
in the industry, performing this role.

11
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:56,792
across many different projects and studios

12
00:00:56,792 --> 00:01:00,854
to hopefully give you the most holistic view possible.

13
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:04,576
Welcome to Avoiding an Identity Crisis as a Technical Designer.

14
00:01:04,576 --> 00:01:09,159
On this panel, we're going to get into it and lay a firm foundation

15
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,220
on what a tech designer is.

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,402
We're going to share what a typical day tends to look like.

17
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:20,024
We'll then carve clear lines in the sand on how this role differs from

18
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:21,745
the other design families.

19
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:36,721
We'll talk about whether we also talk about what it means to generalize and how that leads to being as effective as we can in this role, and also contrast that with specializing which is sometimes also necessary.

20
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:43,897
We'll point out some of the common pitfalls that tends to arise in this role and how to avoid those.

21
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:52,982
And finally, we'll wrap up with advice on how you can get into, grow in, or even nurture this role at your studio.

22
00:01:52,982 --> 00:02:03,166
I'll invite you to jump in on the chat, say what you currently do, and mention what you hope to walk away with from this panel.

23
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,547
A little bit about me.

24
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:14,439
I'm John Diaz, a technical designer at EA on the Frostbite engine, which powers some

25
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:22,222
of our franchises like Need for Speed, Madden, FIFA, Battlefield, Show of Hands, or even

26
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:25,143
in the chat of who has seen the latest Battlefield trailer.

27
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:29,714
And there I do all the usual things in tandem with engineering,

28
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:33,855
enhancing workflows, designing dev-facing features,

29
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:40,936
providing general support to our devs, be it in the form of documentation, examples, and tutorials.

30
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:47,278
I've been at this since I graduated from FUSO in 2006, just shortly after Rusty and Anne.

31
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:50,993
I thought I was going to break in and be a gameplay or tools

32
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:51,533
programmer.

33
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:52,854
Turns out my first gig actually came

34
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:56,035
in the form of a game designer at Midway Austin,

35
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:59,576
scripting content on Unreal 3, alongside our then

36
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:01,337
technical designer, Rusty.

37
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:05,719
And honestly, I attached myself to him

38
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,500
and modeled what he did, enough that eventually he

39
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,761
gave me a chance and took me under his wing to get

40
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:12,622
my first taste of doing tech design.

41
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:15,123
And since then, I've never looked back,

42
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:17,064
despite what my role officially said.

43
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:22,273
At Rockstar, I moved into more of a player-facing role,

44
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:25,574
scripting content and missions in San Diego.

45
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:30,455
So that's where Alan was actually a prominent voice

46
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:32,836
on the technical portion of my interview gauntlet.

47
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:35,097
So I worked alongside him there

48
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:36,937
and Alicia on Red Dead Redemption 1,

49
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:39,958
Undead Nightmare, onto GTA 5,

50
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:43,420
and about a year or so on Red Dead 2.

51
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:50,588
After that, I ventured over the border, got in at WB Games Montreal to do AI systems.

52
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:57,234
And that's where I met the powerhouse Jerome Perrant and worked a little bit on Gotham

53
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,716
Knights and got my first taste of Unreal 4.

54
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:04,020
Eventually Amazon enticed me to come over into the world of engine development to get

55
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,445
back into my roots into dev facing development as a tutorials technical designer.

56
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:14,695
showing the world how to use Lumberyard, and which, funny enough, made me a prominent

57
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:23,100
candidate for the Frostbite UX team over at EA. A little fun fact about me is I produce a game dev

58
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,043
podcast that focuses on sharing our stories and experiences as game devs

59
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:33,045
to hopefully leave the industry a little bit better than when we came into it.

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,882
With all of that said, I'm going to get out the way for the real stars of this panel.

61
00:04:39,882 --> 00:04:44,564
So I'll turn it over to our Bruce Banner, aka Alan Blaine.

62
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:51,787
Hey, John. Thanks. Hey, everybody. My name is Alan Blaine. I am a staff technical designer at

63
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:57,409
Bungie, where I've been for the last five years, and I help build activity and pursuit design

64
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:03,011
tool sets. Currently, I'm the team lead of a technical design team called Frameworks and

65
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,432
Rituals.

66
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:06,019
where we have two roles.

67
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,700
We define the rules and best practices

68
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,162
for all the various kinds of content we build on Destiny

69
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:16,364
and help build tools to support those rules

70
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:18,405
so that when people build new strikes,

71
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,646
they're consistent with old strikes

72
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:22,566
and they work the same way.

73
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,307
Second, we actually maintain and enhance

74
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:27,749
the live game, evergreen ritual gameplay,

75
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:28,089
things like.

76
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:31,058
adding Nightfalls, Crucible, Gambit.

77
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:33,780
So I've been designing and building

78
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,623
and shipping games for 23 years.

79
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:39,225
And I have design credits on every PlayStation,

80
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:41,687
every Xbox console, which is kind of interesting.

81
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:45,130
I actually got into tech design in college.

82
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,594
I was working on a Quake total conversion

83
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:49,614
as one of my projects.

84
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:50,915
And back in those days,

85
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:52,955
the only way to get new models into the game

86
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:55,936
for enemies and guns was to,

87
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:57,896
you had to have an SGI machine,

88
00:05:57,896 --> 00:05:59,737
which I think at the time cost 15 to $20,000.

89
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:04,878
Id luckily put out the source code for their export tools.

90
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:07,859
So I took that source code and actually built 3D Studio Max

91
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,299
and Lightwave exporters for models

92
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:11,780
so that people could add new guns.

93
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,380
and new enemies to the game.

94
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,562
And I believe those were the first tools put out publicly

95
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:20,002
to do that with anything beyond SGI.

96
00:06:20,002 --> 00:06:22,463
Anyway, that was a long time ago,

97
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,464
and I've been doing tech design on just about every project

98
00:06:25,464 --> 00:06:27,465
ever since.

99
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:29,785
So yeah, I'll hand it off to Alicia.

100
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:46,256
Hi, my name is Alicia Thayer and I am a lead technical designer at Crystal Dynamics. I've been at Crystal for almost nine years now which is kind of crazy. And I've been in the industry for about 12. I worked with like John said, Alan and John at Rockstar previously on Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3.

101
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:52,211
Currently I'm working on R&D at Crystal Dynamics. I can't really say much about what I'm talking

102
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:56,435
about but previously I worked on the Tomb Raider reboot games and Lara Croft and the Temple of

103
00:06:56,435 --> 00:07:02,122
Osiris which is very near and dear to my heart. As for how I got here, I kind of face planted

104
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,806
into technical design. I took a very academically oriented path.

105
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:10,349
And the reason for that was because I started really early on my path.

106
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:16,054
I wanted to get into games, probably down, starting at like 10, 11, 12, somewhere in there,

107
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:21,197
because I remember having this profound moment where I realized that people make games and I

108
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:27,883
can be one of them. So I wanted to go to school for it. There weren't any programs that were near

109
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:33,527
me that really did video game design yet. So I kind of did like a special undergraduate

110
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:34,387
graduate program.

111
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,249
at California State University Chico.

112
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,971
And it was pretty crazy towards the end.

113
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:42,492
I finished my thesis on a Monday.

114
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:44,633
I had a job at Rockstar on a Friday.

115
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,894
Rockstar was one of the many companies that I applied to.

116
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:50,797
I got a job, I think, as technically a content creator.

117
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:52,858
It ended up being more of a tech design role,

118
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:55,219
but I didn't even know what a tech designer was at the time.

119
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,041
And yeah, I worked as a scripter there for a while

120
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,783
and then ended up making it up to Crystal,

121
00:08:00,783 --> 00:08:03,545
where I am now a lead tech designer

122
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:05,767
and I'm trying to get a tech design department established.

123
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:08,609
So I'm going to pass it over to Anne.

124
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:11,031
Hello, I'm Anne Childen.

125
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:15,354
I am a senior technical designer and project design architect

126
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:16,115
at Volition.

127
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:19,418
I've been at Volition for about 11 years now.

128
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:23,301
I've been in the industry for about 15 years.

129
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:28,600
have done everything from missions, design, system design,

130
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,681
open world design.

131
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:33,343
And about six or seven years ago,

132
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:38,667
Rusty had pulled me over to help work on creating

133
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,770
our own visual scripting system for our editor.

134
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,512
And I have been in tech design ever since.

135
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:48,615
And I will just pass it over to Jerome.

136
00:08:50,801 --> 00:09:00,607
Hi, I'm Jerome Parent. I'm currently working on Gotham Knights as an advanced technical level designer at WB Games Montreal, where I've been for about five years now.

137
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:06,850
I've been in the industry for about 14 years, the first six of which have been in QA.

138
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:13,874
So I didn't take an academic path into the industry, but I still more or less accidentally became a tech designer.

139
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:18,197
After working at EA, I worked at a small indie studio and helped them ship their first game.

140
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:20,829
And after that, we started using Unreal 4,

141
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:22,350
and I was able to kind of pick it up,

142
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,992
and that gave me the opportunity to switch over

143
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:26,534
to the dev side.

144
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:29,276
And one day, my boss came to me because he

145
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:30,437
needed to renew my contract, and he

146
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,738
didn't know what title to put on it

147
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,600
because he wasn't sure what I did.

148
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,862
And I had heard that technical designer was a thing,

149
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:38,464
so that's actually how I became one.

150
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:39,905
And last but not least, Rusty.

151
00:09:41,993 --> 00:09:46,920
Hi, my name is Rusty Simstrad, I'm the lead technical designer at Arcane Austin.

152
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:55,672
We are working on something that I can't talk about yet but I can say that what I'm doing there now is kind of trying to start or have started a technical design group there.

153
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:58,075
I'm one of two technical designers there so that's exciting now.

154
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:06,279
And my kind of path in the industry was, as John mentioned, went to Full Sail, graduated in 06 and

155
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,681
started at Midway Austin, where I got to work alongside a whole group of Full Sail alumni,

156
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:16,763
including John, and got to find out about the technical design role, because I didn't even

157
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:21,225
know about it prior to that. Similar to John, thought I would be a programmer, got into mission

158
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:25,807
design, but then at Midway quickly transitioned into technical design, and fortunately have been

159
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:26,788
able to do that.

160
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:30,769
in some capacity ever since, including a lot of time

161
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:34,471
alongside Anne at Volition, building a technical design

162
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:37,252
group there, and doing a lot of iteration on our tools

163
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:37,912
and pipelines there.

164
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:40,693
And so just trying to bring all of that kind of process

165
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:45,295
and mentality forward into whatever team I'm working with.

166
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:47,056
So that's a bit about me.

167
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:48,416
Thanks, Rusty.

168
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,517
So let's start out by defining what this role is.

169
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,498
I think we've all agonized over writing the best job

170
00:10:53,498 --> 00:10:56,119
description, so in hiring for this role.

171
00:10:57,518 --> 00:11:02,359
And the best way I like to convey it, I like to compare it to if you take a classic game now,

172
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:09,001
like Team Fortress 2, and you ride that spectrum of taking a tank heavy, where we're at the

173
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:13,982
forefront trailblazing and taking damage and dealing damage, or ride that onto the other

174
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:19,763
end of the spectrum on the support meta class, where we're reaching designers' health and

175
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:23,423
helping boost them to new capabilities on the role.

176
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:30,626
And I can only speculate on the types of games that come out of volition that your designers

177
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:35,188
are well equipped with some sweet tools developed in tandem with tech designers.

178
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:40,730
As the tech designer and now project architect, how do you define what a tech designer is?

179
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,653
The short and sweet version that I use to describe a tech designer is

180
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:50,495
our job is to get as close to the make game button as possible.

181
00:11:52,135 --> 00:12:01,360
Ultimately, our job is to make it as easy as possible to integrate so that people have

182
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,442
more time to iterate on the content that goes into the game.

183
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:12,426
So our primary customers are designers, but we also, you know, keep all content creators

184
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:13,687
in mind when we do stuff.

185
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:22,437
Essentially, we just want to spend as much time as possible, you know, making games fun and less time

186
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:26,658
struggling trying to get what's in our head into the game and

187
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:32,199
It comes down to who's your end user, you know as a game designer your end user is

188
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,760
The player as a tech designer your end user is the content creator

189
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,701
and so that's what our job is to you know design for the content creators whether it be

190
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:45,322
new tools

191
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:53,690
adjusting workflows and pipelines, anything that can make it so that they are not using their brain

192
00:12:53,690 --> 00:13:00,513
space just struggling to get something into the game but just making it as fun as possible and

193
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:06,435
you know making the game as the best that it can be. I know Rusty and I used to always talk about

194
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:12,138
this when we worked together so Rusty what are your ideas on it? Yeah I mean it's

195
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:17,967
I think that the point that you made about focusing on sort of like the tech designer's

196
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:23,588
customer, so to speak, is the content developer. Just like that's kind of the end user that we're

197
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:30,289
focused on. And once you kind of know that and have established that in your mindset as a technical

198
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:35,330
designer, I think it really helps inform just kind of how you approach problems and the kind

199
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,351
of things you choose to prioritize. So as you said, like focusing on iteration and support

200
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:45,093
there's been lots of talks in the past at GDC and research on,

201
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:47,914
you know, the more iteration that goes into a game,

202
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:50,756
you know, the better the resulting player experience.

203
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:53,597
I've always liked to say like, you know, good ideas on paper

204
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:55,137
become great ideas through iteration.

205
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:59,139
And so as a technical designer, my goal is to try to support

206
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,540
and encourage as many iterations as possible in my content.

207
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,041
So that can take the form of.

208
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:10,126
trying to reduce the number of steps to getting, say, a feature in or getting a piece of content

209
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:10,887
into the game.

210
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:14,589
So that way, instead of spending maybe a week doing that,

211
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:15,670
you can spend two days getting in

212
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,310
and have those three days to iterate on

213
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,691
and really kind of tweak it to what a designer wants it to be

214
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,932
for the player experience.

215
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:24,972
As you said, kind of just thinking about that brain capacity,

216
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:28,514
like the cognitive load that is part of a given workflow,

217
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,054
whether that's the number of steps

218
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:32,355
I have to remember, documentation,

219
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:34,135
anything that tech design can do

220
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:35,936
to bring that cognitive load down,

221
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:39,679
means that that's more brain space for the designer to not only have the hopefully the

222
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,802
time to focus on the iteration but also just to think about what they want to do,

223
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:48,087
what they want to change, how they want to improve it. And another thing that always

224
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,572
has to I think be kind of like a guiding principle for tech design is to recognize that

225
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:57,673
in most engines, there are multiple ways to do a given thing. And so we have to think about the

226
00:14:57,673 --> 00:15:02,035
path of least resistance. And that's part of the cognitive load, which is saying, okay, which is

227
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:06,676
the path of least resistance to getting this thing implemented? That's the thing we need to focus on,

228
00:15:06,676 --> 00:15:11,298
not make sure that we support three or four ways to do it and they all work just as well. We should

229
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:15,999
prioritize and make sure that there's one way that's like the best way and sort of the natural

230
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,260
way that people want to do it.

231
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,950
And the last thing is actually something

232
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,671
I picked up from another technical designer, Evan,

233
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,651
while working at Volition, which is

234
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:26,772
the idea of the local maximum versus a global maximum.

235
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,612
And tech design is in the prime spot

236
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:30,172
to always be thinking about how do we

237
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,853
reach that global maximum.

238
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:35,314
So if we're taking a feature of the game, a feature

239
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,554
of the engine or the tool set, don't just

240
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:39,395
think about how do we make this a little bit better,

241
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:41,495
but be willing to take a step back and say,

242
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:44,116
what if we rethink how we even do this workflow?

243
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:47,116
Could we achieve something much higher as that global maximum

244
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:47,997
once we do that?

245
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:56,823
So that's kind of what I think of a tech design and sort of those guiding principles that help you kind of frame everything that you're going to be doing.

246
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:01,486
Thanks for that.

247
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:07,111
My day is very rarely what I envision it will be, save for what's actually on my calendar.

248
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:13,836
I feel like I often get the rug pulled out from underneath me, yet we always make advances towards moving the needle forward.

249
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:14,936
I need to know is it just me.

250
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:20,827
Jerome, I'm curious how your typical day tends to go,

251
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:22,687
especially now that we're working from home.

252
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:27,409
I remember early on on the WB dev floor,

253
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:31,130
if I saw you at your desk before like 4 p.m. that evening,

254
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,671
you know, that was a rare sight.

255
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:35,992
Now that Gotham Knights is deep in production

256
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:37,673
and got a current date of 2022,

257
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:39,373
I wonder how that's changed.

258
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:46,007
Yeah, I think it can vary greatly depending on what stage of production you're at.

259
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:50,949
It can go from much more proactive earlier on to much more reactive later.

260
00:16:50,949 --> 00:17:00,794
Right now, the only thing that's typical about my day is that usually by like 10.30am, my day looks very different than I thought it would look like when I sat down at my desk at 8.

261
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,362
I think that's a pattern you'll hear from most tech designers.

262
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:07,303
It's mainly a support role, so that's normal.

263
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:09,884
And for me, and probably for most tech designers,

264
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:12,105
it's what keeps the job interesting and fun.

265
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:15,747
Every day is different, but it can be a challenge.

266
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:19,029
In pre-production, it can be more about like 30%

267
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:22,310
kind of unscheduled support and 70% time spent

268
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:27,973
prototyping new features, mechanics, helping others with their prototyping.

269
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:36,270
helping with the design of kind of larger scope tools and kind of higher level problems or content

270
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:42,934
production pipelines, like you know your game needs a mission system, well what are the components

271
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:45,376
that go into making a mission from the tech point of view?

272
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:49,743
that someone needs to design that.

273
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:54,431
Tech designers kind of live in between all the other departments,

274
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,536
so we usually inherit a lot of tasks that touch everything

275
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,699
and that don't have a very clear owner.

276
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:06,461
So there's usually lots of talking to lots of different people to gather information.

277
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:13,909
That's maybe something that I didn't expect when I first started this role is just the sheer amount of talking to people and kind of information gathering that you need to do.

278
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:19,935
An example of that is, you know, during pre-production, I spent a lot of time working with TechArt and all the other departments to

279
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:26,261
create a data validation system where we can write and run scripts to automatically check for

280
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:33,169
errors when people are trying to submit stuff. And that required talking to basically everyone

281
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:38,014
on the team and asking, OK, for your type of content, what kind of checks you want to run.

282
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,917
That's usually a task that kind of ends up in the tech design pool.

283
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:48,482
And then that split gradually turns into more of a 70% unscheduled support and 30% planned tasks

284
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:54,165
when you go over to production and post-production. By that point, a lot of the game systems and

285
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:59,488
features are up and running. Chances are you've had your hands in a lot of them in some way,

286
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:05,812
so you automatically become kind of the point of contact for that feature or that part of the game.

287
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:10,735
And so late in production, it's a lot of time fixing bugs,

288
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:14,917
helping other fix bugs, and just generally kind of unblocking people as fast as you can

289
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:21,081
and keeping the wheels of that production train well greased.

290
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:24,382
But at least I'm only in one stage of production at a time.

291
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:26,884
If you're working on a live game like Destiny,

292
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:29,565
you've got all of those stages at the same time, right, Alan?

293
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:36,606
Yeah. So, I mean, it really is like my day sounds a lot like yours, except that at any given time,

294
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:41,688
we've got a live release over here that needs bug fixes. We've got the next patch we're working on.

295
00:19:41,688 --> 00:19:46,411
We've got the next seasonal release that's closing down production and trying to ship.

296
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:51,554
We've got the seasonal release after that, that is in the middle of production. We've got the

297
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:55,377
seasonal release after that, which is in content validation, trying to figure out

298
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:58,258
whether all of the design ideas are technically feasible.

299
00:19:58,258 --> 00:20:01,800
And then on top of that, we've got the yearly release that's going to be coming out at some

300
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,123
point in the future that has its own production cycle. And slamming all those together is a

301
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:12,245
really complex task. So we lean heavily on our producers, obviously, but to try to fit all of

302
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:18,188
those dates and all those priorities together is really complicated. You know, Destiny's been live

303
00:20:18,188 --> 00:20:20,430
in some form for almost seven years now.

304
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,043
And it was in production and pre-production for years before that.

305
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:30,387
So there's a huge amount of normal technical debt built up.

306
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:35,110
And that's a lot of what my team does is trying to go through and mine all that technical debt and fix it all up.

307
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,411
And one of the interesting things we do.

308
00:20:38,332 --> 00:20:43,113
is oftentimes if we change a workflow to make it more stable,

309
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:47,194
to make it better for the players or better for the developers,

310
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:49,334
we don't actually have time in any one of those releases

311
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:53,375
to go back through and fix all of the content that's live.

312
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,176
So we'll put the workflow out,

313
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:58,156
do a little content fix up for one release,

314
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,237
and then slowly roll new content fix up

315
00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:02,217
so that designers have enough time

316
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,858
to make those content fix ups

317
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,538
and QA has enough time to test them.

318
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:08,910
And that's a huge burden in and of itself.

319
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,334
Just trying to go back through and fix all of the old content

320
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:14,757
that lives in the game.

321
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:16,319
Yeah, it's very complicated.

322
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,743
Well said, guys.

323
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:22,647
I love seeing the spectrum of what

324
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:25,991
a day looks like in production and on a live beast

325
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:26,711
like Destiny.

326
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:36,666
I've dabbled all over this amazing chart, I feel like.

327
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,028
I've done system design.

328
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:44,332
And I always feel like it can easily get kind of muddled up.

329
00:21:44,332 --> 00:21:47,034
And there's this, you know, you paper design a feature,

330
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:49,436
you work with engineers to get it built, you shepherd it out,

331
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:52,778
you roll it out, teach designers how it should work,

332
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,940
and be mindful to abstract as much technical details

333
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,781
as possible.

334
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:06,345
Alicia, it's been a while, but at Rockstar, you're responsible for implementing a fair amount of key open world systems and encounters.

335
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:09,206
And I think you even had to fix your title at Crystal.

336
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:15,090
Fix is a strong word, but I think I am one of the first technical designers in name at Crystal.

337
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,813
We have a few now, so that's pretty cool. I think we are up to like five or six, which is really exciting.

338
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:34,432
Yeah, so what I wanted to talk about is kind of the difference between technical design and system design, right, because these, these two things are often confused, even in my studio I mean I can think of recent discussions that I've had where

339
00:22:34,432 --> 00:22:45,442
people, people get the two confused and I think that there are two big aggravators to that. One is that the wording is confusing right, people often confuse a technical designer with a technically leaning designer.

340
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:49,246
And those are very, very different things which we'll get into in a minute.

341
00:22:49,246 --> 00:23:00,040
The other one is is that sometimes you see technical designers kind of moonlight assistance designers on projects, because they tend to have generalist backgrounds, but you don't often see the inverse.

342
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,566
And so the assistance designer tend to really put a lot of effort into workflows or content authoring patterns right.

343
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:20,431
So when I was preparing for this question, I started to do some reminiscing and thinking about my previous interviews of trying to interview technical designers I even talked with my peers, and some commonalities bubbled up right.

344
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:24,756
from their day-to-days, what they consider their jobs to be,

345
00:23:24,756 --> 00:23:26,977
the service that they provide to their team.

346
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:28,338
And so I made this mirror board, which

347
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:29,798
we have on the slide right now.

348
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:31,679
I've showed it around to some people,

349
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,020
and it seems to be really useful in helping

350
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,541
not only technical designers themselves understand

351
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,362
how to communicate what they do, but other designers

352
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,803
understand really the role of that person on their team.

353
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:45,824
The thing that I'm most excited about with this graphic

354
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,004
is that it has, on my team at least,

355
00:23:48,004 --> 00:23:49,745
really cleared up the role for my juniors.

356
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:53,149
I have some engineers that think that they're interested in,

357
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:55,091
like, hey, I think I want to be a technical designer.

358
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:57,614
And I can show them now this graphic and go like,

359
00:23:57,614 --> 00:23:59,036
well, this is what this job means.

360
00:23:59,036 --> 00:23:59,917
Is this what you want?

361
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:01,079
They go, oh, wow.

362
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:01,820
Yeah, OK.

363
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,001
That makes a ton of sense.

364
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:04,283
That's great.

365
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:16,619
So, I want to highlight some things on this board that just kind of clear up the difference between a tech designer and assistant designer and kind of what we do right. The, the biggest thing that I think is important to highlight is we are a liaison

366
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:23,226
between design and engineering, but we are an advocate first and foremost for design. Right, so that's, that's our client, that's our team.

367
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:25,829
These are the people that we represent.

368
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:33,437
We often do a lot of investigation into good content offering patterns for our team.

369
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:45,603
And we advocate those to our team we make sure that we educate our team on those things and and we try to hold them up to a content offering kind of bar quality bar, so that we're, we're all making kind of the same stable content.

370
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,271
We work a lot on early game prototypes.

371
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:49,972
I mentioned the generalist thing earlier.

372
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:52,675
That tends to be because we have generalist backgrounds.

373
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:56,899
We have a knowledge of a lot of the production pipeline.

374
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:00,403
We can do a lot of things, at least at a basic quality.

375
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:10,287
We, at least I have in recent history, contributed a lot to tools and workflow improvements on my team. I know certainly Anne has.

376
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:24,060
And when used properly, a technical designer, like they augment a team, right, and a phrase that Rusty coined during prepping for this talk was force multiplayer, which I love so much that I have used just constantly at Crystal.

377
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:37,987
Since starting, you know, like the preps for this talk I think they're probably sick of me actually using it. But I love that it's a it's a really good really succinct way of communicating, you know what we do for our team and the role that we serve on our team.

378
00:25:38,907 --> 00:25:51,233
Anyway, so the last thing that I wanted to bring up was that since tech designers are often generalists, they do hop around text task wise right, but they do even they specialize right so that makes that makes the problem even more confusing.

379
00:25:51,233 --> 00:26:00,317
If you might have a technical designer that specializes in systems. So I know and has a lot more to say about this so I want to go over and hand it to her.

380
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:08,361
Thank you. I love this board so much, and I'm definitely using it myself over at my studio, because

381
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:14,516
You know, with specifically tech design and systems, the easiest way to describe

382
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:21,222
it is that, you know, a systems designer designs the system and a tech designer

383
00:26:21,222 --> 00:26:23,664
basically acts like Dr.

384
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:29,649
Strange and has to try and envision as many different possibilities that that

385
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:34,834
system can be used in the future of the project or of the entire franchise.

386
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:35,975
And.

387
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:41,696
needs to make sure that the system is architected in such a way that we're not going to limit

388
00:26:41,696 --> 00:26:47,977
designers in the future from expanding on that system. But like you said, a lot of it is more

389
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:57,959
of the technically leaning or as I say technically oriented designers. I get a lot of questions. It's

390
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:02,940
like well this person's very good at scripting, should they be a tech designer? Or this person's

391
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,940
very good at prototyping, should they be a tech designer? And this is where

392
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:12,685
I pull out this graphic because it's very easy to point and be like, yes, this is one

393
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:17,147
part of what we do, but where are they on all the other parts?

394
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:23,008
And it is really important to realize that we do have all these other parts that we do.

395
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:28,970
We may not be visible, because our job is kind of to be in the background and you don't

396
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:35,272
really want to be super visible unless you're training somebody or bringing something new

397
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:35,952
in.

398
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:41,907
I do think that is one of the big things is like, you know, there is so much and it is

399
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:42,888
so wide reaching.

400
00:27:42,888 --> 00:27:50,415
And yeah, I absolutely love this graphic because it explains it perfectly.

401
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:52,958
Well said Alicia and Anne.

402
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,559
Yeah, this graph is money.

403
00:27:55,101 --> 00:27:57,562
And I love that Dr. Strange analogy, right?

404
00:27:57,562 --> 00:27:59,362
I like to imagine myself as a sorcerer,

405
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:01,803
but it'd be so cool to have all those kind of parallel

406
00:28:01,803 --> 00:28:04,184
dimensions and being able to kind of see ahead,

407
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,904
to be like, this is the one that we want to go down, right?

408
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:08,125
And so there's-

409
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:09,965
I'd tell my team to start calling me Dr. Strange.

410
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:10,525
Yes, absolutely.

411
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:21,508
So what has always attracted me to this role

412
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:30,403
And I'm sure many of you out there is the opportunity to kind of get your hands in all the different parts and see how things work and go behind the scenes on them, right?

413
00:28:30,403 --> 00:28:33,908
There's constantly new systems, applications, SDKs, things like that.

414
00:28:35,536 --> 00:28:39,219
Recently, like I've never had a chance to really set up a character from scratch before, right?

415
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:46,327
And so now I'm deep in the weeds on the horrible handshake that happens between animation and physics

416
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:53,014
and dealing with like, so how far we want to data define our input handling and things like this.

417
00:28:54,738 --> 00:29:00,862
So I asked myself, is this the best way to kind of take on the role, right?

418
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:05,824
Are we more effective as generalists or should I specialize?

419
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:08,606
We joked, but we actually seen a few different roles pop

420
00:29:08,606 --> 00:29:09,986
up while we were preparing for this, right?

421
00:29:09,986 --> 00:29:13,989
We saw technical audio designer, technical narrative designer.

422
00:29:13,989 --> 00:29:18,351
I had never seen tutorials technical designer before, and I ended up in that role.

423
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:23,174
Rusty, I've been waiting a long time to confess this to you.

424
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:24,954
And now I'm going to take this advantage to do it.

425
00:29:24,954 --> 00:29:26,955
But I blame you because, again, you

426
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:28,795
were the first technical designer I worked with.

427
00:29:28,795 --> 00:29:30,135
And I modeled myself after you.

428
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,956
Like, all right, whatever, Rusty, is going in.

429
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:34,116
And I saw you hands in on everything,

430
00:29:34,116 --> 00:29:35,717
never shying away from opportunity

431
00:29:35,717 --> 00:29:39,958
to learn something from the ground up and wrestle with it.

432
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:40,138
So.

433
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:50,608
What do you think about the spectrum of like generalizing versus specializing being effective in this role and what are some examples?

434
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,914
Well, first off, thanks.

435
00:29:52,914 --> 00:29:55,197
That's very nice of you to say that.

436
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:57,259
Yeah, I think so.

437
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:58,440
It's kind of interesting, right?

438
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,084
Like inherently technical designers generally are going to be fit

439
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:06,469
into that category of glorified generalist because

440
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:09,853
the generalist nature helps inform so many of the discussions

441
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:12,176
that we need to be a part of or that we get pulled into.

442
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:18,203
and will even help inform your thought process on how something might need to be put together

443
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:25,969
if you're looking to solve a new workflow or a new pipeline problem for a content dev or for a group.

444
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:30,413
But it can also be a vacuum, right? So we have to be careful. I think a part of the glorified

445
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:35,176
generalist question is that it's part of the role, but you have to make sure that it doesn't become

446
00:30:35,176 --> 00:30:40,421
the role. And that will somewhat change over time as well, because I think...

447
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:51,850
A good kind of litmus test for technical design as it relates to the glorified journalist question is, and Alicia mentioned this earlier, is that kind of idea of being a force multiplier.

448
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:55,936
So glorified generalists can do many things and that's great, you know,

449
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:58,940
jack of all trades kind of thing.

450
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,223
But, uh, if the work you're doing doesn't necessarily fit into that kind of force

451
00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:06,288
multiplier idea, then maybe it's worth evaluating is this, is that that thing

452
00:31:06,288 --> 00:31:09,031
that you're doing right now, the highest priority thing that you could be working

453
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:10,713
on as a technical designer.

454
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:11,274
Um, and so.

455
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:15,876
I think early on, being a glorified generalist is kind of just part of it.

456
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:19,918
A technical designer, as you gain more experience and more perspective,

457
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:24,040
and can really start to key into how to be a force multiplier in that role,

458
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,601
that's when you can sort of also use that generalist nature to help inform,

459
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:32,243
like I was saying, but kind of start to be a little bit more focused on what you're

460
00:31:32,243 --> 00:31:37,485
investing your time in and what you're prioritizing, just to help support the team,

461
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:41,267
make sure that you're delivering the best thing you can to support the largest number of people.

462
00:31:41,787 --> 00:31:46,191
The other thing, of course, and Jerome mentioned this earlier,

463
00:31:46,191 --> 00:31:50,134
is that technical design obviously will shift a little bit based on the phase of the project.

464
00:31:50,134 --> 00:31:54,017
So sometimes you need to be a glorified generalist because that's the time of the project.

465
00:31:54,017 --> 00:31:58,781
And later you'll need to really lean into that hyper-focused kind of force multiplier mentality.

466
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:04,085
So I can give one example, during my time at Volition, that I felt like was a

467
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:07,268
kind of a good use case or case example of this,

468
00:32:07,268 --> 00:32:10,611
which is when we were working on the Agents of Mayhem project.

469
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:15,184
the VFX team, we were working with, as Anne mentioned, visual scripting that was new to

470
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:21,509
the whole team. And we also had a very robust prefab system. And so they had reached out

471
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:26,233
to technical design to say, hey, we need to implement beams, you know, ribbon particles.

472
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:29,715
how are we going to script this and how should we script this?

473
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:31,677
And so, of course, that was like the light bulb moment of like,

474
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:34,599
hey, we need to make sure this is highly reusable for you so that,

475
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:38,302
you know, the VFX artists who we had excellent VFX team,

476
00:32:38,302 --> 00:32:41,965
but they were relatively small for how many VFX we had in the project.

477
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:44,047
So I needed to start thinking about that, like,

478
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,688
they need to have quick iteration,

479
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:48,630
they need to not have a high cognitive load for this type of workflow.

480
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,952
They should be able to plug and play as much as possible.

481
00:32:51,312 --> 00:33:00,620
But as soon as you start thinking about that, you start to realize, well, beams are, you know, at the request point, it was purely a ribbon particle, but there's a lot you can do with that.

482
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:14,211
And so we started opening that up to like, Hey, this would just be a great tool in the toolbox that designers could use for maybe content gating or helping to draw a literal line between, you know, connected pieces of content, like a shield generator and the thing that it's shielding.

483
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,214
instead of it being abstract, we could just literally point the player right to it

484
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:23,777
and do it in a very visually compelling way. So we started to bake that all into the process.

485
00:33:23,777 --> 00:33:28,640
The workflow was built to be able to be used by any content group. It was prefabbed for

486
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,261
high reusability with hierarchy.

487
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:34,184
so that we could say, hey, you've got different variations on this.

488
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:38,068
So I am not a VFX artist, but being a generalist allowed me to say,

489
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,509
hey, I understand the workflow.

490
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:41,951
I understand what you're wanting to be able to achieve visually.

491
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:45,174
Even if I could never do that myself, I can support that.

492
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:49,617
And of course, that meant working directly with engineering to make sure

493
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:53,341
that we had exposed the things from the particle system that we needed to,

494
00:33:53,341 --> 00:33:54,782
to be able to do all this in script.

495
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,645
So that's an example where it was one request VFX based that sort of snowballed

496
00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:03,787
into in a very positive way, a full kind of feature of the game that ended up

497
00:34:03,787 --> 00:34:07,871
being used in a lot of different ways for everything from gameplay

498
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:09,892
to purely visual elements.

499
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:13,335
Um, so Alicia, I think you had some things to add to this.

500
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:21,116
Thank you. Yeah, so I think it's actually really good to be a generalist. It makes for a more flexible team member.

501
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:36,366
Generalist kind of have the potential to advocate for other teams right on pretty much any project because they, they understand kind of every bit about everyone's workflows and what they're dealing with on a day to day basis that's actually why they're

502
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:41,790
prototyping right it's really good to have someone with that kind of background for your early game prototypes exploring.

503
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:44,266
new workflows, and new game features.

504
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:46,587
I personally have a generalist background,

505
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:50,930
and it's helped me be a more versatile functional

506
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,611
collaborator on my teams.

507
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:54,733
A few examples of that, I'll give Max Payne 3 as an example.

508
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:58,115
So back on Max Payne 3, I helped work on most of the game.

509
00:34:58,115 --> 00:35:03,219
But in particular, the really cool slow motion sequences,

510
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:03,960
where Max jumps.

511
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,303
and does a little slow motion shooty shooty, that sort of thing.

512
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:11,225
Those were really, really complicated sequences, right?

513
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:14,027
And so people from all sorts of disciplines

514
00:35:14,027 --> 00:35:15,788
needed to jump in on those and dog pile.

515
00:35:15,788 --> 00:35:17,229
I needed, you know, we had the animation,

516
00:35:17,229 --> 00:35:20,832
we had the effects guys, we had the audio guys, design, everyone.

517
00:35:21,032 --> 00:35:22,193
And so what I ended up doing is I

518
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:24,874
ended up creating these little widgets, these little workflow

519
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:27,575
enhancers that would allow them to scrub the sequence

520
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:29,156
backwards and forward.

521
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:31,897
Because there was one in a police station, right?

522
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,178
So Max jumps onto a little cart thing.

523
00:35:34,178 --> 00:35:35,118
He's rolling.

524
00:35:35,118 --> 00:35:37,159
And these guys rappel into the room.

525
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,679
They break through windows, right?

526
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,900
So there's windows breaking.

527
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,201
There's all sorts of stuff happening all at once.

528
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:44,342
And it's really a drag on a developer

529
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,783
to have to play that front to back just

530
00:35:46,783 --> 00:35:47,623
to get one little edit in.

531
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:50,124
So the widgets really, really helped.

532
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:53,206
Back on Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris,

533
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:55,128
I did all the boss fights.

534
00:35:55,128 --> 00:35:57,790
And so we were a really small, lean team.

535
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,833
I ended up doing a lot of the animation, modeling,

536
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:05,455
skinning, effects, early sound stuff.

537
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,956
Not the really crafty things.

538
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,858
Like that should definitely go to my experts.

539
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:10,659
But since we were kind of all tapped out,

540
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:13,981
the fact that I could jump in and do those things,

541
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:16,243
the really easy versions of those tasks

542
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:17,524
meant that my teammates could focus

543
00:36:17,524 --> 00:36:19,265
on the things that really required their attention.

544
00:36:19,865 --> 00:36:21,466
Not only that, though, it helped us jam, right?

545
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:25,068
Like we had a common language, we riffed off of each other,

546
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:31,611
and working together was really smooth and really productive.

547
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:34,912
Yeah, Alicia, I actually think that being a generalist is really good.

548
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:38,334
I think it actually might be necessary for this job.

549
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:41,676
I actually prefer to think of myself as a hybrid, not a generalist.

550
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:44,877
Even my first job in the industry was game designer slash engineer.

551
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:57,917
I've had like on the Warriors, I actually got a tech art credit in addition to tech design, just because I helped out with a lot of the collision mesh generation and some, some of the sprite generation for smashed windows on the cars.

552
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:06,326
Um, my personal process really is to like do a deep dives on things and really understand,

553
00:37:06,326 --> 00:37:10,710
uh, the guts of the task. So I understand the pain points that I can build the workflows

554
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:16,454
to make, uh, to make mission designers jobs easier to whomever, uh, like I like building

555
00:37:16,454 --> 00:37:20,997
the first version of a thing and really understanding, um, back on red dead.

556
00:37:20,997 --> 00:37:23,119
Uh, when we started the rock star engine.

557
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,861
basically doesn't have any of the game concept

558
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:26,922
in the engine at all.

559
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:28,624
It just says, hey, the player's ready to spawn.

560
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:30,785
And then it's all scripts from there on out.

561
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:33,968
So when we started, there was no game.

562
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:35,289
There was no skeleton for the game.

563
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:38,372
So one of my tasks was actually building the skeleton

564
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:38,932
for the game.

565
00:37:38,932 --> 00:37:40,093
What is a mission?

566
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,935
Build a skeleton for mission launching,

567
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:45,658
put the spot in the world, have the companion there.

568
00:37:45,658 --> 00:37:46,919
But like, actually, what is a mission?

569
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:47,599
Does it have checkpoints?

570
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,321
Does it have phases?

571
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:51,182
How do you spawn the actors in the thing?

572
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:52,283
How do you spawn all the props?

573
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:59,568
So now then I'm building tools in Maya to actually generate all the different things in there and then get it in the game.

574
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:09,214
But, you know, Red Dead Open World is a huge game. So we're talking random events, mini games, towns, roadmaps, treasure chests, all those things.

575
00:38:09,214 --> 00:38:12,896
I roll in to build the skeleton, build the very first version of that thing.

576
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:16,978
Then I can start building the API out. Like, what are the other designers going to need?

577
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:20,621
How are they going to build those things?

578
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:21,801
So I prototype everything.

579
00:38:22,618 --> 00:38:30,581
But sometimes that ships, like the very first random event in Red Dead was the coyote being chased by a guy on a horse shooting a gun at it.

580
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:34,242
That was sort of the simplest random event I could think of to spawn in the world.

581
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:38,744
Nice and simple. Spawn three actors, make them aggro on each other and go.

582
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:40,524
And that ended up shipping in the final game.

583
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:44,005
I know they did some polish on it, stuff like that, but like that ended up shipping.

584
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:48,827
Every once in a while you get a prototype that is just good enough to ship.

585
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,148
It might not be great, but like sometimes you need a lot of content.

586
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:59,352
I would argue it's way more than every once in a while.

587
00:38:59,352 --> 00:39:06,939
So, yeah, so one of the one of the core philosophies I always had is I hate to hand people work that I wouldn't do myself.

588
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:10,222
I hate to ask people to do something that I really wouldn't do something myself.

589
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:15,326
So if I go into something and see something where I'm like, if I had to do this more than once.

590
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:17,900
I would be annoyed.

591
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,381
I'd go fix that.

592
00:39:19,381 --> 00:39:20,742
Go fix that right away.

593
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:24,144
Like make sure that when you're giving people work to do,

594
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:25,424
that it's something that you'd totally

595
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:27,125
be willing to do by yourself.

596
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,426
And then if you can do that, then I

597
00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:31,027
think you've got good workflows for everybody.

598
00:39:31,027 --> 00:39:32,988
I think that's a really strong thing.

599
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:33,189
Great.

600
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:37,291
What really well said.

601
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,832
I think that's a key part of this whole conversation.

602
00:39:39,832 --> 00:39:42,193
I think that's where you get kind of the price of admission

603
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:42,954
at this panel.

604
00:39:44,063 --> 00:39:50,227
Now we can step into some of the potential pitfalls

605
00:39:50,227 --> 00:39:51,588
you'll face in this role.

606
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:54,170
At the root of this, we are problem junkies.

607
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:57,212
I've never seen people say no to more problems

608
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:59,693
to solve and tinker and learn how things work,

609
00:39:59,693 --> 00:40:02,315
especially living between engineering and design,

610
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:05,958
always seeking to be force multipliers, right?

611
00:40:07,564 --> 00:40:11,648
And that inherently kind of ends with you being the default owner for a lot of things.

612
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:19,876
So the problem is what happens when you remove that times four multiplier on the team? You know,

613
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:25,241
if you want to take a vacation or better yet, you hit the lottery and want to retire.

614
00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:28,615
So Alan, back to you.

615
00:40:28,615 --> 00:40:33,479
I cringe at thinking how we would have ever shipped Red Dead Redemption

616
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:38,282
if it wasn't for you at those last kind of last tail end of those months.

617
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:42,065
I'm curious to know what you've learned since then

618
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,527
and hopefully at Bungie to kind of mitigate this huge risk.

619
00:40:45,747 --> 00:41:02,001
Sorry, it is a problem. I love knowing all about the project. I love being the person that everybody comes to to ask questions of. I love being the person that is like going after new things. But if you don't find a way to hand those new things off,

620
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:05,264
then you're stuck with all of those new things.

621
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:08,407
Recently, I've started, you know, people always said,

622
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:10,349
you know, you've spent so many plates.

623
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:11,089
This is really great.

624
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:13,892
How do you, how do you manage all of it?

625
00:41:13,892 --> 00:41:17,575
And the real answer is you either crunch a lot

626
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:21,419
or you do a half-assed job at some of them

627
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:23,300
and you figure out how to prioritize.

628
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,661
So I've actually started seeing that,

629
00:41:24,661 --> 00:41:27,924
like spinning plates comment as a real backhanded compliment.

630
00:41:27,924 --> 00:41:29,566
And it's time for me to start handing things off.

631
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:34,858
If I'm doing too much work, I need to give that to somebody else.

632
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:41,582
Yeah, like on so you can be able to take a vacation, you can take a sick day here and there.

633
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:45,484
I had that happen on Red Dead and I took a two week Australian vacation.

634
00:41:46,023 --> 00:41:52,249
And they gave me a BlackBerry so that I could answer questions on email just in case something

635
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:57,294
came up that they couldn't handle by themselves or that the knowledge was there. So I spent,

636
00:41:57,294 --> 00:42:00,597
because of the time difference, I spent my first two hours every morning after I got up

637
00:42:00,597 --> 00:42:06,563
drinking coffee and answering emails on my BlackBerry. And I want to stop that.

638
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,123
I, you know, crunching is bad.

639
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:11,744
Being the sole linchpin is bad.

640
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:15,528
So you have to get, find ways to get rid of it.

641
00:42:15,528 --> 00:42:18,831
You need to innovate yourself out of a job.

642
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:20,132
Can you find another tech designer

643
00:42:20,132 --> 00:42:21,594
to own some of that stuff?

644
00:42:21,594 --> 00:42:24,116
Can you find a technically oriented designer

645
00:42:24,116 --> 00:42:28,861
to own sort of the, to be the proponent for that stuff

646
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:32,444
and teach other people how to use the tools?

647
00:42:32,804 --> 00:42:40,669
Find a QA person who's really good at that, that wants to learn how to use the workflow, and can be the person that everybody goes to, to talk about.

648
00:42:40,669 --> 00:42:51,215
If you're building scripting documentation, build self-documenting APIs. Build it so that your functions and your parameters actually kind of explain themselves what the function does.

649
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:55,896
Yeah, start building your workflow documentation early and make it usable.

650
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:58,879
Uh, oftentimes you can build the skeleton as you're doing the first

651
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:01,561
pass of it, um, and have that be good enough.

652
00:43:01,561 --> 00:43:04,744
Then that first person that you teach it to that technically oriented

653
00:43:04,744 --> 00:43:08,247
designer, the QA person, they run into problems when they sit there.

654
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:11,310
Like I was following the documentation and it didn't quite handle this.

655
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:13,739
you go fix it.

656
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:15,701
Now you have somebody that actually can own

657
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:17,022
and feel some responsibility

658
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:19,544
for maintaining that documentation and knows it really well.

659
00:43:19,544 --> 00:43:23,988
So at Bungie, we have this idea of shepherds.

660
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:26,510
So because Bungie's been,

661
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,151
Destiny's been in production for so long,

662
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:30,313
some of the systems we work with,

663
00:43:30,313 --> 00:43:32,034
the people that originally authored them

664
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:35,217
haven't worked at the company in five years or longer.

665
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:41,199
So you have to be constantly developing new experts in all the different technical systems

666
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:42,080
of the game.

667
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,441
And so we use the concept of shepherds to be that.

668
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:48,342
You need to have one or two shepherds in everything so that they can hand off that knowledge,

669
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:49,462
they can tell people about it.

670
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:53,144
And then if one of those shepherds leaves, you have somebody that's ready to step into

671
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,385
that role, and then you start training another shepherd.

672
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:58,546
So there's always somebody to answer the questions, and there's always somebody learning.

673
00:43:58,786 --> 00:44:08,900
So that you never have that that kind of brain drain and you get away from tribal knowledge which is a real problem on long running long running projects long running games.

674
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,987
Yeah, those are some of my thoughts.

675
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,110
I think Jerome you had something you wanted to add.

676
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:21,438
Yeah, I mean, I think one of the biggest challenges of being a tech designer is finding that balance

677
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:26,502
between how much stuff you want to keep on your plate and how much you want to hand off. That's a

678
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:33,026
daily, you know, struggle for me. I think one of the most valuable things a tech designer brings

679
00:44:33,026 --> 00:44:37,209
to a production in general is the knowledge that you kind of accumulate over the course of the

680
00:44:37,209 --> 00:44:42,392
project. And that bird's eye view you have of either the entire game or parts of the game.

681
00:44:42,673 --> 00:44:47,370
and your ability to instantly answer people's questions or point them to whoever has the answer.

682
00:44:48,097 --> 00:44:53,698
I'm sure everyone here regularly prevents hours and even days of unnecessary work

683
00:44:53,698 --> 00:44:58,640
by just being present in discussions about new features and kind of pointing out,

684
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,262
hey, we could combine these existing systems to do that instead of just creating something new from scratch.

685
00:45:04,262 --> 00:45:08,163
The problem is when you're the only person on the team that knows this stuff.

686
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:16,125
And as a tech designer, it's just extremely easy to become that person because people will just get used to coming to you for information.

687
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:21,251
And it's just it's a lot easier most of the time to just tell someone that,

688
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,432
hey, like that problem you're having, you're asking me about,

689
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:27,454
just give me five minutes, I'll fix it myself and you'll be immediately unblocked.

690
00:45:27,454 --> 00:45:30,855
That's a lot easier to say than to take 30 minutes to, you know, 60 minutes

691
00:45:30,855 --> 00:45:35,077
to sit down with that person, explain to them what the problem is,

692
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:37,719
how to fix it so they can actually fix it themselves, like Alan said.

693
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:42,961
But I think it's really like if you don't do that, every time you don't do that,

694
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:45,902
you you're accruing like knowledge sharing debt.

695
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:51,253
kind of like tech debt, and you have to pay that back at some point on the project.

696
00:45:51,253 --> 00:45:56,437
So I think it's important to regularly take a step back and evaluate

697
00:45:56,437 --> 00:46:02,640
kind of how vulnerable your particular area of ownership is and, you know, plan time in

698
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,244
your schedule to pay that knowledge sharing debt back. I don't particularly enjoy spending an

699
00:46:08,244 --> 00:46:11,886
entire day, you know, documenting a feature that I made a couple weeks ago, but

700
00:46:12,707 --> 00:46:16,048
in my experience, it pretty much always pays off in the end.

701
00:46:16,048 --> 00:46:18,289
Plus, it feels really good to just be able to paste a link

702
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:21,050
to documentation whenever people ask you a question.

703
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,191
It saves you a lot of time, saves you from getting derailed,

704
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:25,853
which can be a really big problem in this job.

705
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:28,934
And that's something that I wish someone told me

706
00:46:28,934 --> 00:46:30,455
when I started this role,

707
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,235
because it's a very insidious problem

708
00:46:32,235 --> 00:46:34,977
where you don't feel the effects of all those,

709
00:46:34,977 --> 00:46:37,298
I'll just do it myself decisions that you make

710
00:46:37,298 --> 00:46:38,578
over the course of the project until...

711
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:43,222
much later in production where it's very difficult to solve that problem.

712
00:46:43,222 --> 00:46:49,607
Yeah, and I just want to jump in on this really quick and say if you are watching this panel

713
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:55,691
because you're thinking about creating a tech design department or building up your tech design

714
00:46:55,691 --> 00:47:00,355
department, this is one of the biggest things because ultimately we

715
00:47:02,082 --> 00:47:07,825
love supporting people and love helping people and if we're left to our own devices we will try to

716
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:15,728
support everyone at the same time and I think this is one of the things that I have seen

717
00:47:15,728 --> 00:47:22,751
burn out tech designers the most and so I think this is just really a huge topic that we can

718
00:47:22,751 --> 00:47:30,095
probably do a whole other talk on and but yeah it is this is one of probably the most important

719
00:47:30,095 --> 00:47:31,415
things if you're looking to build your

720
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:37,740
department. Yeah, I like to think of it as like, learning how to become a senior tech designer is

721
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:42,942
really learning how to be that person that everybody wants to come to to answer. But

722
00:47:42,942 --> 00:47:48,043
learning how to advance past senior tech design is learning how to never be that person ever again,

723
00:47:48,043 --> 00:47:55,306
handed off to somebody else constantly. That's a gem right there. Now I know how to get myself to

724
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:57,147
the next level. Awesome.

725
00:48:02,568 --> 00:48:06,210
After all of this, if we've somehow not scared you off

726
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:09,391
and actually sparked an interest to get into doing this

727
00:48:09,391 --> 00:48:12,051
for yourself, you may wonder, you know,

728
00:48:12,051 --> 00:48:13,332
should I go to school?

729
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:14,232
Do I need experience?

730
00:48:14,232 --> 00:48:16,453
And those are totally valid questions.

731
00:48:16,453 --> 00:48:18,554
Personally, I know I was much better equipped

732
00:48:18,554 --> 00:48:20,394
after going through a whole production cycle

733
00:48:20,394 --> 00:48:23,235
on Blacksite, shipping that, working in the tool,

734
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:25,096
seeing where they came up short,

735
00:48:25,096 --> 00:48:27,956
and understanding how I can help that, right?

736
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:29,797
And kind of offering that up.

737
00:48:29,797 --> 00:48:32,158
Also, my programming background came in pretty handy.

738
00:48:33,598 --> 00:48:34,879
So a question for you, Jerome.

739
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:38,899
You came up from Dev QA and getting deep, deep, deep

740
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:41,940
into indie development, which harmed you pretty well

741
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,000
for this.

742
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,321
So what would you tell an aspiring tech designer

743
00:48:46,321 --> 00:48:48,061
what they should focus on, or even a current one,

744
00:48:48,061 --> 00:48:48,661
how to level up?

745
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:51,522
Yeah, I think it's probably difficult to get

746
00:48:51,522 --> 00:48:57,083
into tech design as your first role in the industry.

747
00:48:57,083 --> 00:49:00,423
It's not impossible, but I think it would be difficult.

748
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:09,875
Normally it's game designers and level designers that kind of discover tech design and maybe that's just because tech design is still a fairly young role in the industry.

749
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:21,246
I think, I'm biased obviously, but I think Dev QA or QA in general can be a good path into tech design because there's a lot of overlap in the mindset of a good tester and a good tech designer.

750
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:28,110
It's a lot of like, you know, trying to think, you know, several steps ahead, being able to reverse engineer things.

751
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:35,193
Indie can be a great introduction to kind of the hard skills of tech design.

752
00:49:35,193 --> 00:49:40,876
You know, scripting, prototyping, touching a little bit of everything, a little bit of animation, that kind of generalist side that we talked about.

753
00:49:40,876 --> 00:49:46,798
But I don't think it prepares you for the advocacy and kind of pipeline design that only really comes with scale.

754
00:49:47,706 --> 00:49:53,691
And I would say the most important thing as someone who's trying to get into this role,

755
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:57,494
maybe fresh out of school or not, is show your ability to learn quickly.

756
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:04,439
Strong technical skills are definitely a plus, but I think there's a direct correlation between

757
00:50:04,439 --> 00:50:08,142
your ability and desire to learn and your potential as a tech designer.

758
00:50:09,363 --> 00:50:25,122
You can join a mod team, you can pick up one of the freely available game engines like Unreal or Unity, pick up some assets on the marketplace, and build something small but complete that kind of demonstrates your understanding of the various parts of game design and how they interact with each other.

759
00:50:25,951 --> 00:50:31,895
And I would say lastly, ask yourself if you're okay with being in support role.

760
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:38,860
This is not a role where you usually get to point at something in the final game and say like, hey, I made this.

761
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:44,684
It's a role where you get to point at lots of different things in the final game and say, I helped these other people make this.

762
00:50:45,304 --> 00:50:53,516
And if that prospect of empowering other people sounds exciting and fulfilling to you, I think you're a great candidate for this job.

763
00:50:53,516 --> 00:50:59,085
And I know Alicia took a different path into this job than I did, so maybe she has more input about that.

764
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:07,536
I do. Yeah, when we were preparing for this talk, there was a lot of debate about whether or not it was possible to have an entry level tech design job.

765
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:20,787
I did a lot of thinking about that and I do think it is possible to go from school into a tech design career, but it'll probably be a few good years before you're doing your job really effectively, since so much of it is in service to your team, right?

766
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:23,842
If you are coming from school, I do have a few pieces of advice

767
00:51:23,842 --> 00:51:25,923
as someone who came from school themselves.

768
00:51:25,923 --> 00:51:28,624
I don't think it's necessary for one that you're a great coder,

769
00:51:28,624 --> 00:51:30,005
but I do think it's important that you

770
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:32,926
have some engineering background or familiarity with coding.

771
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:35,427
That doesn't mean that you're an incredible programmer.

772
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:38,308
Just enough of a foundation that you can apply it to your work

773
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:40,469
and be a better communicator with engineering.

774
00:51:40,469 --> 00:51:42,670
Because remember what I said before,

775
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:45,471
we are a liaison between our design department

776
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:47,412
and between engineering.

777
00:51:47,412 --> 00:51:50,373
So that will just help that communication happen better.

778
00:51:51,414 --> 00:52:07,285
Another thing I think is really ideal to dial in and Jerome mentioned this right is that advocacy thing and team education. I think that honing your skills there is critical to a successful design career tech design career right drum said that that was something that he just wished that he knew earlier and I fully agree with him.

779
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:17,434
Lastly, I think that if you can find a tech design group, and I know we're kind of hard to find, but we'll talk about some social networking after this, right?

780
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:23,077
If you can find a tech design group to hitch your wagon to, absolutely do. Soak up the experience of those around you.

781
00:52:23,077 --> 00:52:27,999
Twitter's actually a really good place to find us, you know, but like really hone in on something and become a subject expert.

782
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:29,940
And then once you're comfortable, broaden your skill set.

783
00:52:32,802 --> 00:52:35,704
Yeah, I think Jerome and Alicia hit all the main points,

784
00:52:35,704 --> 00:52:38,747
especially pointing out that you can kind of do it

785
00:52:38,747 --> 00:52:42,091
from school or not, but knowing, being comfortable

786
00:52:42,091 --> 00:52:43,972
with the idea that getting into tech design

787
00:52:43,972 --> 00:52:45,754
right out of school may be challenging,

788
00:52:45,754 --> 00:52:47,436
whether that's because you just need a little bit

789
00:52:47,436 --> 00:52:49,878
more experience to sort of build up that generalist nature

790
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:52,020
that will help you do the job.

791
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:56,940
or it just might be because those roles are a little hard to find still.

792
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:02,701
I know many of us, like Alicia mentioned, she sort of established technical design at Crystal.

793
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:09,263
The same with Felicia and the technical design group we started there was new, so the role is still kind of new and up and coming.

794
00:53:09,263 --> 00:53:14,564
And so hopefully as we continue this conversation and stuff, you'll see those roles start popping up more

795
00:53:14,564 --> 00:53:17,905
and that might provide opportunities for people coming out of school.

796
00:53:18,685 --> 00:53:31,417
But in the interim, just know that preparing yourself to be a good generalist, whether that's going through school and getting some solid engineering background, or doing some self learning online, just trying to build up your knowledge base and understanding

797
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:31,637
our

798
00:53:32,852 --> 00:53:36,315
all things that you can do to help prepare yourself for the role.

799
00:53:36,315 --> 00:53:38,957
And then as Jerome mentioned, I think really understanding that idea of it

800
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:42,920
being a support role is pretty critical because you want to make sure that

801
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,062
you're feeling validated in the work that you're doing.

802
00:53:45,062 --> 00:53:48,704
And so if you're good with being able to point to multiple features and say, I

803
00:53:48,704 --> 00:53:53,728
enabled those to, to either be there or to be as good as they were, that for some

804
00:53:53,728 --> 00:53:55,850
people is extremely validating like myself.

805
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:59,453
And if that is you too, then you probably will enjoy this role.

806
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:04,252
Yeah, I'll mimic that, like get a learn to mod,

807
00:54:04,252 --> 00:54:08,655
learn to code, learn how to use 3D programs,

808
00:54:08,655 --> 00:54:10,357
learn how to use 2D art programs,

809
00:54:10,357 --> 00:54:13,759
learn how to use sound programs, learn all those things.

810
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,301
If you're on a team already,

811
00:54:16,301 --> 00:54:20,804
the thing I've always done is to be a better tech designer

812
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:22,745
is find the thing that nobody's doing.

813
00:54:22,745 --> 00:54:24,927
Find the thing that nobody's doing

814
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:28,710
because they don't know how or are afraid to do it.

815
00:54:29,841 --> 00:54:32,403
or don't know that they need to do it,

816
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:36,027
but find that thing that nobody is actually doing

817
00:54:36,027 --> 00:54:39,610
and you'll be a super useful tech designer.

818
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,732
There you go, there you go.

819
00:54:41,732 --> 00:54:45,555
I'm getting notes for my tool belt as well

820
00:54:45,555 --> 00:54:47,677
and I've been doing this for a while.

821
00:54:47,677 --> 00:54:51,701
So identity crisis averted, right?

822
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:53,763
I hope that.

823
00:54:55,807 --> 00:55:00,770
you have a better understanding of what this role means,

824
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:04,533
what it can be for you, how you can transition into it,

825
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:07,214
how to talk to your team about maybe getting more help

826
00:55:07,214 --> 00:55:09,516
and bringing some additional ones on

827
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:12,318
so that your current one can take a vacation.

828
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:13,619
It's a EA's frostbite team.

829
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:15,880
Sometime before they figured out they could really use one.

830
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,182
So we're all still trying to figure this out.

831
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:29,423
We've also covered how to best utilize this in a developer facing support role, where we can be force multipliers.

832
00:55:29,423 --> 00:55:41,472
Often something we talked about as well was that you should try to only kind of allocate 50% 50 70% of a tech designers time right because that whole communicating.

833
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,847
and talking that always goes untracked and off the charts.

834
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:47,870
Nobody wants to see that in a burned down chart,

835
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,839
but it's a very real part of our time and key to the role.

836
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:53,801
And ultimately.

837
00:55:54,610 --> 00:56:01,854
We've identified important processes to save us from ourselves and burning out or overextending ourselves, right?

838
00:56:01,854 --> 00:56:07,758
Our instincts are always to jump into fires and and and support to our detriment.

839
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:15,323
And finally, we ended on some key skills that will serve you in pursuing, growing and nurturing this role.

840
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:23,592
There's a ton we had to omit to fit this into the one hour slot, but let's make sure to keep the conversation going.

841
00:56:23,592 --> 00:56:30,175
Come join our dedicated Slack community by jumping over to that URL you see on the screen.

842
00:56:30,175 --> 00:56:32,516
So, bit.ly game dev tech design.

843
00:56:34,168 --> 00:56:38,995
We've also fortunately snagged a live Q&A session slot later on today,

844
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,639
where you can speak directly with us one-on-one live.

845
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,421
I know there is a ton of questions in there.

846
00:56:43,421 --> 00:56:47,627
We're eager to hear them and try to answer them in true tech design fashion.

847
00:56:49,045 --> 00:56:54,632
Also, fortunately, most panelists have already gotten the clearance to come on to my

848
00:56:54,632 --> 00:57:00,979
Autoplay area podcast and do one-on-one interviews where I'm sure we'll dive deeper in on the craft,

849
00:57:00,979 --> 00:57:05,884
go deeper on how they got here, and share more war stories for your benefits. So please follow

850
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:10,169
so you don't miss out. Available everywhere you listen to podcasts, Spotify, even on YouTube.

851
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:23,616
And now finally, I want to take this opportunity to extend my eternal appreciation for you guys and answering the call to make this panel what it is.

852
00:57:24,879 --> 00:57:29,882
I hope it ends up being a very valuable reference for us all going forward in this craft.

853
00:57:29,882 --> 00:57:34,704
I would have been super happy if like two or three of you said you could do it.

854
00:57:34,704 --> 00:57:39,947
And I'm so ecstatic that all five of you said yes, we're in and we'll do it.

855
00:57:39,947 --> 00:57:43,449
And props to your employers and studios for jumping in.

856
00:57:43,449 --> 00:57:46,251
You guys are my heroes.

857
00:57:46,251 --> 00:57:49,893
Please fill out those evaluation forms so that we can continue coming back and diving

858
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:51,874
deeper in on this topic.

859
00:57:51,874 --> 00:57:52,675
Thank you.

860
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:55,310
Stay dangerous, fellow devs.
