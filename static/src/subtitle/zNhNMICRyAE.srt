1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:13,813
Hello everybody. Oh, it's too loud. Hi. I'm so glad to be here. A bit nervous. It's my

2
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:22,143
first GDC, first talk. So, yeah. Thank you. It was definitely on my bucket list. It's

3
00:00:22,203 --> 00:00:26,848
so glad to see so many nice and friendly faces. I'm talking to you, Jeremy. Yeah.

4
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,129
So this presentation will contain spoilers,

5
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:32,950
so if you haven't played Expansion Packs,

6
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,072
you can sometimes cover your ears and eyes.

7
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:41,035
But before we get down to the business,

8
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:46,078
I'd love to just introduce myself properly.

9
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:48,439
So my name is Sebastian Kalemba,

10
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,720
and I'm Animation Director at CD Projekt Red.

11
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:56,650
I worked there on Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and then both expansion packs.

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,351
Right now we are working on Cyberpunk 2077.

13
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:04,892
Before I worked at a company called Platige Images in Poland

14
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:09,753
in a cinematic department as a lead animator.

15
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:14,054
And even before I worked in England for the Real Time UK

16
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:18,235
on a few AAA titles like Kinect E-mails or Disneyland Adventures.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,762
On a daily basis, I'm an animation tutor at iAnimate and I really love it.

18
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:30,103
And a fun fact is I used to be a vice champion of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in Poland,

19
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:32,604
so I love motion, not only in games.

20
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:36,366
But before we move forward, I'd love to introduce this great team

21
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:42,007
of animators, producers, cinematic designers and TDs.

22
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:46,449
So, pushing boundaries. Let's talk about that.

23
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:54,505
For the Wild Hunt, we had to deliver around 16,000 assets in three years.

24
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:57,586
The game is quite big, I don't know if you've played that,

25
00:01:57,806 --> 00:02:01,067
but it's like 200 hours to finish it with side quests and minors.

26
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:06,469
For the expansion packs, we had to deliver just 50 hours,

27
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:10,310
but we did more animation content.

28
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,710
I will talk about that in a minute.

29
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:14,311
So...

30
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,192
we had in essence we had like half of that time because that was just a year and we had to deliver

31
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:30,194
even more more animations in less time. So I'm now going to show you the show reel.

32
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:35,175
It's just five minutes, hopefully you'll enjoy that. It's from expansions.

33
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:55,732
Stunt.

34
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:56,913
Fight.

35
00:02:57,193 --> 00:02:57,993
Stunt.

36
00:02:58,154 --> 00:02:58,714
Fight.

37
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:24,435
well.

38
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:36,121
All right, thank you.

39
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:38,702
So here's the agenda.

40
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:42,123
Mind you, I won't talk about our daily work.

41
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:46,704
I will talk more about how we took our existing skill set

42
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:49,585
after main game and we just straight jump

43
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:50,825
into the expansion packs.

44
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:55,046
We had to upgrade our pipelines and workflow a little bit

45
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:57,667
because there was a little bit like too much content.

46
00:07:57,707 --> 00:07:58,607
We'd be scared of that.

47
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:01,368
So we had to pimp this fundamental,

48
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,388
like basics in our workflow.

49
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:10,511
So I'm going to talk about improving communication and this helped with speeding up many processes,

50
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:14,952
focusing on character motivation which helped us on quality,

51
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:20,994
and reorganizing the animation department during this one year which helped us with both time and quality.

52
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:25,095
But starting with tech, there's a tiny background I want to tell you.

53
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:28,753
We worked all expansion packs and main game

54
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:32,054
using the MotionBuilder 2010, just MotionBuilder.

55
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,654
There was no time to make re-exporters,

56
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:38,135
jump into the new version of MotionBuilder.

57
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:41,476
So we sometimes really been like Geralt,

58
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:46,617
looking at the roach on the roof, getting some crazy bugs.

59
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:49,758
We had really stable tech and that was good.

60
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:53,178
So we felt like Geralt in armor and with two swords.

61
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:55,239
But at the same time we get the.

62
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:01,942
high like a high level like message from the production that we shouldn't bother so much the

63
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,824
programmers because they need to focus on

64
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:09,446
of course cyberpunk at the same time

65
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:13,565
I must say that animators as a mock-up specialist,

66
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:14,866
they've been like one man's band.

67
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,767
We've been like one man's band.

68
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:20,550
So we didn't have, even the motion capture department

69
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,312
that time wasn't like an independent team.

70
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,314
We had to, we have very small studio,

71
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:28,396
we have to, like mock-up studio, I mean,

72
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,938
we have to manage the mock-up by ourselves.

73
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,980
So we got idea, we got some story,

74
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,361
we had to mock-up by ourselves,

75
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:37,923
we had to clean it up by ourselves.

76
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:40,523
and then we had to animate by ourselves.

77
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,384
So it was really sometimes frustrating.

78
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:46,985
So first things first, communication.

79
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:49,745
And this relates to pushing the time boundary.

80
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:53,666
And it's not that we haven't communicated before.

81
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:54,906
Of course we did, a lot.

82
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:59,367
But still we could definitely optimize

83
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:01,348
some parts of the communication.

84
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,048
So as Lana mentioned at the beginning,

85
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:11,603
I need to start from the kiss rule. So, honestly, that was the most important thing. In expansion

86
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:16,608
packs I knew that we have a year, so I wake up every morning, went to the bathroom and

87
00:10:16,768 --> 00:10:22,293
kiss myself in front of the mirror and I'm not a vain, I'm just, you know, I was telling

88
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:27,218
myself that keep it simple, stupid, there's no time for crazy iteration process. So that

89
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:30,501
was definitely the most important rule during the production of expansion packs.

90
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:35,469
Second, abundance of cool, but not unnecessary ideas.

91
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,191
It's like, yeah, you know that.

92
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:42,800
It's like having a lot of ideas is as bad as having no ideas at all.

93
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:44,583
So, this rule...

94
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:52,291
like a keep it simple rule and like having very very like a really clarity at the beginning of

95
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:58,574
each process of creating monsters or main main npcs in the game it was helping us a lot.

96
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:04,216
Yeah this is what I'm talking about. Lag of structure and formalizing the pipeline by templates.

97
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:11,200
So we incorporated templates into our production. We start communicating even more often.

98
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,861
with the design team and the story,

99
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:15,783
and it was a really infinity loop.

100
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:20,026
Because, you know, our games are heavily story-driven.

101
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:22,227
Everything comes from the story.

102
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:25,689
So we had to really make sure that if you really make,

103
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,611
the question always was, like at the beginning,

104
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,193
if you want to make your character

105
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,494
really grounded in the world,

106
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:35,316
you have to make sure that the story department

107
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:37,879
knows about that and agrees.

108
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,363
So before, as I said, we communicate,

109
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:43,846
but the process was a little bit messy,

110
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:44,747
and it looked like that.

111
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,790
So, for example, you see the toad here, yeah?

112
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:51,535
The first boss in the Hearts of Stone expansion pack.

113
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:54,437
So that was the process at the beginning.

114
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:57,160
Like, you know, we got the idea, you have to make a toad.

115
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,981
But it's like, what toad?

116
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:00,242
Prince toad.

117
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:03,825
So, oh, OK, another dandelion, beautiful, handsome guy.

118
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:07,388
But yeah, it's a dark fantasy game.

119
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:08,689
So dark prince?

120
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,812
Okay, but the design said, hey guys, we need to have a ranch attacks.

121
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:19,013
They have to have, the toad has to have tumors on his back,

122
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:21,594
his tongue has to be covered with spikes.

123
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:24,355
So I'm like, oh my God, don't tell us, yeah?

124
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:27,656
So we need to put some blisters on his face because of, you know,

125
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:30,017
that's exactly what I'm talking about.

126
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:31,358
Keep it simple, stupid.

127
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,919
We start narrowing down the basics, design and animation process

128
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,320
as soon as possible.

129
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,020
So that finally the guy.

130
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,822
in a game look like that.

131
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:42,305
Hey, mom.

132
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:44,107
Yeah.

133
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:45,409
And in the...

134
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:47,112
Let me show you.

135
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:51,206
Yeah but thought was rather simple. This guy was a nightmare. Because normally in a very small strike

136
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:56,511
teams we spend like three months on each monster, each boss fight I'm talking, each boss fight.

137
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:04,277
And that laugh was a little bit more difficult. You know vampires yeah? Vampires are supernatural.

138
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:10,743
They are transforming into mist. They can rip apart the human being so quickly.

139
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:15,735
So yeah, that was the Death Laugh first form.

140
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:22,101
But then we knew that this guy is the final boss of the whole game

141
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:27,125
in the end of expansion pack 2, Blood and Wine. And we got those concepts.

142
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:33,926
Yep, so, okay, this guy is transforming into that thing

143
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:38,009
and we have to make him fly, we have to make him walk, run,

144
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,992
and then, like, we didn't even know how to manage this guy

145
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:45,233
from the body mechanics perspective, you know?

146
00:14:45,473 --> 00:14:47,415
We cannot transform the model

147
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:50,316
during the fight so many times.

148
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:54,699
So, that was his first monster stage.

149
00:14:56,616 --> 00:15:02,778
As you see, we even changed a little bit the communication with the FX department.

150
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:04,799
You see those tiny helpers around him?

151
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:12,521
We, with the animator, the owner, Tizian, he actually animated those helpers

152
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:20,124
just to show FX artists how we want to make the FX supporting the whole animation.

153
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:24,825
And it definitely like speed up the process of creating FX a lot.

154
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:32,579
But yeah, that was the first stage.

155
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,281
And this is exactly where we iterate.

156
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,963
Ah, my God, like three months.

157
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,905
We had all together, we had like just six months.

158
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:43,907
We should have like, honestly, like nine months.

159
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:46,069
But we had just six months for that guy

160
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:47,490
with a very small team.

161
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:50,973
And what we had, we had this guy.

162
00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:54,476
We knew that we, at some point, we need to get him down.

163
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,397
So we need to chop his wings off.

164
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:59,699
And what's then?

165
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:03,902
We've been iterating and talking to Story, what's then?

166
00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:11,567
And they said, okay guys, let's fight with the construct of his blood in illusion of his heart.

167
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:14,049
I'm like, yeah, good.

168
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,451
But how to do that?

169
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:21,333
So here you have a few examples of this construct.

170
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:24,075
The construct, the idea of construct, he was brainless.

171
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:29,358
He was kind of magic monster, like very aggressive and quick.

172
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:34,842
And there's the scene when we are chopping his wings off.

173
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,622
So yeah, guys, this template saved our lives.

174
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,964
Honestly, we finished Dead Love in six months.

175
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:25,326
And that was a really big challenge for us.

176
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:30,309
So the second, the most important thing we did during

177
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:33,291
the expansion packs was pushing a little bit the

178
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:34,432
character motivation.

179
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:35,352
And

180
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:38,443
How we did that, I've already told you that

181
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:40,064
story is the king in our games.

182
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:44,187
Like no matter what, story has to drive everything.

183
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:47,969
And we constantly talk to story.

184
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,992
So we got this template, which really speed up

185
00:17:52,452 --> 00:17:54,173
the iteration process.

186
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,975
The iteration process was really dynamic.

187
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:58,816
So we communicate a lot.

188
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:01,618
So we get this idea of

189
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:05,088
getting this template and communication

190
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,390
sorted out as soon as possible

191
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:08,371
and

192
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:11,393
we made out of

193
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:13,775
almost every animator

194
00:18:14,116 --> 00:18:17,919
was like a supervisor of an NPC or a monster

195
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:20,501
so they've been not even just actors

196
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:22,763
they've been even co-directing

197
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:24,885
each monster on a mock-up session.

198
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:29,931
and that really helped us a lot because with that template,

199
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:34,396
on the first day of the mock-up shoot, we had a brief,

200
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:36,438
we knew everything about the character,

201
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:40,683
so directing the characters was really much easier.

202
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:42,786
Not easy, but way more easier.

203
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,357
So we had these dedicated teams for every monster.

204
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:53,664
Every department had his own artist specialist

205
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:56,086
in every single monster department.

206
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:01,872
So, let's say, always like 68 people in one strike team.

207
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:04,134
And as I said,

208
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:09,071
Because of that, because of having those people around the one monster,

209
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:11,534
the process of iteration was really dynamic.

210
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:14,497
They've been communicating all the time on a daily basis.

211
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:17,220
So this is a good example of Olgierd.

212
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:23,928
It's the first boss fight in the first expansion pack, Hearth of Stone.

213
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:26,784
So what's cool about Olgierd?

214
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:30,087
Olgierd is a human being and we've been like,

215
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:33,351
okay, Geralt is killing monsters every day,

216
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:37,075
so how to make a human being a demanding enemy to Geralt?

217
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,657
But yeah, we got this message from the story

218
00:19:39,697 --> 00:19:41,339
that this guy's actually immortal.

219
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:47,814
So yeah, so if he's immortal, how to show it through the gameplay animation, through the combat?

220
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:52,597
I mean like, it would be cool to show that he's, because he's a noble guy,

221
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:56,539
he signed a pact with the devil, and he doesn't care.

222
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,101
He has everything he wants.

223
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:02,683
So we wanted to show that he's really cocky,

224
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:07,405
that even his idle position in a fight is really open.

225
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:10,507
He's like even inviting you to kill him.

226
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:25,248
Because he doesn't care, he even doesn't check where you are, he's just constantly very cocky and aggressive guy.

227
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:33,051
But we've been like thinking about what kind of combat style we should develop, we should work on.

228
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:44,133
And finally, we found that in 17th century, in Poland actually, the combat like the cross sabers masters, the saber masters,

229
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:48,994
they developed this combat style, very deadly style, called...

230
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:55,187
cross saber. They called him like the Polish samurai, let's say. The stance was very open.

231
00:20:55,827 --> 00:21:03,274
That's the, let's say, idle position for them. The position was very open. The sabers were very

232
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:09,140
light, so they could deliver so many attacks in seconds. They've been like twirling around the

233
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,520
enemy.

234
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:15,603
really, and the style was very cheaty and dirty.

235
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:19,367
So they really been killing enemies very quickly.

236
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:22,831
The sword masters didn't have like any chance

237
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:23,892
to even fight with them.

238
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:28,057
So really we've been studying that.

239
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:31,778
And finally, this is a part of the mock-up session.

240
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:34,579
It's one of the first days of the training sessions

241
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:37,920
with Maciej Kwiatkowski.

242
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,140
I love the stuntman.

243
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:40,101
He's amazing.

244
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:45,202
I call him, his nickname is Washing Machine.

245
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:47,923
Because you can program him,

246
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:50,304
and next day you just press the button and it works.

247
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:51,725
It's crazy.

248
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:53,705
Muscle memory is just unbelievable.

249
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:57,667
So this is how the Olga looked like in Maya.

250
00:21:58,676 --> 00:22:00,296
uh... in in motion builder

251
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:06,858
as a final polished

252
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:07,958
game loops

253
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:10,198
as you see

254
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,119
very open position

255
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,820
no, he didn't even use the hard blocks

256
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,100
the cross saber masters

257
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,380
they just parry it

258
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,561
they parry it just to kill you

259
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:23,641
very offensive style

260
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:25,662
so it fit

261
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:27,642
perfectly into his character

262
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:34,578
We did the same thing with cinematics and dialogues.

263
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,741
We have our own, like, a dialogue system.

264
00:22:38,802 --> 00:22:42,185
And let's talk about Regis and Henrietta now.

265
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:46,528
So Henrietta, she was a queen of blood and wine.

266
00:22:46,749 --> 00:22:48,971
Yeah, of the Buclair in blood and wine.

267
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:50,732
So we developed, like...

268
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:57,216
just custom poses to her, just to make her more queen look like.

269
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:57,516
Yeah?

270
00:22:58,497 --> 00:23:01,158
And, but she's not a typical queen.

271
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:01,679
Yeah?

272
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,581
Of course, we made a lot of custom acting choices,

273
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:08,884
and just to make her more queen-like and feminine.

274
00:23:09,524 --> 00:23:12,766
But at the same time, she had a really high temper.

275
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:13,727
So...

276
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:18,070
we need to somehow connect those two worlds,

277
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,493
this high temper and being very noble and queen-like regal.

278
00:23:23,454 --> 00:23:26,116
So here's the part of the cut scene when she is like,

279
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:29,098
I know probably this advert from Mentos.

280
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:43,402
So as you see here, she just got angry and she even doesn't want to wait for Geralt.

281
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:46,544
She gets on the horse and she needs to help her people.

282
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:24,923
poor guy. And Regis, yeah, he's a vampire so you might think that we could copy Dead

283
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:31,768
Labs moveset or whatever but he's a completely different guy. And we could even tell that if

284
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:35,611
they knew physics there he could be a physics teacher.

285
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:43,593
like check this guy, he's very like static pose, he's a scientist slash biologist vampire,

286
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:53,596
even his facial expression is very calm and of course there is still his first most important

287
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:59,878
nature so until he smells blood and you piss him off he is like this but still...

288
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:56,056
hours. Sent one. Yeah. And the third thing, they're organizing the animation department. So

289
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,637
there's a quality at time boundary.

290
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,504
What we used during the main game

291
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:02,347
and the first expansion packs,

292
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,649
we used the old OptiTrack system.

293
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,034
And as I said before, the animator was one month banned.

294
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,857
So in the middle of creating expansion packs,

295
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:15,081
we bought new icons, we extend our area of shoots,

296
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:15,942
and...

297
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:19,352
we made Mocap as an independent team.

298
00:26:19,972 --> 00:26:22,774
We've hired a motion capture specialist who helped us a lot

299
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:26,636
because animators could really focus only on animation then.

300
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:31,118
So we've been at least getting the clean data from shoots,

301
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:33,359
from shootings.

302
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:35,940
So to sum it up,

303
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:41,002
we did like 50% of the main game animation-wise

304
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:43,704
in a better quality in half the time.

305
00:26:44,527 --> 00:26:46,749
with deeper and more story-focused characters,

306
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,731
more refined monster designs,

307
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,974
and better overall animation quality.

308
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:54,758
And like...

309
00:26:58,482 --> 00:26:58,883
Oh, shit.

310
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,429
And I would like to just say one more thing that...

311
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,023
It's, in my opinion, just to really sum it up,

312
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,044
I must say that the most important thing

313
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:14,626
is always to just try to at least once per week

314
00:27:14,746 --> 00:27:17,067
take a step back and no matter what,

315
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:19,027
if you are in the middle even of the production,

316
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:21,188
it's good to try at least,

317
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,330
check the, like a big picture where you are.

318
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,951
Because people, like at least me,

319
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:36,919
I tend to really skip the basics sometimes and in my opinion like stepping back before

320
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:43,967
creating the expansion packs and really improving the most important, the crucial, the

321
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:50,374
fundamental steps at the beginning help us a lot in creating the expansion packs. And

322
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:52,416
that's it. Thank you.

323
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:03,527
Thank you, guys.
