1
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:07,863
All right, welcome everybody.

2
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:09,084
Thank you for joining us.

3
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:10,905
I'm Kelly Snyder.

4
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:15,067
I'm a producer at Bungie and one of the co-founding members

5
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:16,528
of the Bungie Diversity Committee

6
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:19,350
and former lead of Xbox Women in Gaming.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,411
And we're here today to talk to you

8
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:24,053
about how you can foster diversity in games.

9
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:28,255
So kind of moving beyond the 101 of what is diversity

10
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,536
and moving into kind of the action steps

11
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:32,878
of what can we actually do as studios to help.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,602
tangibly foster an inclusive and a diverse environment.

13
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:39,445
Which isn't to say that any of us here are perfect.

14
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:41,406
Nobody's got it all figured out.

15
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:43,508
Even this panel, we could be a little more diverse.

16
00:00:43,888 --> 00:00:45,790
But we wanted to get together and talk to you guys

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,332
about what we've learned, our experiences,

18
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:51,194
and so that we can all share and learn and get better together.

19
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:51,774
Yeah.

20
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:55,638
So we'll do some quick panel introductions.

21
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:56,799
Sure.

22
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,040
So is that on?

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:58,780
Yeah.

24
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:58,980
OK.

25
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,501
I'm Elaine Chase.

26
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:02,921
I'm the vice president of global brand strategy and marketing

27
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:03,841
for Wizards of the Coast.

28
00:01:04,442 --> 00:01:05,882
I lead the Magic the Gathering business there.

29
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:07,662
And in addition to my day job, I'm

30
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,443
also president of the board of Child's Play,

31
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:11,723
the charity for children's hospitals

32
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:12,564
and domestic shelters.

33
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:14,444
I'm Mary Olsen.

34
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,845
I'm the executive producer of the internal game development

35
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:18,005
team at 343.

36
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:19,065
We make Halo.

37
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:21,826
I'm Leah Hoyer.

38
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:24,627
I am the vice president of creative at Telltale Games.

39
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:27,907
Hi, I'm Joy Lau.

40
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:28,908
Hi, people in the corner.

41
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:36,240
I am a test engineer at Bungie and also a co-founding member of the Bungie diversity

42
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,521
committee and before I worked in games I was a professor in the philosophy of race and

43
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,502
gender at Virginia Tech.

44
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:43,362
Awesome.

45
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:48,244
So, in terms of format, each of our panelists is going to come up and give a short talk

46
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:52,325
talking about what they've done at their studio and then we're going to move into, I've got

47
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:55,546
some questions for them and we're going to discuss them as a group and then after the

48
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:59,027
panel is over we'll be available for if you guys want to come up and ask us questions.

49
00:01:59,607 --> 00:01:59,687
So.

50
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:02,205
And Elaine is going to come up and kick it off.

51
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:07,367
Thank you.

52
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:10,329
So as I just said, I'm Elaine.

53
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:11,990
And I work at Wizards of the Coast.

54
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,110
And I make Magic the Gathering.

55
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:17,152
I've had the honor of working at Wizards for 19 years.

56
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:19,393
We're primarily known in the industry

57
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:20,934
as the titans of tabletop gaming.

58
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:23,935
But a few years ago, we started investing heavily

59
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,056
into building up our digital gaming capability

60
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:28,638
so we can bring our brands, Magic the Gathering and Dungeons

61
00:02:28,678 --> 00:02:28,978
to life.

62
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:30,285
and the way they really deserved.

63
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:33,047
And as we started hiring, we realized

64
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:35,268
that we didn't really have a good talent

65
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:37,229
pipeline for the new set of skills

66
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:39,870
that we needed to bring into our building or for diversity.

67
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,271
Because I hope that you all realize

68
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,712
that having a diverse set of people

69
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,293
brings in greater skill set.

70
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:47,954
So we took a hard look at what that was.

71
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,295
And we realized that over the 25 plus years

72
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:54,197
we had been a company, we had been relying really heavily

73
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:57,298
on the passion of our fan base to fill our applicant pool.

74
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:58,946
And that just really wasn't going to get us

75
00:02:58,966 --> 00:02:59,726
where we needed to be.

76
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,987
And so we looked at how we were presenting ourselves

77
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:03,228
and what we were saying.

78
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:05,068
And we realized that on top of that,

79
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:06,849
our culture had kind of drifted

80
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:09,230
and we didn't really know what we stood for anymore.

81
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,512
And if we couldn't clearly articulate what we stood for

82
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,452
and why it was awesome to come work at Wizards,

83
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:16,913
then how could we possibly convince other people to do that?

84
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:21,155
So we started a internal effort

85
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:22,696
to define our mission and values.

86
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,837
And that alone, that whole process

87
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:26,297
is worth its own GDC talk,

88
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:27,238
which maybe I'll give one day.

89
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:33,346
And Joe's actually going to talk about Bungie's mission and vision, mission and values process

90
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:33,826
in a little bit.

91
00:03:34,187 --> 00:03:39,609
So I'll cut to the chase and just say that the number one value, as stated by our employees

92
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:41,770
ourselves, was diversity and inclusion.

93
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:45,892
And so we took a really hard look and said, okay, well, how are we living that?

94
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:46,832
And how can we be better?

95
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,934
And what can we do to make sure that we're doing that to the very best that we can?

96
00:03:50,674 --> 00:03:54,356
And so the things I'm going to talk to you today are focusing on the applicant journey.

97
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:57,608
So you've probably been in a bunch of talks today already

98
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,629
talking about the player journey and the importance of a funnel

99
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,050
and getting people through the door and making sure they stick.

100
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,771
And so that's the kind of things that we're

101
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,792
going to focus on for my part of the talk.

102
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:08,412
So some things we did.

103
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:11,654
We revamped our career website to showcase our mission

104
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:14,475
and our values, to feature the diversity of our employee base,

105
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,756
highlight our amazing family-friendly benefits

106
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:18,537
and charitable activity, just try

107
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:20,377
to be overall more inspirational for people

108
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:21,258
trying to join the company.

109
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:24,413
We're doing more targeted recruiting and employment

110
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:27,434
branding at local venues, like the Grace Hopper event

111
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,374
and Geek Girl Con in Seattle, as well as hosting tech lady

112
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:31,174
events at our office.

113
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:33,135
We're doing industry talks like this one.

114
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:35,295
And we're generally just being louder and prouder

115
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:37,516
about waving our flag as an employer of choice who's

116
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:39,076
actively looking for diverse candidates.

117
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:42,437
So once we have people's attention,

118
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:45,138
the next step is to craft a really good job description.

119
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:47,639
So the critical thing to think of here

120
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:49,359
is that your job description.

121
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,913
is the first conversation that you're having with the person

122
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,555
that you're eventually going to hire.

123
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:57,438
So when you think of it that way,

124
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:00,721
think about showing off to them what the team they're

125
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:02,583
going to join is like, what the culture is like,

126
00:05:02,643 --> 00:05:05,706
so they can really envision themselves in that environment.

127
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:09,070
Emphasize how they can contribute to success,

128
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,312
the success of the company, not just at the individual level.

129
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:14,376
Try to keep any requirements list to a minimum.

130
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:17,737
So studies show that men will apply to a job description

131
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:20,878
where they meet about 60% of the requirements

132
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:21,658
on a requirement list.

133
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:26,379
Women tend to think requirements are requirements

134
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:31,220
and will only apply if they meet 100% of that list.

135
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,600
So instead of requirements, think more of things

136
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,721
like skills that will help success,

137
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,721
or things that are a plus, or things

138
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,682
like that worded differently than just requirements.

139
00:05:40,902 --> 00:05:41,802
Avoid loaded words.

140
00:05:42,368 --> 00:05:49,030
Gendered is really obvious, but also avoid words like rock star and ninja and things that can evoke kind of a bro-centric mentality.

141
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,751
I guess if you work for Rockstar Games, you can use rock star, but that might be the exception.

142
00:05:55,672 --> 00:06:00,653
Clearly state a commitment to diversity and actively invite diverse applicants to apply.

143
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,414
And then here's actually the most important point.

144
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:10,757
Have your job description and show it off to the people in your company, to a diverse group of people, and have them comment on it and see what they say.

145
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:16,324
You'll be really surprised to hear what they might say in terms of things that seem innocuous to you,

146
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:21,228
but to somebody reading it from the outside, just kind of turns them off or makes them question if they'd be a good fit or not.

147
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,391
So you take all that, and let's see what that looks like.

148
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:29,795
So up on the screen is a portion of a revamped job description for a design manager in our Magic R&D team.

149
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:34,078
So I'm not going to read this to you because it's really long, but you can capture it, and of course it'll be up on the vault later.

150
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,923
So you've got this great job description. Now what do you do with it?

151
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:43,452
So you've got to go out beyond your normal channels,

152
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:45,613
go out beyond your website, go out beyond LinkedIn,

153
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:48,914
and go to places where diverse pools of candidates will be.

154
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:51,855
Go to places like Women in Gaming and Blacks in Technology.

155
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:54,316
Go to diversity groups at your local colleges.

156
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:57,117
The point is, if you go where they're gathering,

157
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,758
they're going to know that you have a commitment to looking

158
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:02,419
for them, and they're going to be more eager to apply and see

159
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,260
themselves in your company.

160
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,500
So then.

161
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:08,124
Make sure you're actually getting them in through you

162
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:09,245
to your interview stage, right?

163
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:10,465
Like you don't want to just leave it out there

164
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:11,206
and leave it to chance.

165
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:13,147
You actually want to talk to some of these people.

166
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:16,250
So I have my own kind of personal management rule

167
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,191
that I require my hiring managers

168
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,213
to at least talk to a woman.

169
00:07:20,513 --> 00:07:23,075
Now, you don't need to hire for diversity.

170
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,396
You don't, that's not the point, right?

171
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,917
And the point here is not to say you need

172
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:28,439
to have diversity hire slots or anything like that.

173
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,141
The point is, is if you talk to people,

174
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,562
you'll find people with skill sets

175
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,644
that maybe you never would have found otherwise, right?

176
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,857
So thinking about that applicant journey again,

177
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:39,318
thinking about that funnel, you want

178
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:40,999
to get as many people into that funnel

179
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,760
as you can because then eventually you'll

180
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,080
get them more out down the other side.

181
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:48,843
And then when you actually have people in,

182
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,024
live it in your interview.

183
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:53,145
Have a diverse group of people interviewing on your panels

184
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:54,006
and that they're talking to.

185
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,166
You want that for two reasons.

186
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:56,627
One is you want to make sure you've

187
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,709
got a broad amount of feedback from your own employees

188
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:01,290
to give you a broader sense of what

189
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,510
that candidate is capable of.

190
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:06,405
And the second reason is because you've got a greater chance of that candidate

191
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:10,406
seeing someone like them thriving in your company.

192
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:13,866
Right? If you see someone like you thriving, you're more likely

193
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:16,947
to think that, oh hey, maybe this is a place that I can be successful too.

194
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,308
So, shout out here by the way to

195
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:23,648
Ken Trupp on our R&D team. He's a design

196
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:27,189
designer there who crafted this job description. He's a great ally

197
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,810
and that leads me to my last point which is allies and the importance of allies

198
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,310
in your company.

199
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:39,673
So we've got our head of magic R&D design group is Mark Rosewater.

200
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:43,616
And just last week he answered this question on Tumblr that I'm going to pop up in a minute.

201
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,117
And this one I am going to read out loud to you.

202
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:52,160
I get that you're trying to mock diversity and inclusion,

203
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,162
but I think it comes from an ignorance of what it means to feel excluded.

204
00:08:56,842 --> 00:08:58,243
When you've lived your life in the majority,

205
00:08:58,503 --> 00:08:59,823
it's easy to take it for granted

206
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,404
when you see yourself represented

207
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:03,124
in the products and entertainment that you use.

208
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:05,225
But every time we branch out,

209
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:07,786
and I'm not exaggerating, I mean every time,

210
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:09,766
and represent a new group of people,

211
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:11,547
I get heartfelt messages from them

212
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:12,727
about how much it means to them

213
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:13,928
to see themselves in the game.

214
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,508
The reason Wonder Woman and Black Panther

215
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:17,989
have been such cultural touchstones

216
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:20,070
is because they're allowing new groups of people

217
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,470
to experience something they've never experienced before.

218
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:26,976
I get that it's easy to mock that when it's something so basic to your experience that

219
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:29,897
you don't even recognize that it's a thing you'd miss if you didn't have it.

220
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:34,558
But I beg for you to try to see life through other people's perspectives, just as I always

221
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:38,119
talk about how good designers see their game through different players' perspectives.

222
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:43,440
Try to take actions that build up the world and make it a better place for everyone than

223
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,481
to tear it down for others to make your world better in comparison.

224
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:51,603
So thank you to Ken and to Mark and to all the great allies I have at Wizards.

225
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,081
and here in this room, and everywhere else in the industry.

226
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:55,222
Because this helps.

227
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:56,663
Thanks.

228
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:59,684
Yeah.

229
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:00,624
Yeah.

230
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:08,068
Yeah.

231
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:08,168
Yeah.

232
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:08,268
Yeah.

233
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:08,468
Yeah.

234
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:08,568
Yeah.

235
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:08,768
Yeah.

236
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:08,868
Yeah.

237
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:09,029
Yeah.

238
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:09,129
Yeah.

239
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:09,229
Yeah.

240
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:09,589
Yeah.

241
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,049
Hi, I'm Mary Olson.

242
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,530
As I mentioned, I'm the executive producer

243
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,591
for the internal development team at 343 Industries.

244
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:19,213
And we make the, we create the Halo franchise games.

245
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,060
So I'm happy to be here today.

246
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,763
Diversity in our beloved industry

247
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:28,507
is a loaded and complex and extremely important topic.

248
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:31,029
I will attempt to draw lessons that

249
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:34,492
relate to fostering diversity of thought, gender, background,

250
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:37,335
culture, perspective, abilities, and skill.

251
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,257
But I want to be up front with that.

252
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:41,479
I'm coming to you as a cisgendered female

253
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:43,981
and will be sharing some of my personal experiences

254
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,623
to illustrate lessons we're learning.

255
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:50,094
We need to be fostering diversity at all levels.

256
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:52,095
This conference is a good example.

257
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:56,318
If anyone, this conference is a good example

258
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:57,199
of the industry side.

259
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:02,202
So if anyone has been to GDC 10 years ago versus today,

260
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:04,183
it's a completely different conference

261
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,886
and with a lot more focus on inclusivity, and it shows.

262
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:11,548
Then as studios and organizations,

263
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,890
we also need to be looking at diversity.

264
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,631
And some of my colleagues on this panel

265
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:17,412
are going to go more deeply into that.

266
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,458
And then there's what we can do as individuals.

267
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:22,899
And that individual learning and influence

268
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,860
is the piece that I'm going to focus on today.

269
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,322
Before I do that, here are a few of the tactical efforts

270
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:32,523
we do across 343, Xbox, and Microsoft.

271
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:35,945
Microsoft's mission statement is to empower

272
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:38,926
every person and every organization on the planet

273
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:39,867
to achieve more.

274
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,247
So that's our foundation.

275
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:49,843
Xbox has diversity-focused initiatives that provide community, advocacy, and a strong presence across the company and in the industry,

276
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:53,924
like Women in Gaming and other organizations like that.

277
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:57,845
Gaming for Everyone focuses on diversity in our fans.

278
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:02,767
We have inclusivity-focused core values.

279
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:07,228
And at 343, we have a diverse senior leadership team.

280
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:11,412
And that has made a tangible difference in our ability

281
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:13,653
to attract and retain diverse employees.

282
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:16,953
We've changed our approach to hiring and recruiting

283
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:19,174
and the language we use in job descriptions as well.

284
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,794
Some of the stuff that Elaine was mentioning

285
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,775
and some ideas from her that I plan to steal.

286
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:27,156
And Microsoft has a number of valuable trainings

287
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:29,276
required for managers, for example,

288
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:32,977
around unconscious bias and dialoguing across differences,

289
00:12:33,157 --> 00:12:35,077
which I've personally found really valuable.

290
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:37,715
Beyond initiatives and practices,

291
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:39,656
I believe that fostering diversity

292
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,798
lies in the attitudes and actions of individuals

293
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:43,978
as well as teams and companies.

294
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,459
Each of us has a responsibility

295
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,881
to challenge our assumptions daily

296
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:51,522
and grow in our understanding of the issues we face

297
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:53,243
when it comes to making needed change.

298
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,004
Here are a few anecdotes from myself

299
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:58,505
and drawing from other people on our team

300
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:01,606
to illustrate the need for ongoing growth and change.

301
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,307
Because we have a long way to go.

302
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:10,453
So I've spent most of my 23-year career in audio production

303
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:12,734
and leadership for games thinking

304
00:13:12,774 --> 00:13:15,234
it was enough to just be a woman and show up.

305
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,996
I'm really results-focused, and I've always been heads-down

306
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:22,536
and really immersed in the game that I'm making at the time.

307
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:25,317
Outside of that, my time goes to my family.

308
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,078
I have two AFAB kids.

309
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:28,738
That's assigned female at birth.

310
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:29,618
They taught me that.

311
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,559
They teach me a lot every day.

312
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,079
Beyond just staying heads down and focused on the job,

313
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,600
this is hard to admit.

314
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,602
I have spent a lot of my career being part of the problem

315
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:40,802
and fueling the problem.

316
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,385
I've sometimes, what I mean by that,

317
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,546
I've sometimes been really hard on women

318
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:50,927
that I've encountered along the way.

319
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,149
And I really have had this expectation

320
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,510
of all of them to be really high performing superstars,

321
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,792
representing womankind as like its highest caliber

322
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:00,492
at all times.

323
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:05,826
And I've since realized that a really big part of this problem is that there's only

324
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,869
room for high performers for any minority group in this industry.

325
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:15,192
And one of the signs of progress that I hope we see and that we do start to see is when

326
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:21,635
there is room for solid average performers and the whole spectrum as there is with the

327
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:22,356
kind of majority.

328
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,947
So I think that'll be good progress.

329
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:28,310
Microsoft hosted a dialogue across differences training,

330
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,811
and we were asked how inclusive we thought

331
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,553
our respective teams would be to someone coming out

332
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:35,154
as trans or queer in our environment,

333
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:36,535
on a scale of one to five.

334
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:38,957
And the first thing that popped in my head was,

335
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:40,298
well, five if they're high performing.

336
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:44,480
And so that really uncovered, that was enlightening for me,

337
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,802
and it really uncovered this bias

338
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:48,343
that I've been carrying around.

339
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,553
It's not until more recent years, honestly,

340
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:55,057
from trainings like that, from long conversations

341
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:57,360
with colleagues, keeping the conversation going,

342
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:00,064
long conversations with my now young adult kids.

343
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:03,600
who are trying to work out their place in the world as well,

344
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,660
wrestle through some of this.

345
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:10,025
And more than anything, the process of building and growing

346
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:12,927
and fostering a team and strengthening a team,

347
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:16,570
that I've really started to challenge my biases

348
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,091
and assumptions in a meaningful way

349
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:21,093
and have transformed my personal thinking

350
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:23,835
about what it means to really be inclusive.

351
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:26,077
I still put the game first.

352
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:28,239
That's still a value that I have.

353
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:29,620
The difference is.

354
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:33,698
that I now realize that building a diverse team

355
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:36,399
and having a diverse team is putting the game first.

356
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,521
That's what we need to make the best game that we can make.

357
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:41,983
And this is a worthwhile journey.

358
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:46,905
A colleague of mine who is in a leadership position

359
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,247
at our studio had feedback from a former manager

360
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:50,027
that she's aggressive.

361
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:54,249
She's a self-aware person and it didn't fit feedback

362
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:55,510
she'd gotten in the past.

363
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,592
So she dug in further with him wanting to understand

364
00:15:58,652 --> 00:15:59,332
if the feedback.

365
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:02,986
was his opinion or it had come from other people on the team.

366
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,448
He admitted that it was just his perception.

367
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:07,869
So she took the time to talk to him

368
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:09,831
about how common this perception is

369
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:11,452
of women in leadership positions.

370
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:13,613
And she sent him some articles to help give him

371
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,255
more awareness of this specific type of bias.

372
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:19,237
This was a situation where he lacked awareness

373
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,219
and once brought to his attention,

374
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,881
he was extremely receptive and eagerly read

375
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,882
the information she sent and asked her for more.

376
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:27,663
That was a start of a conversation

377
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,305
and a real change in their relationship.

378
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:35,547
So she was willing to educate and teach the behavior she wanted to see and he

379
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:41,389
was willing to learn and it transformed his management style. I had a person on

380
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:45,311
my team raise concerns and give some critical feedback about a peer and he

381
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,552
came back to me later with really different feedback.

382
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:51,482
he hadn't realized that this person had a disability,

383
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,563
which explained the issues he was having.

384
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:56,204
And most importantly, once he was aware

385
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:58,365
and he changed how he was interacting,

386
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:00,025
his concerns were alleviated

387
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,226
and his feedback actually took a total about face.

388
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:05,187
And he and other people on the team

389
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:07,628
have now called out how her disability

390
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,029
is a strength on our team, not a weakness.

391
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:17,622
She brings a unique perspective, some highly developed skills as a result, that no one

392
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:20,164
else on our team has, and she's a strong advocate.

393
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:27,805
I want to call out too that it was really impressive that he came back and actually

394
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:32,652
admitted that and took the time to change his feedback but also say, hey, look, I just

395
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:33,232
wasn't aware.

396
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:39,160
I think it's so important we have to be willing to stumble and learn as we go.

397
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,685
This is not a perfect journey because we're all kind of figuring it out and there's a

398
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:43,165
lot to learn.

399
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,649
We recently had someone on our team leave,

400
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:48,289
and this wasn't the reason she left,

401
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:52,090
but in her exit interview, she noted the locker room talk

402
00:17:52,851 --> 00:17:55,432
that she experienced day to day among the people around her.

403
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:59,613
And it really, she didn't wanna stop it,

404
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:00,914
she didn't wanna be the fun killer.

405
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:04,535
So instead, she just remained uncomfortable

406
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:05,615
and just dealt with it.

407
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:13,710
It made us realize that we need to proactively create safe opportunities to discuss unique challenges of different groups of people like this.

408
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:21,693
And we need to train and educate managers and people on the teams in such a way that we're creating advocates on our team.

409
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:25,815
Sometimes it's just helpful to have someone else be speaking up for you.

410
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,867
And here's the final story that I'll tell.

411
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:33,229
I was wrestling through what to share for this presentation

412
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:34,550
with a few of the leads on my team,

413
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,871
sharing with them that I find it really hard

414
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:38,292
because it's so important for us

415
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:39,832
to keep this conversation going,

416
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,554
but there's also a sense like you're never doing enough.

417
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,975
The next morning, one of them shared this story with me.

418
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:48,877
On a Friday night, he and his daughter

419
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:50,938
were talking about their day as he tucked her in.

420
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:54,320
He told her that he had lunch with his boss

421
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,720
and she asked, what's his name?

422
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:56,981
And...

423
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:01,834
He said, well, my boss's name is Mary, and she's a woman.

424
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,956
This apparently blew her mind.

425
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,158
And she lit up and started asking a bunch of questions

426
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,779
about how I got into this position.

427
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:11,980
And at several points throughout the weekend,

428
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,881
she let him know that she wanted to be his boss one day,

429
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:15,362
like Mary.

430
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:18,963
I think she's probably already the boss.

431
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:22,525
He was hard on himself because.

432
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:26,240
Her worldview up to this point hadn't shown her

433
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,161
that she could do something else like that.

434
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:30,982
And that was a worldview he felt responsible for.

435
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:33,283
I'll also mention that she's three.

436
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,664
So good news, there's still time for her

437
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:37,185
to develop a broader worldview.

438
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:40,466
He thanked me for helping teach his daughter

439
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,427
that she can be anything she wants to be.

440
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:45,088
And they're now having very different conversations.

441
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:51,371
It's also a reminder that showing up sometimes really

442
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:54,721
it's not enough, but it can help make a big difference.

443
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:58,965
So if you feel like an outsider, don't stay in isolation.

444
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:03,628
Find mentors, others who understand, advocates and support.

445
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:06,511
And if you love making games, stick around

446
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,953
and do what you can do to affect change

447
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:10,194
and develop our industry.

448
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:13,736
To everyone, no matter what your background, make room.

449
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:17,059
You can be part of this ongoing conversation

450
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,961
and part of change in your individual day-to-day life.

451
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:20,962
Thank you.

452
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:36,966
Hi, I'm Leah, and like I said before, I'm at Telltale.

453
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,768
I am here in part to share all of this,

454
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:41,729
and also I'm gonna tell you a couple stories,

455
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,092
because I work at Telltale.

456
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:47,794
I think every person in this room is here

457
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:50,996
because you maybe are encountering a problem,

458
00:20:51,056 --> 00:20:53,418
you've seen issues, there are certain things

459
00:20:53,498 --> 00:20:55,980
that you're looking to change and solve

460
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,822
while you're working in this industry.

461
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:00,063
Maybe you're hiring people.

462
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:03,037
And it's of course very important for you to figure out

463
00:21:03,057 --> 00:21:05,298
exactly, specifically, what is that problem

464
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:06,398
that you might be trying to solve?

465
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:07,939
It might be some existing culture,

466
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:09,299
it might be problems of recruiting.

467
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:12,140
But once you identify that, the thing that I really

468
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,820
want to encourage everyone in this room to be thinking about

469
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:17,661
is truly the power of why.

470
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:21,082
Like why is that thing something

471
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:22,663
that you are looking to change?

472
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:24,243
Something that you are looking to solve?

473
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,364
You have to be really honest about the various factors

474
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:29,244
that might go into that.

475
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:30,225
And.

476
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:33,362
To illustrate this, what I actually want to say is,

477
00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:35,803
I'm going to tell you a pretty great story

478
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:39,244
that I actually think can be a good illustration

479
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,024
of sort of the power of why.

480
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,045
Before I came to Telltale,

481
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:44,545
I actually worked at a company called ArenaNet,

482
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:46,006
known for their Guild Wars franchise.

483
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:49,987
And about six months into my tenure there,

484
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:53,348
the entire company got an email from our HR department

485
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:56,629
that said a colleague of ours,

486
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,529
who we used to know as a man,

487
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:02,744
wanted to be referred to by the pronouns of she, her,

488
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,405
was going to be using a different name.

489
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:09,746
She was going to be fine if you asked her any questions.

490
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,167
She knew we were gonna slip up and maybe make mistakes.

491
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:15,948
But also if there was anything that people

492
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:18,129
didn't maybe feel comfortable asking her,

493
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,790
talking to her about the HR department

494
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,770
was gonna be there and be open to discussion.

495
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:28,373
I was so kind of taken by the fact that

496
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:34,370
this person who I was actually good friends with, you know, hadn't talked to me even directly,

497
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,672
but had felt like, you know what, I know this is going to be a problem.

498
00:22:38,112 --> 00:22:43,455
I want to rip the Band-Aid off, honestly, just once so I don't have to go around to

499
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:48,898
320 people, and went to the HR department looking for guidance and help, and they really

500
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:53,620
stepped up and said, look, if it would be easier, we will send something out, and we

501
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,962
can make that announcement and know that this is someplace that

502
00:22:57,486 --> 00:22:59,627
not only are you saying it, but that we are saying

503
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:01,468
that this is absolutely something

504
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:04,289
that shouldn't be an issue for the company.

505
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,249
It should be something that everyone

506
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:07,450
should be very accepting of.

507
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,272
And I never once in the entire time that I was there

508
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,554
heard a negative comment, any kind of like rude question,

509
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:19,275
anything along the way, because the other thing

510
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:20,955
about the culture of this company

511
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:24,577
was that I knew it was never gonna be tolerated.

512
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,178
And I think the other people working there also knew that.

513
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:31,625
This person, it was legitimately not even an issue

514
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,625
for the entire company because this person

515
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,226
was still our friend and still our colleague.

516
00:23:36,486 --> 00:23:40,027
The thing that I was most kind of taken with

517
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,068
was also over the next six months,

518
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:45,629
two other people had the same transition

519
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:48,750
and went through the same process

520
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,051
with very much the same results.

521
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:56,873
And I will say, first off, huge props to these three women

522
00:23:57,315 --> 00:24:03,941
for going through what was obviously going to be a difficult personal transition and being honest

523
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:09,966
with who they really were. But I also know from having talked to them that it was easier for that

524
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:17,212
second and third person, like somewhat easier to know that they were going to go through this

525
00:24:17,252 --> 00:24:22,036
process, make this announcement, because they were going to be accepted at least at their workplace.

526
00:24:23,257 --> 00:24:25,158
There was that like strength there.

527
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,953
that I think was something that was just built into the culture of the company.

528
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:39,679
And so I look at that as when I think of the why, the why was that possible as I look at what

529
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:45,383
ArenaNet sort of developed a culture over time. First off, they make Guild Wars and in Guild Wars

530
00:24:45,523 --> 00:24:53,068
2, this right here, five of the core cast members of the story of Guild Wars. Two of them are a

531
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:53,909
same-sex couple.

532
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:59,679
One of them is a young girl with physical limitations.

533
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:02,361
And what I love about the stories that are in Guild Wars

534
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:04,523
is that's never what the story is about.

535
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:06,805
You know, the story is absolutely

536
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:09,867
about dealing with the struggles of video game stuff.

537
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:12,629
You know, I mean, there's big villains,

538
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,251
and there's big problems, and there's dragons,

539
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:15,592
and there's world things to solve.

540
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:20,436
And we just have great representation in the characters

541
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:21,616
and in the story of that game.

542
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:23,178
And that.

543
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:29,081
is I feel really interesting because I think what happens at ArenaNet is first

544
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:35,902
off any company starts off saying things like we value diversity, we think

545
00:25:35,962 --> 00:25:40,243
inclusivity is important. Well actually not every company does. Every company

546
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:43,844
should and make sure at the baseline that's what you're doing in your

547
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:46,945
workplace. Whether you're an individual person, whether you're a person who's

548
00:25:46,985 --> 00:25:52,306
hiring and managing people, whether you run a company, it is important to say it.

549
00:25:52,326 --> 00:25:52,387
you

550
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,043
and people talk about how talk is cheap, talk is a good start, right?

551
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:01,545
From there, though, they also were very much backing it up with their actions.

552
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:06,709
The actions that clearly, as we all know, speak louder than words.

553
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:11,852
And what I think is great about the game company that is making entertainment,

554
00:26:12,332 --> 00:26:17,255
they made stuff that backed up their idea of inclusivity and diversity.

555
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:21,951
And we have an ability in this industry to do all of that,

556
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:24,732
to change the dialogue, not just in our companies,

557
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:26,673
but in society, and I think that's amazing.

558
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:30,335
And here, it's actually tough for us to even look back

559
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:32,275
at the history of ArenaNet and say,

560
00:26:32,295 --> 00:26:33,196
well, where did it start?

561
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:35,197
There's kind of a chicken and egg thing here.

562
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,818
The truth is, it doesn't matter where you start.

563
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:39,559
You can start by making something,

564
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:40,799
you can start by saying something,

565
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:42,760
you can start by putting your actions out there.

566
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,202
But as you start to go through that cycle and build on it,

567
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:49,280
all of a sudden, you turn that question of,

568
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,260
why is this a problem to,

569
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,440
why is that company doing such great stuff?

570
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,961
Why is it feeling that,

571
00:26:57,361 --> 00:26:59,221
because they say, they act, and they make.

572
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:03,742
I also now wanna talk about a slightly different issue

573
00:27:04,282 --> 00:27:06,523
when I moved over to Telltale.

574
00:27:07,923 --> 00:27:09,863
I showed up as the head of the creative department,

575
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:11,423
which is writing, design,

576
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,284
creative directors, voiceover,

577
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:15,484
and we had.

578
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:21,290
really bizarrely huge from my perspective number of open spaces for

579
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,473
narrative designers. And I was having discussions with people and they were

580
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:29,656
saying things like, well it's such a strange thing that we do here at Telltale,

581
00:27:29,976 --> 00:27:32,998
we'll go down to Hollywood and those people don't understand interactive or

582
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,680
we'll go to game studios and most game studios just don't care about story the

583
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,623
way we do. So getting a person who really is a good writer or narrative designer

584
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:45,866
is like almost impossible. It's like finding a unicorn. And I was like, okay.

585
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:52,588
That's an interesting conundrum and I do understand what they're talking about because, hey, we

586
00:27:52,728 --> 00:27:57,633
are looking for folks that are definitely different than what's going on in the industry.

587
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:04,058
And to be honest, it also, we're looking as we're filling these things with diverse voices.

588
00:28:04,178 --> 00:28:07,942
That's super important because you know we tell stories and stories are universal and

589
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:09,903
stories need to represent all of us.

590
00:28:12,272 --> 00:28:17,317
what the suggestion I had is like, hey, could we could we see about making unicorns? And I kind of

591
00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:26,405
got some blank stares. And the whole point was to me, if you are just looking to people in, say,

592
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:33,111
the video games industry who are already working in the video games industry, you're never going

593
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:36,174
to make the video games industry more diverse. You might borrow.

594
00:28:36,942 --> 00:28:39,303
or steal some diversity from one company,

595
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:40,624
but now they have the same problem,

596
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:43,065
or you might get certain talent out there,

597
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:46,527
regardless of however they identify,

598
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:48,928
you're going to be pulling it from different places

599
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:50,169
and we're not going to change it up.

600
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:53,951
What if we went out to people and gave them a mechanism

601
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:56,792
that if they just understood at their core

602
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,514
what it is that we do, could we be their first job

603
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,815
and really find something that was awesome?

604
00:29:03,196 --> 00:29:05,577
So what we actually did is something we called internally

605
00:29:05,697 --> 00:29:06,497
our Unicorn Summit.

606
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:09,989
And it is our creative workshop that we actually

607
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:11,050
did this time last year.

608
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,832
We, towards the end of 2016, put out an open call.

609
00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:17,674
And what we asked was people submit a statement

610
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:20,636
about why they would like to work at Telltale

611
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,178
and why they would like to be part of this creative workshop

612
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:23,819
that we put on.

613
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:25,900
And they had to make a twine.

614
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,902
And twine is a quick, easy to understand,

615
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:32,024
you can all pick it up, way to do a simple,

616
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:35,067
interactive story around a prompt.

617
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:38,016
They sent those two things in and we just said,

618
00:29:38,116 --> 00:29:40,518
look, we don't really even care about your resume.

619
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:41,698
We don't wanna know any of that.

620
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,120
We took all the names off of it,

621
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,401
looked at those two things,

622
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:47,083
and we invited 22 people to come be part

623
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:50,786
of our day-long creative workshop.

624
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:52,988
The diversity that we got in this thing

625
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:54,389
was actually really astounding.

626
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:55,369
It was about 40% women.

627
00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:56,110
We had age ranges from 19 to 57,

628
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,211
which also, absolutely,

629
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,183
Age in the games industry is also something we really need to be looking at.

630
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:11,206
It's not okay to say that people sort of age out of being able to make great content, or

631
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:15,450
that you have to get a certain amount of experience before you can make great content.

632
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:20,213
And we had a wide variety of racial diversity.

633
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:26,954
From this, at the end of the day, what we did after getting this is ask people to redo

634
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:31,215
the thing that they submitted to us, and we looked at that, we got a chance to actually

635
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:35,716
see their soft skills, how they worked, how they were part of it, how much they took feedback,

636
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:38,237
all those things, and we actually made two offers.

637
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:42,218
Both of them happened to be women, but it was because they came, they showed up, it

638
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:46,480
was their first jobs in the games industry, and they are amazing at what they do.

639
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,040
We are so happy to have them on our team.

640
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,941
I don't think we would have...

641
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:54,910
filled out what we needed to do at the time

642
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,572
with the right kind of candidates nearly as quickly

643
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:02,073
if we hadn't actually opened up the pool.

644
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:03,534
And I know that was brought up earlier.

645
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:06,296
You've got to think about how do you go out

646
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:07,636
to different groups of people.

647
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:11,238
So really, in summary though, with all of this,

648
00:31:11,318 --> 00:31:13,019
I would like to encourage you to think about,

649
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,561
say, act, make, all around your why.

650
00:31:18,122 --> 00:31:19,763
And I think if we're all doing that,

651
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:19,983
like,

652
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:22,259
Why is it the way it is?

653
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:24,299
How can we do these things to make it better?

654
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:27,040
We are going to see greater diversity in our industry

655
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,880
in the very near future.

656
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:40,043
Thank you.

657
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:42,303
Hi, in the interest of accessibility,

658
00:31:42,343 --> 00:31:43,763
I want to give a shout out to the AB guys

659
00:31:43,783 --> 00:31:45,224
for giving me this box to stand on

660
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:46,484
because I couldn't see over the lectern.

661
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,280
Cool, so hi, I'm Jo.

662
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,482
I am a test engineer at Bungie,

663
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:55,843
and I was also one of the founding members

664
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:57,023
of the Bungie Diversity Committee.

665
00:31:57,843 --> 00:32:01,065
And in my talk, I'm going to look at our studio

666
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:04,126
and our values and how we live our values

667
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,227
through our game development.

668
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:08,988
So let's start by talking about

669
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,969
where this all came about for Bungie.

670
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,871
So our studio's been around for a little over 25 years,

671
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:17,692
and early on, our culture was very informal.

672
00:32:18,725 --> 00:32:23,149
However, we are now a considerably larger company,

673
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,852
and we recognize the need to foster diversity intentionally,

674
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:30,855
proactively, and I think most importantly, with structure.

675
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,798
And so in late 2016, our leadership recognized

676
00:32:34,838 --> 00:32:37,080
that our organizational growth required us

677
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,343
to basically evaluate and write down

678
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:41,864
and codify our company values.

679
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:45,307
So just a little bit about values.

680
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:52,979
Values aren't meant to be a kind of checklist you just go through and you're like, yeah, achievement unlocked. Yay

681
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:55,760
like it's a thing that you live and

682
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,742
Our values are intended to remind us of how we work and how we treat each other

683
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:04,685
so these are things that you embody and

684
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:09,987
So what I have here is our first draft and this was shown to the company and after we did that

685
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:11,068
We realized something was missing

686
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:17,056
So we didn't have anything that captured our commitment to diversity and inclusion.

687
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:21,578
And like sure, there's a sense in which you can kind of imply it from the other values,

688
00:33:21,718 --> 00:33:24,700
but we also felt like it was important enough to stand on its own.

689
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:30,102
So we went back and we redrafted a seventh value and this is what it looks like.

690
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:37,106
And you can also see all these values on our website, so don't feel like you need to read them all.

691
00:33:37,946 --> 00:33:40,487
So, it was important.

692
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:42,855
in the elements of this value here,

693
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:44,536
like the wording and the imagery

694
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:46,557
really needed to reflect the value itself.

695
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:49,218
So it shows a broad range of people

696
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,099
from our studio and our community.

697
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,160
And the reason that we wanted to do this

698
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,641
is because just talking about values

699
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:58,982
without the action behind it was just really meaningless.

700
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,143
And we wanted to have this genuinely represent who we were.

701
00:34:02,163 --> 00:34:06,705
I will also say at Bungie,

702
00:34:07,265 --> 00:34:08,525
we encourage employees to

703
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:14,860
self-organize and engage with diversity values, I mean diversity issues. So we have the studio

704
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,264
LGBTQIA club, we have bungee ladies, we have bungee people of color, for example. So with

705
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:26,949
leadership supporting more diverse practices and employees driving these kind of grassroots

706
00:34:27,009 --> 00:34:32,273
organizations, it was just this really perfect opportunity to focus on diversity. And that's

707
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:38,678
basically what we did. So we focused on diversity. We formed literally focus groups that

708
00:34:39,176 --> 00:34:43,777
talked about diversity under three sub-pillars of the studio,

709
00:34:44,677 --> 00:34:47,537
our game community, and the industry as a whole.

710
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:53,858
And so we had over 120 people in the studio participate in these discussions.

711
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,239
And so what I'm going to do for the rest of the talk is

712
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:59,760
kind of just cover a couple of things that we've done under those three pillars.

713
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,400
And I just want to point out this is not an exhaustive list or anything by any means.

714
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,501
It's things that we're all learning and things that we're planning to do.

715
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:07,561
So.

716
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,743
Yeah, so here's our first pillar, which is our studio.

717
00:35:14,263 --> 00:35:15,584
And here are a couple of things that we've done.

718
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:18,606
So we formed the Bungee Diversity Committee

719
00:35:18,707 --> 00:35:22,549
with 10 members and we have clearly defined roles and goals.

720
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,133
And this sets a clear expectation for our involvement

721
00:35:27,853 --> 00:35:30,175
with the studio because we are a volunteer committee.

722
00:35:30,935 --> 00:35:34,838
We operate as an advisory and an advocacy group

723
00:35:34,978 --> 00:35:37,320
for the studio so people can bring questions to us

724
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,701
and consult us.

725
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:43,232
And we facilitate discussions internally to make sure that diversity is a topic that is

726
00:35:43,312 --> 00:35:48,014
at the forefront of people's minds and that people can openly ask questions and that they

727
00:35:48,054 --> 00:35:48,894
have a space to do that.

728
00:35:50,255 --> 00:35:54,736
We also work with leadership in improving things like transparency and communication

729
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:59,758
and helping to empower leaders and managers in becoming better allies through providing

730
00:35:59,778 --> 00:36:01,758
training and studio resources.

731
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:07,802
And I know like Elaine and Leah have already talked about this a little, but we also work

732
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:12,243
with recruiting and HR and we do a lot of the things that they've mentioned, so I won't

733
00:36:12,263 --> 00:36:13,103
talk a lot about that.

734
00:36:13,623 --> 00:36:20,025
But we are also moving to look at blind, like we're helping recruiting with blind reviews

735
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,205
of applications, for example.

736
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:22,825
So we have made progress there.

737
00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:27,186
Okay, so our second pillar is that of the community.

738
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:31,067
And the opening line from our diversity value is...

739
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:34,849
We want everyone to feel their identity is welcome

740
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:36,950
in our studio and in the worlds we create.

741
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,251
And this is kind of really the centerpiece

742
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:40,711
of the community pillar.

743
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:44,252
And so I know I've talked a lot about pillars

744
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:45,972
and there's pillars everywhere,

745
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:47,893
but this is where it gets weird

746
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:49,293
because there are two sub pillars.

747
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:51,114
So it's like you have diversity

748
00:36:51,194 --> 00:36:54,495
and then you've got your three types of diversity pillars.

749
00:36:54,575 --> 00:36:56,515
And now there's like pillars all the way down

750
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:57,496
with these two sub pillars.

751
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:03,493
So the two sub-pillars, people at our studio have a place in our community.

752
00:37:04,794 --> 00:37:07,615
And people in our community have a place in our games.

753
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:15,039
So on the first side of that sub-pillar, last year we had a presence at several events that

754
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,459
we felt embodied our values.

755
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:26,124
So this picture is actually one of us doing a Let's Play at GigaCon, which is a convention

756
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,425
that happens every year in Seattle and it celebrates.

757
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:34,505
women and girls that work in STEM and games and comics and yeah, so we

758
00:37:35,265 --> 00:37:42,468
We had just like shipped d2 at this point. So we were just kind of showing a group of girls what our game was like and

759
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:49,930
This is really important because these are events that we staff with bungee employees and it gives people a chance to see

760
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:55,212
People who look like them and have them think I could do that

761
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:58,033
Like I can I can be a game dev like that's cool

762
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:03,793
And yeah, on the other side of the pillow here, we have our community.

763
00:38:04,955 --> 00:38:11,803
And our community team makes a really strong effort to highlight and celebrate a cross-section of our members.

764
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:19,258
feature a lot of diverse streamers and artists and cosplayers, and the face of our community

765
00:38:19,518 --> 00:38:22,519
is diverse, and we want to send that message to everyone.

766
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:26,821
So I know I'm main a Titan, so I have my Titan shirt on right now, but even if you're main

767
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:32,843
a warlock like this person, you still have a space in our community.

768
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:34,904
Okay, cool.

769
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:41,246
Finally, our last pillar is that of the industry as a whole.

770
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:48,927
As we move towards an increasingly global studio,

771
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:51,749
we really want to make games that embody our values.

772
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,212
And so we tried to do this through a game

773
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,634
you might know of called Destiny.

774
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:00,117
The characters in our universe

775
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:01,618
are representatives of humanity.

776
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:05,762
And they cover different axes of representation.

777
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:09,165
So we have race and gender and ability

778
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:11,186
in the LGBT spectrum, for example.

779
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,412
And we want these to reflect that the world is diverse

780
00:39:14,832 --> 00:39:16,233
and that our player base is diverse.

781
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:17,574
But it's not just that.

782
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:19,616
We want to celebrate and normalize these facts,

783
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,918
because that's just how it is.

784
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,642
Outside of our game, it's also important for us

785
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:30,945
and our values to support our employees and people

786
00:39:31,006 --> 00:39:31,606
in our industry.

787
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:33,508
So for example, one thing we did last year

788
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:36,550
was we joined with other companies in entertainment

789
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,652
and tech in submitting an amicus brief.

790
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:39,653
And

791
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:45,428
Basically, the point of this, the idea is just to acknowledge each other and to show

792
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:46,689
that we have each other's backs.

793
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:50,512
And this is really important for people who are from underrepresented groups.

794
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:52,633
So it's really simple and effective.

795
00:39:52,673 --> 00:39:56,136
It's just a way that you can say, I see you and I support you.

796
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:59,118
And for someone that doesn't hear that a lot, that really goes a long way.

797
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:06,163
And finally, we also want to continue driving these discussions with our colleagues and

798
00:40:06,183 --> 00:40:07,304
peers, so all of you.

799
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:07,364
So.

800
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:14,216
We're all learning together and we're all going to be working towards a common goal.

801
00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:20,238
So I really encourage all of you to continue these conversations and share information

802
00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:26,321
and share ideas about this and just keep those dialogues going because no one is perfect

803
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:29,962
but we can all get closer to being better together.

804
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:31,703
And that's all.

805
00:40:31,983 --> 00:40:32,183
Thanks.

806
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:45,420
Thanks so much to our panelists.

807
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,721
So we're going to go into a little bit of moderated

808
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:49,661
questions.

809
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:53,202
And to kick it off, one thing we want to talk about

810
00:40:53,462 --> 00:40:55,043
was a little bit on microaggressions.

811
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:57,824
So often, the pain of being a minority

812
00:40:58,004 --> 00:41:00,425
is often felt by a lot of little things

813
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:03,446
adding up over time, kind of the death by 1,000 cuts.

814
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:06,927
And Joe, did you want to give some extra context if anybody's

815
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,328
not super familiar with the?

816
00:41:09,612 --> 00:41:15,273
Yeah, I just like without like giving specific examples of microaggressions, I guess one way to understand it is

817
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:20,574
like suppose you're in a small studio and there's only like you know you're one of 10 people

818
00:41:21,254 --> 00:41:27,815
and you're the only member of an underrepresented group at your studio and let's say every single

819
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:34,036
day someone like each one of your colleagues comes up to you and like makes an like a passing

820
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:36,057
microaggressive comment and

821
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,963
you're just like, okay, like, you know, I don't know how people react to microaggressions.

822
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:47,168
But what that means is for each of those interactions, the person that's doing that

823
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:52,712
action has experienced one microaggression in that they, you know, directed one at you.

824
00:41:52,752 --> 00:41:58,816
But for you, you've received nine of them. And now multiply that by the number of days

825
00:41:58,836 --> 00:42:01,098
that you work there and scale up the studio.

826
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,632
And that is what the death by a thousand cuts is really like.

827
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:06,332
It's like you get tired of this stuff.

828
00:42:07,313 --> 00:42:09,293
Yeah, and so one thing that makes sense

829
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:11,434
is that if a lot of negative things

830
00:42:11,494 --> 00:42:12,835
can add up to make a big difference,

831
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:16,216
I think it's also possible for a lot of positive things,

832
00:42:16,756 --> 00:42:19,617
micro affirmations, if you will, to add up

833
00:42:19,657 --> 00:42:20,457
to make a big difference.

834
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:23,098
What are things that you guys have found in your studios,

835
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,299
the little things that make a big difference?

836
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:27,200
I got two.

837
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:27,600
Excited.

838
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:27,740
OK.

839
00:42:29,952 --> 00:42:34,133
The first tangible achievement that I did when I got onto the executive team at Wizards

840
00:42:34,173 --> 00:42:38,834
of the Coast was I got better feminine hygiene products in the bathrooms.

841
00:42:41,655 --> 00:42:45,517
Seriously, I went into the bathroom right after I got promoted and looked and went,

842
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,878
and went, wait, who am I going to complain to?

843
00:42:49,198 --> 00:42:49,458
Me?

844
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:52,219
Right.

845
00:42:52,499 --> 00:42:54,760
So seriously, like little things make a difference like that.

846
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:57,200
And then the second one I wanted to mention

847
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,442
is, so at the Child's Play auction this past December,

848
00:43:01,002 --> 00:43:02,603
one of our speakers that we had, who's

849
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:06,525
very active in the hospital community, she uses a wheelchair.

850
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:08,927
And she let Child's Play know that.

851
00:43:09,827 --> 00:43:13,249
And they built her a ramp to come up onto the podium, right?

852
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:14,470
Like, if you were in a wheelchair,

853
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,051
you wouldn't be able to get up here where we are right now.

854
00:43:17,171 --> 00:43:18,972
And she came up to do her speech.

855
00:43:19,012 --> 00:43:20,113
And the first thing she said is she

856
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:24,095
gushed over the fact that she has done speeches tons of times.

857
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,986
And this is the first time someone had provided her a ramp.

858
00:43:27,966 --> 00:43:29,508
And that made her feel normal.

859
00:43:29,548 --> 00:43:30,869
And it's just those kinds of things

860
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,130
can really make a difference to make

861
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,052
people feel like it's normal.

862
00:43:36,574 --> 00:43:38,876
I also think allyship is a really important point.

863
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:40,517
And I know some of you mentioned that as well.

864
00:43:41,798 --> 00:43:46,543
So there's a study that shows that people

865
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,805
are more likely to believe other people that look like them.

866
00:43:50,668 --> 00:43:52,870
which I don't know what it's like.

867
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,210
But...

868
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,371
Even on diversity topics?

869
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:58,294
Yeah, so it's like, what this means is white men are more likely to believe other white men,

870
00:43:58,494 --> 00:43:59,935
even on issues of diversity.

871
00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:03,218
So, take from that what you will.

872
00:44:03,898 --> 00:44:06,200
But what this means is, if you have that,

873
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,943
it's like, if you are in that position to be able to speak about something

874
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:11,925
and to support someone that is underrepresented,

875
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:14,267
then, like, do that, because...

876
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:15,528
And it doesn't have to just...

877
00:44:15,568 --> 00:44:18,810
And I'm not just, like, saying this to the white men in the audience, but, like, you know...

878
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:20,493
if you're white, or if you're straight,

879
00:44:20,513 --> 00:44:24,236
if you're able-bodied, if you're cisgender,

880
00:44:25,136 --> 00:44:26,617
use your voice to help everyone else

881
00:44:26,677 --> 00:44:28,098
that isn't in that position.

882
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:31,121
And I think that's really,

883
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:33,002
I think that's one of the things that helps

884
00:44:33,062 --> 00:44:35,364
is just acknowledging that there are other people

885
00:44:35,584 --> 00:44:36,865
that are not like you that exist,

886
00:44:37,445 --> 00:44:39,006
and normalize the fact that they are there

887
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:40,808
and recognize them, so yeah.

888
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:43,529
Yeah, thanks.

889
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:44,670
Thank you for those two claps.

890
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:45,291
Yeah.

891
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:45,651
Cool.

892
00:44:45,671 --> 00:44:46,011
Cool.

893
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:46,351
Cool.

894
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:46,912
Cool.

895
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:48,933
So.

896
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:53,873
In general, what have you guys, like what are some of the biggest challenges that you faced

897
00:44:53,993 --> 00:44:56,255
and what are some of the biggest lessons that you've learned along the way?

898
00:44:56,275 --> 00:45:04,521
Yeah, I will say when I first moved into the games industry I used to actually make

899
00:45:04,822 --> 00:45:08,444
cartoons for Disney for a living and that's what I wound up doing and then

900
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:14,109
transitioned through my work there into working at Xbox actually and in gaming and I

901
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:24,314
was when I first came there, honestly, I got a lot of comments about the fact that I wasn't a big Halo player.

902
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:26,395
Sorry.

903
00:45:26,656 --> 00:45:32,359
And the fact that maybe I wasn't a real gamer in a lot of ways, even though I will tell you, like, I play all

904
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:36,882
sorts of games. I play a lot of D&D. I play a lot of some of, and I play a lot of mobile games, and I

905
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:42,545
play a lot of actually video games, but just because I wasn't mainly a first-person shooter player,

906
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:46,678
Somehow I was sort of like, my cred wasn't that great.

907
00:45:47,859 --> 00:45:55,223
And I would say that when I started to be then brought

908
00:45:55,283 --> 00:45:57,365
into sort of leadership teams and got promoted,

909
00:45:57,445 --> 00:45:59,486
and I will say in three times in my career,

910
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,788
I've been the first woman to come into say,

911
00:46:01,828 --> 00:46:05,230
a senior leadership team or running a group of things.

912
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,433
I definitely in the first several years of my career

913
00:46:09,473 --> 00:46:12,235
in the games industry, I wanted to fit in.

914
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:16,233
And I think I was then trying to because a lot of that was,

915
00:46:16,694 --> 00:46:17,975
you know, kind of hitting at me

916
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,156
in sort of microaggression kind of ways,

917
00:46:20,216 --> 00:46:21,457
that sense of like, oh, ooh,

918
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,659
maybe they don't think I belong here and all that stuff,

919
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:25,320
to a point where I started to believe it.

920
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,162
And then after a while, I was like, no,

921
00:46:27,382 --> 00:46:28,142
you know what, I got this.

922
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:31,465
But once you realize that too,

923
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:33,106
what it also made me realize

924
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:36,709
is that it is actually my job to speak up.

925
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:38,530
It is my job to be like,

926
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,512
I think that we're thinking about this

927
00:46:41,252 --> 00:46:42,973
from a very narrow point of view.

928
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:47,646
And so over time, that's really the thing that I learned.

929
00:46:47,686 --> 00:46:50,970
It was a challenge that then became something that I know

930
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,592
that each one of you can do that,

931
00:46:53,652 --> 00:46:55,254
sort of in the idea of like the ally.

932
00:46:55,654 --> 00:46:58,117
But it is literally my job,

933
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:00,720
and while it shouldn't be necessarily put on me

934
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,401
as the only woman in some of those rooms,

935
00:47:02,441 --> 00:47:06,305
you know what, if it's not me, who else is going to do it?

936
00:47:07,363 --> 00:47:10,205
And sometimes it's a lot of pressure, but I take that on.

937
00:47:10,385 --> 00:47:12,706
And in a way that that's the way that I've

938
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:13,767
started to see change.

939
00:47:14,307 --> 00:47:16,569
And you actually get a lot of people acknowledging it

940
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:17,630
and giving you more respect.

941
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:23,913
I think one thing that I've realized and tried

942
00:47:24,053 --> 00:47:25,594
to say to a lot of people in my team

943
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:29,897
is this concept of really well-intentioned people.

944
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:36,999
and how outdated the kind of colorblind, well-intentioned colorblindness kind of concept is.

945
00:47:38,421 --> 00:47:39,742
Outdated feels like the right word.

946
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:42,885
Like, it's just not where we are anymore, and it's not valuable.

947
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:49,432
And so the kind of well-intentioned comments that I mean are like, no, no, I love everybody,

948
00:47:49,512 --> 00:47:52,876
I treat everybody the same, I treat everybody equally, I don't even just think about who

949
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:53,176
they are.

950
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:53,636
I just like...

951
00:47:54,017 --> 00:47:56,438
You know, I just think they're all awesome, and stuff like that.

952
00:47:56,759 --> 00:48:01,042
We can't afford that, because then you're managing everyone as the same person, or then

953
00:48:01,062 --> 00:48:02,823
you're interacting with everybody as the same person.

954
00:48:02,843 --> 00:48:04,965
That's actually not appropriate.

955
00:48:05,505 --> 00:48:08,547
We need to recognize where people are coming from.

956
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:13,110
We need to recognize who they are, see them for who they are, not be colorblind.

957
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:16,913
Not be like, oh, we have love in our hearts, and we see everyone the same.

958
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,523
I mean that's a well-intended, I see that so much with people who just really want to do the right thing

959
00:48:24,543 --> 00:48:26,583
and have no idea that that's the wrong thing.

960
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:34,546
And so I think that's something that, we try to bring awareness to, but that's something that I think is something that, you know, we're just, there's just not room anymore.

961
00:48:35,827 --> 00:48:43,869
I think as an industry also we are very competitive and we're also conditioned to avoid failure.

962
00:48:45,106 --> 00:48:49,328
this is the thing about being an ally, you will fail at some point, but it's okay.

963
00:48:50,348 --> 00:48:55,390
It's like, you will make mistakes, like in the examples Mary and Leo were talking about,

964
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:59,852
like you won't get everything perfect all the time, because if you did, we wouldn't need to be here.

965
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:07,575
Yeah, like you'll get called out by people you've inadvertently hurt, but use this. I think what

966
00:49:08,015 --> 00:49:14,337
the important point from this is, is take that as a like moment to learn from that, and

967
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:21,565
just acknowledge that you've done something that's not awesome, apologize, take it as

968
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:22,786
a teaching moment and move on.

969
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:28,611
And that's what it, and I feel like part of allyship is to do that and not, like you know,

970
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:32,754
and like to continue supporting the people that you've hurt instead of just like doubling

971
00:49:32,774 --> 00:49:38,779
down on it, which I don't believe any of you would do, but yeah, it's, but what we need

972
00:49:38,799 --> 00:49:40,300
to do is assume good intent on both sides.

973
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,023
So just make sure that, you know, if you are hurt, someone...

974
00:49:45,147 --> 00:49:49,449
Let someone know that you've hurt them, but then also don't assume that they did that

975
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:52,210
because they were being an ass necessarily.

976
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:53,391
Maybe they just need to know.

977
00:49:55,212 --> 00:49:59,033
I actually wanted to riff a little bit on the colorblindness kind of comment.

978
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:05,456
So it's important to treat people as individuals, but then it's also important to kind of pull

979
00:50:05,496 --> 00:50:09,677
back and look at the macro trends that you see, because sometimes when you just focus

980
00:50:09,717 --> 00:50:12,318
on individuals, you miss the larger trends that are happening.

981
00:50:13,206 --> 00:50:15,587
So a really good example for this is, in the past,

982
00:50:15,687 --> 00:50:18,089
when we've decided to send people to GDC here

983
00:50:18,709 --> 00:50:21,291
as training opportunities, it's been a conversation

984
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:23,172
between an employee and their manager, right?

985
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,474
And they kind of decide, hey, is this the right place for you

986
00:50:25,494 --> 00:50:25,694
to go?

987
00:50:25,754 --> 00:50:26,755
Is this the right opportunity?

988
00:50:27,976 --> 00:50:30,477
This year, for the first time, the executive team

989
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:32,619
looked at the list of the couple dozen people

990
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:34,240
that were on the list to attend GDC.

991
00:50:35,421 --> 00:50:38,202
And I noticed that there were two women out

992
00:50:38,223 --> 00:50:40,804
of the couple dozen of people on the list, myself

993
00:50:41,365 --> 00:50:42,345
and one person from my team.

994
00:50:43,228 --> 00:50:50,351
And I said to all the other dudes, hey, there's only two women and it's me and someone on

995
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:51,491
my team, what's up with that?

996
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,973
And we identified a thing that we just didn't realize that was there, right?

997
00:50:56,273 --> 00:50:58,694
And because of that, now there are a bunch more people who are here.

998
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:00,615
At least one is sitting in this room right now.

999
00:51:00,635 --> 00:51:01,215
Yay, Marissa!

1000
00:51:01,275 --> 00:51:03,897
Oh, and Allison's over there too.

1001
00:51:03,937 --> 00:51:04,057
Yay!

1002
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:04,357
Awesome.

1003
00:51:04,397 --> 00:51:04,737
Thank you.

1004
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:05,417
Thank you.

1005
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:05,737
Thank you.

1006
00:51:05,777 --> 00:51:06,278
Thank you.

1007
00:51:06,298 --> 00:51:07,058
Thank you.

1008
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:07,778
Thank you.

1009
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:08,158
Thank you.

1010
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:08,639
Thank you.

1011
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:08,879
Thank you.

1012
00:51:08,919 --> 00:51:09,199
Thank you.

1013
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:09,519
Thank you.

1014
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:12,700
Welcome.

1015
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:14,746
So switching gears a little bit

1016
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:19,408
While many of us are working on increasing diversity within our studios

1017
00:51:20,188 --> 00:51:22,849
sometimes we can have members of our own communities who are

1018
00:51:23,809 --> 00:51:27,271
Less than enthused about the topic of diversity to put it generously

1019
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,632
Have you guys kind of tackled that issue?

1020
00:51:31,564 --> 00:51:36,528
Wait, you mean people in our community might not be 100% gun-headed?

1021
00:51:37,348 --> 00:51:40,671
So I kind of feel like right now I should just pull out my phone and look at the most recent

1022
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:48,337
notification I have from Twitter right now. I think that would be fun. So the thing about

1023
00:51:49,097 --> 00:51:52,159
magic, I'll talk about magic specifically for a minute, the thing about magic is that our

1024
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:58,444
community is interesting in the way that it's a face-to-face based community, which is a little

1025
00:51:58,464 --> 00:52:00,946
bit different than the communities that most of you guys manage.

1026
00:52:02,016 --> 00:52:06,078
And because of that, there's a lot of really good positive stuff that goes on in that community.

1027
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:07,839
I love my community so much.

1028
00:52:07,899 --> 00:52:11,120
They are the best, really the best people in the world.

1029
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:18,543
But there's also people there who decide that for them it's more fun to annoy those people,

1030
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:18,783
right?

1031
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:24,246
And the issue is that I can't just like block their account.

1032
00:52:24,326 --> 00:52:26,207
I can't just, you know, keep them out of the game, right?

1033
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:28,688
Because the community for magic is beyond.

1034
00:52:30,241 --> 00:52:35,084
kind of a platform like that, right? Like the community for magic is the world, right?

1035
00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:39,147
So I can't ban people from the world, right?

1036
00:52:39,268 --> 00:52:44,432
At least not in an ethical or legal way.

1037
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:50,076
And I can't make them stop being mean, right? Like I can't do that either.

1038
00:52:50,777 --> 00:52:53,138
So the question is kind of what do you do there, right?

1039
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:55,760
How can you try to make sure that your community,

1040
00:52:56,701 --> 00:52:59,563
the wonderful goodness of the community that's out there knows.

1041
00:53:00,074 --> 00:53:05,117
that you as a company have their back, especially recognizing the limitations that you have

1042
00:53:05,157 --> 00:53:05,857
as a company, right?

1043
00:53:05,877 --> 00:53:08,819
Like it's a really kind of hard thing to balance.

1044
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:12,482
So I wish I could say I had it all figured out.

1045
00:53:12,702 --> 00:53:14,103
Unfortunately, I don't.

1046
00:53:14,303 --> 00:53:17,445
I like to think that we make decisions that move us in the right direction.

1047
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:21,367
And I'll say that we've gone through some really tough times lately with some things

1048
00:53:21,387 --> 00:53:25,490
that have been going on with people even pulling people from outside of our community coming

1049
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:29,132
and attacking our community members just to be mean and rile people up.

1050
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:33,981
And it's nice because sometimes I get things like I actually came to work one day

1051
00:53:34,001 --> 00:53:37,764
when we were having this tough time and there was a handwritten letter that someone

1052
00:53:37,804 --> 00:53:42,467
from our community had sent me just a, hey, I just wanted to say I appreciate what you do.

1053
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:46,310
And I keep that pinned up before my desk.

1054
00:53:48,631 --> 00:53:49,352
Any other thoughts on that?

1055
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:55,536
Yeah, so I guess like we

1056
00:53:56,253 --> 00:54:02,156
So like Destiny is an online game so our community is slightly different but we also build mechanisms

1057
00:54:02,216 --> 00:54:08,998
into the game to minimize toxicity and encourage fair play. So when you play if you're running

1058
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:14,200
around in the world you don't automatically start voice chatting with people. Like we don't have

1059
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:19,441
open voice chat, we have guided games which allows people to like you know find other people like

1060
00:54:19,641 --> 00:54:23,483
they enjoy the place like if they enjoy the same play style and

1061
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:26,013
you know, over time that helps to make friends.

1062
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:29,336
And I think one of the things about our community

1063
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:33,980
is also making sure that we elevate the positive voices

1064
00:54:34,201 --> 00:54:37,624
there as well and, you know, amplify those ones

1065
00:54:37,664 --> 00:54:38,785
because those are the ones that we want,

1066
00:54:38,965 --> 00:54:42,689
like we value them and we also have,

1067
00:54:42,709 --> 00:54:45,491
and so like, you know, just to get back to Elaine's point,

1068
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:48,705
Like, you know, there are things that are going to happen.

1069
00:54:50,146 --> 00:54:52,187
And so one of the things we want to do is just make sure

1070
00:54:52,227 --> 00:54:54,928
that we can mitigate for those situations.

1071
00:54:54,988 --> 00:54:57,329
So, you know, for example, we have a player support team,

1072
00:54:57,369 --> 00:54:58,689
we have a security team,

1073
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:01,730
and we will investigate these sorts of things.

1074
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:04,732
Like, you know, if people are being toxic members

1075
00:55:04,772 --> 00:55:07,172
of the community, we will investigate and we will ban them.

1076
00:55:07,293 --> 00:55:10,034
Because if you want to have a place

1077
00:55:10,094 --> 00:55:11,474
where people feel safe and welcome,

1078
00:55:12,374 --> 00:55:13,315
sometimes you have to do that.

1079
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:15,396
Yeah, it's letting your players know

1080
00:55:15,416 --> 00:55:16,076
that you have their backs.

1081
00:55:17,132 --> 00:55:18,073
It's going back to that back swing.

1082
00:55:18,393 --> 00:55:19,774
Yay.

1083
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:21,695
So some quick closing thoughts.

1084
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,276
So if someone in the audience right now,

1085
00:55:24,076 --> 00:55:25,737
if they want to start something at their studio,

1086
00:55:25,757 --> 00:55:27,718
at their company around diversity

1087
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:31,640
to help increase inclusion, what are some immediate next steps

1088
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,881
that you think that they can take?

1089
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:37,223
I will talk about another story from ArenaNet.

1090
00:55:37,283 --> 00:55:40,164
When I showed up, there was a women in games chapter.

1091
00:55:40,345 --> 00:55:42,846
But I will say you could do this with any kind of diversity.

1092
00:55:43,804 --> 00:55:48,626
in games group. There was a small group of about five women who would get together for lunch every once in a while,

1093
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:53,608
but they even came to me as the first member of the senior staff that was a woman and were like,

1094
00:55:53,628 --> 00:55:56,250
you know, we'd love to make this bigger and not just us

1095
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:02,493
having lunch and talking about some things. And what we wound up doing was just putting out an open invitation.

1096
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:08,175
We did it around the beginning of the year, but you know what? Any day's a good day to start something and said,

1097
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:12,681
let's have a brunch. Let's start off with a breakfast meeting and it's the games

1098
00:56:12,721 --> 00:56:19,384
industry so it was like 10 a.m. But we brought people in, we served mimosas and

1099
00:56:19,424 --> 00:56:25,066
we had pastries and it was an hour and a half of us whiteboarding about what are

1100
00:56:25,086 --> 00:56:30,629
some of the things that we would love to do as a group that was a concrete thing

1101
00:56:30,709 --> 00:56:32,670
we would produce like an event or

1102
00:56:33,793 --> 00:56:37,214
items or a giveaway or a video we could share with the community.

1103
00:56:37,334 --> 00:56:40,196
There were all sorts of things that we put up there and then asked everyone that was

1104
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:47,020
on that showed up, who by the way, out of a company of about 300 people, 75 showed up.

1105
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,021
And it certainly wasn't all women.

1106
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:56,525
It was a really lovely group of folk who not only showed up to that first one, but stuck

1107
00:56:56,565 --> 00:56:57,385
through it the whole time.

1108
00:56:57,826 --> 00:57:01,368
And as we had these ideas, then we just asked everybody to vote with their initials, go

1109
00:57:01,428 --> 00:57:03,028
up and say, okay, what are the one or two that

1110
00:57:03,402 --> 00:57:06,624
you would put your time behind, that you would actually

1111
00:57:06,664 --> 00:57:08,785
be excited about, which allowed us to winnow it down

1112
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:11,767
to maybe three ideas that then teams went away,

1113
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:13,908
and then we picked one the next month

1114
00:57:14,089 --> 00:57:16,450
that we did the same thing with mimosas and more pastries.

1115
00:57:17,911 --> 00:57:21,634
And said, OK, we are going to make an event.

1116
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:24,275
And what we wound up doing, and actually some of these ladies

1117
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,996
also came to it because ArenaNet's also

1118
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:30,039
in the Seattle area, and we did a regional event that was

1119
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,461
about it was sponsored by our chapter of women in gaming but it was about

1120
00:57:35,521 --> 00:57:39,703
producing your own career and we brought people in from all sorts of different

1121
00:57:39,743 --> 00:57:43,084
disciplines to talk about their experiences it was open it was very

1122
00:57:43,124 --> 00:57:47,985
candid we were you know but it was also with the idea of hey you know what there

1123
00:57:48,306 --> 00:57:52,727
are things that sometimes you don't always think about if you're a person

1124
00:57:52,787 --> 00:57:52,927
who

1125
00:57:54,128 --> 00:57:56,429
feels maybe like you can't ask for a raise,

1126
00:57:56,669 --> 00:57:58,971
you can't ask for a promotion, you can't do those things.

1127
00:57:59,071 --> 00:58:00,372
And we just came together and said,

1128
00:58:00,452 --> 00:58:01,592
this is a problem we see,

1129
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:04,654
but it's also an event that we produced together

1130
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:07,736
that really galvanized our studio around,

1131
00:58:07,756 --> 00:58:09,697
hey, this is a cause we believe in,

1132
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:11,138
this is something that's important to us.

1133
00:58:11,438 --> 00:58:14,560
And it also was honestly great recruiting message

1134
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,321
to put out there to be like, yeah, we value this.

1135
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,521
We're given, you know, we're spending money

1136
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:19,542
and giving people's time to do it.

1137
00:58:19,582 --> 00:58:20,823
So I would really encourage you,

1138
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:22,664
regardless of how small it is,

1139
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:24,366
or do you work in a shared workspace,

1140
00:58:24,386 --> 00:58:25,307
or you're doing some other things,

1141
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:28,409
like get people around the idea of how can we

1142
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,352
not just work with ourselves, but share outward,

1143
00:58:31,692 --> 00:58:32,433
and that'll help.

1144
00:58:32,933 --> 00:58:36,456
That's the act, make, say, act, make kind of thing.

1145
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:39,779
By doing that, you're going to make

1146
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:41,460
a better culture internally,

1147
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,162
because you're putting it out there for people.

1148
00:58:44,572 --> 00:58:48,794
I would also say that just as far as a next step, just something you can do.

1149
00:58:51,315 --> 00:58:51,936
Take stock.

1150
00:58:52,356 --> 00:58:55,837
Like, I've, you know, even being part of this panel, I've, I've, or

1151
00:58:55,877 --> 00:58:57,038
I'm gonna go do more things.

1152
00:58:57,698 --> 00:58:58,519
I'm gonna steal.

1153
00:58:58,819 --> 00:59:01,080
You should, the next thing you should do is hit, sorry.

1154
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:04,752
is go, not literally.

1155
00:59:04,892 --> 00:59:08,194
The next thing you should do is go and take stock

1156
00:59:08,794 --> 00:59:12,316
and ask yourself if, as companies and as individuals,

1157
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:14,496
if you're doing everything we mentioned,

1158
00:59:14,777 --> 00:59:16,497
which should be a minimum bar,

1159
00:59:16,917 --> 00:59:18,618
a minimum bar at this point in our industry.

1160
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:20,139
And then we have so much further to go.

1161
00:59:20,179 --> 00:59:22,560
So then, am I doing all those things?

1162
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,961
You know, and even if you're not in a place.

1163
00:59:25,638 --> 00:59:28,999
that you're necessarily in charge of certain things,

1164
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:30,479
go talk to the person who is.

1165
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:31,900
So what can you do?

1166
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,341
There's something probably you can do that you aren't doing.

1167
00:59:34,681 --> 00:59:37,261
I know we aren't doing even the things that

1168
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:37,862
were brought up here.

1169
00:59:38,262 --> 00:59:41,283
And so that's a next step that you can go back and do.

1170
00:59:41,763 --> 00:59:44,624
And just whatever that one piece is,

1171
00:59:44,684 --> 00:59:45,724
that you can go take action.

1172
00:59:46,104 --> 00:59:48,165
And then we're a little bit further.

1173
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:51,646
Are you?

1174
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:52,766
Sorry, I almost hit you.

1175
00:59:53,246 --> 00:59:53,627
All right.

1176
00:59:54,685 --> 00:59:57,468
Well, and with one minute to go, we're going to go ahead and wrap up.

1177
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:01,072
Some quick housekeeping reminders, don't forget to fill out your surveys.

1178
01:00:01,653 --> 01:00:05,637
And also, we're the last panel in here for the day, so we'll be up here at the front

1179
01:00:05,697 --> 01:00:07,379
if you guys want to come and talk to us and ask questions.

1180
01:00:07,959 --> 01:00:09,161
So thank you all for attending.
