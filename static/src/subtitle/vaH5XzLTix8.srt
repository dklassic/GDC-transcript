1
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:05,793
So they've closed the door.

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,574
So I think I'm going to get started.

3
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,636
First, thanks to everybody for coming.

4
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:12,818
Even though this is scheduled opposite the number one Reason

5
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:15,200
to Be panel, I've seen from Twitter

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,501
that the line there is out the door.

7
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:19,963
So thanks very much for coming here to talk just about design.

8
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:22,385
A little background about myself.

9
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,366
My name's Brian Upton.

10
00:00:24,386 --> 00:00:26,528
I'm a senior game designer with Sony Santa Monica.

11
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:31,051
My biggest claim to fame is that I designed the original Rainbow

12
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:32,552
6 and Ghost Recon.

13
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:34,393
Thank you.

14
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:38,243
But for the last 12 years, I've been at Sony Santa Monica,

15
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:41,705
where I describe my role as being a script doctor

16
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:42,186
for games.

17
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,427
I work with a handful of little indie games

18
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:45,608
that are in development.

19
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:48,029
And I provide design, support, and critique

20
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:48,909
while they're being developed.

21
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,011
And I'm currently in the process of working

22
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,952
with several different experiential games, one of which

23
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:56,634
is the next game being done by The Chinese Room,

24
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:58,215
the original makers of Dear Esther.

25
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,271
So what I'm going to do is talk a little bit about the design of experiential play spaces

26
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:06,092
and some design principles, I think, that sort of tie into that.

27
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:11,734
The first thing I'm going to mention is what I call the problem with interactivity.

28
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:17,277
We define ourselves as an industry as being interactive.

29
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:19,998
We have the academy of interactive arts and sciences.

30
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:24,480
It's sort of baked into the genetics of what we consider games to be.

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,664
There's a problem with this, however, because it biases how we think about making these sorts of experiences.

32
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:41,210
Interactivity is a thing that games can do, but it's not what games fundamentally are.

33
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,191
And this is a really crucial distinction.

34
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:48,674
I'm going to borrow something from another medium to sort of illustrate what I'm talking about.

35
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,603
So this is probably the most famous example of another thing that another medium can do really well.

36
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,445
This is the most famous match cut in all of cinema from 2001,

37
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:06,069
the cut from the femur bone to the nuclear missile platform.

38
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:08,970
This is a very, very meaningful moment in 2001,

39
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:12,753
and it's something that film is really, really good at.

40
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:17,290
But nobody thinks that film is all about cuts.

41
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,731
Cuts are a thing that you can do within cinema,

42
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:24,392
but it's not what films are in their entirety.

43
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:27,213
It's not the essence of film.

44
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:30,894
You don't make films better by putting more and more cuts in.

45
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:34,655
You don't put cuts in at arbitrary times

46
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,576
just because more cuts are always better.

47
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,577
Cuts are a tool that can be used.

48
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:41,685
in order to tell stories with film,

49
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,609
but they are not something that has to happen

50
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:46,111
for a film to function as a film.

51
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:52,440
So within games, interactivity has a similar sort of role.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,843
We've seen it as something that has to happen,

53
00:02:54,863 --> 00:02:56,726
that has to happen for a game to occur.

54
00:02:57,282 --> 00:03:00,883
and that has a particular effect on how we design play spaces.

55
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:03,864
So for example, this is a common way to think ofâ€”

56
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:06,105
this illustration here I have here is a common way to think about

57
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:08,545
the relationship between a player and a game.

58
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:11,626
A game is something separate from a player that stands apart

59
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:14,567
and there are a set of mediated interactions

60
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,548
between the player and the game

61
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,628
and that is what produces the play experience.

62
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,581
But there's another way that we can define the relationship between player and game.

63
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,442
We can draw the line in a different place.

64
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:32,083
And in my design work, I prefer to draw the line like this.

65
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:37,926
The reason why is that we all know that different people play different games in different ways.

66
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:40,006
We don't all play the same way.

67
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:44,708
There's an element that each of us as players brings to the play experience.

68
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:45,849
And if we...

69
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:50,372
only think of the game as existing as something apart from the player,

70
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:54,255
we're losing a key element of what it takes to design a good game.

71
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:58,518
So I prefer to think of the game as something that occurs

72
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:01,781
both with whatever is happening in the computer or the console,

73
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:05,364
whatever is providing it, and within the player himself,

74
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:08,526
and that the element that's being contributed by the player

75
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,288
is actually crucial to understanding what's going on with the play.

76
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,431
So the question is, what's going on here?

77
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,280
We don't currently have particularly good tools

78
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,702
for talking about this part of the play experience

79
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,604
because we've been so biased towards thinking

80
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,706
about interaction as being at the heart of where play lies.

81
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:31,329
And so what I'm going to do over the next hour or so

82
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,231
is talk about a new design methodology.

83
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,392
This is a methodology for talking

84
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:39,114
about what happens in non-interactive play spaces.

85
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:41,516
So it's happening in those little loops that are happening

86
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:42,596
in the player's mind.

87
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:46,225
in between beats where they're actually interacting with the game.

88
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:49,487
And as part of this, I'll be giving you a set of design heuristics

89
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:51,608
that I've developed for designing these sorts of spaces,

90
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:56,010
and go through some case studies, some games that do this sort of thing particularly well,

91
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,712
sometimes in very surprising situations.

92
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:02,414
So the first thing I'd like to ask is,

93
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:05,396
given that we're so focused on interactivity,

94
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:08,078
why should turn-based games be fun?

95
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:11,165
It's like, if you look at people playing chess,

96
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:12,646
sometimes they'll just sit there.

97
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,488
They'll sit there and they'll stare at the board.

98
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:16,490
They're not interacting at all.

99
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,833
There's most of the play of a game like chess

100
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:23,736
involves sitting there and thinking about

101
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,697
what's going to happen in very particular ways.

102
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,462
And then when a move does get made, when you do interact with the other player,

103
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,264
it's almost like you're confirming the play experience you had before.

104
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:34,726
The fun that you have when you're playing chess

105
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:36,948
is in this moment when you're considering,

106
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,771
not when you are actually moving the piece.

107
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,192
That's just a bit of bookkeeping.

108
00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:42,953
And in fact, if you're really good at chess,

109
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:44,294
you can just do it entirely in your head.

110
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:45,896
You don't even have to move the piece.

111
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:51,681
So I have an answer for why I believe that turn-based games are fun.

112
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,003
And that is Anticip.

113
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:00,883
As Frank knows, patient.

114
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,924
There's something that goes on that I call anticipatory play.

115
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,065
And anticipatory play is something

116
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,945
that happens in the gap between moments of interaction.

117
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:16,526
And understanding how this works can be a really valuable tool.

118
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:18,526
So you see it in turn-based games.

119
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:19,826
You see what's going on when you're

120
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,067
waiting for a turn in chess.

121
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:22,387
You also see it in puzzles.

122
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:25,768
If you're working on Sudoku, for example,

123
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,228
you may stare at a page for.

124
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:30,489
10 minutes before you make a mark, something's going on there.

125
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:33,470
But it also happens in what seems to be more action-oriented games.

126
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,471
It happens in strategic beats in action games,

127
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,913
where there's a pause in the ongoing flow of give and take with the game,

128
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,333
where you stop to consider what you're doing.

129
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:44,755
And it also is going to happen in something that I call interpretive play.

130
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,476
And this is in games like Dear Esther or Gone Home,

131
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:52,257
where most of what's happening, most of the meaningful play that's happening,

132
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:54,078
is happening inside the player's head,

133
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,299
not in their direct interaction with the system.

134
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:01,653
So what we could talk about is with games like this,

135
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:04,694
these little cycles that are happening in the player's head,

136
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:06,974
we can talk of them as interpretive moves.

137
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:11,395
Interpretive moves are a shift in your understanding

138
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:12,195
of the play space.

139
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:16,376
So it is a state change that's happening.

140
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:17,557
It's something that's happening

141
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:20,557
that produces a play-like effect,

142
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:22,718
but it's not a state change that's happening

143
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:24,358
out in the console that you're playing with,

144
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:25,718
or it's not happening on the game board.

145
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,343
It's a state change that's happening in your head.

146
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,945
And understanding how these state changes happens

147
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,506
is the essence of anticipatory play.

148
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,148
So here's a really obvious example

149
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:38,709
of anticipatory play in action.

150
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,830
A puzzle game like Portal.

151
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:44,833
When you move it, when you enter a new test chamber in Portal

152
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:50,160
You don't immediately start firing your gun, your portal gun, and creating portals and jumping through them

153
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,481
You stop and consider, you stop to think about the situation

154
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,782
And you're not just thinking what can you do

155
00:07:57,342 --> 00:07:59,543
You're trying to think about how does this work

156
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:05,865
This working through the understanding of how the space is organized is an important part of interpretive play

157
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:09,586
So that you're identifying different features within the environment

158
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:13,688
and you're considering how that defines a space that you can operate within

159
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,151
You can see this also in Metal Gear Solid.

160
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:21,132
Metal Gear Solid has lots of anticipatory play moments.

161
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:24,554
And what's important to note is that if you're

162
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:26,614
studying the guards in Metal Gear Solid,

163
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,975
again, you're not necessarily thinking about,

164
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,356
oh, what am I going to do next?

165
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:33,697
You're trying to understand the situation around you.

166
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:36,478
And that cycle of understanding is

167
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:39,959
a key for understanding why Metal Gear Solid is fun to play.

168
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:46,060
Now personally, I first stumbled across this when I was designing the original Rainbow Six.

169
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,864
And for that, I mean, this was, I apologize for the very primitive graphics, this was back in 1997.

170
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:57,110
And this is the first mission from the original Rainbow Six, it was a hostage rescue in a Belgian embassy.

171
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,806
And one of the things that's interesting about Rainbow Six, when you see people play it,

172
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:08,087
is that a lot of the most interesting gameplay happens in spaces where nothing whatsoever seems to be happening.

173
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:11,268
So you enter the embassy and you have a hallway.

174
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:16,409
In the original Rainbow Six, we had a very, very severe one shot, one kill rules of engagement.

175
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:21,230
So that any misstep would get you killed. It could potentially lose the mission for you.

176
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:27,324
And people who would play this game would stop and would stand in the hallway.

177
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:34,836
And the gameplay that emerged from standing in the hallway turned out to be a crucial part of what made Rainbow Six a fun game to play.

178
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:39,095
and then they would creep slowly forward and kind of get a sense of what they're doing

179
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:42,898
and eventually they might see somebody, but the moment that they saw somebody

180
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:46,061
and took a shot, there was actually a confirmation,

181
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:49,544
that was actually like the reward for the actual game that had been played.

182
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:52,767
So when these shots happened, because the firefights would be over like that,

183
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:55,129
there'd be these almost instantaneous results,

184
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:59,712
the gameplay that was happening was happening in people's minds

185
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:01,854
as they considered the situation they were in,

186
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:04,076
not when they actually fired the killing shot.

187
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:05,237
And so...

188
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:13,600
We actually took the information we got from this and it factored into the design of the sequel to Rainbow Six Rogue Spear and then later on Ghost Recon.

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,103
We realized that the best levels were one that had nothing that happened in the first half of the level.

190
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:23,511
You would actually, we would actually design the level so you'd have half the level

191
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:24,812
that was just an approach.

192
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:27,154
And you'd get little glimpses of maybe what was going on,

193
00:10:27,174 --> 00:10:29,876
and you could stop and hide in the bushes and think about what was happening.

194
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,878
But there were no firefights for the first half of the game,

195
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,381
because a lot of the most interesting things that happened

196
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:39,003
were in people's minds as they considered their options

197
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:43,427
as they were moving forward within the approach to the play space.

198
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:46,429
So...

199
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:49,905
How do we go about designing spaces like this?

200
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:54,287
I mean, we can't just say, okay, we'll make a space that's interesting to play through,

201
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:58,148
because lots of spaces that are interesting to play through are not necessarily interesting

202
00:10:58,188 --> 00:10:59,509
to think about playing through.

203
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,490
If you're doing a very, very fast action game.

204
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:06,997
you may discover that there's not a whole lot of planning that happens at all.

205
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:13,182
And sometimes with some of these shooters, you have situations where you don't want anything

206
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:13,382
to happen.

207
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:17,205
You want people to purposely be still and not do anything.

208
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:22,810
So this is a set of heuristics that you can use to think about how situations can be structured

209
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,872
in order to deliver these sorts of anticipatory play.

210
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:29,896
So the first bit is choice.

211
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:34,693
Are there multiple possible ways for the situation to unfold?

212
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:37,597
What can I do? What's going to happen?

213
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:41,582
If you have an immediate threat that's coming to you in a game, you know what you need to do.

214
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:43,885
You need to deal with that immediate threat.

215
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:49,294
Choice involves putting the player in situations that are inherently ambiguous.

216
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:51,375
Where you're not sure what's going on.

217
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:54,196
You're not sure what you're supposed to do.

218
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:57,958
And those are cases where players will stop and consider,

219
00:11:57,978 --> 00:11:59,299
and if you design it right,

220
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,141
having a good time considering what they're going to do next.

221
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,282
But you also have to include variety.

222
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:09,806
Have you encountered previous situations before?

223
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:12,848
Because when we play this sort of anticipatory play,

224
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:14,569
we remember what we did.

225
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,091
And if we encounter a similar room,

226
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,532
a similar set of monsters, a similar setup,

227
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,134
we remember what our anticipation was.

228
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,555
We know how it's going to go.

229
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:26,117
And once we know how it's going to go,

230
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:27,618
then the situation is played out.

231
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:30,459
So that means it's not only the case that you have to...

232
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,681
continually give the player choices, but these choices have to

233
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:38,523
be different than the choices they've seen previously. This is why it's so hard to

234
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:39,823
design puzzle games, because

235
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:43,044
once you've solved a puzzle, you know what it is. You know what the answer is, and

236
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:44,865
there's no more anticipatory play

237
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:49,287
in working your way through it. If you have the same levels repeated over and

238
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:49,687
over again,

239
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:50,967
things quickly get played out.

240
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,276
You also have to have consequence.

241
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:59,058
Does any choice that I make in my anticipatory exploration

242
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:01,758
affect my future opportunities?

243
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:03,739
So it can't just be idle speculation.

244
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,580
To go back to the Rainbow Six example,

245
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,541
it's really important whether or not a guard sees you.

246
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:11,861
So wondering about what the guards can see

247
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:13,622
is a fun form of anticipatory play.

248
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:15,842
Can an innocent bystander see me?

249
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:17,563
That doesn't really matter.

250
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:19,763
That doesn't affect the way the game's going to unfold.

251
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:24,289
So it's not just a case of that you have something that you're going to work through and try to understand,

252
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:32,115
but also have a sense of how does that play into future anticipatory play as I move forward through the game.

253
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,660
Predictability. Are we able to correctly anticipate?

254
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,884
Has my model of the system that I understand, my understanding of how the game is playing,

255
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:46,186
can we observe patterns to guess what is likely to come next?

256
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:50,432
We have a system that's predictable enough that we can perceive patterns.

257
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:54,435
This is an image of Peggle, which if any of you have played, is a little like Pachinko.

258
00:13:54,876 --> 00:14:00,581
And it's a very interesting game because it teeters right on the edge of being completely unpredictable.

259
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,984
There's a very, very small window of things that you can predict.

260
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:08,848
And so there's a lot of anticipatory play when you're playing Peggle

261
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:10,850
because you're spending a lot of time figuring out, you know,

262
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,032
exactly how do I do this shot? What's possible for me to do?

263
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:20,057
Quite often it completely fails, but it succeeds often enough

264
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:23,278
that you have a sense that the system is something you can grasp with

265
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:26,199
and it gives you something to hang on to when you're trying to understand it.

266
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,001
But at the same time, too much predictability is problematic.

267
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:33,021
You also need a degree of uncertainty.

268
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:37,583
Because just as if we encounter the same situation over and over again,

269
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:42,524
we feel like it's become played out, there's no longer any anticipatory play.

270
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:47,330
If a game is too predictable, if it's too obvious what's going to happen,

271
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,594
then we can run through anticipatory play very, very quickly,

272
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:57,259
have a whole series of anticipatory events that happen in rapid succession.

273
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:03,065
And when that happens, by the time we actually get to those situations within the game,

274
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:04,846
they feel as though they're played out.

275
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,269
They feel as though there is, in fact, no more play to be had with them.

276
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,110
So...

277
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:15,335
On almost every game we encounter, we find that there is some degree of randomness, some degree of uncertainty.

278
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:22,077
And it's kind of curious, it's like, why should we have games that have this sort of uncertainty within them,

279
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:25,438
when in many cases players want to succeed?

280
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:30,920
You have obvious uncertainties of dice rolls or random number generators.

281
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,442
You have playing multiplayer, which is almost the most uncertain situation you always have.

282
00:15:35,822 --> 00:15:36,802
And it comes down to...

283
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:43,055
having a way to establish this, a way so that we have imperfect information about the future.

284
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,416
We don't want to be able to anticipate too perfectly,

285
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:48,617
because that destroys our ability to have anticipatory play.

286
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:51,777
And finally, the satisfaction.

287
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:57,379
It's very frustrating to, like, you can have a space that's very interesting to explore,

288
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,979
like, oh, there's all sorts of things I could do,

289
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,060
but if you work your way through all the possible ramifications,

290
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,901
and discover that none of them...

291
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,630
lead to anything that you think is successful,

292
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,451
then it doesn't matter whether it's fun to play or not.

293
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,712
There has to be some way that we think we can move forward.

294
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:16,473
Now, it doesn't really matter whether or not we actually can move forward,

295
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,854
because what matters is what the player thinks is going to happen.

296
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:23,576
So, for example, if you, if you, there's a clear, a clear solution to a problem,

297
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:26,176
but you don't know what it is, you can't figure it out,

298
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:29,919
that's no different from a solution not existing at all.

299
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,561
At the same time, if you think you know what the solution is,

300
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:37,025
you might have fun playing, even if you're in an almost impossible situation.

301
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:39,507
This is an image from a game called 1001 Spikes,

302
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:44,251
which is from a genre known as Trollcore or Massacore,

303
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:48,474
where the whole point is to put people in what feel like almost impossible situations.

304
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,096
And when you're in an impossible situation,

305
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:55,640
you have this continual iteration over possibilities that exist within the play space.

306
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,173
even though you're continually being frustrated with the actual gameplay.

307
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:05,360
So, we can summarize what the anticipatory play space consists of.

308
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,065
It is a pause in the action, it is a moment of stillness in the unfolding of a game

309
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:15,272
that is followed by a rapid flurry of interpretive moves within the player's mind.

310
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:20,278
eventually converges on a satisfying new understanding of the play space.

311
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:23,400
Either what the play space is, how it's organized,

312
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,321
or the player's sense of what they can do.

313
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:28,463
And then this understanding is then disrupted

314
00:17:28,523 --> 00:17:32,045
as the play space continues to evolve and the game continues.

315
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:39,199
The way I like to look at games is a game is an engine for generating interesting situations.

316
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,984
And this is where an interesting situation is any situation that satisfies the heuristics.

317
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:52,811
And what's interesting about this is that this definition of how games operate says nothing about rules or mechanics or feedback loops.

318
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:55,028
or even interaction.

319
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,050
All of these things are tools

320
00:17:57,491 --> 00:18:00,734
for creating interesting situations for anticipatory play.

321
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:03,497
But they're not, each one is not necessary.

322
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:06,019
You don't necessarily have to have really good feedback.

323
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,842
You don't necessarily have to have really good interaction.

324
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:11,145
It's easier to create interesting situations

325
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:12,206
if you use those tools,

326
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,408
but there are other ways to do it as well.

327
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:19,013
So a couple of key points designing for anticipatory play.

328
00:18:19,354 --> 00:18:21,796
The first thing is interpretive moves take time.

329
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:25,880
As I said, when we were designing Rogue Spear and Ghost Recon,

330
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,844
we would purposely design in points where nothing was happening for the player.

331
00:18:30,224 --> 00:18:33,627
Because it takes as much time to process what can potentially happen

332
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:36,310
as it does to actually respond to immediate events.

333
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:42,060
One of my concerns with games is that because we prioritize interactivity, we tend to fill empty space.

334
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,005
We tend to say, oh, this is a boring dead spot.

335
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:49,333
But actually those dead spots can be really, really crucial for crafting player experience.

336
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:53,147
The second point is that anticipation is shaped by player knowledge.

337
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:59,453
Because the dividing line between game and player is not so hard and fast,

338
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,696
that the game actually includes the knowledge the player has of the world,

339
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:04,618
and so much of the game happens in the player's head,

340
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:07,882
it's very, very sensitive to what players know about the world.

341
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:10,965
And so in many cases, this goes well beyond tutorials.

342
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:15,411
We need to be convincing players of what sort of games they are playing.

343
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:19,653
We need to be saying to them, because you've had this experience, because we give this

344
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:26,176
sort of theming to it, this is the set of rules you should be operating in to play these

345
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,077
anticipatory games.

346
00:19:27,357 --> 00:19:32,159
And this is true even if the game that they're playing is different from the game as actually

347
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,840
constituted in the rules that make it up.

348
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,463
And finally, to think of interaction as the validation of anticipation.

349
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,550
Interaction is not fun in to itself,

350
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,831
it is not something that is essential to games,

351
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:49,273
it's a way to move games forward

352
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,415
and to restart the engine of anticipatory play.

353
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:55,056
Once you've played through a horizon

354
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:58,158
and you sort of know how things are going,

355
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:01,060
an interactive moment can move things forward

356
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,681
into the next cycle of anticipation.

357
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,742
anticipatory play can operate even in very, very low interaction situations.

358
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,605
So, for example, it's possible to play SimCity and not touch your city

359
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:19,087
for half an hour, an hour. You can set things up

360
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:23,089
and just watch it evolve. And what makes SimCity

361
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:26,351
interesting to watch evolve is because each time the

362
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:29,193
game procedurally evolves, it

363
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:33,455
opens up a new set of possibilities that we could potentially act on.

364
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:37,858
And sitting there and watching your city as it grows on its own

365
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:42,842
is entertaining on its own because of the anticipation that happens as we're watching it.

366
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:48,946
So we can create a situation where the little thread we have back and forth

367
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:52,289
between whatever the simulation is that's running on your computer

368
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,390
and the human being can be very, very thin.

369
00:20:54,811 --> 00:21:00,275
We can have a tiny little trickle of interaction.

370
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,104
And that can work as long as whatever that tiny trickle that's occurring

371
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:10,928
is feeding the much larger cycles of interpretive play

372
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:12,769
that is happening in the head of the player.

373
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:18,053
So this is a way of setting up experiential games.

374
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:20,595
So if you have a game like Dear Esther,

375
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:23,838
you have a game where you have an interesting play experience

376
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:25,840
with almost no interaction at all.

377
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,982
The number of things you can do within Dear Esther is very, very tiny.

378
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,281
you can walk around, you can look at things,

379
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,222
there are things that get triggered as you move through it,

380
00:21:33,722 --> 00:21:35,283
but as long as the game continues to provide us

381
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:38,385
interesting situations to explore,

382
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:40,946
we can enjoy an experience like this

383
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:42,547
even though our interaction is very minimal.

384
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:45,749
And to understand why things can be interesting

385
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:46,769
in a game like Dearest,

386
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,670
I'm gonna introduce another concept,

387
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:50,411
and that is the idea of an interpretive play.

388
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:54,726
So, so far as I've been talking about anticipatory play, I've been mostly been talking about

389
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:59,451
like understanding what you can do in the world, what is your situation and how can

390
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:00,212
you act within it.

391
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:04,596
But interpretive play is an anticipatory play that is directed towards meaning.

392
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,113
You're not just saying what's going on here, but you're saying to yourself,

393
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:08,933
what does this mean?

394
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:10,155
Why do I care?

395
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:11,235
What does this say about me?

396
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,657
What does this say about the world?

397
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,600
And being able to operate within that sort of cycle,

398
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,902
when you're moving from moment to moment within a space,

399
00:22:18,602 --> 00:22:21,885
is what drives a game like Dear Esther.

400
00:22:22,646 --> 00:22:25,028
It's not about solving puzzles with a game like this.

401
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,330
It's about finding an interpretation that

402
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,913
feels whole and complete as you're moving through the space.

403
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:34,228
So to discuss this, I'm going to take a little detour and talk about

404
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:37,070
previously I mentioned that one of the heuristics is satisfaction

405
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,711
and obviously when you win, it's satisfying.

406
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:41,513
When you find a good way to move through a level, that's very satisfying.

407
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:44,655
That's a successful resolution of anticipatory play.

408
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:47,877
But in many of these games, you don't have a way to win.

409
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:52,460
And how do we go about delivering satisfaction to a player

410
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,642
in a situation when winning is trivial

411
00:22:54,962 --> 00:22:56,883
or when there's no obvious success state?

412
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:01,465
So, there's actually a good body of research that's been done on this,

413
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:04,306
from pen and paper role-playing game theory.

414
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:07,468
There's a website called The Forge, which did a lot of research about this,

415
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:12,370
mostly about discussion among themselves, back in the 90s.

416
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,892
And what they discovered is that, they were looking at the question is,

417
00:23:16,072 --> 00:23:21,334
why do some people like some sorts of RPGs and other people like other sorts of RPGs?

418
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,232
And they broke it down into, they realized that they had three basic categories of player.

419
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:28,913
They were looking for different things out of the game.

420
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,974
They had gamists, and gamists were looking to win.

421
00:23:32,114 --> 00:23:35,636
They were looking for ways to move through the RPG that would advance them somehow.

422
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:38,337
Even though in a game like Dungeons & Dragons, there's not an obvious win state.

423
00:23:38,357 --> 00:23:40,378
You can level up, you can get more treasure.

424
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:43,680
There's a winning, there's a gesture towards winning.

425
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,662
Then there are the simulationists, and the simulationists just wanted to see how things would play out.

426
00:23:48,682 --> 00:23:50,143
They're like, well what, you know, um...

427
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,782
What if I actually pretend to be an evil overlord?

428
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:56,122
What are the ramifications of that?

429
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:57,903
You could die.

430
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:02,664
For a simulationist, dying feels like success,

431
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:04,965
as long as it felt like it was honestly earned.

432
00:24:05,605 --> 00:24:07,626
And obviously this is a bad thing to mix with gamus,

433
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,967
because gamus are trying to avoid dying at all costs,

434
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:11,687
even if it violates the simulation.

435
00:24:12,207 --> 00:24:13,288
And finally they had narrativists,

436
00:24:13,348 --> 00:24:15,168
and narrativists were interested in good stories.

437
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:19,770
and making it interesting, whether or not it was realistic for the simulationists,

438
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,213
or whether or not it led towards winning.

439
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:26,421
So we've already talked about goals in terms of winning for achieving satisfaction,

440
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:30,848
but we can talk about two other valuation strategies that people use.

441
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:32,130
when they're playing games.

442
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,032
These are coherence and closure.

443
00:24:34,512 --> 00:24:36,314
Coherence is what the simulationists are using.

444
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,216
They're trying to hold one thing steady

445
00:24:38,636 --> 00:24:39,557
and see what happens.

446
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:42,380
And closure is what the narrativists are doing.

447
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,442
They're trying to seek out situations

448
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:46,624
within the play space that either open up

449
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:48,826
or close off opportunities for future play.

450
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:50,828
I'm going to explain a little more about this.

451
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:58,403
So coherence is finding an interpretation that causes minimal disruption to a previous understanding.

452
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:00,787
So you're holding one set of constraints constant.

453
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:03,290
How are things going to play out if I hold this one thing constant?

454
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,874
And this can be difficult in certain situations.

455
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:13,246
So, and closure is finding an interpretation that either opens off or closes off future interpretive play.

456
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:19,711
So you can say like, oh, I'm going to choose to interpret this in a way that increases the ambiguity of the situation

457
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:23,134
or that reduces the ambiguity of the situation.

458
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:27,077
And what you pick tends to depend on where you think you are within a game.

459
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:31,738
If you're at the very beginning of a game, people tend to open up the play space.

460
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:34,119
I'm going to do something that kind of makes things feel more open.

461
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:39,521
I'm going to interpret things in a way that makes it easier for me to make future interpretive moves.

462
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:43,102
Whereas if you do this at the end, players work to close off the interpretive space.

463
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:44,162
They're trying to find closure.

464
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,523
They're trying to find a way to encompass the whole thing in a fixed understanding.

465
00:25:51,344 --> 00:25:52,324
So I'm going to illustrate this.

466
00:25:52,364 --> 00:25:53,725
If any of you have seen the Lego movie...

467
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,492
There's a moment where things look very, very grim.

468
00:25:58,293 --> 00:25:59,914
Cloud Cuckoo Land has been destroyed.

469
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:02,475
The heroes have been rescued by the pirate Metalbeard.

470
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:04,877
Out of nowhere, the Millennium Falcon shows up

471
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:08,159
and Batman, Lego Batman, abandons them.

472
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:09,520
He goes off, he's like, I'm gonna go off

473
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,141
and party with the guys in the Millennium Falcon.

474
00:26:11,341 --> 00:26:13,262
That's much better than hanging out with you losers.

475
00:26:14,223 --> 00:26:16,044
So, if you're playing a coherence game.

476
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,311
Your response to this point of the plot is to say,

477
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:21,152
well, I know that looks like Batman is ditching him,

478
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:23,073
but he's got to have some sort of secret plan.

479
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:24,513
There's got to be something going on

480
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:27,255
because I believe I know who Batman is.

481
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:30,636
And figuring out how to reconcile what Batman is doing

482
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:34,158
with the fixed constraint of who you believe Batman is,

483
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:35,979
that's an interesting game to play.

484
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:38,220
That's something that requires a series

485
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,401
of interpretive moves to work out,

486
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:40,501
well, why could he be doing this?

487
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:41,181
What's going on?

488
00:26:42,954 --> 00:26:45,075
But you can also do closure play with this situation.

489
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,275
You can say, well, maybe it's true.

490
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:48,756
Maybe Batman's really a bad guy.

491
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:49,716
He's a huge jerk.

492
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:52,937
He's kind of been treating Wild Style poorly.

493
00:26:53,457 --> 00:26:56,057
But if Batman is a bad guy, well, that

494
00:26:56,077 --> 00:26:57,538
opens up all sorts of possibilities.

495
00:26:57,558 --> 00:26:58,718
That changes everything.

496
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:01,259
And that also, that opens up the play space.

497
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:03,979
And so you have these two different things

498
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,100
in tension with each other.

499
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:09,929
You have the idea that something that you will hold one constraint constant,

500
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,450
but that's difficult to reconcile with what's happening.

501
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,092
Or you have a way to choose a complete up-end to your understanding of the situation,

502
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,973
but that creates a whole lot of ramifications to work through.

503
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:24,454
So our understanding of any situation with the game

504
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,016
is a network of related propositions in tension with each other.

505
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,028
We think we know what's going on and we have these propositions that sort of all hang together in a coherent model.

506
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:38,712
And this is true whether you're talking about a story, whether you're talking about a level in a shooter,

507
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:40,415
whether you're talking about a strategy game.

508
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:43,980
We think we know what's going on and we think we know how things are going to unfold.

509
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,044
But if something changes in the situation that doesn't make sense to us,

510
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,227
that we have some new bit of information,

511
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:55,732
then we work to restore the stability that exists within this network

512
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,475
without disrupting our normative assumptions.

513
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:03,721
We either work to resolve the tension that exists between holding certain things constant

514
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:08,303
and by trying to broaden things as much as possible to encompass whatever new information that happened.

515
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:15,851
And it's these two motivations to either achieve closure or to maintain coherence

516
00:28:16,271 --> 00:28:19,174
that drive satisfaction with anticipatory play.

517
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:24,676
So winning, we talk about creating games that allow us to win,

518
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:28,782
that's an arbitrary condition that the rules impose on play spaces.

519
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:31,426
And we can create lots of play spaces that include winning.

520
00:28:31,907 --> 00:28:34,231
But this is always in addition to an intuitive pull

521
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:35,513
towards coherence and closure.

522
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:42,289
And we know this poll is there because we experience sometimes, even in games that have very strong winning conditions,

523
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:45,331
if you're really into a game, you're playing really, really strongly,

524
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:50,213
and all of a sudden you win abruptly, just like that, it feels like a cheat.

525
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:52,494
It feels sort of strangely unsatisfying.

526
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:56,215
We want to win at the moment we can feel it coming together.

527
00:28:56,235 --> 00:29:00,297
We want to have that sense that everything is converging to a satisfying resolution.

528
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:02,698
We want that closure at the same time.

529
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,920
that we have the actual weagle victory condition.

530
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,081
And understanding the way that that draw towards closure

531
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:13,182
affects the way we want games to end,

532
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:16,784
that takes place even in situations where it seems like

533
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:19,665
everything is driven by winning alone.

534
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:25,387
So I'm going to take a look at three case studies now

535
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:27,848
and sort of show how this plays out

536
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:29,848
when we have more experiential games.

537
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,598
The first one is a game from Blendo Games, done by Brendan Chung.

538
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:36,141
It's called 30 Flights of Loving.

539
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:41,111
It's a fairly small indie game, but I think it's a really good illustration of how these

540
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:41,712
things work out.

541
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:47,754
So 30 Flights of Loving is about a heist gone bad,

542
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:50,938
but it's not quite clear how the heist goes bad

543
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:53,180
or what happened to lead up to that.

544
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,183
There's a little interlude at the beginning

545
00:29:56,203 --> 00:29:58,385
where things are set up, you meet the two main characters,

546
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:01,408
it's first person 3D, you meet the two main characters

547
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:03,671
other than yourself, Nita and Borges,

548
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:05,573
who are clearly your partners.

549
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:09,334
You're going to be committing some sort of crime with them, you're not sure what.

550
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:10,814
Something's being planned.

551
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:14,156
And then, quite quickly, you get dropped into this scene.

552
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:17,197
It's after something has gone badly wrong.

553
00:30:17,977 --> 00:30:19,738
Anita is wounded and she's trying to kill you.

554
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:21,038
And this is the title screen.

555
00:30:21,718 --> 00:30:26,040
But the problem is that there's no indication of what it was that happened previously.

556
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:29,962
So almost immediately we're presented with choices.

557
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:31,263
What happened here?

558
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:32,323
What does this all mean?

559
00:30:32,783 --> 00:30:35,364
Interpretive play requires that you have choices.

560
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:38,444
There has to be some sort of ambiguity in what's being presented to you.

561
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:42,686
There has to be a situation where it's unclear to you how you should interpret it.

562
00:30:43,006 --> 00:30:45,646
Was there a betrayal, an accident, some sort of screw up?

563
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:48,267
There's no obvious right answer to this puzzle.

564
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:49,747
There's not like, oh yeah, I got it.

565
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:50,067
Okay.

566
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:50,628
I know what it is.

567
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:56,308
We want to work towards something that, given the information we have, satisfies this feeling

568
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:57,751
of both coherence and closure.

569
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:05,191
After the initial scene with Anita, you discover that Borgias is also wounded.

570
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:08,373
And you leave Anita behind, which is a new bit of information.

571
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,453
Why would that be happening?

572
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:11,595
And you escape with Borgias through the Kugat Airport.

573
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:15,978
And there's this long sequence where you get him in a luggage cart,

574
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:18,019
and he's bleeding, and you push him around through the crowds.

575
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,041
And there's interaction in this space.

576
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:24,083
You're having to move through the space and navigate with these crowds.

577
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:28,045
but it's very, very low, a very thin trickle of what's going on.

578
00:31:28,405 --> 00:31:31,066
You have a lot of time to think about what you just saw

579
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:32,487
and why that matters.

580
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,528
Why was she trying to kill you?

581
00:31:34,628 --> 00:31:36,068
Why is he not?

582
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:37,309
Why are you escaping with him?

583
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,370
So, variety.

584
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,991
What new information did I just learn from moment to moment

585
00:31:43,011 --> 00:31:44,232
within this interpretive space?

586
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:46,773
And how does that alter my previous interpretation?

587
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,169
from moment to moment within 30 flights of loving,

588
00:31:50,189 --> 00:31:53,749
you're always going to sense that things are continually changing,

589
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,330
the ground is continually shifting under your feet.

590
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,950
There are new things that are happening

591
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,170
that require you to make these sorts of interpretive moves.

592
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:03,151
Interpretive play requires that our situation keep changing.

593
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,652
And then, after you escape with words,

594
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,712
all of a sudden you start getting flashbacks.

595
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:13,133
You get flashbacks to what happened before the beginning of the game.

596
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:17,893
What happened before the heist was even being planned.

597
00:32:19,011 --> 00:32:21,372
And you find that you and Anita have a history.

598
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:25,574
There's a scene of her alone peeling oranges,

599
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:27,595
and she sort of smiles at you as you walk past her.

600
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:30,556
All three of you are going to a wedding together.

601
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:34,497
There are these different moments, different beats

602
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:37,479
that give shifts to what your interpretations could be.

603
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:39,800
And what's interesting about this is that

604
00:32:41,051 --> 00:32:43,152
these shifts have consequence.

605
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:45,052
So when you're making interpretive moves,

606
00:32:45,112 --> 00:32:46,733
it's not just sort of idle speculation.

607
00:32:47,273 --> 00:32:50,274
You're actually directing your speculation

608
00:32:50,614 --> 00:32:53,154
towards situations that will

609
00:32:53,194 --> 00:32:54,815
contribute your other interpretive moves.

610
00:32:54,835 --> 00:32:56,995
So what are the ramifications of this interpretation?

611
00:32:57,336 --> 00:32:58,916
How does one shift in understanding

612
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:00,917
invite other shifts in understanding?

613
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,758
So that it's not a case of just like,

614
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,198
oh, I wonder what Anita was doing there.

615
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:09,500
But it seems very, very significant that Anita is there.

616
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,221
It's very significant for knowing what you know about what comes later

617
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:16,142
that she be there peeling an orange, looking at you that way.

618
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:20,904
As I said, the three of you wind up going to a wedding together.

619
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:25,506
And this all clearly takes place before any of the heists that happens.

620
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,508
And so, we now get into the realm of predictability.

621
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,176
And in the case of interpretive play.

622
00:33:34,801 --> 00:33:36,722
We're looking to say, can I make sense of what's going on?

623
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:38,603
Can I anticipate what might go next?

624
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:41,665
At this point, we're in this whole stew of possible things

625
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:42,326
that might happen.

626
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:44,207
Interpretive play requires that you're

627
00:33:44,227 --> 00:33:46,368
able to form a sense of how things are likely to unfold.

628
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:48,189
And one thing that's really interesting

629
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:51,832
is when we talk about typical action games,

630
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:54,834
the rules are something that we present to the player.

631
00:33:54,854 --> 00:33:57,155
They're an abstraction that the player has to learn.

632
00:33:57,175 --> 00:33:59,377
But when we start talking about interpretive play,

633
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:02,559
our ability to predict is to a great deal predicated

634
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:03,640
on our knowledge of.

635
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:09,531
day-to-day life, or our knowledge of literary tropes, or our knowledge of film, or our knowledge of other

636
00:34:10,392 --> 00:34:16,818
types of experiential games. So the rules that make up, the rules that allow us to predict what's

637
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:23,123
happening in this situation rely on our understanding of, like, what are the relationships

638
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:28,108
between people? Like, was there a love triangle here? They all went to a wedding together. What does that mean?

639
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:31,279
What sort of friends were we that we all went to a wedding together?

640
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:36,342
There's a lot of real world knowledge that gets mixed into creating predictable situations

641
00:34:36,762 --> 00:34:39,083
whenever we're talking about experiential games.

642
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:43,466
And then finally, after the wedding, you apparently sleep with Anita.

643
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:45,467
It's not spelled out explicitly.

644
00:34:45,487 --> 00:34:46,308
You both get drunk.

645
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,629
You go back to the hideout that you were staying in,

646
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,351
and she's waiting for you on this makeshift bed that exists.

647
00:34:53,032 --> 00:34:55,433
And at this point, as you walk towards her,

648
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:57,655
you get dropped back into...

649
00:34:58,298 --> 00:35:02,000
the experience in the airport.

650
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,842
But what happens with the continual shift is you get this sense of

651
00:35:06,902 --> 00:35:08,182
uncertainty.

652
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:11,384
Once you discover that there is this romantic entanglement between you

653
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:11,784
and Anita,

654
00:35:12,124 --> 00:35:15,165
which has not been hinted at before except for a few of these looks,

655
00:35:15,673 --> 00:35:18,535
Is it possible that all the predictions I had previously were incorrect?

656
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:20,336
Is there something that I've overlooked?

657
00:35:20,716 --> 00:35:25,019
You have the sense of that the world underneath your feet is unstable.

658
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:29,262
And because of that, you go back and revisit your previous interpretations.

659
00:35:29,302 --> 00:35:30,682
You're not fixed and settled.

660
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:32,443
It's not like, right, I knew what happened, I moved on.

661
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:38,807
But each new element that is added has the potential to undermine what came previously.

662
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:43,070
So interpretive play requires that we continually revisit our existing understanding of the situation.

663
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,971
We're never really sure we know what's coming next.

664
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,520
So eventually you escape with Borges.

665
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,262
There's a great sort of interactive moment

666
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,063
where you use Borges on his luggage cart

667
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:54,403
to prevent a gate from coming down.

668
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,665
And then, when you finally make it out of the airport,

669
00:35:57,685 --> 00:35:59,526
you get another flashback.

670
00:35:59,947 --> 00:36:02,108
And this flashes you back all the way to

671
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:03,829
something even before the wedding.

672
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,130
We know it's before the wedding because

673
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,011
you're riding on motorbikes together

674
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:09,432
and you can tell that you're carrying the bottles

675
00:36:09,472 --> 00:36:12,074
that you take to the wedding as a wedding present.

676
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:17,740
Right at the moment where Anita turns around and looks lovingly at you,

677
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:22,724
again another sort of moment that invites coherence and closure exploration,

678
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:25,525
she's not paying attention and she gets hit by a truck.

679
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,267
And the two of you are apparently killed.

680
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:29,988
And now this really throws things into confusion because...

681
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:33,669
How do we interpret this now?

682
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,951
Was this really a romance going wrong?

683
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,854
Was it some sort of stupid mistake in the heist,

684
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:39,876
an intentional betrayal?

685
00:36:40,396 --> 00:36:42,118
Did the heist even happen?

686
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:43,640
Is it metaphoric?

687
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,904
Is the entire thing some sort of afterlife dream?

688
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:52,069
This final movement of the death of you and Anita.

689
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:57,073
in one way or another, really breaks open the possible interpretive space

690
00:36:57,493 --> 00:37:01,495
and then encourages you to work on a whole variety of levels towards satisfaction.

691
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:03,475
So you're no longer at this point trying to say,

692
00:37:03,776 --> 00:37:05,836
okay, can I understand what's going on?

693
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,338
You're trying to say, can I understand thematically

694
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:10,539
something that will make this satisfying to me?

695
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,700
How does this make me feel?

696
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,561
How do I want to close this off and it makes this feel whole and complete?

697
00:37:17,142 --> 00:37:21,925
in an interpretation that intellectually and emotionally that I can feel good about.

698
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:27,969
And it's this convergence on an interpretation that we like is what is at the heart of this sort of interpretive play.

699
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:31,791
And notice this isn't about winning, this isn't about getting the puzzle right.

700
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:35,233
It's not about solving what happened between Borges and Anita.

701
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:43,038
It's about taking the situation as presented to us and using it as a way to work through our own personal interpretation

702
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:46,400
of what feels satisfying in these sorts of situations.

703
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:52,244
My second example is going to be something that you're more likely to have played.

704
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:58,006
It's the Silent Hills playable trailer that came out this fall, PT, for PlayStation 4.

705
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:05,548
And what's very interesting about this in terms of interpretive play and interactivity

706
00:38:06,129 --> 00:38:11,030
is that there's, again, only the thinnest trickle of interactivity in this space.

707
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,471
It's a very tiny repetitive level.

708
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:18,532
about the only action you have is to be able to look more closely at things.

709
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:23,356
And, in a really interesting design choice, the feedback cues are really confusing.

710
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:28,241
In preparing this talk, I played way more PT than is probably healthy.

711
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:33,165
And, I actually tweeted, I was like, I had not anticipated the fact that

712
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:36,948
talking about PT would require me to immerse myself in PT.

713
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:41,084
And I also watched a lot of walkthrough videos

714
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:41,985
of people playing PT.

715
00:38:42,005 --> 00:38:43,165
And one of the interesting things

716
00:38:43,185 --> 00:38:43,966
about the walkthrough videos

717
00:38:44,006 --> 00:38:46,187
is that people are trying to show things

718
00:38:46,587 --> 00:38:47,868
and they have absolutely no idea

719
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,089
how to trigger the things they're showing.

720
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:50,009
And you have these people saying,

721
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:51,430
I think I need to do this.

722
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:53,892
Even with people who are really obsessed with the game,

723
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:55,272
there's a degree of confusion

724
00:38:55,312 --> 00:38:57,314
over what the feedback is actually doing.

725
00:38:58,955 --> 00:39:01,556
Yet, we get hours, hours of interpretive play

726
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:04,498
out of this really simple, almost non-interactive space.

727
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:10,005
So here's the way, I'm not going to show you all PT,

728
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:13,227
but there's a few spaces aside from this,

729
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:16,489
but most of PT takes place in this L-shaped hallway

730
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,950
with a little bathroom attached.

731
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:21,833
And initially, the hallway's very kind of normal.

732
00:39:23,274 --> 00:39:25,196
It's well lit, you can kind of see what's going on.

733
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,922
You turn a corner, that's the rest of the hallway, the bathroom's kind of off to the right.

734
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:36,186
And most of the gameplay consists of this continual cycling through this L-shaped hallway.

735
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:40,390
And occasionally you'll make a detour into the bathroom, there's some other things that can happen.

736
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,513
But it almost all happens in this very, very limited space.

737
00:39:44,353 --> 00:39:47,276
So why does this work? Why does this work as a play experience?

738
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:53,073
The environmental cues that exist within the space drive anticipatory play.

739
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:57,695
Almost everything in the space feels very, very significant.

740
00:39:58,215 --> 00:40:01,556
And because it's repeated over and over and over again,

741
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:07,479
there's a hard stillness that exists where you're sort of driven to

742
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,921
obsessively look at the various things within the space

743
00:40:12,261 --> 00:40:13,641
and try to consider what it means.

744
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:16,843
Why is it here? Why am I being placed in this situation?

745
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:18,003
Why should I be looking at this?

746
00:40:18,697 --> 00:40:22,224
And it's very important that for most of the game almost nothing is happening,

747
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:25,951
because with nothing happening, then the interpretive play,

748
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:30,279
you can make the interpretive moves that make P.T. work is a horror experience.

749
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:36,440
So, within this hallway there are small areas that have great informational density.

750
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,122
And because the triggering is so soft, because you're never quite sure if you've actually

751
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:45,084
triggered anything or not, you're really encouraged to study details closely.

752
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:48,006
You look at things, you're not sure, what do I need to do to advance here?

753
00:40:48,026 --> 00:40:49,207
Is it important that I study this?

754
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:50,127
Is there a clue here?

755
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,308
What do I need to find?

756
00:40:52,546 --> 00:40:56,027
When you narrow down to look at these tight details, it really gives you this sort of

757
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,028
feeling of having blinders on.

758
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:01,909
It sort of eliminates your situational awareness.

759
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:06,391
You're not quite sure of anything around you other than what you're actually looking at.

760
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:13,114
These details all work towards suggesting some sort of awkward and dysfunctional relationships.

761
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:17,775
The various areas around the hallway have this sort of squalor to them.

762
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:19,656
There's like old banana peels, cigarettes.

763
00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:23,817
pill bottles, candy wrappers laid around.

764
00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:27,880
All the family portraits seem kind of off.

765
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,464
There's suggestions of drug abuse and then after a while you start getting radio

766
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:34,887
messages about murder and families

767
00:41:34,987 --> 00:41:37,829
killing each other and there's this pervasive

768
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,833
atmosphere of sort of insanity and dysfunction

769
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:45,096
that you pick up gradually as you start to study the space around you.

770
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:49,240
You also start seeing things that appear.

771
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,261
There are things that start appearing on the wall.

772
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:54,083
I don't know if this is readable on the screen,

773
00:41:54,103 --> 00:41:56,284
but it says, I can hear them calling me from,

774
00:41:56,865 --> 00:41:58,126
and if you continue to explore,

775
00:41:58,226 --> 00:41:59,687
one of the things the triggering reveals

776
00:41:59,747 --> 00:42:00,807
is that it turns into,

777
00:42:00,907 --> 00:42:02,508
I can hear them calling to me from hell.

778
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:05,930
And so, again, because we've been forced

779
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:08,452
in this sort of obsessive relationship with the world,

780
00:42:08,932 --> 00:42:10,513
then all these tiny,

781
00:42:10,894 --> 00:42:13,115
so if you were doing a more action-oriented game,

782
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:16,497
you would blaze right past something on the wall that said,

783
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,311
I can hear them calling me from hell.

784
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:24,174
But because there's nothing else to do, there's nothing else to look at, the emergence of

785
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:27,436
this thing on the wall feels very, very significant and very, very powerful.

786
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:33,680
And it triggers, again, spawns a whole other cycle of interpretive play when it happens.

787
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,601
So there's ways to solve.

788
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:39,044
What's going on in PT?

789
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:41,105
We can sort of like work out solutions

790
00:42:41,245 --> 00:42:42,625
of what the space is presenting to us,

791
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:44,526
but they all lead to feelings of dread,

792
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:47,206
which is why it's so effective as a horror space.

793
00:42:47,727 --> 00:42:51,807
All our interpretations and views, abuse, insanity, murder,

794
00:42:52,188 --> 00:42:54,508
we're not explicitly told what awful happened,

795
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:56,429
which is what actually makes it even worse,

796
00:42:56,469 --> 00:42:58,649
because now we're giving lots of hints

797
00:42:59,169 --> 00:43:01,070
that something awful happened,

798
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,670
and our imagination is where the horror takes place.

799
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:10,006
So the space is so minimalist that even very small differences feel pretentious.

800
00:43:10,106 --> 00:43:14,028
After you've cycled through the hallway half a dozen or a dozen times,

801
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:17,330
you turn, it gets dark and you have a flashlight at one point,

802
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:23,754
and you turn the corner, and at this point, instead of having the normal lighting of the hallway,

803
00:43:24,454 --> 00:43:25,855
there's a spot that's lit red.

804
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:30,277
And I'm looking at the people over here who I played it with at Sony Santa Monica,

805
00:43:30,898 --> 00:43:35,720
and all of us had the same response when we saw this, and that was this.

806
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:44,012
And it's really simple. I mean, it's like, again,

807
00:43:44,673 --> 00:43:47,294
in a game where there's a lot more action going on,

808
00:43:47,514 --> 00:43:51,036
the fact that all of a sudden you encountered an area where you had a red light,

809
00:43:51,316 --> 00:43:52,717
that wouldn't feel particularly significant.

810
00:43:52,737 --> 00:43:56,178
But because the game has given you so little

811
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:00,381
in terms of interpretations, in terms of evidence to consider,

812
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:04,603
the fact that all of a sudden something like that changes feels very, very significant indeed.

813
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:09,725
On top of that, PT contains a handful of jump scares.

814
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:15,509
There's a ghost, this is a brief screenshot of her who appears sometimes,

815
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:17,270
there's a smashed window that can startle you,

816
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:19,953
there's an unexpected attack by the ghost.

817
00:44:20,873 --> 00:44:22,395
These happen very, very rarely.

818
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:25,717
In fact, it's possible to play the game with only encountering one of them.

819
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:28,780
But because you know that that possibility exists,

820
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,882
it always puts you on edge that it's going to happen again.

821
00:44:34,283 --> 00:44:37,886
Now there's one thing that I'm going to show, the baby in the sink.

822
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:40,508
And the baby in the sink I think is probably the weakest part of PT.

823
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:42,749
And it's interesting why it's the weakest part.

824
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:45,631
It's really, really creepy the first time you see this baby.

825
00:44:45,651 --> 00:44:49,174
You're locked in the bathroom and there it is sort of mewling at you.

826
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:51,395
It's a really unsettling situation.

827
00:44:52,228 --> 00:44:55,771
But the problem is that because of the soft triggering that works so well elsewhere in the game,

828
00:44:56,232 --> 00:45:00,836
it's possible to get stuck in a state where the baby is there for a long time.

829
00:45:01,197 --> 00:45:03,379
You can have half an hour with the baby there in the sink.

830
00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:06,362
And after a while it wears off. It's like it's played out.

831
00:45:06,422 --> 00:45:12,108
There's no more... whatever you imagined about what sort of horrors surrounded the existence of this horrible thing in the sink.

832
00:45:14,247 --> 00:45:15,467
you don't have any more work to do on it.

833
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:16,808
And at that point, when that happens,

834
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:18,609
your response is, oh yeah, the baby.

835
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:20,190
And it stops being scary.

836
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:21,431
And it's really interesting that something

837
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,972
when it first appears is one of the scariest parts of PT,

838
00:45:24,412 --> 00:45:26,193
quickly can become one of the most boring

839
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:28,014
because it has gotten played out

840
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:29,435
as an interpretive play space.

841
00:45:31,716 --> 00:45:34,018
The final thing I'm gonna talk about is Journey,

842
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:36,739
which was done by Sony Santa Monica.

843
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,880
My involvement was very tangential.

844
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,722
I was not sort of the designer on it,

845
00:45:41,762 --> 00:45:43,543
but I got to see a lot of it while it was being developed.

846
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:46,888
Most of you probably know how Journey unfolds.

847
00:45:46,928 --> 00:45:48,729
It's a two-player platformer.

848
00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:51,310
What's interesting about it is that you're randomly paired

849
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,270
with another player.

850
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:56,032
And a key play mechanic, which is very subtle,

851
00:45:56,432 --> 00:45:58,974
is that your proximity to the other player

852
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:02,815
recharges your jump when you're running within the space.

853
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,177
So normally when you're running around,

854
00:46:06,217 --> 00:46:08,358
you have your scarf that trails behind you.

855
00:46:08,538 --> 00:46:09,759
Your scarf gets longer over time,

856
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:11,580
and your scarf is a meter that tells you

857
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,020
how high and how long you can jump.

858
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:18,102
And the scarf will drain when you jump, and then you fall,

859
00:46:18,122 --> 00:46:19,542
you can no longer sustain your float.

860
00:46:19,803 --> 00:46:22,684
But if you get to around certain areas, it will recharge,

861
00:46:22,724 --> 00:46:24,605
and then you can jump again.

862
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:27,747
But when you're playing with another player,

863
00:46:27,987 --> 00:46:31,149
if you get close to them, then your scarves

864
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:31,969
recharge each other.

865
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:38,753
They light up, and whatever you burned off from jumping

866
00:46:39,053 --> 00:46:39,894
recharges itself.

867
00:46:41,082 --> 00:46:44,984
What's interesting about this is that even though there's no direct communication in the game,

868
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:49,847
the mechanics themselves, this one very subtle mechanic, drives a particular social behavior.

869
00:46:50,247 --> 00:46:53,809
And that is that if you want to proceed effectively for the platforming part of the game,

870
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:55,789
sticking together is a good thing to do.

871
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:59,491
And this instinct towards sticking together becomes a strategy that you sort of internalize

872
00:46:59,531 --> 00:47:01,152
almost unconsciously as you're playing the game.

873
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:07,364
This sort of unconscious internalization of this sort of strategy

874
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,185
actually exists in other games as well.

875
00:47:09,325 --> 00:47:12,808
In Ico, Yorda has a similar function.

876
00:47:12,908 --> 00:47:15,569
She acts as a key, and also she's very vulnerable.

877
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:17,050
And whenever you're not with Yorda,

878
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:19,772
you feel very, very nervous when you're playing Ico.

879
00:47:20,113 --> 00:47:22,714
And what it means is that the mechanics drive you to the sense of like,

880
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:24,135
oh, I should really always be with Yorda.

881
00:47:24,235 --> 00:47:25,596
I should really always be with Yorda.

882
00:47:25,957 --> 00:47:29,519
And this sort of reinforces a particular way of existing within the game world.

883
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:33,408
You have the same thing with this guy in Portal.

884
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:36,951
In fact, I think I cared more about the cube

885
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:38,392
than I did about Yorda.

886
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:40,293
Because it's a real ally.

887
00:47:40,313 --> 00:47:43,576
Where it's presented, it blocks energy pulses

888
00:47:43,596 --> 00:47:44,016
that you could kill.

889
00:47:44,036 --> 00:47:45,537
You pick it up and you use it as shield.

890
00:47:45,598 --> 00:47:46,318
It protects you.

891
00:47:46,879 --> 00:47:48,980
And then the only way to get through the level

892
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,101
is to place it on trigger plates.

893
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:51,062
So it opens doors for you.

894
00:47:51,122 --> 00:47:53,043
It really is a valuable ally

895
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:54,725
for the 10 or so minutes you have it.

896
00:47:54,745 --> 00:47:58,248
And then, so again, the sense of that I need this cube.

897
00:47:58,268 --> 00:47:59,208
I need it to be with me.

898
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:03,972
The mechanics drive a particular way of thinking about your existence within the space.

899
00:48:05,573 --> 00:48:07,594
So within Journey, the same thing happens.

900
00:48:07,614 --> 00:48:11,315
The mechanics have driven you to think about a certain way of existing within the space.

901
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:13,796
But then you get to the snowfield near the end of the game.

902
00:48:14,116 --> 00:48:16,217
And the snowfield, there's nothing really to jump to.

903
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,038
You can still jump for the heck of it.

904
00:48:18,615 --> 00:48:20,456
But there's not really any point anymore.

905
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,817
And the cold begins to drain away your scarves.

906
00:48:22,857 --> 00:48:25,538
Even without jumping, you're losing the ability to jump.

907
00:48:26,058 --> 00:48:28,579
And what that does is that this draining happens.

908
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,600
I've watched every time. People tend to stick together.

909
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:35,382
They want to keep their scarves sort of fully charged.

910
00:48:35,762 --> 00:48:39,063
And so this reflexive mechanic encourages a certain way to be.

911
00:48:43,213 --> 00:48:47,895
This has particular poignance when you get to the point in the snow field where you both die.

912
00:48:48,515 --> 00:48:51,416
And I'm sorry if I'm spoiling Journey for you.

913
00:48:51,496 --> 00:48:53,937
You don't make it through that part alive.

914
00:48:54,377 --> 00:48:55,218
And you both collapse.

915
00:48:55,638 --> 00:48:58,319
At the very end, your scarves have melted away to nothing.

916
00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:00,680
They've been destroyed by the cold.

917
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:07,002
But every time I play Journey, I've never not seen both people stay together right to the very end.

918
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:10,604
They march shoulder to shoulder right up to the moment where they both die.

919
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:12,745
What's fascinating about this is that...

920
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:17,250
that it feels really, really natural to stick together at that point.

921
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,371
It feels wrong not to stick together.

922
00:49:20,012 --> 00:49:24,853
And so Journey contains within it this lingering tendency towards togetherness.

923
00:49:24,873 --> 00:49:27,234
That's sort of the meaning that it adheres within Journey,

924
00:49:27,254 --> 00:49:28,555
or at least that's the meaning that it adheres to me,

925
00:49:28,595 --> 00:49:32,736
because I'm reading Journey through my own particular interpretive,

926
00:49:32,817 --> 00:49:35,838
my own particular set of interpretive moves that I experienced as I played it.

927
00:49:36,238 --> 00:49:37,718
You might experience something very different,

928
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:39,399
but the sense is that baked into the,

929
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,560
so it's not just like story moments that create the sort of meaning making.

930
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,842
It's also in the mechanics themselves.

931
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:49,885
I'm going to speed up a little because I realize I'm running short.

932
00:49:50,325 --> 00:49:55,409
An interesting, cool thing I discovered when I was replaying this for the presentation.

933
00:49:56,289 --> 00:50:00,712
Together this encourages players when you're resurrected and walk into the light in the end,

934
00:50:02,613 --> 00:50:05,335
they recreate the silhouette of the mountain unconsciously.

935
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:08,236
And I actually asked somebody from the Chinese room if this was intentional.

936
00:50:08,597 --> 00:50:09,557
It was completely accidental.

937
00:50:09,797 --> 00:50:12,679
This was just sort of a natural convergence during creation.

938
00:50:14,382 --> 00:50:16,464
I'm going to talk very briefly about Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

939
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:19,806
I wish I could talk more, but unfortunately almost nothing's been released about it yet.

940
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:23,128
I've been allowed to show one screenshot.

941
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,032
So when we're designing Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, what we're looking for is creating

942
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:32,574
a space that's largely empty of interaction.

943
00:50:32,874 --> 00:50:35,116
There's plenty of stillness in this space.

944
00:50:35,876 --> 00:50:39,438
There are triggered beats that will happen as you explore this space.

945
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:41,220
They alter your understanding of the story.

946
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,162
There are ways to interpret what's going on.

947
00:50:44,848 --> 00:50:51,373
But they're designed to be both ambiguous and for the space itself to offer you plenty of stillness

948
00:50:51,653 --> 00:50:54,536
in order to consider the ramifications of what you're seeing.

949
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:01,782
So just in conclusion, I'm going to talk a little about meaningful play.

950
00:51:01,802 --> 00:51:05,345
I mean, we want games to become a powerful art form.

951
00:51:05,365 --> 00:51:07,606
We want games to be something that are meaningful.

952
00:51:08,429 --> 00:51:13,133
And I think the way to this is by realizing that meaning is the residue of interpretive play.

953
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:17,277
If you're talking about just sort of like what your strategies are for winning a game,

954
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:22,482
okay, that has an application to the game itself. That's internal to the game.

955
00:51:22,842 --> 00:51:26,726
But once you start talking about doing interpretive play, because that ties into our own

956
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:31,030
understanding of the world, we're drawing on our understanding of human relationships,

957
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:33,232
of human power structures.

958
00:51:33,993 --> 00:51:41,676
Because we're drawing on that, then the interpretive moves that we make in order to navigate these sort of anticipatory spaces

959
00:51:42,617 --> 00:51:46,839
lead to a lingering meaning that exists even after you finish playing.

960
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:54,402
So in a way, the meaning of a game is the final position of the pieces as they exist on the interpretive board.

961
00:51:54,982 --> 00:52:01,065
They're the final set of ways of understanding through coherence and closure what it is we were doing as we play.

962
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:05,093
What this means is that if we're trying to make games that are meaningful,

963
00:52:05,633 --> 00:52:08,176
it's not a good idea to think of them as a transfer of information.

964
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:10,238
We're not trying to pump meaning into the player.

965
00:52:10,518 --> 00:52:14,602
We're not trying to encode meaning as a way for them to decode as a puzzle.

966
00:52:15,122 --> 00:52:17,164
Even though sometimes even literature is taught this way,

967
00:52:17,424 --> 00:52:21,568
we want to think about meaningful games as existing

968
00:52:22,108 --> 00:52:26,432
as a sense of discovery in a way of having strategies of anticipation

969
00:52:26,692 --> 00:52:29,055
that lead to particular interpretations.

970
00:52:30,823 --> 00:52:34,044
So the rules that put bounds on the sorts of meanings that you can discover

971
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:38,146
are constraints that are defined by the mechanics of the game as they are in Journey.

972
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:41,208
They're described by situations, the situations you're put into PT.

973
00:52:41,548 --> 00:52:48,211
They're characters, so within the characters that are presented within 30 Flights of Loving.

974
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:51,753
And they're also driven by the player's own knowledge of themselves and the world.

975
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:57,436
It's not possible to cleanly separate out mechanics or story or narrative.

976
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:05,988
All of these things are distinct parts of meaning making and they all contribute to the sorts of interpretive moves we can make.

977
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:09,649
And they don't need to be presented linearly.

978
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:13,711
We're accustomed to stories being told in a linear fashion because that's the way stories have always been told.

979
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:18,152
But again, in addition to being interactive, games can also be really non-linear.

980
00:53:18,172 --> 00:53:25,935
And you can put these constraints in that encourage players to search for interpretation in a wide variety of different orders or even deliver them procedurally.

981
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:29,922
But again, the goal was not to have people decipher things,

982
00:53:30,182 --> 00:53:33,485
but rather find a way towards something that satisfies either coherence or closure.

983
00:53:34,706 --> 00:53:38,329
So I said previously, a game is an engine for generating interesting situations.

984
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,511
But by the same token,

985
00:53:41,712 --> 00:53:45,075
a story is an engine for generating interesting situations.

986
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:48,838
A symphony is an engine for generating interesting situations.

987
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:52,728
A painting is an engine for generating interesting situations.

988
00:53:52,748 --> 00:53:58,090
There's a wide variety of different ways to produce these sorts of play.

989
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:03,513
As game designers, we have a unique ability with the sort of tools we have, the interactive

990
00:54:03,593 --> 00:54:07,895
tools, the ways we can have things evolve procedurally to deliver these sorts of things,

991
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:14,478
but it's similar in many ways to what is done with other forms of art.

992
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,073
So if you're interested about more of this sort of thinking,

993
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:22,016
I have 300 pages of it in a book called The Aesthetic of Play.

994
00:54:22,976 --> 00:54:24,337
It's coming out in about two weeks.

995
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:27,799
And this talk is drawn almost entirely

996
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,841
from stuff I've talked about here.

997
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:32,221
And if you just want to talk about it,

998
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:36,624
I would love to have interlocutors on Twitter,

999
00:54:36,804 --> 00:54:37,865

1000
00:54:37,985 --> 00:54:40,346
Or if you want to send me an email, this is my email address.

1001
00:54:42,047 --> 00:54:43,828
And I think they have like five minutes.

1002
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:57,621
Hi.

1003
00:54:58,422 --> 00:55:01,205
I was wondering if you've considered the selection,

1004
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:04,789
or more specifically, the rejection of opportunities

1005
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:09,595
to take action as its own kind of potent decision in gameplay

1006
00:55:09,855 --> 00:55:12,238
with its own affirmations, if you could comment on that.

1007
00:55:12,596 --> 00:55:20,983
Oh yeah, so the question is if rejecting a call to action is its own type of gameplay, and I think absolutely.

1008
00:55:21,003 --> 00:55:29,771
I think some of the most interesting play experiences are when people refuse to play games the way that they're maybe intended to be played.

1009
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:31,713
I think there's the opportunity for...

1010
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:35,028
a lot of meaning-making in situations where you say,

1011
00:55:35,148 --> 00:55:39,734
oh, I reject the framework of play that is being given to me

1012
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:40,555
by the game designer.

1013
00:55:40,815 --> 00:55:41,816
I'm going to find my own fun with this,

1014
00:55:41,836 --> 00:55:43,478
and I'm going to do something that's entirely different.

1015
00:55:43,498 --> 00:55:47,744
I think that's a really powerful way to play.

1016
00:55:48,024 --> 00:55:50,647
And I think people who either break games or refuse

1017
00:55:50,687 --> 00:55:51,588
to engage with games.

1018
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:55,156
or doing something really interesting. I even have my own personal example.

1019
00:55:55,837 --> 00:55:59,602
In Shadow of the Colossus, I refused to finish Shadow of the Colossus,

1020
00:55:59,642 --> 00:56:03,667
even though I really loved it, because I didn't want to be the sort of person

1021
00:56:03,707 --> 00:56:05,909
who was going to kill the colossi.

1022
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:08,801
I don't like being this guy.

1023
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:13,563
And so it was almost like this sort of little moment

1024
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:14,363
of protest.

1025
00:56:14,563 --> 00:56:16,564
But also, it felt like that was a really significant move

1026
00:56:16,584 --> 00:56:16,864
to make.

1027
00:56:17,004 --> 00:56:17,464
It felt like that.

1028
00:56:18,024 --> 00:56:21,485
For me, the not finishing Shadow of the Colossus

1029
00:56:21,986 --> 00:56:24,766
was more important than whatever fun it was giving me.

1030
00:56:25,146 --> 00:56:25,327
Thanks.

1031
00:56:26,797 --> 00:56:34,645
Hi. You talked about the elements that you find in the game when you're trying to elicit

1032
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:40,791
interpretative play and you talk about adding every element that's going to shift your

1033
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:45,956
interpretation. And you mentioned, for example in PT, those points where you have a

1034
00:56:46,076 --> 00:56:47,818
concentration of information.

1035
00:56:49,715 --> 00:56:51,935
Is there, like, what is the balance?

1036
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:55,136
Because clearly if you look at the Raster,

1037
00:56:55,617 --> 00:56:58,638
or you look at even everybody who's gone to the Rapture,

1038
00:56:58,658 --> 00:57:01,418
if you have even done just a screenshot,

1039
00:57:01,899 --> 00:57:04,119
there is necessarily something,

1040
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:06,640
a way to design those spaces

1041
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,841
so that you have those elements there that allow,

1042
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:12,842
so there's necessarily,

1043
00:57:13,882 --> 00:57:16,903
or you think there would be some kind of balance to strike?

1044
00:57:17,654 --> 00:57:29,462
and some kind of also taste in choosing how you place ingredients that allow for interpretation

1045
00:57:29,522 --> 00:57:38,668
and that have this conflicting, allow for this conflicting and some search for satisfactory interpretation.

1046
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:44,852
I'm supposed to repeat that question, but I don't think I can, so I'm just going to answer it. I think it's the best I can.

1047
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:52,651
I think one of the tricky things about designing play spaces like this is that you have to make a lot more assumptions about the player.

1048
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:59,073
Because so much of what's happening is based off of people's own feelings and prior knowledge of things.

1049
00:57:59,653 --> 00:58:06,395
And so I think that there are very clear things we can do mechanically as designers to draw people towards areas of interest.

1050
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:09,236
So like in The Shuffler, When He's Gone, or The Rapture,

1051
00:58:10,036 --> 00:58:14,357
if you're walking through a field and there is a barn with a big open door,

1052
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:16,576
you're probably going to go over and look in the barn.

1053
00:58:16,616 --> 00:58:17,616
And if you go over and look in the barn,

1054
00:58:17,636 --> 00:58:20,578
you'll probably find something that's an interesting beat.

1055
00:58:21,238 --> 00:58:24,159
I think that there's a real art towards finding ways

1056
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:28,381
to seduce people into gathering the information they

1057
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,041
might need.

1058
00:58:29,421 --> 00:58:31,422
But at the same time, you want to always,

1059
00:58:31,722 --> 00:58:32,942
part of what makes it interesting

1060
00:58:33,062 --> 00:58:34,443
in an interactive space like this

1061
00:58:34,483 --> 00:58:36,224
is that you can create situations

1062
00:58:36,264 --> 00:58:37,404
where people might miss stuff.

1063
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:40,905
And the fact that you might get part of the story

1064
00:58:40,965 --> 00:58:42,126
or part of the interpretation.

1065
00:58:43,179 --> 00:58:45,500
That's actually part of the gameplay in this,

1066
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:48,582
that you may be working with fragmentary information.

1067
00:58:49,002 --> 00:58:51,123
And if it's designed properly, the ambiguity itself

1068
00:58:51,804 --> 00:58:55,165
produced by that helps lead to an interesting exploratory

1069
00:58:55,546 --> 00:58:55,986
experience.

1070
00:58:58,887 --> 00:59:00,168
So I'm pretty sure the only reason,

1071
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:03,190
I'm pretty sure anticipatory play and interpretive play

1072
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:05,651
are the only reason I've ever played video games,

1073
00:59:06,371 --> 00:59:08,092
now that you articulate it like that.

1074
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:16,186
And I'm wondering, especially in the case of interpretive play, the thing you were saying about meaning be the final moves on the interpretive board.

1075
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:22,951
That strikes me as very accurate, and I'm wondering in the case of

1076
00:59:24,452 --> 00:59:30,777
serious games, activist games, games that kind of purport to address serious topics in complex ways.

1077
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:37,623
We need those games, of course, but a lot of them are very focused on like message transmission, and I'm wondering

1078
00:59:38,552 --> 00:59:42,957
How do you bring this concept of interpretive meaning

1079
00:59:43,017 --> 00:59:44,399
and really giving the player the freedom

1080
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:48,803
to kind of arrive at their own conclusion to that space?

1081
00:59:48,883 --> 00:59:51,766
Or do you feel like that's especially

1082
00:59:51,806 --> 00:59:53,028
hard for political reasons?

1083
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:54,249
Or is it impossible?

1084
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,112
I think that, I mean.

1085
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:03,399
We're all human beings and we all, most of us, occupy very similar interpretive communities.

1086
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:13,628
And there's a fair amount of literary theory on the side of how do we actually communicate with each other.

1087
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:20,374
And I think the answer is that if you try to explicitly tell somebody what you want them to hear,

1088
01:00:20,414 --> 01:00:22,956
you try to have a really explicit message, then...

1089
01:00:24,176 --> 01:00:28,140
it's going to feel very didactic and very sort of like on the nose.

1090
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,821
It's going to feel like it's really being hammered home

1091
01:00:30,201 --> 01:00:32,804
and kind of like it's being forced on you.

1092
01:00:33,284 --> 01:00:35,026
But I think because we sort of know,

1093
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:37,167
if we know our audience well

1094
01:00:37,227 --> 01:00:39,189
and we have a sense of how they're going to respond,

1095
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:43,293
I mean, I have a sense of the sort of interpretive moves people will make,

1096
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:45,395
even if I can't know exactly what they will make.

1097
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:52,939
So if I put queues out that allow them to sort of find their own way into something that is likely,

1098
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:57,622
then I think we can transmit something that's kind of close to what we intend

1099
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:00,304
without having to deliver it directly.

1100
01:01:00,384 --> 01:01:03,246
And again, the example I'll use is Journey.

1101
01:01:03,787 --> 01:01:11,769
I mean, Journey really creates this strong sense of that fellowship and combined struggle

1102
01:01:11,789 --> 01:01:16,130
is important, but it never actually says that to you at any point.

1103
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:19,290
It just encourages you to live your way through it, and when you live your way through it,

1104
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:20,571
that kind of lingers with you.

1105
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:29,733
And so I think it's possible to do this because we have similarities between us and we can

1106
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,953
anticipate the way players are likely to...

1107
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:37,817
what interpretive moves they're likely to make by making assumptions about what their background is.

1108
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:40,979
And this is... I didn't intend for this to be a diversity talk,

1109
01:01:40,999 --> 01:01:44,021
but this is one reason why it's really important to have diversity in games,

1110
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:45,922
because it's very easy...

1111
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:49,521
if you come from a very narrow community, if you're one sort of person,

1112
01:01:49,561 --> 01:01:52,885
to assume that your assumptions about how interpretation is going to happen

1113
01:01:53,225 --> 01:01:54,586
are going to be the same for everybody.

1114
01:01:54,926 --> 01:01:57,409
And it's really useful to have people who have very different voices

1115
01:01:57,449 --> 01:01:59,431
and very different backgrounds because what that does

1116
01:01:59,771 --> 01:02:04,636
is it gives a range of possible ways that this interpretive play can play out

1117
01:02:04,956 --> 01:02:09,000
and gives you a sense of what is possible with the sort of situations you're setting up.

1118
01:02:12,835 --> 01:02:17,897
Hi. A lot of the stuff you're talking about, actually, I couldn't help thinking constantly

1119
01:02:17,937 --> 01:02:25,059
about the film Primer. I don't know if everyone here has seen that, but that film leads to,

1120
01:02:25,299 --> 01:02:30,580
for me in any case, re-watching it many, many times and trying to piece together and looking

1121
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:35,321
on online forums and trying to figure out what on earth is going on. And that, of course,

1122
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:40,743
has no interactivity whatsoever. So in a sense, I guess the question is, what

1123
01:02:42,075 --> 01:02:46,881
If we can create this interpretive play with a film like Prima,

1124
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:51,947
what is the point of any interactivity at all, really?

1125
01:02:54,607 --> 01:03:02,751
Well, in the first place, I agree that this sort of interpretive play exists in all mediums.

1126
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:09,234
And I think that'sâ€”my point is that there are things that we can do that they can't.

1127
01:03:09,354 --> 01:03:10,915
That interaction is interesting.

1128
01:03:11,115 --> 01:03:12,416
A feeling of agency is interesting.

1129
01:03:12,436 --> 01:03:16,678
A feeling of, like, oh, I'm responsible for this, or I lived through it,

1130
01:03:16,698 --> 01:03:18,679
or I made decisions that made that happen.

1131
01:03:19,059 --> 01:03:21,880
All those things are interesting things that go into the interpretive mix.

1132
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,762
So it's not really a case of, oh, we

1133
01:03:23,782 --> 01:03:25,083
can do interpretation with everything,

1134
01:03:25,143 --> 01:03:27,565
so why go to the trouble of making a game?

1135
01:03:27,985 --> 01:03:32,609
It's more a case of saying, OK, we have a set of tools

1136
01:03:32,669 --> 01:03:34,150
that we can use.

1137
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:38,293
We can, by having interaction and giving players agency,

1138
01:03:38,794 --> 01:03:41,716
we can tell different sorts of experiences

1139
01:03:42,297 --> 01:03:44,799
than you could have with a movie.

1140
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:46,540
You can implicate people in things.

1141
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,041
You could immerse people in things.

1142
01:03:48,537 --> 01:03:50,318
There are different approaches that you can take.

1143
01:03:50,738 --> 01:03:53,059
And so it's like saying, why do we

1144
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,240
need to have movies and their ability

1145
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,421
to have cuts and close-ups?

1146
01:03:56,941 --> 01:03:58,042
Why not just have stage plays?

1147
01:03:58,242 --> 01:03:59,743
And the answer is, well, because there's

1148
01:03:59,763 --> 01:04:01,144
some things you can do with cuts and close-ups

1149
01:04:01,164 --> 01:04:02,444
that you can't get with stage plays.

1150
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:05,186
And I think that the goal for us as designers

1151
01:04:05,246 --> 01:04:11,069
is not to say, how can I make everything about interactivity,

1152
01:04:11,089 --> 01:04:13,471
but how can I use interactivity to feed

1153
01:04:13,531 --> 01:04:16,132
into interpretive play in an interesting way

1154
01:04:16,192 --> 01:04:17,213
for our own medium?

1155
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:19,979
Thanks. It was a bit of a cheeky question.

1156
01:04:20,859 --> 01:04:22,400
No, that's fine. I like cheeky questions.

1157
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,200
Oh.

1158
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:26,202
Sorry. Can we... I think Amy needs to wrap up.

1159
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:29,344
So, can we move it outside for continued discussion?

1160
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:29,944
Sure. Absolutely.
