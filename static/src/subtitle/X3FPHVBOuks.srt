1
00:00:04,548 --> 00:00:07,770
Thank you very much for coming to get journalists

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,010
to cover your game.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,252
Today we're gonna talk about exactly that,

4
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:13,373
by lessons learned from online dating,

5
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:15,034
praying in no man's sky.

6
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:17,955
Before we start off with that, three other things.

7
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:19,456
Firstly, please turn off your phones,

8
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,437
if you sit here alone.

9
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,559
Secondly, please evaluate the session after it's over.

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,320
And thirdly, thank you so much for coming.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,281
I know there's a cellular talk going on in the other room,

12
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:28,842
so I really appreciate everybody that's here.

13
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:37,791
In preparation of the talk, I did something that I think most people do when they do a presentation or public speaking, maybe you've done it as well.

14
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:41,994
You maybe Google what makes a good talk, and what you always find is a good intro.

15
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:49,539
And what people say what makes a good intro is either you have something that's really emotionally touching, maybe it's scary or really funny.

16
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:54,523
Or the other thing is you have interesting stats. And I thought why not do both? Why not start with some super scary stats?

17
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:57,817
And that is a super scary stat.

18
00:00:57,817 --> 00:01:00,039
That is the main problem why it's really hard to get

19
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,260
journalists to cover your game.

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,241
That is the number of sheer games that's

21
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,863
coming out at the moment.

22
00:01:04,863 --> 00:01:07,885
You can see it goes from 2006, where it's quite low,

23
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:12,069
and until it goes to 2014, 15, 16, which has skyrocketed.

24
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:14,150
So last year we had over 4,000 games.

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,491
That's 11 games per day.

26
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:16,813
That's really crazy.

27
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:18,794
We don't even know where that's going.

28
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:22,157
Maybe Steam changes a bit, but maybe it keeps the trend up,

29
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:23,938
and next year could look a bit like that.

30
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:26,939
Or it could go even worse, maybe it goes like that, who knows?

31
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,221
Anyway, there's loads of games coming out,

32
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,143
and that's only Steam.

33
00:01:30,143 --> 00:01:32,665
You also have consoles, you have mobile games, and so on.

34
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:35,268
So you see, that is a big problem,

35
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:37,351
just the sheer volume of games coming out.

36
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:39,173
But there's also another very big problem,

37
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:41,816
the second problem, .Lightning League of the Hooked yet.

38
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:43,578
There's even more super scary stats.

39
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:45,918
And that's related to that.

40
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:48,480
That is the landing page of Eurogamer,

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,901
on the day when No Man's Sky launched.

42
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,562
So Eurogamer, one of the most biggest

43
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:53,184
influential gaming websites in the world,

44
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:55,045
on the day when No Man's Sky came out.

45
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:56,787
And what we see in red here,

46
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:59,369
is all the articles that were about No Man's Sky on the day.

47
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:07,776
Which means if you're not No Man's Sky, you can fight about those two little spots on the landing page with a few other hundred games.

48
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:14,281
And of course, that doesn't mean Eurogamer is evil. They're not getting paid loads of money by Sony to do that.

49
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:19,245
They simply write articles that their readers want to read, and on that day there was No Man's Sky.

50
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,337
on a bigger scale and that is the scariest step.

51
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:25,279
We looked at the media coverage at ICO,

52
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,201
we developed different tools and one of the tools

53
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:30,024
basically measures the gaming media landscape.

54
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,487
So it tracks articles from 10,000s of websites

55
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:33,708
across the US and Europe.

56
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,272
And that's the articles output of all of them per month.

57
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:38,774
And you can see there's some spikes,

58
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:39,935
like June when it free happens

59
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:41,857
or when it goes to the Christmas period.

60
00:02:42,357 --> 00:02:46,881
And what we highlight here in purple now is the coverage that the top 20 games get.

61
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:50,484
So that's your Overwatches, that's your Division, and so on.

62
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:55,389
So those games get a good chunk of the total coverage of all gaming websites.

63
00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:00,533
The other few hundred games that are released constantly have to fight over that yellow bar,

64
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,715
so it's very hard for them to get traction.

65
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:07,640
Again, because press wants to write things that the readers want to see, and that is often top 20 games.

66
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:15,821
So far for the problems, we have why it's hard to get good media coverage, but we also want to talk about how we can get good media coverage.

67
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:24,348
Before we do that, a few words about me. My name is Thomas Reisenacker. I work for Ico Partners, a PR and consultancy agency in Brighton, UK.

68
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:30,533
I've worked on a lot of different games, from very big games like League of Legends of Smite and Endless Space 2,

69
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:35,156
to more indie projects like doing the PR for IndieCade Europe, working on Omello in Europe, or Anomalous Phone.

70
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:40,803
And I also worked as a video game freelance journalist for seven years, so I also know the other side of the game,

71
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,206
what you're looking for as a journalist if you want to cover games.

72
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:50,677
But of course, the real star of this talk is not the PR side, it is the influencer and the press side.

73
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:52,659
So in preparation for the talk, I talked to...

74
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:58,342
A lot of people, journalists from very high profile websites interviewed them, sent them

75
00:03:58,342 --> 00:04:03,826
questions, were on panels with them, watched talks from other conferences they gave, talked

76
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:07,089
to a lot of peers, to a lot of other PR people, what are their experiences. So that's kind

77
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:11,953
of the source for this talk, where the information comes from. So a few famous websites that

78
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:17,338
we talked for this talk that had strong influences, for example, Waypoint, Kotaku, The Guardian,

79
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:20,320
Killscreen, Rock Paper Shotgun, and big European websites.

80
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,240
So what we're going to talk about today is three chapters.

81
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,280
First of all, we're going to talk,

82
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,581
is PR even the right thing for you?

83
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:27,501
It's not always the case.

84
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,242
PR is a great tool, but not for every game.

85
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:32,883
We're going to talk about five facts

86
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:36,904
from the media landscape, five key insights.

87
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:39,464
And then we talk, in the end, we're going to have like,

88
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:41,745
it's almost like a step-by-step guide

89
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:44,566
how you can get good media coverage.

90
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:47,907
So, first chapter, is PR even the right thing for you?

91
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:50,292
Maybe.

92
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,774
I think there are in general three communication ways

93
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:54,155
how you can reach your players

94
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:57,178
and important people you want to sell your game to.

95
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:00,241
And I would roughly categorize them into marketing,

96
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:01,642
which is everything that's paid for.

97
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,264
That's Facebook ads, that's paid YouTubers, and so on.

98
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:05,965
Everything you spend directly money on.

99
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:11,811
You have your community, where you talk directly to your players and foster a community to sell your games.

100
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:17,959
And you have PR. That is influencers, that is press, that cover your game, but you don't pay them to do so.

101
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,644
You can more or less convince them or work with them so they produce coverage for you.

102
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:26,809
And all those things are important and all those things can work great for different games.

103
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,170
I think there's not one that's better than the other.

104
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,992
So that's a disclaimer as a PR person.

105
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:34,534
I think PR is good but it's not always the solution for your game.

106
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:38,217
And I think especially with that crowded media landscape that we have today,

107
00:05:38,217 --> 00:05:40,219
it's really about finding the right mix for you.

108
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:41,880
Do you do all of those things?

109
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,800
Do you do maybe two of one?

110
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,982
Maybe you're just really good at one, might as well work.

111
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:49,561
But I think it's really important to experiment and also figure out how those things work together.

112
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:55,226
For example, marketing tends to work very well for AAA games, for casual games, copycat games.

113
00:05:55,226 --> 00:06:00,412
Not meaning it in a bad way, but if you make a match-free puzzle game, that can work well if it's well made,

114
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:05,336
but it's not going to win an innovation prize at an indie game conference.

115
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:06,778
Mobile games, for example.

116
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:09,420
tends to work well with long-running games,

117
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,261
with niche games, and with early access games,

118
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:12,922
where you build up your community.

119
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:14,443
And PR, classically, tends to work well

120
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:18,205
with classic premium games, with hardcore free-to-play games,

121
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:20,046
with critics games, and for B2B topics.

122
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,888
And today, we're going to focus on the third pillar.

123
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:26,030
We're going to focus on PR and influencers,

124
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,891
how we get coverage from them without paying them.

125
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:32,703
To do that best, I think it's good to understand

126
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,544
the media landscape, how it works in general.

127
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:36,264
And for that, we have some interesting stats

128
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,625
that we got together from our tools.

129
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,607
And the first question is, how much media coverage

130
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:43,247
is good coverage?

131
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:44,587
It's often really hard to measure

132
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:48,409
if you're doing a good job in PR, or is it enough?

133
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,609
Do you do good PR or bad PR?

134
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,730
So we looked at launch coverage of games.

135
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,991
What we did, we looked at the launch day and measured that,

136
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:57,012
and then three days before, when there's a bit of hype,

137
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:58,172
and then three days after.

138
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:04,119
So in general, a AAA game tends to get about 1,500 articles.

139
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,180
So that's your Horizon Zero Dawns.

140
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,980
That's your Divisions.

141
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,402
That's the really, really big games.

142
00:07:09,402 --> 00:07:11,563
A AAA game, a premium indie game,

143
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:14,725
tends to get around 231 articles.

144
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,927
Those are the really high-profile indie games.

145
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:24,531
So that would be a Spelunky or an Oldboy, Undertale.

146
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,152
So the really, really big names.

147
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:29,298
And what is really important there,

148
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,600
always keep your peers in mind.

149
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,842
A lot of people talk to me about,

150
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:35,264
oh, they want to have really good PR

151
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:36,965
like other indie games like No Man's Sky.

152
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:38,567
But No Man's Sky was, in terms of PR,

153
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:39,788
absolutely not an indie game.

154
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:41,589
Maybe in terms of development, but not in PR.

155
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:44,612
So we compared the coverage for launch from No Man's Sky,

156
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:47,154
we can see in the right, very high,

157
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,596
to actual indie games, Inside and Collateral Cowboy,

158
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,878
and you can see it absolutely shrinks them.

159
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,219
So always pick your peers wisely

160
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,101
when you measure if your PR is going well or not.

161
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:58,869
Secondly, we looked at who talks about which platforms,

162
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,251
especially interesting if you're working on a console title.

163
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:03,372
We looked at the coverage over the last years

164
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:05,053
from PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

165
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:08,255
and you can see that PlayStation 4 in blue in general

166
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,916
gets more coverage than the Xbox.

167
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:13,118
In fact, in general, media tends to talk

168
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,039
35% more about PlayStation games.

169
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,420
How that can help you in PR is of course that

170
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,681
if you work on both platforms,

171
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:22,123
it may be wise to always push your PlayStation version

172
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:23,604
first, mention it first, and see

173
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:28,689
that you got more traction, but because more media just had an easier time talking about

174
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:32,074
PlayStation because there are more PlayStation players, so they will get more clicks from

175
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:32,855
PlayStation readers.

176
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:37,526
We also made the same stat on the country breakdown.

177
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:40,328
If you look at other European media markets,

178
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:44,452
for example, France tends to cover PlayStation

179
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:47,194
on an average level where they talk less about Xbox

180
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,855
and less about Steam and more about Nintendo

181
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:49,656
than other markets.

182
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:52,759
Of course, that doesn't mean they talk about Xbox at all,

183
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,660
but just in general, less than other markets.

184
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:58,607
I think one of the most important graphs from today

185
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:03,689
is looking at media in terms of what is mobile games media

186
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:05,750
and what is PC and console media.

187
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,251
So the big games versus the small games.

188
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:10,292
And we looked at the launch coverage, again,

189
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,673
from a very famous mobile game from Clash Royale.

190
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:14,293
And you can see when it launches,

191
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:16,174
it gets a nice spike in news coverage.

192
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:18,095
But then we compare it to an indie game.

193
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:21,186
So we compare it to GoTimulator when it goes to the

194
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,347
Games for Gold program on Xbox.

195
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:25,288
And that's not even a strong news for them.

196
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:27,490
Gamers spit out for a while, but you can already see

197
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,411
it completely shrinks Clash Royale, it makes it very small.

198
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:32,853
But then we compare that to the launch of an actual

199
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:36,335
triple A game of Deus Ex, and suddenly you see

200
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,016
GoTimulator looks kind of small,

201
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:40,038
Clash Royale is hardly visible on the graph.

202
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:44,680
And that is not because Clash Royale did a bad PR job and got bad coverage.

203
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,791
That is simply because of the fact that there are way less mobile websites than there are console and PC websites.

204
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,836
So that's always important to keep in mind when you promote your game.

205
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:55,972
We also looked at what are the most talked about VR headsets.

206
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:58,615
And you can see in blue, the PlayStation VR

207
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:01,598
gets some really good spikes, especially when it launches.

208
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:03,861
What you can also see in general, the Oculus in red

209
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:06,704
gets more media coverage than the HTC Vive in green.

210
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:07,905
So again, similar to the consoles,

211
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:10,648
I would recommend to put the Oculus first

212
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:11,790
if you pitch games to press.

213
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:16,702
And then we looked at the key fact number five,

214
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:19,304
a really interesting phenomenon is sometimes

215
00:10:19,304 --> 00:10:21,766
you just see that news just starts spreading out of nowhere

216
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:24,008
and they get on all websites, even in countries

217
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:26,350
that you maybe not serve from a peer point of view,

218
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,851
but those news just go big.

219
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:30,394
And what we see often how that happens is

220
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,616
that certain websites cover it.

221
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:35,578
Your IGN, PC Gamer, GameSpot, Rock Paper Shotgun, Polygon.

222
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:39,198
really high profile website that have one thing in common,

223
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:41,901
they're English speaking websites.

224
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:43,944
And if two or three of those English websites

225
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,106
can promise you talk about your news,

226
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:48,168
it's gonna spread on loads of other English websites,

227
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:51,192
but it's also gonna spread in loads of other countries

228
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,753
that you're not necessarily contact directly.

229
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,535
They definitely act as an opinion leader

230
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,418
that other countries look at.

231
00:10:56,962 --> 00:10:59,524
That doesn't mean that there's no value in also doing PR

232
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:00,504
in the other countries.

233
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:02,706
You will get better coverage if you have German translating

234
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:05,548
material and you talk to German press directly.

235
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:07,950
But if you only have money to focus on one country or one

236
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,112
market, it may be advisable to go to the English media,

237
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:14,355
because if you win Dandover, you're going to see spread to

238
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:14,775
other countries.

239
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:20,439
And the third chapter, I think the chunkiest bit of the talk,

240
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:24,422
is more or less a step-by-step guide on how you get press

241
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:24,923
coverage.

242
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:27,313
in five golden rules.

243
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:30,314
So the first step is make your game Tinder ready.

244
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,694
I think it's really important.

245
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:33,955
I think we can learn loads of Tinder.

246
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:36,076
Because if you're a journalist, you

247
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:38,097
get hundreds and hundreds of email updates,

248
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,498
and you only have a few seconds to check them.

249
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:42,539
And that is very similar on Tinder.

250
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:44,019
And often, you just have that.

251
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:46,420
You have one screenshot, maybe the title of the game,

252
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,441
and then you read one sentence.

253
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,622
So for example, that's the game Collected Chunk League.

254
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:51,983
Has a screenshot here.

255
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:53,623
The text is build whatever ship you want

256
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:54,904
and battle with your friends.

257
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:54,964
OK.

258
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,323
But it could also look like that.

259
00:11:57,323 --> 00:11:58,744
There's a GIF, you see, oh, that's weird,

260
00:11:58,744 --> 00:11:59,824
there's a teddy bear, there's a hot dog,

261
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:01,505
there's some ship building going on.

262
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:02,605
That looks kind of cool.

263
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:05,346
All right, there's also fighting, okay,

264
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:07,087
and then you see the title screen.

265
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:08,707
And suddenly you know a lot about the game.

266
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,408
And then you could describe it as galactic babies

267
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:13,289
in battle-ready space toilets.

268
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:14,930
Build and battle your ships in any shape.

269
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,022
And you can see we pitched a completely same game,

270
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:21,343
just with a more creative wording

271
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:23,223
and with a little gif that shows a lot of the games.

272
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:25,104
And suddenly we understand a lot more.

273
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:26,265
We understand there's humor.

274
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:28,605
We understand you can build a lot of different ships

275
00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:31,066
with the ship creator because you can already see it.

276
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,007
And you can also see there's battle going on.

277
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:34,208
So as you can see.

278
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,805
If you manage to convey your message,

279
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:39,407
I think that's the important one,

280
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:40,968
how to get the game Tinder ready.

281
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,731
Within 10 seconds, you have a really big advantage

282
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:45,512
about a lot of other pitches.

283
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,474
When we talked about media, one of the main complaints

284
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,696
they get from developers is they get really long email

285
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:51,158
that are hard to read.

286
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:53,600
It's not that they do not want to read them,

287
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,001
but if you get 300 emails a day,

288
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:56,683
you can only read so much

289
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:58,624
before you just bleed out of your eyes.

290
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:01,086
So really make your game Tinder ready.

291
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:02,247
That's the new elevator pitch.

292
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,768
Convey your message within 10 seconds.

293
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:06,629
Really break it down to the most interesting element,

294
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:08,310
to the most interesting story.

295
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,072
And a good thing, said it before, that helps,

296
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:11,933
is that it gives.

297
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:15,445
big fan of GIFs, they can convey a lot of messages.

298
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:17,346
That's just some examples of games we've worked on.

299
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:20,988
And it can be great to show some quotes from press

300
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:23,609
if the game is maybe visually not as exciting.

301
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:26,671
They can be great to show some cut scenes and gameplay.

302
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:29,852
In the right corner down, just show a gameplay element.

303
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,154
Or in the left upper corner, that

304
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:34,255
is a narrative game, a normal lost phone.

305
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:38,311
And it doesn't look as visually exciting if you just see a screenshot.

306
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:41,534
However, in a little GIF you can always make like a film trailer

307
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:44,096
that conveys the concept and the theme of the game.

308
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:46,138
So the journalist is already intrigued and prepared.

309
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:48,920
And then when they look at the screenshots and see it's a text adventure,

310
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,464
they're okay with it because they already know what the game is about.

311
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,205
If you don't know how to make GIFs, no worries.

312
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:55,286
We did put a guide together.

313
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:58,809
You can find it at iCoopartners.com slash GIFguide, where we just...

314
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:02,707
describe how we make GIFs, how we make them from trailers,

315
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:04,308
how, which tools we use to record them,

316
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:07,992
what are the upload sizes, what are good ways to use them.

317
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:11,035
And we really like to use them as well in social media

318
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:11,695
as in emails.

319
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:15,099
It's a really good tool.

320
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:17,401
If it's not too big to just put it directly into an email.

321
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:21,294
And the second thing we can learn from Tinder is,

322
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,834
it is way better also in terms of PR

323
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:26,056
to be amazing for a few people than okay for many.

324
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:28,157
It's one of the most common mistakes, I think.

325
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:30,138
I saw a statistic on that, on online dating,

326
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:32,280
that people, if they start online dating,

327
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,601
they put their profile online and they say,

328
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:37,142
I like good films, I like my friends,

329
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,823
and I like music, but who doesn't?

330
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:40,485
That's not the point.

331
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:43,348
You want to be exciting for a small group that actually wants

332
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:45,890
to talk to you instead of being OK for a lot of people.

333
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,973
They maybe like your game on Facebook,

334
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:50,075
but they're not actually going to buy it in the end.

335
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:51,496
So if you go back to the Tinder analogy,

336
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:54,620
it is probably way more successful

337
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,523
that if you're a cosplayer, your Tinder profile first thing

338
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,944
shows a full-on cosplay outfit.

339
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:01,366
90% of people will not like that.

340
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:02,447
They will be maybe confused.

341
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:04,868
They don't like cosplaying or whatever.

342
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,089
But the 10% that are actually going to like it,

343
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:07,169
they will want to talk to you.

344
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:08,090
They will want to meet up to you.

345
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,951
And it's the same for games.

346
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:14,714
If you pinpoint what your game is and be brutal with it,

347
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,255
it might be that you scare off a lot of people.

348
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:18,456
But those people that actually care about your game

349
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:21,398
and will spend money on it and want to read articles about it,

350
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:24,279
they need to have that information why your game is

351
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,580
good and why it is important for them.

352
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,308
Which leads us to the second problem,

353
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:30,788
I call it the division problem.

354
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:32,548
That is actually a thing that happened,

355
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,709
that I pitched a cool indie game to a journalist I know,

356
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:36,469
and he said, I love that game,

357
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,830
but no way I'm gonna cover it,

358
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,030
because today I have to write

359
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,930
four other news about the division first,

360
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,111
because that's what gets them a lot of clicks.

361
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,452
So one way to work with that is,

362
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:49,672
I think that's the most important learning from today,

363
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,793
always try to think in headlines.

364
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,913
If you pitch games, if you pitch stories,

365
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:56,274
try to think if they could make a good headline

366
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:57,334
you could use.

367
00:15:57,694 --> 00:16:00,776
Because if you make a good headline that brings clicks,

368
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,077
that brings the journalist money.

369
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:02,838
They live off that.

370
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:03,678
That is their business.

371
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:04,879
That's important for them.

372
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,081
So you help them helping promote your game.

373
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:10,183
Of course, that doesn't mean that all journalists

374
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:12,104
just are money-grabbing evil people.

375
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,445
Of course not.

376
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:14,946
It is a bit a driver for them,

377
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:17,607
but there are also other ways how you get game coverage.

378
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:19,689
Often it's personal reasons, personal relationships.

379
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:21,850
Maybe there's a marketing spending behind it.

380
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,472
But in general, it is a very good approach

381
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:26,273
to think if your pitch makes a good headline.

382
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:29,754
One game that was so good at it is No Man's Sky.

383
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:33,196
I know it's very controversial, but just in terms of PR,

384
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:36,478
No Man's Sky campaign was an absolute masterpiece.

385
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:39,079
And it's just in the way how they talked about certain things.

386
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,121
You would maybe pitch No Man's Sky in that way.

387
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:43,822
You would say, No Man's Sky.

388
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,311
we have a new trailer and it shows a massive universe.

389
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:48,592
That's an okay pitch, but how they pitched it,

390
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,273
they said, a No Man's Sky trailer invites you

391
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:54,214
to explore the game's 18 quintillion planets.

392
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,054
I don't know what 18 quintillion planets are,

393
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:58,235
I think nobody knows, they can't even comprehend it,

394
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:00,996
but it doesn't matter, because it sounds very exciting,

395
00:17:00,996 --> 00:17:03,677
it sounds very scientific, and you wanna see a video

396
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:05,858
with 18 quintillion planets.

397
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,620
So they're pretty much talking about the same thing here,

398
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,960
but just in a very exciting way.

399
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,761
Another thing they did,

400
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:15,339
They have a very good painting mental energy

401
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,401
that get your imagination going.

402
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:20,243
For example, a classic pitch would be,

403
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:22,105
we have a new video of No Man's Sky

404
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,987
and it shows off the procedural generation

405
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:25,488
where everything is unique.

406
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:27,310
Okay, I get that.

407
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,211
Well, okay.

408
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:32,072
But what they pitched was, No Man's Sky is a game

409
00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:34,872
in which even the developers haven't seen all of the game.

410
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:37,093
And suddenly, that sounds very exciting.

411
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:39,833
You just start to imagine that someone goes up in the morning,

412
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,034
plays the game, and suddenly there's a planet

413
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:43,714
with a new, weird AI that takes over planets,

414
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:45,815
and he discovers things for the first time

415
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,615
and posts it on the internet, and it's really cool.

416
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:50,336
So, again, by describing the same game

417
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,616
with interesting language that you can use in headlines,

418
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:56,237
they managed to convey a message in a really good way.

419
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,263
What follows now are a few other examples of how you can think in headlines.

420
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:06,888
Of course there's no easy template how you can make up those headlines, but I think the

421
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:12,093
easiest way is to get some inspiration, see what other people are doing and just get in

422
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:14,555
the mindset of how you can craft good headlines.

423
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:19,559
A question I get asked a lot is if you pitch a game, is it okay to say it is like Minecraft

424
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,422
in space or it is like GTA in the desert?

425
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:24,263
Is it okay to refer to other games?

426
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:26,257
I would say yes sometimes.

427
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,579
It really depends on your point of reference.

428
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:31,262
For example, we have a game here called Northgard,

429
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:35,726
and that we just recently had a very successful PR campaign

430
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:36,146
with.

431
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:40,270
The reason Northgard worked well is it

432
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,472
looks very similar to a game called Banished,

433
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:44,954
and it also looks similar to a game called Settlers, which

434
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:46,175
was massive in Germany.

435
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,297
But over the last couple of years,

436
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:50,059
there were not a lot of games like that,

437
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,420
meaning there's a high demand for it.

438
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,903
In that case, suddenly referring to another game

439
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:56,766
becomes very interesting for press.

440
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:58,769
Because if you pitch that game and say,

441
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:01,573
our new Settlers-like game, Northgard, is announced,

442
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,498
they go like, okay, if you write that in the headline,

443
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:07,402
all the Settlers fans are gonna click on it.

444
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:10,024
The name of my game is not even that important.

445
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,626
They just want to serve the settler's fund.

446
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:13,487
So if you know you have a good point of reference

447
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,508
where there's a high demand, I think

448
00:19:14,508 --> 00:19:17,511
there's no harm in referencing to other games,

449
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:20,513
or even referencing to other art forms.

450
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:23,416
We have a game here called Memoranda.

451
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:27,481
And there was, it's a point and click adventure,

452
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:29,542
it looks pretty, but by no means it would get

453
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:32,084
the massive amount of coverage it would usually get.

454
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:35,226
But the way they pitched it is that it is a game

455
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:37,347
that is inspired by the Japanese author,

456
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:39,769
Hakuri Murakami, who is very famous

457
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,291
and who has massive following, and also big overlap,

458
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,472
I think, in the gaming community,

459
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:46,473
that like his books, but there's just no games

460
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:47,494
in that direction.

461
00:19:47,494 --> 00:19:49,595
So again, you have a very strong lead.

462
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:51,477
And what you see in the headline, which is also interesting,

463
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:52,477
it's taken from Kotaku,

464
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:53,998
it doesn't even mention the game title.

465
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,939
Because it's not important to the readers,

466
00:19:55,939 --> 00:19:57,520
because the game title is not known.

467
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,462
But it's important that it's inspired by that author.

468
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:01,963
And by the way, all those examples that I'm showing,

469
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,604
they all got a massive amount of coverage.

470
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:06,085
All those pictures and headlines,

471
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:07,546
they got all the big media on their board.

472
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:10,688
There's also another way to get headlines,

473
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:11,909
which is a bit more experimental.

474
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:15,171
It's called guerrilla marketing.

475
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:17,072
We see an example here from PolyGods.

476
00:20:17,072 --> 00:20:19,734
And it's a cool game.

477
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:21,855
By no means I want to offend the developers,

478
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:23,636
but it's not the prettiest game on Earth.

479
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,385
and they get massive coverage and how they did it,

480
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:29,486
they said the game is free for everyone

481
00:20:29,486 --> 00:20:32,247
that gets a certain really hard Binding of Isaac achievement.

482
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:34,949
And again, why is that great for media?

483
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:38,370
Because suddenly they can have a headline

484
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,471
that first of all mentions Binding of Isaac,

485
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:42,072
that would get them loads of clicks,

486
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:45,313
and it mentions free stuff as well for certain players.

487
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:47,214
You wanna find out if you get that game for free.

488
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:48,014
That is a great headline.

489
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,595
That's why they got so much coverage

490
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:50,835
and so much traction with that.

491
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,340
If you're interested in more insights on guerrilla marketing and how that works,

492
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,501
there's also a talk for me on the GDC world from last year.

493
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:58,762
And I know what you could say now, you could say like,

494
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:03,583
oh, there were good examples, but it's really hard to come up with headlines

495
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,363
because everything is taken already.

496
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:09,124
But it's just not true. There's always new angles, there's always new ways you can go.

497
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:11,184
So just some further examples, for example,

498
00:21:11,184 --> 00:21:14,365
Hyper Light Drifter was promoted with being that

499
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,826
every second in the game looks like a stunning wallpaper.

500
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:19,687
That sounds more interesting than saying it's a pretty game.

501
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:24,718
Oh boy, obviously had a really good hook because it was in development for over 10 years.

502
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,260
That was definitely a great headline.

503
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,762
It's very relatable with a dev focus.

504
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:32,988
Or a really hard game called Devil Daggers, where there's an achievement that only one

505
00:21:32,988 --> 00:21:34,470
person on earth unlocked.

506
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,256
Again, it's not so much about the game as for a really interesting story that got plenty

507
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,738
of coverage in loads of countries.

508
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,734
So now that we figured out our cool Tinder pitch

509
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:45,935
that we can convey in 10 seconds,

510
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:49,820
and we figured out the good headline we want to get,

511
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,522
now we want to all put that into an email

512
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:53,003
that actually press wants to read.

513
00:21:53,003 --> 00:21:54,105
That's a really important thing.

514
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,027
I think the next slide is quite hands-on,

515
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:57,509
and I hope you can use it.

516
00:21:58,175 --> 00:21:59,935
That's how we write emails at the moment.

517
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:01,256
It's called the perfect email pitch.

518
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:02,496
That's our AIDA template.

519
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,537
And the way it works is, first, we

520
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:06,577
want to get the attention of the journalists.

521
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:08,858
So we write a really catchy subject line.

522
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:11,619
In that case, it's not just we don't say the game title.

523
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:14,500
We say, it is a mystery game dealing with homophobia

524
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,500
and self-discovery.

525
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,061
And suddenly, you already have a good hook there.

526
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:20,361
You already have an interesting story there, instead of just

527
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:22,922
saying that game is launched today.

528
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:27,876
Now that we got the interest of the journalist,

529
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:29,297
the attention of the journalist,

530
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:30,197
we wanna get the interest.

531
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:33,478
So we write a really short game text or pitch text,

532
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:36,799
and that's just really straightforward, two or three lines.

533
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,840
What is the story we wanna tell you today,

534
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,440
and why you should care about it?

535
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,521
And with that, we put it directly to the email,

536
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:46,342
a nice little animated GIF, and the trailer underneath,

537
00:22:46,342 --> 00:22:48,523
or if you don't have a GIF, at least a nice screenshot

538
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:49,683
that maybe links to a trailer,

539
00:22:49,683 --> 00:22:50,764
or at least a nice screenshot,

540
00:22:50,764 --> 00:22:51,984
some kind of visual element.

541
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,955
And after that, there's a little text

542
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:57,675
that we had to do for that game.

543
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:59,696
Sometimes there's extra information you have to put in.

544
00:22:59,696 --> 00:23:01,557
If you can avoid it, skip the next paragraph,

545
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:02,698
and you go to desire.

546
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:05,800
Because now that we got the journalist,

547
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,821
we got his attention, we also got his interest,

548
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,082
now he wants to find out more

549
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:12,223
because he's up for covering that story.

550
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:14,844
So here's the desire to get more information.

551
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:15,664
That's exactly what we give him.

552
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:17,746
What we give him here is a link

553
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,266
to our press page with the assets.

554
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:21,547
And then we say, if you want more information,

555
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:23,207
here's a link to the blog post, here's

556
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:26,128
a link to an online press release, or here's a link,

557
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:28,529
or you can find the full press release copied below.

558
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:32,670
And the last step is not always something you have to do.

559
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,310
But if it's just a simple news story

560
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,291
you want to get coverage on, the email is over pretty much then.

561
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,892
But sometimes you have something you

562
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:40,172
want to have from the journalist,

563
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:41,933
and that would be the call to action.

564
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:42,313
That could be.

565
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:45,756
If you're interested in the interview, let me know.

566
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:48,240
If you want a review key, just let me know.

567
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,747
Do you want to maybe meet at GDC or a certain event?

568
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:52,428
Just let me know.

569
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:54,968
So that's pretty much the way you write emails now.

570
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:57,230
And as you can see, it's very, very short

571
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,892
and compressed information.

572
00:23:58,892 --> 00:24:00,453
It's hard to craft one of those emails,

573
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:02,315
but once you have it, they tend to get

574
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,137
quite high open and return rates.

575
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:06,979
And of course, as it always is for email pitches,

576
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,361
if you can make it personal, even better,

577
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,303
if you know the journalist or what they're talking about,

578
00:24:11,303 --> 00:24:13,765
add a little sentence in the beginning and say,

579
00:24:13,765 --> 00:24:16,167
hi Kate, I really think you really like Story Driven Game,

580
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,308
maybe you wanna check that out.

581
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:18,550
And then you've run out that pitch.

582
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:22,177
So now that we got our perfect pitch email,

583
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:23,638
we also want to pitch it to the right people

584
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:26,200
because there's just no point in sending it to people that

585
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,541
don't care about it.

586
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,963
And I can't stress this enough.

587
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:32,105
I know it is really tempting to just get a massive email list

588
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:34,047
and just spread your news out there.

589
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:36,029
But it's definitely worth doing your homework,

590
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:38,551
losing a lot of Google and a lot of Twitter

591
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:41,434
to just find out which journalist at which outlet

592
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:42,975
cares about your game and will cover it.

593
00:24:44,174 --> 00:24:47,075
If you've done that, if you find out the journalist that should

594
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:49,976
be interested in your game, and you can't find the email

595
00:24:49,976 --> 00:24:53,758
address, Email Hunter is a very good website that often helps

596
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,599
to find email addresses, and you can use it for free.

597
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,360
It's also very good to look into freelancers.

598
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,781
Sometimes you find them because they just

599
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:02,902
write certain articles on different websites.

600
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:05,163
And they are often, especially for smaller games,

601
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:09,364
easier to pitch to because they work in a different way

602
00:25:09,364 --> 00:25:11,645
and are often more focused on feature pieces

603
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:13,126
than normal websites are.

604
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:17,470
Another code you can pray to, which is very helpful,

605
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,931
is official blogs, especially if you work on consoles.

606
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:21,891
The PlayStation blog and the Xbox Wire

607
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:23,652
are really great outlets.

608
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:24,973
They will often feature your game.

609
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,293
But the thing is, often they don't ask you.

610
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,634
So you have to go to them and say, we have a release date.

611
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:30,715
Can we announce it on your blog?

612
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:32,675
And they will write you a blog post.

613
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:34,436
And those things get great coverage.

614
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:35,736
So definitely, if you do a console game,

615
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:36,697
try to get in touch with them.

616
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:39,738
A lot of the rules we just discussed today

617
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,278
also work with streamers and YouTubers.

618
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:44,852
However, there are a few things that work quite differently.

619
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:46,233
First of all, they don't care so much

620
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:47,453
about having a good headline.

621
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:50,175
Instead, you want to convince them why that game is really

622
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:51,375
fun to watch.

623
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,336
So you have to think your headline in that direction.

624
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:55,778
And again, it really helps to show an animated GIF that just

625
00:25:55,778 --> 00:25:59,019
shows why the game is funny and why his or her viewers will

626
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:00,180
probably care about it.

627
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,441
Also, it's like a press kit.

628
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:06,303
You want to give the streamers and the YouTubers something

629
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:07,703
that's easy to work with.

630
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:10,702
So you want to do some things like have a little space

631
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,383
for your window in your game where you can put

632
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:14,104
your little selfie window in.

633
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:16,326
You want to have a window mode and be able to switch off

634
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,547
usernames so that it's easier for them to record

635
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:20,168
and stream your games.

636
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:22,189
Also again, in the direction of guerrilla marketing,

637
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:25,011
some companies are really good at creating little special

638
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:27,572
features that makes it more fun to stream your game.

639
00:26:27,572 --> 00:26:29,513
For example, we had Darkest Dungeon, which is famous

640
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:30,694
for having a really good narrator,

641
00:26:30,694 --> 00:26:32,695
and they made little voice pads that says.

642
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:35,149
new subscriber and things like that.

643
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:36,230
Makes it more fun to watch.

644
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,313
So we have cluster truck where the developers

645
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:40,996
implemented something that if they saw a big streamer,

646
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:42,758
they could just press a few buttons

647
00:26:42,758 --> 00:26:44,920
and suddenly they could control something in their game

648
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,003
and suddenly it would say speed run mode baby

649
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:48,905
and the game goes up in 50 times in speed

650
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,627
and the streamer doesn't know what's going on

651
00:26:50,627 --> 00:26:52,029
and chat goes crazy.

652
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,491
Really good stuff if you make the game more fun to watch.

653
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:58,724
And the last rule is make something pool worthy.

654
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:02,567
Because all we talked about now is how we craft a really nice pitch and how we get it

655
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:05,909
to the journalists or the influencers that we want to reach.

656
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:10,513
But in the end of the day, you have to make something that's pool worthy because otherwise

657
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:11,253
it doesn't stick.

658
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:15,556
What I mean by that is there is push PR where you push something out with marketing muscle

659
00:27:15,556 --> 00:27:17,478
where there's maybe not a lot of demand.

660
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:19,657
And the opposite of that is pool PR.

661
00:27:19,657 --> 00:27:21,738
We have something really, really great,

662
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:23,898
and people just want to hear all of it,

663
00:27:23,898 --> 00:27:25,519
but you don't actually do something for it.

664
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,740
You don't do a crazy PR stunt.

665
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,901
You just wait, you tweet a bit, and they just come for it.

666
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:33,062
And of course, pool PR is the ideal scenario

667
00:27:33,062 --> 00:27:35,203
because it's easier from a PR point of view,

668
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:37,504
but to do that, you have to make a masterpiece game,

669
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:39,045
and that's not always easy.

670
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:41,806
So I think the way to go and play it safe

671
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:45,689
is you try to make something as pull-worthy as you can,

672
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:47,350
but then you also push it.

673
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,030
Because otherwise, again, you run the risk

674
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,691
that people just don't find it, even if it's really great.

675
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:53,211
So make something pull-worthy and push it.

676
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:57,813
The two last slides from today is just a summary.

677
00:27:57,813 --> 00:27:59,893
First of all, we talked about the five key facts

678
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:02,394
from the media landscape, which is English media

679
00:28:02,394 --> 00:28:04,794
is opinion leader, PlayStation gets

680
00:28:04,794 --> 00:28:05,815
more coverage than Xbox.

681
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:11,151
The average launch numbers, the coverage you can get for AAA

682
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:13,212
game is around 1,500, and for AAA indie game, 230.

683
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:17,433
Mobile media is way smaller than the media

684
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:18,834
of PC and console games.

685
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:22,756
And if you look at VR headsets, Oculus

686
00:28:22,756 --> 00:28:25,237
gets more coverage than the HTC Vive.

687
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,958
And the five golden rules of how you get the games covered.

688
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,339
Make your game Tinder ready, which

689
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:31,680
means the 10 second rules.

690
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,561
Also use GIFs whenever you can.

691
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:36,201
Try to get loves, not likes.

692
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:39,887
Think in headlines, like a lot of headlines

693
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:42,129
and good headlines.

694
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:46,472
Use the AIDA pitch email template that we discussed before.

695
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:50,775
Really make the effort and find out the gods

696
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:52,336
you're praying to because there's no point

697
00:28:52,336 --> 00:28:54,298
in trying to sell some things to people

698
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:56,299
they just don't want or can't use.

699
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:00,322
And the last point is try to make something

700
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,303
pool-worthy and then push it out.

701
00:29:01,303 --> 00:29:03,445
Thanks a lot for listening,

702
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:04,886
and I will be in the wrap-up room

703
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:05,887
and after if you have questions.
