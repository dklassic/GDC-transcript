1
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:11,800
Survive Thursday night, only one more day to go.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,081
Okay, so I'm Hugh Monaghan.

3
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:17,145
I am the co-founder and designer at Stellar Jockeys.

4
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:20,988
My brother Jack is the other co-founder.

5
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:27,915
He ran a design blog called Design Reboot for a while

6
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:29,416
and worked on some other projects.

7
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:34,666
Brigador and star jockeys have the prestigious.

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,527
A quality of being the first thing that I've really worked on in the games

9
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:45,269
industry. So take all that in mind when we go through this. Before we really get

10
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:50,771
started. Couple things you know cell phones you guys know the drill.

11
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:53,512
Also I think Chris Charla he was my advisor on this and you know I've only

12
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:58,293
shipped one game he is around for a little bit longer than that to give

13
00:00:58,293 --> 00:00:59,173
some good context.

14
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:06,439
So yeah, so this is all systems know learning from the doomed launch of Brigador, or as

15
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,782
I've been calling it, just how I cocked up our launch.

16
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:11,362
Not a big deal.

17
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:17,366
Okay, so what did I mean by doomed?

18
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:20,108
What's this overall thesis for this talk?

19
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:25,063
The 1.0 launch was a failure before it happened.

20
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:29,425
I didn't know it, but a myriad of factors

21
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:34,187
went into basically preventing us

22
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:37,188
from ever getting any kind of real momentum with the game.

23
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:40,230
So the real question though is,

24
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,131
was it doomed as in nothing I could do about it

25
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:46,553
or doomed as in all my fault?

26
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:46,893
Yeah.

27
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:55,411
And it turns out that's something that you need a lot of time away from it to really get the context you need.

28
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:59,693
So yes, I'm sure anyone who can, you know,

29
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:01,894
anyone who's shipped a game can vouch that like,

30
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:05,415
that month before and after is, you know,

31
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:07,136
everything's kind of a blur, you don't really,

32
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:09,917
nothing really makes sense.

33
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:12,978
And the other thing is that when things don't go well,

34
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:18,420
your immediate instinct is to look to the other, right?

35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,702
So, okay, this project didn't go so hot, who screwed me?

36
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:23,122
And...

37
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:30,513
Thankfully I kind of just let that sit for a bit and now we're 9 months out

38
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:33,395
from that original launch so I've got a little bit more context and I think a

39
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:37,998
little bit of a cooler head to be able to talk about this stuff.

40
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:44,823
So before we really get into it though we need the context for the launch for

41
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:49,527
the game the studio just everything so we're for full-time devs between 2011

42
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:50,568
and 2016. Mostly full-time.

43
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:52,903
early years were kind of off and on.

44
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:57,028
This was the first commercial game for 3 4ths of us.

45
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:59,670
Like I said, my brother had done some contract work

46
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,136
and had worked on Darkest of Days at 8 Monkey.

47
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:06,097
But for the rest of us,

48
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:08,079
we were freshly minted game developers.

49
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,441
This project was 100% self-funded.

50
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:16,006
And so, I mean, specifically, I mean, we took no outside money.

51
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:17,908
We did not work with a publisher.

52
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:23,754
And because we were, you know, fresh in the industry,

53
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:25,896
we also had almost no connections at all.

54
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,573
So we also scratched both the engine.

55
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:33,374
This is something we took a lot of flak for,

56
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:36,236
a lot of armchair generals in gaming forums.

57
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:41,680
And the thing that I wanted to point out there is.

58
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:47,238
It's important to remember the context for this.

59
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:51,543
In 2010, 2011, the landscape for licensed game engines

60
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:53,485
was very different than it is now.

61
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:57,949
Unity was not quite what it is,

62
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:02,273
and Unreal was also extraordinarily more expensive.

63
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:04,215
And the other thing, too, is that

64
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:09,640
Because we didn't have full funding for this project,

65
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,183
by necessity it was a passion project.

66
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:19,926
For me personally, that was getting to be a designer

67
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,408
and putting all my bad ideas into a game.

68
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:25,809
And for the programmers,

69
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:29,771
that was being able to make their own engine.

70
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:35,090
Unlike me, Harry and Dale, both of the wonderful programmers

71
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,832
on the project, had much better offers ready to go for them.

72
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:42,693
And they chose instead to work with my brother and I

73
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:45,515
on this project.

74
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:47,375
And so you need to be able to bring something

75
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,216
to the table when you're asking someone

76
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:52,037
to sacrifice a very, very healthy wage on the West Coast

77
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:56,099
and permanent sunshine with near poverty wage

78
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:59,200
and living with me for three years.

79
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:08,814
So the goals on the project, one was to make a unique game

80
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:12,617
with a high skill ceiling.

81
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:13,618
I should qualify that.

82
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,314
So Brigador was a ridiculously ambitious project,

83
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:23,718
especially given our means and experience at the time.

84
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:26,140
Much of that was driven by a communal desire of the team

85
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,901
members to make something distinct.

86
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:31,965
If we're going to go through these tremendous pains

87
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,827
of developing a game, then it should

88
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:37,990
be one that sort of bore our distinct imprint.

89
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:42,173
Something that hadn't been done before, at least in some respects,

90
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:45,176
and which respected player time.

91
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:48,498
One of the things we talked about a lot was the Doom Rule,

92
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:52,581
which is that you get into a game, you spam Enter,

93
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:57,065
and within one or two seconds, you should be in combat playing the game.

94
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,247
If you boot up Brigador, that is absolutely true.

95
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:05,558
And it also kind of pervades the overall mindset with the game

96
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:08,459
is that there's only downtime if you want it.

97
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:11,600
There's nothing worse for me than having

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,962
these sort of designer-mandated wait periods.

99
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,463
I mean, it's understandable in the case

100
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:24,044
where it's a disguised loading screen.

101
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:25,704
But if it's not necessary to actually,

102
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:29,165
you know, a mechanical component to the game,

103
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:31,826
I prefer to avoid that.

104
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,118
And regarding the high skill ceiling,

105
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:37,401
part of that is just having a game that's reactive

106
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,643
to the player in some component.

107
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:44,728
Like if we wanted to be able to reward players

108
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:48,652
who were willing to put in the time and the effort

109
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:52,655
on a game to truly learn all the mechanics.

110
00:06:52,655 --> 00:06:53,796
And I think we accomplished that.

111
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:57,299
And it was also relative to one of the programmers,

112
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:58,921
Dale's an avid Counter-Strike player.

113
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,764
And so that kind of mentality for precision play

114
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:07,747
is something that I think continually crept into our design.

115
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:11,670
The second goal was to make enough money to do it again.

116
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,192
That's fairly self-explanatory.

117
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:16,014
I mean, it's nice if you break even.

118
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:17,855
Great if you can fund another project.

119
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:22,299
The third goal was to keep the team together after ship.

120
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,831
One of the unfortunate realities of game development is that

121
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:30,313
oftentimes a team doesn't really just until the,

122
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:33,334
you know, getting towards the end of a project.

123
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:37,175
And then, you know, you ship a game and then things happen,

124
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:40,376
studios close, people move on.

125
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,817
And so our hope was that this was the first step

126
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:46,939
in a much longer journey together as a studio.

127
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:48,819
And the fourth goal was to build a reputation

128
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,120
as a high quality developer.

129
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:55,498
The best way to sum that up is just,

130
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:58,601
I mean, you wanna be known for being the guy

131
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:00,082
who makes really good stuff.

132
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:08,750
Pretty straightforward there.

133
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,391
Anyway, sorry.

134
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:14,716
So as far as actually whether we hit that or not,

135
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:18,740
excuse me, didn't need to drop that note.

136
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:23,610
Okay, so did we make any unique game?

137
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,831
I think we did.

138
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,212
I'm not gonna give any wiggle room

139
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:32,175
on some of the distinctive components.

140
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:35,676
I'm very proud of that we managed to capture

141
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:39,178
that granularity of aiming that I mentioned

142
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:40,099
with Counter-Strike.

143
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,280
The goal was to make a first-person shooter,

144
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,402
to bring the precision that you get in those kinds of games,

145
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:48,003
but into an isometric environment.

146
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:52,900
It took a year of prototyping to get an AIM scheme

147
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,783
that really worked there, and there were all other sorts

148
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:57,805
of wonderful problems that we had to deal with,

149
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,807
but we got there.

150
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:04,731
We did not make enough money to do it again,

151
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:06,513
at least not yet.

152
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:11,218
So the little asterisk there is that

153
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,558
Even though Brigadier's launch wasn't so hot,

154
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:19,219
we've actually been trending up in day-to-day sales.

155
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:23,881
Now, as much as I'd like to attribute

156
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:27,542
that to my own personal charisma and running my mouth

157
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:28,622
continually on the internet, I think

158
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:31,123
there's also a component of the launch itself just

159
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:32,203
being that bad.

160
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:36,785
That maybe it was just you needed

161
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,825
to get the ball rolling a little bit more.

162
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,643
We did not keep the team together after the ship.

163
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:47,145
It was a very amicable parting.

164
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:52,389
There's nothing, there's no like terror story here.

165
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:54,170
It was just, we finished the game,

166
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,632
we didn't have money to do it again.

167
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:59,594
And we had all gotten largely

168
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:02,076
what we needed to out of the project.

169
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:03,256
So I'm very happy with just,

170
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:05,798
even though we didn't stay together

171
00:10:05,798 --> 00:10:07,800
and that goal wasn't itself met, that.

172
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:16,571
this was a stepping stone for all four of us to actually move forward in the industry.

173
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:20,192
And as for building a reputation as a high quality developer, I'm not,

174
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:23,194
I'm not the person who can really make that judgment.

175
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:29,496
And the other thing too, is that I don't think you can make those kinds of qualitative assessments

176
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,777
until at least your second or third project. I mean,

177
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:37,070
You know, everyone's heard of like One Hit Wonders.

178
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,254
That's mostly referred to, I mean, you mostly hear that

179
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:42,396
in the context of music or film,

180
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:44,117
but I think it can certainly apply to games as well.

181
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:49,502
And then just a quick run through on end results.

182
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:49,683
So.

183
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:53,273
Like I said, Brigador shipped June of 2016

184
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:56,938
after a nice stint in early access

185
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:59,040
starting in October of 2015.

186
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,525
We had review scores ranging between four out of 10

187
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:03,606
and 9.5 out of 10.

188
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,909
Obviously I prefer one of those.

189
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:13,194
Our final Metacritic score was exactly 70%.

190
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:13,794
It was 78.

191
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:18,881
And then our very last review was that 40%.

192
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:20,663
So that one stung.

193
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,173
We actually are overwhelmingly positive

194
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:27,014
on our Steam user reviews.

195
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:28,075
That's been a nice vindication.

196
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:31,018
And actually, we just, even though we've been

197
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:33,880
at that percentage level for a while,

198
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,602
we just hit the minimum review threshold

199
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:39,665
a week before I flew out for GDC.

200
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,107
So that's a freshly minted title.

201
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:47,512
Now, nine months out from release

202
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:49,713
for a game that took five years to make,

203
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,115
we are standing at 15,000 units sold.

204
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:56,263
I'll let you come to your own conclusions there.

205
00:11:56,263 --> 00:12:00,526
But we did ship a game, a two and a half hour soundtrack,

206
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:02,087
a book, and an audio book,

207
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,869
all as part of our first project.

208
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:09,232
And then the double asterisk there is that

209
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:12,435
a lot of those negative reviews we received

210
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:14,076
were relating to controls,

211
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:17,498
something I will more fully address later in the talk.

212
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:27,002
When we went into ship, that whole thing I mentioned

213
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:30,004
about high-quality developer and wanting

214
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:33,988
to kind of make a splash, I definitely

215
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:38,371
think I bit off more than I could reasonably have chewed.

216
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:44,136
And you end up paying the price for that in different ways.

217
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:45,917
But at the end of the day, we still

218
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,899
managed to produce all of these things.

219
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:55,154
So the game itself. I've been doing a lot of prefacing without actually talking

220
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:55,934
about the project.

221
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:58,818
So what is Brigador?

222
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:05,558
It turns out that's actually a very difficult question to answer.

223
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:10,462
We were plagued for the entire two-year stretch running into release,

224
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:13,304
trying to articulate it in a pithy fashion.

225
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:18,288
So the best I could do at the time was just figuring out what it wasn't.

226
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,250
So it's not a twin-stick shooter.

227
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,773
And this is actually something that if I had taken that to heart much earlier in the development cycle,

228
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:29,397
I might have better been able to market it and anticipate.

229
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,379
some of the issues we had going into launch.

230
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:36,401
But it looks like a twin-stick shooter,

231
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:37,782
but it very much is not.

232
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,263
It's a very mechanically dense game.

233
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:42,585
It's slower than a twin-stick.

234
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:47,688
And they're just distinct elements.

235
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:48,869
It's not Tiberian Center and RTS.

236
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,751
I mainly bring that one up because we

237
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,992
use sprite-based graphics.

238
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:59,301
both out of a stylistic decision and out of necessity.

239
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:03,524
The entire game art was produced by a single artist,

240
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:06,446
and that includes over about two and a half years of art,

241
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:11,250
130 units, and over 1,000 environment assets.

242
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,993
If we were to do that in a 3D pipeline,

243
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:21,678
we would have been able to build a fraction of that.

244
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,496
We utilized a kit bashing style to produce all of the in-game assets since

245
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:34,083
we didn't have to worry about apology or the you know any of the qualities of the

246
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,367
3 render itself for the 3 model itself all that mattered was the render.

247
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:47,286
We were, and by we I mean Jack, was able to produce these assets at a diabolical speed.

248
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:52,909
By the end of the art pipeline, by the end of the process of art assets being produced,

249
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:58,553
he was able to create a finished vehicle for the game within about six hours.

250
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:04,482
So it's not a roguelike or a roguelite.

251
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:08,285
There were certain aspects of roguelite

252
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:10,906
that we wanted to hit.

253
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:12,767
I feel like everyone who's been up on stage on GDC

254
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,528
for the last couple years mentioned

255
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:16,309
Spelunky in some capacity.

256
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,990
It's a very important game that kind of tickles

257
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,652
the back of everyone's brain since it came out.

258
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,798
Our only real touch, touching on to that genre,

259
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:33,720
was that we had an entire segment of the game

260
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,163
that was built around these sort of semi-procedural runs

261
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:40,124
where you set up your equipment, you go,

262
00:15:40,124 --> 00:15:41,945
and then either see how far you can get

263
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:44,706
or go until you die.

264
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:48,328
So the only thing we could figure out

265
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:50,389
was that it's kind of like Desert Strike,

266
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:52,410
kind of like Crusader, no remorse.

267
00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:00,363
But it turns out it's a bit of a problem when your major touchstones came out 22 and 25

268
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:05,106
years ago, respectively.

269
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:10,830
A significant portion of our player base weren't even alive when the games that we would refer

270
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,953
them to were made.

271
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:15,613
And that's just...

272
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:20,015
It's a similar problem as anyone who's making a truly new game.

273
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:23,978
I don't know if any of you caught the For Honor

274
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:26,860
talk about its development.

275
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,622
But that is a game that is truly unique.

276
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,003
And so when you don't have any of those kinds of natural

277
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:36,186
touchstones to draw from, Brigador is like Dark Souls

278
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:37,187
plus tanks.

279
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:41,095
We didn't have the easy shorthands to pull from.

280
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:45,577
And so the best we found was,

281
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:48,259
and I'm just giving a sampling of what we did get.

282
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,800
PC Gamer Review said,

283
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,682
it's a colorful and chaotic isometric 2D mech shooter

284
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:55,663
set in a world steeped in 80s futurism.

285
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:58,825
It's a lovely description, but it's also mouthful.

286
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:02,347
And if you just walk up to someone and say that,

287
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:04,328
they're gonna kinda give you a little squint.

288
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:10,638
We have a pretty active Something Awful thread,

289
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:14,945
the forum, and someone described it as a tank western.

290
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:17,309
That has a nice romantic quality to it,

291
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:20,534
but again, it's not super useful.

292
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,731
And the one I ended up using the most in talking with press was it's a Kool-Aid

293
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:33,553
man simulator. That was because I lacking the ability to have distinct

294
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:39,336
game touchstones. I started to move in just the evoking the feeling of the

295
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:43,617
game and something we had start saying internally was that you need to feel

296
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:46,899
like a Kool-Aid man at least when you're in the you know the big giant

297
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,020
building sized tanks and Max.

298
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,220
So

299
00:17:53,139 --> 00:18:00,333
For a little context, I don't know how familiar everyone is with the game, but I'm gonna play

300
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,375
our early access trailer.

301
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,239
So this was when we launched in October of 2015.

302
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:49,888
So.

303
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:53,051
So that's not supposed to happen.

304
00:18:53,051 --> 00:19:00,438
So the interesting thing about that trailer is that.

305
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:09,546
It's a very good trailer for a different game.

306
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:10,507
When we went into it.

307
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:14,492
original trailer, which I'll actually play later,

308
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:18,193
was very slow, it was very,

309
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:22,015
it was more concerned with atmosphere.

310
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:25,456
And our assumption was that going into our actual launch,

311
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,576
we wanted to show gameplay,

312
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:28,777
show that it's like the bombastic quality of,

313
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:30,838
hey, in Brickdoor you can blow everything up.

314
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:34,559
The whole shtick of our game, the whole premise,

315
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,200
is that the entire game world is destructible.

316
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,801
And we figured we would highlight that.

317
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:43,848
through these high-intensity quick cuts,

318
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:47,290
things blowing up, people like explosions.

319
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,473
But the problem is that it showed the game

320
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:52,833
as a twin-stick shooter.

321
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,115
And the urban destruction elements,

322
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:57,616
I mean, it kind of got highlighted

323
00:19:57,616 --> 00:19:58,917
at the end of that trailer,

324
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:02,238
but it was still more of a peripheral element

325
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:05,720
to just, oh, this is like a high-intensity loud thing

326
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,902
where the music never changes, apparently.

327
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:15,156
This trailer got about a third of the views of our original launch trailer.

328
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:17,677
Now part of that I think is just natural diminishing returns.

329
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:21,858
Once people know a thing exists, it's harder to build up excitement

330
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:24,198
on subsequent trailers and press releases.

331
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:26,659
But it also, it just wasn't as effective.

332
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,999
We weren't able to draw people in.

333
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:34,560
OK, so the one way that we did manage to draw people in

334
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,581
was through me running my mouth on the internet.

335
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:39,641
So.

336
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:44,640
Back in February,

337
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,522
so this is prior to release,

338
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:50,284
February of last year, excuse me,

339
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:54,206
we had a poster on our Steam thread

340
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:57,048
who was very insistent that

341
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,509
Brigadier should cost $15 and not $20,

342
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:00,551
which is fine.

343
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,353
I mean, I don't agree with you,

344
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:06,275
but you're welcome to post your opinions.

345
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:09,617
The last straw came when...

346
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:16,033
He posted back again on it, genuinely confused and insulted

347
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:19,974
that I hadn't taken his advice.

348
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:23,095
And he was actually like genuinely sad and perplexed,

349
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:24,456
like why didn't you take my advice?

350
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:26,256
I could have helped you.

351
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:32,539
So my initial response to that was 2 in the morning,

352
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:36,380
two or three beers in, and just a long list of, uh, you know.

353
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,273
And because I had a good English teacher in high school,

354
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:46,958
I decided to do a second draft, sat on it for a bit,

355
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,843
and then realized that oftentimes the best way

356
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,266
to reach people is through humor.

357
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:54,728
So I rewrote it just as like, OK.

358
00:21:55,978 --> 00:21:58,340
here's all the things that you are willing to pay $20 for

359
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,342
and that people don't really balk at,

360
00:22:00,342 --> 00:22:02,004
things like a Nickelback poster,

361
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:06,208
or a case of beer, toilet plunger,

362
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,071
all these sorts of things that,

363
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:10,693
because of the context and the usage,

364
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:14,797
people have completely different valuations of those things.

365
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:17,740
So I wrote that reply, and this actually...

366
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,914
relates to a very important lesson that I learned,

367
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:26,298
which is that most virality has to be stimulated.

368
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:32,163
I mean, manufactured makes it sound

369
00:22:32,163 --> 00:22:34,325
kind of evil and dubious.

370
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:35,546
So I wrote that post,

371
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:39,269
and if I had just left it on the Steam forum,

372
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:40,910
I don't think anyone, it wouldn't have blown up.

373
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,333
And maybe some people would have shared it.

374
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:50,080
But instead, I wrote that post at very late in the morning,

375
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,343
but then I emailed it to everyone I had made contacts

376
00:22:54,343 --> 00:22:58,747
with, both as developers and as journalists,

377
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:01,469
the few that would listen to me.

378
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:04,632
Emailed, I just did a big, big blast with this.

379
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:07,274
Just say, hey, here's this thing that happened to us.

380
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:08,215
You might find it interesting.

381
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:09,696
Cool beans.

382
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:17,924
And then I woke up 8 hours later with my face plastered on some of these

383
00:23:17,924 --> 00:23:24,185
different sites and with coverage on Kotaku all these kinds of

384
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:27,466
the response to that was the coverage that we've been trying to get for the

385
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:32,427
game itself and had failed at miserably.

386
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:39,049
So then later about 2 weeks after our launch.

387
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:39,189
In a.

388
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:45,288
less considered fit of frustration.

389
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:49,049
We were two months out of launch

390
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,410
and we had yet to receive a Metacritic aggregated rating.

391
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,032
I can't remember if the minimum was four or five,

392
00:23:57,032 --> 00:24:00,492
but whatever it is, we were one below that.

393
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:01,133
And I was furious at this,

394
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:05,394
because it was like we had done our due diligence.

395
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:08,075
And it seemed like it was emblematic of

396
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:11,577
what I perceived as like, well, everything that was wrong

397
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:12,598
with the games industry.

398
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:16,761
And so I wrote this big blog post on Imgur about how,

399
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:18,983
don't become a game dev.

400
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:21,465
It's terrible.

401
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:24,307
I have terrible health problems leading into launch,

402
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:25,568
all these kinds of things.

403
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:31,613
And yeah, that got shared around.

404
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:34,236
And it ended up with me doing a follow-up interview

405
00:24:34,236 --> 00:24:36,237
with Nathan Grayson on Kotaku.

406
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:45,328
I would prefer a slightly different headline, but again, that interview with him alone ended

407
00:24:45,328 --> 00:24:46,308
up being about 85,000 views.

408
00:24:46,308 --> 00:24:52,590
The Imgur post was about 70,000 views, and that doesn't even include just sort of word

409
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,990
of mouth elements as well.

410
00:24:53,990 --> 00:25:01,392
This one's my favorite, though, because this actually was following the Price post.

411
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:12,558
I made a few waves with that soon after Jane from Firewatch, and that whole debacle about

412
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,423
people returning the game after beating it in under two hours.

413
00:25:17,423 --> 00:25:22,308
The close proximity there meant that people were kind of putting these two together.

414
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,444
But in the process of talking about it,

415
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:29,524
everyone who approached it was like, yeah,

416
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:30,405
there's Firewatch.

417
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:31,525
Everyone loves Firewatch.

418
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:34,445
And then there's, I don't know what this game is.

419
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:40,106
But apparently, there's this price component here.

420
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,887
So that wasn't so good.

421
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:47,568
But those three things tallied up

422
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:51,348
for about a third of our sales.

423
00:25:54,073 --> 00:26:00,657
And that's a very, very important thing.

424
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:05,520
So let's look at total Brigador purchases from 2015 to 2016.

425
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,242
I don't have Christmas in here.

426
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:12,904
This chart was made a few months back.

427
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:19,075
Those three posts, or rather the posts and the reactions to them.

428
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:21,537
So the $20 price post, my Imgur, DevLife post,

429
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:27,261
and then the Kotaku interview that was actually significantly after it.

430
00:26:27,261 --> 00:26:33,566
Those three elements are directly responsible for about a third of our sales.

431
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:39,529
And we've done a few more things after that and we've had more sales and everything, but

432
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:46,012
that response of press reaction to, I guess you could call it non-traditional marketing.

433
00:26:46,012 --> 00:26:48,973
I wasn't even intended as marketing, it was just me being angry on the internet.

434
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:56,475
But that was a significant role in broadening the exposure of Brigadore.

435
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:08,755
So this brings me to kind of summing up all the things that I learned over the course of this launch. My litany of doom.

436
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:15,759
So the first thing is priming. You have to teach the consumer how to react to and interact with your game.

437
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:23,303
I kind of touched on this a little bit earlier with our trailer and how it was a great trailer for a twin-stick shooter, not for Brigador.

438
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:31,958
of actually I've got some more slides for that. But yet another thing is that

439
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:36,622
you have to be you have to start doing that before they play it. If a player is

440
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:42,368
in your menu or you know just booting up the first level of your game. And they

441
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:46,733
don't have to know exactly what the game is but they need to know to a degree

442
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,375
what to expect or how to approach it.

443
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:56,949
This, I mean, for anyone who's not actually familiar

444
00:27:56,949 --> 00:28:00,231
with the game itself, this is a test that we did

445
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:03,272
for what proper full destruction in the game

446
00:28:03,272 --> 00:28:04,412
could look like.

447
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:08,734
And this is the kind of thing that we should have focused

448
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:10,255
on a lot more.

449
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:14,337
We had a pretty good success sharing GIFs of the game,

450
00:28:14,337 --> 00:28:18,278
I mean, exactly this kind of thing.

451
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:23,080
But the problem was that we didn't convey to the player

452
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:29,203
anything more significant than shoot stuff, blow stuff up.

453
00:28:29,203 --> 00:28:34,268
And what happens is that there's kind of an embedded message

454
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:39,253
in that kind of ethos, which is that you are

455
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:43,717
super powerful going in and that it's more,

456
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:46,320
it's more of that empowerment fantasy.

457
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,962
And as a result, when you subvert that,

458
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,842
you know a player can get killed by walking into a gas station which we

459
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:58,102
thought was hilarious early Cypher was hilarious. I think it gave one least one

460
00:28:58,102 --> 00:28:59,303
of the programmers an aneurysm.

461
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:08,284
That's that getting killed by a gas station when you're cool mercenary in a

462
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:15,266
giant Mac is like the least empowering thing that can happen in the game.

463
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:15,886
And.

464
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:19,484
That was part of the whole messaging.

465
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:22,827
And we didn't...

466
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,270
Players came into the game like they were a bull in a china shop

467
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:32,718
as opposed to something more like a matador

468
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:37,443
where you're actually trying to avoid and corral this much more powerful force.

469
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,981
So this was our very first trailer.

470
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:48,162
This is February 2014, right before I attended my second GDC.

471
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:48,922
Oh, no, no, no, no.

472
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:50,442
Let's actually play that.

473
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:51,223
OK, here we go.

474
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:18,601
Like and Subscribe

475
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:23,201
Yeah, so that was before we learned how to encode trailers.

476
00:31:23,201 --> 00:31:26,242
And also, there were some things a little embarrassing there.

477
00:31:26,242 --> 00:31:29,643
Also, it turns out, don't name your game

478
00:31:29,643 --> 00:31:33,744
before you do copyright checks.

479
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:38,810
and IP searches and also search engine optimization.

480
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:43,433
Because matador turns out kind of a common word

481
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:46,935
both in general use and in business.

482
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:49,096
Doing a cursory Google search for matador,

483
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:55,039
you come up with matador beef jerky, matador condoms.

484
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,220
And if you look, okay, well let's refine a little bit.

485
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,102
Matador trailer, ha ha.

486
00:31:59,102 --> 00:31:59,882
Pierce Brosnan movie.

487
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:05,137
So having to pivot on that didn't exactly help us,

488
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:08,900
but that's not really, it's not nearly as important,

489
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,422
I think, as a lot of these other elements.

490
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,460
So regarding this whole priming thing,

491
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,581
let's give me the next slide.

492
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:21,062
Okay, so I'm only gonna briefly talk about Bioshock Infinite

493
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:25,183
specifically because the messaging for that game

494
00:32:25,183 --> 00:32:28,204
was almost entirely based around Elizabeth,

495
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:31,005
around storytelling and how like when you play this game,

496
00:32:31,005 --> 00:32:32,926
you're gonna have this great,

497
00:32:32,926 --> 00:32:35,166
like it's gonna be a great story and like a great,

498
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,547
you're gonna be emotionally involved.

499
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:37,907
And.

500
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:42,294
very little of it was actually focused directly on it's a shooter.

501
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,177
Even though it's a shooter.

502
00:32:45,177 --> 00:32:53,504
And I think because of that focus, well first of all it primes people for being focused

503
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,548
on the things that they did well in like the, I mean not that they did things poorly, but

504
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:00,270
like the storytelling elements.

505
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:07,990
They put all these energies into those elements of the game,

506
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,254
and they set up their audience and their critics as well

507
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:13,196
to look at those things.

508
00:33:13,196 --> 00:33:15,638
They put the spotlight on them, which I think is also

509
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:18,902
why when the cover featured Booker.

510
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:28,826
I think that's part of the reason for that backlash is because their entire marketing

511
00:33:28,826 --> 00:33:36,271
campaign leading up to that was putting all the focus away from the traditional shooter

512
00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:45,097
setup and as a result those players who were already part of that message, there was a

513
00:33:45,097 --> 00:33:47,378
bit of a dissonance there in that messaging.

514
00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:55,578
Alien Isolation, I think, is just a great example of a game where you had this coherence

515
00:33:55,578 --> 00:34:02,843
across what the game was, how it was marketed, how it was presented at trade shows, and on

516
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:10,388
top of that, they were having to overcome the challenge of the reputation of previous

517
00:34:10,388 --> 00:34:16,572
games, both from a qualitative standpoint and from a genre standpoint.

518
00:34:16,572 --> 00:34:17,813
This was a proper horror game.

519
00:34:19,937 --> 00:34:24,140
Tim Keenan's Duskers, I think, is actually,

520
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:29,142
given similar challenges that we faced for the players,

521
00:34:29,142 --> 00:34:30,884
this is how you do it correctly,

522
00:34:30,884 --> 00:34:35,726
which I wish I could have figured that out about a year ago.

523
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:39,428
But with Duskers, and he actually mentioned this

524
00:34:39,428 --> 00:34:42,350
in his talk, originally they had a mouse interface

525
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,992
on the menu, and he said that it wasn't until they,

526
00:34:45,992 --> 00:34:47,013
when you enter the game,

527
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,831
from the get-go, there's no mouse input,

528
00:34:50,831 --> 00:34:54,372
and everything is keyboard only,

529
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:56,493
that they stopped getting complaints

530
00:34:56,493 --> 00:34:59,615
or having issues with players,

531
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:01,036
not only just trying to use the mouse,

532
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:03,016
but even having a problem

533
00:35:03,016 --> 00:35:06,678
with that direct keyboard interface.

534
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:08,319
Also,

535
00:35:10,213 --> 00:35:12,373
it looks like a game you use a keyboard for.

536
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:16,354
And there's kind of like an intangible quality to that,

537
00:35:16,354 --> 00:35:19,515
but there's the console commands.

538
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:22,316
And his overall just presentation of the game

539
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:26,357
was much more in line with the way

540
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:30,178
that players ended up playing it.

541
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:36,580
I think the best way it can be summed up is that he.

542
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:41,747
The trailers and the marketing for that game

543
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:49,850
much more accurately described the experience

544
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,291
of playing it rather than the physical realities of the game.

545
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,632
It's the subjective experience of that game.

546
00:35:55,632 --> 00:35:59,293
And that was a lesson that I didn't understand,

547
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:01,874
which is that we tried to be very

548
00:36:01,874 --> 00:36:03,415
literal in everything that we showed with Purgator.

549
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:05,875
It's like, we didn't have the budget for.

550
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:11,711
trailers that didn't exclusively use gameplay footage.

551
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,672
And we focused on,

552
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,755
it was also kind of like our counter-marketing thing

553
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:19,077
where it's like, everything that we're gonna show

554
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:21,498
in this game, for the trailers and everything else,

555
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:23,620
is going to be unadulterated gameplay footage.

556
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,641
Nothing's gonna be fabricated in that regard.

557
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:32,146
And while, you know, we did that,

558
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:33,867
the downside of that was that

559
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:37,789
that was ineffective marketing.

560
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:39,512
So, you know, why do it in the first place?

561
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:44,779
The last one I want to say is that Zac Tronics,

562
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:45,300
he's sort of...

563
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:52,682
a great example of taking that priming and applying it across multiple projects.

564
00:36:52,682 --> 00:36:58,665
I mean you, you know to an extent that you're getting into some serious puzzle

565
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:04,167
shit when you get a Zachtronics game. You know it's going to be different and

566
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:08,309
you know you're going to need to sit down and like have not don't let anyone

567
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:12,531
bug you for a while and just dig in.

568
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:13,392
So priming.

569
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:15,378
uh... death of the designer

570
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:16,679
what do i mean by that

571
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,140
so uh...

572
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,344
all that really matters at the end of the day is

573
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:25,988
whether players buy and enjoy your game

574
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:26,029
uh...

575
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:28,391
this determines sales and sales determine longevity

576
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:28,491
uh...

577
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:34,957
controls are a very interesting thing

578
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:39,983
So, Brigger was designed around tank controls,

579
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:45,729
where pressing W, A, S, D, or a left control stick

580
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:49,694
on a vehicle, W is forward, not up on the screen.

581
00:37:49,694 --> 00:37:52,977
So it's relative to the orientation of your vehicle.

582
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:57,337
This hasn't really been a common control scheme for a couple decades.

583
00:37:57,337 --> 00:38:03,664
Again, Desert Strike, Crusader, No Remorse, these are touchstones, are older than most

584
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:10,552
people's children and cars and even their, you know, anything of substance in their lives.

585
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:14,196
And I fail to account for the fact that.

586
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:18,125
With video games, most players going into a game,

587
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,026
it's not the first game that they've ever played.

588
00:38:20,026 --> 00:38:23,768
That's a problem that mobile developers have to deal with

589
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,509
a lot more, I think.

590
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:28,352
But generally speaking, you can usually assume that someone

591
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:31,033
has played a video game before yours.

592
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:33,935
And that means that there's a sort of legacy knowledge set

593
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:34,596
going into it.

594
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:36,937
If you made a shooter, usually someone's played a

595
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:39,619
shooter before yours.

596
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:43,442
So for us, we had this legacy skill set of people who had

597
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:44,542
played twin stick shooters.

598
00:38:45,163 --> 00:38:48,404
And I don't really know of any twin stick shooters that use tank controls.

599
00:38:48,404 --> 00:38:52,747
So we had this entire player base where they were expecting a twin stick shooter and then

600
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:58,970
not only is the game mechanically very different from a twin stick shooter, but also the control

601
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,732
schemes are like, why, why, why would you do this?

602
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:09,635
And this is a genuine case of my sort of arrogance and enforcement as a designer, because in

603
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:10,015
my mind.

604
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,502
The game was designed around a tank controls control scheme.

605
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:21,987
And I both wanted players to experience this like ideal way of playing the game.

606
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:30,772
And also, because of the limitations of adapting it to a twin-stick style control scheme,

607
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:37,026
players who tried to progress with that would eventually hit an artificial

608
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:40,027
ceiling in what they could do in the game.

609
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:44,468
And so I didn't want to ambush players with this like okay, you know, gotcha

610
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:48,429
where you put five hours in the game and now all of a sudden you have to relearn a new

611
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:51,050
control scheme in order to be able to meaningfully progress.

612
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:56,131
That's just flavor picture.

613
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:01,303
So the problem there, oh, no, I thought I had another slide there.

614
00:40:01,303 --> 00:40:10,107
Well, so to actually articulate that, the issue that comes up there is that A, most

615
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,970
players don't make it far enough to actually run into any kind of a skill ceiling.

616
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:20,332
And B, if a player isn't engaging with your game right off the bat.

617
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,492
Very few people are going to bang their head against a wall

618
00:40:24,492 --> 00:40:28,394
for 45 minutes or an hour until they start liking a game.

619
00:40:28,394 --> 00:40:31,915
Very few people can trust in a game or a developer.

620
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:35,356
You have to have some very strong external motivators

621
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:38,016
to get people to stick with something that long.

622
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:41,477
And we had all this data right in front of our noses.

623
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:43,878
We found that for most players, it took them,

624
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:46,019
most players who weren't acquainted with tank controls,

625
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:48,099
took them 45 minutes to an hour

626
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:49,440
to start to settle into the game.

627
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,105
Now, in a testing environment, you have someone who's either paid to be there or they're your

628
00:40:54,105 --> 00:40:56,067
friends, so it's like a social payment.

629
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:58,069
They're going to get beers later.

630
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:05,157
They are there, they're incentivized to stick around with the game.

631
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:06,278
And so we weren't.

632
00:41:07,737 --> 00:41:12,099
responding to the fact that for most players they would come in

633
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:15,841
not like the controls and just immediately be done with the game.

634
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:19,323
It's an instant return. We had a whole set of 0.1 hours,

635
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:23,745
returns, negative review. These controls are so dumb.

636
00:41:23,745 --> 00:41:25,226
So we did eventually pivot on that.

637
00:41:25,226 --> 00:41:29,969
Added a twin stick style control scheme. We added in controller support.

638
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:34,491
They weren't ideal control interfaces but

639
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,412
again at the end of the day if a player is having fun...

640
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:41,603
and they purchased your game that's that's the thing that's important.

641
00:41:41,603 --> 00:41:49,447
So tying into this the first like the first 60 minutes Foundation.

642
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:56,150
So the majority of your players also as the ones who fund your company will

643
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,171
never make it past the early stages of gameplay.

644
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:02,486
This varies depending on genre.

645
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:06,829
But if you look at Steam achievements,

646
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:11,631
and any kind of usage statistics for most games,

647
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:14,613
you get kind of like the hockey stick, right?

648
00:42:14,613 --> 00:42:19,496
Most people aren't actually making it that far into games.

649
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,197
So I talked with the guys at 17-bit.

650
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:25,039
They had much better data tracking than we did.

651
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:27,280
And they told us that 17% of their players

652
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,241
dropped out before completing the first level.

653
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:40,762
And then 92% of their players dropped out before completing the first dungeon, which is roughly 2 hours in.

654
00:42:40,762 --> 00:42:43,583
So you've got 92% of your players

655
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,024
never see anything more than your intro content.

656
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:49,565
Like, yeah, and that blew my mind.

657
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:53,565
I knew to an extent that you had a fall off.

658
00:42:53,565 --> 00:42:57,626
I had no idea that it was of that magnitude.

659
00:42:58,426 --> 00:43:04,069
So this screenshot's pertinent because on the left is our tutorials, or rather, the

660
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:07,570
first hour of playing a game, or of playing Brigador.

661
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,492
On the right is what the game actually looks like.

662
00:43:10,492 --> 00:43:16,295
We did this sort of virtualized, abstracted environment for the game, but because there

663
00:43:16,295 --> 00:43:19,756
was so much the player needed to learn, so much of a skill set, and also because this

664
00:43:19,756 --> 00:43:20,096
was

665
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:23,988
not the first draft on our tutorial.

666
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:26,210
And so this was something that we had

667
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,411
banked out right before launch.

668
00:43:27,411 --> 00:43:28,592
Everyone's under time pressure.

669
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:32,516
It was easier to do this abstracted environment

670
00:43:32,516 --> 00:43:34,618
and not have to set dress it.

671
00:43:34,618 --> 00:43:37,680
And also because we wanted to get the players

672
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,322
directly into the game,

673
00:43:39,322 --> 00:43:42,084
we actually ended up with a much shorter tutorial

674
00:43:42,084 --> 00:43:42,985
as opposed to.

675
00:43:44,313 --> 00:43:49,295
bridging that gap in player knowledge and skill over a much longer period of

676
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:51,196
time. And as a result,

677
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:55,978
we had a bunch of players dying in the tutorials because we were putting too

678
00:43:55,978 --> 00:43:57,919
much in there. The tutorial levels were taking too long.

679
00:43:57,919 --> 00:44:01,680
So you would die at the end of a tutorial level that took 10 minutes to play.

680
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,761
And then you'd have to start over again.

681
00:44:03,761 --> 00:44:06,902
And that is not a way that you endear yourself to your players.

682
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:11,332
So impedance.

683
00:44:11,332 --> 00:44:13,893
The more unusual, complicated, or difficult the game is,

684
00:44:13,893 --> 00:44:15,274
the stronger the incentive is required

685
00:44:15,274 --> 00:44:17,196
to get both players and reviewers to buy in.

686
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:22,599
This ties in a little bit to what I was saying earlier,

687
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,381
but if your game is different or not,

688
00:44:25,381 --> 00:44:27,342
in some way not immediately approachable,

689
00:44:27,342 --> 00:44:30,344
you have to have something to hook them in,

690
00:44:30,344 --> 00:44:35,488
either within the game itself or external to the game.

691
00:44:36,437 --> 00:44:40,541
For us, we thought that we were doing that with our aesthetics, with the music, with

692
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:48,749
the lore and everything, but A, very few people care anything about lore before they're already

693
00:44:48,749 --> 00:44:51,052
like 5 or 10 hours into a game.

694
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:58,339
So you can't use that as a pull, unless it's a sequel or something.

695
00:45:00,443 --> 00:45:05,107
We didn't have the kind of momentum

696
00:45:05,107 --> 00:45:07,750
that you get from a game like Dark Souls.

697
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,712
Which also, I mean, they did some brilliant sort of,

698
00:45:10,712 --> 00:45:12,935
I don't know how much they were directly involved in that,

699
00:45:12,935 --> 00:45:15,297
but the whole Dark Souls hard mentality,

700
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:18,460
where there was almost like a social pressure

701
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,762
to play that game and to excel at it,

702
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:22,564
because like, oh man, like did you beat Dark Souls?

703
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:28,869
You know, I did it on the naked run with no equipment or anything like that.

704
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:35,715
There was this whole momentum behind that game that helped players to stick around when

705
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:37,077
they might normally have given up.

706
00:45:39,462 --> 00:45:44,927
Tangentially related to this, this was a post that was going around on Reddit a while back,

707
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:49,390
this would have been about a year ago, which is that game developers should never ever

708
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,793
be afraid to innovate.

709
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:53,194
And it's a wonderful sentiment.

710
00:45:54,114 --> 00:46:00,439
So this screenshot is from the GameSpot October 2000 review of Alien Resurrection.

711
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:03,441
The game's control setup is its most terrifying element.

712
00:46:03,441 --> 00:46:07,685
The left analog stick moves you forward, back, and strafes right and left, while the right

713
00:46:07,685 --> 00:46:11,588
analog stick turns you and can be used to look up and down.

714
00:46:11,588 --> 00:46:15,731
You know, early advent of what is now the staple control scheme.

715
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:22,636
So my, like, asterisk for this is that when you do something different.

716
00:46:25,974 --> 00:46:31,718
Unless it is something that is immediately obvious or very easy to learn,

717
00:46:31,718 --> 00:46:35,881
that you have to, there's a price you have to pay.

718
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:41,745
You have to have those motivators to get people to adapt to that new thing.

719
00:46:41,745 --> 00:46:47,408
Otherwise, your innovation actually comes at the cost of a non-insignificant portion of your player base.

720
00:46:51,902 --> 00:46:54,403
So, press is transactional.

721
00:46:54,403 --> 00:46:57,905
Let me decode that a little bit.

722
00:46:57,905 --> 00:47:02,027
So, I worked on Brigador with this mentality

723
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,148
of, you know, field of dreams.

724
00:47:04,148 --> 00:47:05,169
If you build it, they'll come.

725
00:47:05,169 --> 00:47:09,691
It was a very naive understanding of games development,

726
00:47:09,691 --> 00:47:12,473
of just the nature of how you build hype,

727
00:47:12,473 --> 00:47:16,034
of how you build interest in a game.

728
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:16,094
So,

729
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:22,403
I think the most helpful thing for developers to keep in mind

730
00:47:22,403 --> 00:47:24,404
when they're interacting with press is,

731
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:28,987
what do you bring to the table?

732
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:33,811
Because at the end of the day, games press are doing a job,

733
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:34,831
and they have to earn money.

734
00:47:34,831 --> 00:47:37,253
There's a very interesting podcast.

735
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:41,676
Austin Walker over at Waypoint was talking with Pat Klepek.

736
00:47:41,676 --> 00:47:44,798
I think it was just right after the new year.

737
00:47:44,798 --> 00:47:46,339
But they were talking about how.

738
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,945
Austin has all kinds of things that he would love to cover.

739
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:56,113
He has these kind of passion projects or these sort of things either directly related to

740
00:47:56,113 --> 00:47:58,537
games or tangential to it that are very interesting.

741
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:06,023
But it's his responsibility to put things up on Waypoint

742
00:48:06,023 --> 00:48:08,525
that are gonna generate views.

743
00:48:08,525 --> 00:48:10,286
It's a business, he employs people,

744
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:11,727
he has those responsibilities.

745
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:15,509
And so for you as a person who's trying to get people

746
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:18,671
like Waypoint to cover your content,

747
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:21,332
the only way you can consistently do that

748
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:24,254
is if you can offer them something in return.

749
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,007
And this isn't to kind of cast this negative light on it.

750
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,772
It's just understanding that that's the way things are.

751
00:48:32,772 --> 00:48:34,936
There's no free lunch.

752
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:35,798
And so if you can...

753
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:43,264
figure out how to contextualize either what you're trying to promote or your

754
00:48:43,264 --> 00:48:47,369
game in general as an interesting thing. A really common phrase among game

755
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:50,513
developers is that you know what's what's your story what's your story as a

756
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:55,139
studio or as a developer or as a person or like give them something to latch on

757
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:56,421
to because

758
00:48:57,041 --> 00:49:01,122
What that boils down to is having a headline, having something that grabs their audience,

759
00:49:01,122 --> 00:49:07,424
because games press are having to deal with their whole own host of problems.

760
00:49:07,424 --> 00:49:12,065
You know, I'm not a games journalist, so I don't know, I'm sure there could be like a

761
00:49:12,065 --> 00:49:15,606
parallel version where I'm giving this talk about how I'm a terrible games journalist.

762
00:49:15,606 --> 00:49:21,508
But there's all kinds of things that they have to deal with, so you have to meet them

763
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:22,028
in the middle.

764
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,632
So, kind of articulation of this, I don't know if you guys have heard of Slaughtering

765
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:28,913
Grounds.

766
00:49:28,913 --> 00:49:31,374
There was this whole debacle a while back.

767
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:40,079
It was a game, it cost like one or two dollars, and Jim Sterling had a thing where he would

768
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,721
look at games that he does not think are qualitatively good.

769
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:45,982
and then he would say things about them,

770
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:49,164
and then sometimes they would say something back.

771
00:49:49,164 --> 00:49:51,445
There was this whole series of,

772
00:49:51,445 --> 00:49:53,626
oh man, there was this video that Jim Sterling,

773
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:55,948
where he like totally trash talks this dev,

774
00:49:55,948 --> 00:49:58,269
and then the dev wrote a response, trash talking back,

775
00:49:58,269 --> 00:49:59,550
and then there was a lawsuit involved,

776
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,811
and then something happened.

777
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:05,593
None of that itself is actually important.

778
00:50:05,593 --> 00:50:06,914
What's important is that it was a good story,

779
00:50:06,914 --> 00:50:08,035
so people talked about it.

780
00:50:08,035 --> 00:50:08,655
It was interesting.

781
00:50:08,655 --> 00:50:10,296
It was an easy headline.

782
00:50:12,931 --> 00:50:16,713
I'm not saying go out and pick a fight with Jim Sterling.

783
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:17,654
I mean, maybe.

784
00:50:17,654 --> 00:50:21,296
I'm sure it would be interesting.

785
00:50:21,296 --> 00:50:22,617
Don't, don't, don't do that.

786
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:24,698
Or at least don't say that I sent you.

787
00:50:28,312 --> 00:50:31,693
that I mean it brought something to the table and so

788
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:35,854
here's a game that prior to that hadn't got really any attention at all and all

789
00:50:35,854 --> 00:50:40,976
of a sudden you've got most of the major games press sites

790
00:50:40,976 --> 00:50:43,617
articulating that like, I mean like giving coverage to this thing

791
00:50:43,617 --> 00:50:48,039
uh... and then last of all the reserve tank

792
00:50:49,827 --> 00:50:52,168
The week after shipping is just as demanding,

793
00:50:52,168 --> 00:50:54,128
if not more, than the week before.

794
00:50:54,128 --> 00:50:57,129
And this starts just going into personal health stuff.

795
00:50:57,129 --> 00:51:02,770
And obviously, no one wants to take poor care of their health.

796
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:07,851
But so this was that imager post that I wrote a while back,

797
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:10,231
intentionally trying to be a little goofy

798
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:11,172
with that first picture.

799
00:51:11,172 --> 00:51:14,292
Like, oh, look at naive young cherubic developer,

800
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:16,513
then hard and grizzled veteran at the end.

801
00:51:17,944 --> 00:51:19,785
The part that I talk about in that post, though,

802
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,846
is that I gained 40 pounds over about the last eight

803
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:27,428
months of development and got into a whole slew

804
00:51:27,428 --> 00:51:30,649
of very unhealthy habits, partly just out

805
00:51:30,649 --> 00:51:35,591
of the continuing push.

806
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:38,812
We had gone five years in development

807
00:51:38,812 --> 00:51:40,913
and still hadn't shipped a game.

808
00:51:40,913 --> 00:51:45,314
So that's a very strong pressure.

809
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:45,774
But also,

810
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:49,358
You know, we talk a lot about crunch,

811
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:50,819
and it should be talked about.

812
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,020
It's an important thing to be aware of.

813
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,001
But oftentimes, it's something that

814
00:51:56,001 --> 00:52:03,703
is used as a proxy for a lack of time or a lack of money.

815
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:07,644
And at the time, for me, not knowing really

816
00:52:07,644 --> 00:52:10,405
anywhere else to go and not having the experience

817
00:52:10,405 --> 00:52:14,847
to contextualize it, that was the only thing

818
00:52:14,847 --> 00:52:15,467
I could reach for.

819
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:21,864
So yeah, some final notes that I'll just zip through real quick.

820
00:52:21,864 --> 00:52:24,365
This is just what the actual game looks like in the menu.

821
00:52:24,365 --> 00:52:29,647
We tried to do some interesting stuff with pilot-related difficulty

822
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:34,429
and making the game as modular as possible from a player choice standpoint.

823
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:36,549
So you can change your difficulty through your pilot,

824
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:39,330
through your vehicle, through the levels you play.

825
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:48,038
None of that matters if your baseline difficulty is so high already that no one's even hitting

826
00:52:48,038 --> 00:52:52,205
that low difficulty, that, you know, the minimum level of difficulty.

827
00:52:54,475 --> 00:52:58,018
And I mentioned this earlier, but yes, we ship the game as

828
00:52:58,018 --> 00:52:59,719
well as a book and an audio book.

829
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:02,481
I mean, that's insane.

830
00:53:02,481 --> 00:53:04,823
It was cool, and I'm glad we did it.

831
00:53:04,823 --> 00:53:09,867
But also, I was in the middle of trying to design levels

832
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:14,351
for the game, and then I was editing a 300-page book.

833
00:53:16,387 --> 00:53:20,350
And then also because he's a thing we like that book so much a guy in Brad

834
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:24,214
but Brad Buckmaster was sort of a technical consultant for us during the

835
00:53:24,214 --> 00:53:28,558
game for military hardware so like we would design a tank and we would ask

836
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:31,341
about it like yeah, you know that that seems kosher and like you help us write

837
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:35,565
a lot of descriptions. It was a very natural fit so we decided hey we don't

838
00:53:35,565 --> 00:53:36,205
want to write a book.

839
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:39,364
So we did, and it was great.

840
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:42,165
And we liked it so much that we're like, okay,

841
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:43,306
but no one reads video game books,

842
00:53:43,306 --> 00:53:45,727
unless you're like a big, big studio.

843
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:49,268
So it's like how do we get someone

844
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,829
to read this video game book that no one reads?

845
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:54,670
So it's like, oh, audio books are cool.

846
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,291
So we did an audio book adaptation.

847
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,392
And again, that was also a lot of time and effort.

848
00:53:59,392 --> 00:54:03,393
And another thing that had to be finished by the time we shipped.

849
00:54:03,835 --> 00:54:07,377
So the bright side of this is that we had some great reviews.

850
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:11,260
I mean even now it's still standing at a five star review on Amazon books.

851
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,341
Great feedback.

852
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:20,646
But the other thing is that this kind of tangential content it was just.

853
00:54:22,124 --> 00:54:25,546
Rather than bringing people from the outside to the game,

854
00:54:25,546 --> 00:54:27,967
I can count on two hands the number of times that happened.

855
00:54:27,967 --> 00:54:30,348
Mainly it was just people who were already

856
00:54:30,348 --> 00:54:32,510
hardcore Brigadier fans.

857
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:33,950
This was the icing on the cake for them.

858
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,692
So it was something that endeared us to our fans,

859
00:54:36,692 --> 00:54:38,153
but from a business standpoint,

860
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:39,473
it didn't do a whole lot more for us.

861
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,200
So that's the audio book.

862
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,121
And then also, we worked with Makeup and Vanity Set.

863
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:45,042
They did a killer soundtrack.

864
00:54:45,042 --> 00:54:48,383
And then on his own, he actually did,

865
00:54:48,383 --> 00:54:49,983
we helped him with the cover art for it,

866
00:54:49,983 --> 00:54:53,345
but he also did vinyl pressings of the soundtrack as well.

867
00:54:53,345 --> 00:54:55,646
So we had a lot of cool stuff.

868
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:57,666
And I'm gonna end on just,

869
00:54:57,666 --> 00:55:00,327
this was a single Steam review that we got.

870
00:55:03,188 --> 00:55:05,249
That was really cool.

871
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:07,990
And I think anyone who's a content creator,

872
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,811
when you get this kind of a strong reaction from a user

873
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,312
base, it's one of those things that

874
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:13,312
helps you weather the storm.

875
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:16,433
And also because I didn't want to make

876
00:55:16,433 --> 00:55:18,394
this sound like a really terrible, lugubrious talk.

877
00:55:18,394 --> 00:55:21,075
The final context for all this is

878
00:55:21,075 --> 00:55:25,376
that we're relaunching Brigador this coming June.

879
00:55:25,376 --> 00:55:27,377
We added localization, new content.

880
00:55:27,377 --> 00:55:29,737
I'm sanding down all those really, really rough edges.

881
00:55:29,737 --> 00:55:30,298
And like the

882
00:55:30,678 --> 00:55:34,200
the difficulty curve that used to be like a just giant plateau

883
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,502
is now going to actually be a curve.

884
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:42,305
Doing all these things that we can manage to course correct

885
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:43,906
and see where things go from there.

886
00:55:43,906 --> 00:55:54,293
So thanks very much.

887
00:55:54,293 --> 00:55:57,895
We've got time for a couple questions, so anyone?

888
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:00,734
Hi, thanks for the talk.

889
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:03,076
I bought the game, so hooray.

890
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:06,779
I had a question actually about that purchasing experience, though.

891
00:56:06,779 --> 00:56:13,004
One thing that I noticed in following Brigador and then not following it and then eventually

892
00:56:13,004 --> 00:56:18,248
buying it is that I heard about it way early before it launched, was interested because

893
00:56:18,248 --> 00:56:22,792
I played those games back in the old SNES days and was just curious, then forgot about

894
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:22,832
it.

895
00:56:24,043 --> 00:56:28,466
for quite a while and I did not even think about it again until the imager post. I actually

896
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:32,028
saw the imager post and I was like, oh, I completely forgot about that thing and went

897
00:56:32,028 --> 00:56:35,250
and bought it because I wanted to support you guys and I enjoyed that the difficulty

898
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:43,896
curve is insane. My question is, did you talk at all about the timing of when you started

899
00:56:43,896 --> 00:56:46,798
talking about the product to when you could actually launch it?

900
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:55,108
And how that impacted things because that distance of excitement when people first got into it to the point of purchase in my

901
00:56:55,108 --> 00:56:56,709
Opinion and I'm not an indie dev

902
00:56:56,709 --> 00:56:58,572
I've worked for others, you know larger studios

903
00:56:58,572 --> 00:57:04,458
But I found that to be a big problem when you talk about something for three years and never comes out everyone just fatigues and forgets

904
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:05,259
Yeah, how is that?

905
00:57:05,677 --> 00:57:08,978
changing as you thought about at all and how it absolutely so

906
00:57:08,978 --> 00:57:14,520
uh... the the shortage of that is that the to your gap to our first trailer

907
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,600
and

908
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:16,640
uh...

909
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,802
i think it's two-and-a-half yet to have your gap between our first trailer and

910
00:57:19,802 --> 00:57:20,682
our launch

911
00:57:20,682 --> 00:57:21,782
was entirely unintentional

912
00:57:21,782 --> 00:57:25,263
uh... when when we ship that first trailer like

913
00:57:25,424 --> 00:57:28,446
Oh yeah, we got like another 8-12 months of work left.

914
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:29,487
Like at the worst.

915
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:38,816
And because I did spend a lot of time looking at the distance

916
00:57:38,816 --> 00:57:41,919
between first press and shipping for a lot

917
00:57:41,919 --> 00:57:42,580
of different indie titles.

918
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,202
I don't remember them off the top of my head,

919
00:57:44,202 --> 00:57:48,205
but we looked at Hotline Miami, we looked at Bastion.

920
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:51,253
anything John Blow did.

921
00:57:51,253 --> 00:57:56,294
And what I found was that the minimum time

922
00:57:56,294 --> 00:57:58,535
was about three months prior to launch.

923
00:57:58,535 --> 00:58:00,656
And that's actually, most PR agencies that I've talked to,

924
00:58:00,656 --> 00:58:03,736
they prefer to have at least a three month window

925
00:58:03,736 --> 00:58:06,137
with which to build the hype train.

926
00:58:06,137 --> 00:58:09,798
And then the longest I found was like three years.

927
00:58:09,798 --> 00:58:12,519
But in almost every case, anything like that.

928
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:16,303
hyperannuated, like longer than a year and a half, two years.

929
00:58:16,303 --> 00:58:19,526
Those were either AAA titles, or those

930
00:58:19,526 --> 00:58:22,589
were games that were indefinitely delayed.

931
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:27,314
They're pulling a Duke Nukem Forever or whatever.

932
00:58:27,314 --> 00:58:32,579
So yeah, if I had my druthers and a proper set of experience,

933
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:35,562
I think I probably would have shot for a year or less

934
00:58:35,562 --> 00:58:37,123
between Announce and Ship.

935
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:40,040
How do you, since no one else is asking questions,

936
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,162
how do you handle that with the uncertainty

937
00:58:42,162 --> 00:58:43,924
of being an indie dev then?

938
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:46,266
You know, because you don't necessarily have a good context

939
00:58:46,266 --> 00:58:48,248
for your window, it seems like.

940
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:50,210
So what kind of advice do you have for people

941
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:52,852
that are trying to figure out how to do that

942
00:58:52,852 --> 00:58:56,275
and are trying to figure out what that year window

943
00:58:56,275 --> 00:58:58,377
could possibly be when they're not sure what that is?

944
00:58:58,377 --> 00:59:01,220
Yeah, so what I found is that,

945
00:59:02,823 --> 00:59:07,805
And this is advice that seemed to be pretty common from everyone that I've talked to with

946
00:59:07,805 --> 00:59:14,709
experience in the press is that when you're at indie scale, it is better to have as big

947
00:59:14,709 --> 00:59:21,193
of a single blast as possible than a bunch of small little announcements and things because

948
00:59:21,193 --> 00:59:22,573
there's a certain threshold you have to hit.

949
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:29,340
to get the general public or general press interested in what you have to offer.

950
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:35,484
And so if you distribute that across a broad set, there's a chance that maybe you'll get

951
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:39,206
one, maybe two times covered, but for the most part, most of that stuff is just going

952
00:59:39,206 --> 00:59:41,008
to fall under the radar.

953
00:59:41,997 --> 00:59:45,520
Early Access is obviously, I mean, it's not the right choice for everyone.

954
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,882
For us, it was, originally, Brick-It-Or-Head had no story campaign.

955
00:59:48,882 --> 00:59:53,246
It was entirely in this spelunky set of, here's the freelance mode,

956
00:59:53,246 --> 00:59:58,069
you pick your thing, you pick the mission, and then there's some procedural stuff,

957
00:59:58,069 --> 01:00:00,091
and you either win or you die, you start again.

958
01:00:00,091 --> 01:00:03,113
And when we were launched on Early Access,

959
01:00:03,113 --> 01:00:06,075
the universal response was, this is a great tech demo.

960
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:07,176
Where's the campaign?

961
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:16,987
So we entirely retooled the game to actually hit that expectation.

962
01:00:16,987 --> 01:00:19,229
Anyway, so yeah, what I would say is like,

963
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:23,134
maybe an ounce before early access, but at a small level,

964
01:00:23,134 --> 01:00:26,618
I think bundling all that together is actually maybe the right way to go.

965
01:00:26,618 --> 01:00:27,359
Thank you.

966
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:27,399
Hi.

967
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:32,121
even with a relaunch, knowing that there's only so much

968
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:34,682
you can do to change the fundamental design of the game,

969
01:00:34,682 --> 01:00:36,522
if you were to make a sequel, is there anything

970
01:00:36,522 --> 01:00:39,063
very fundamental about the game that you would do

971
01:00:39,063 --> 01:00:42,043
differently if you don't necessarily have to take on

972
01:00:42,043 --> 01:00:45,724
the baggage of the actual from the initial development?

973
01:00:45,724 --> 01:00:47,724
Yeah.

974
01:00:47,724 --> 01:00:50,765
Yeah, so this is a combination of stuff that got cut

975
01:00:50,765 --> 01:00:52,845
from the game as well as just

976
01:00:52,845 --> 01:00:56,706
things I learned about the design of the game

977
01:00:56,706 --> 01:00:57,346
as it went forward.

978
01:00:57,346 --> 01:00:57,406
So...

979
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:03,245
One thing I would do is that in the game you've got two guns,

980
01:01:03,245 --> 01:01:05,647
a broad variety of vehicles you can choose from,

981
01:01:05,647 --> 01:01:06,588
and a defensive ability.

982
01:01:06,588 --> 01:01:10,791
So every vehicle has two guns and a special ability.

983
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:12,773
And that part was OK.

984
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:15,235
The problem is that

985
01:01:17,074 --> 01:01:24,926
We had no way for the player to actively defend themselves.

986
01:01:24,926 --> 01:01:28,792
So there's sort of an assumption built into Brigador

987
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:30,295
that you're going to get shot.

988
01:01:31,073 --> 01:01:34,295
And what happened is that ultra light vehicles

989
01:01:34,295 --> 01:01:37,257
either means that you had to play super cat and mouse

990
01:01:37,257 --> 01:01:39,919
and use stealth tech all the time,

991
01:01:39,919 --> 01:01:42,381
or for the ultra vehicles,

992
01:01:42,381 --> 01:01:44,882
that we added in damage resistances,

993
01:01:44,882 --> 01:01:46,444
but also we made them slow

994
01:01:46,444 --> 01:01:50,386
because you can't have something that's both super tough,

995
01:01:50,386 --> 01:01:53,228
a lot of firepower.

996
01:01:56,433 --> 01:01:57,994
It just ends up being boring.

997
01:01:57,994 --> 01:02:00,495
So like something more active components,

998
01:02:00,495 --> 01:02:02,075
something we considered was actually having

999
01:02:02,075 --> 01:02:03,396
the shielding be a toggle.

1000
01:02:03,396 --> 01:02:06,737
That like shielding just slowly burns out as it's on.

1001
01:02:06,737 --> 01:02:08,438
So you actually have to decide

1002
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:09,919
when you're gonna have your shielding up.

1003
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:13,340
I think our whole armor mechanic didn't work all that well.

1004
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:18,062
Maybe have something akin to like a guard break

1005
01:02:18,062 --> 01:02:20,743
where it's like being able to time like flashing the shield.

1006
01:02:20,743 --> 01:02:22,904
These sort of more active components.

1007
01:02:22,904 --> 01:02:25,646
We had a lot of concerns about player attention,

1008
01:02:25,646 --> 01:02:25,906
but.

1009
01:02:26,677 --> 01:02:27,724
You know, that's a different case.

1010
01:02:27,724 --> 01:02:29,820
The other thing I would say is that we, um...

1011
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:37,202
We originally had a prototype for hand braking in A-GRAVs

1012
01:02:37,202 --> 01:02:38,683
and in tread-based vehicles.

1013
01:02:38,683 --> 01:02:42,143
So there's these tiny little motorcycle tank things.

1014
01:02:42,143 --> 01:02:46,944
And we had a prototype where you could skid around a corner.

1015
01:02:46,944 --> 01:02:50,765
It felt awesome, but there was a whole lot of stuff.

1016
01:02:50,765 --> 01:02:52,126
There was all these horrible edge cases

1017
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:54,546
that it was just going to be too much of a time commitment,

1018
01:02:54,546 --> 01:02:55,906
and we were too late in development to get that in.

1019
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:59,128
I mean, the answer is that there's a lot of,

1020
01:02:59,128 --> 01:03:01,189
I mean, the game itself, the core would be there,

1021
01:03:01,189 --> 01:03:03,590
but there's all these kinds of refinements to the formula

1022
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:06,991
that I'm, you know, I have a notebook full of them, so.

1023
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,032
Cool, thank you.
