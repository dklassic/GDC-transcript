1
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:07,830
Can everybody hear me in the back?

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,711
Ah, there we go.

3
00:00:10,112 --> 00:00:10,553
All right.

4
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:13,996
Well, thanks to all of you for coming out at 5 o'clock,

5
00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:18,821
the last session of the day, for the classic game post-mortem

6
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,283
on the Oregon Trail.

7
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:30,976
Enough of all this high-level technology stuff

8
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:34,619
that in the expo area, it just boggles the mind.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,361
We're gonna have some fun.

10
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:40,965
I'm Don Rawitsch, co-inventor of the original version

11
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:43,067
of the Oregon Trail, and I'm happy to be here

12
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,228
to tell my story.

13
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,886
First, a couple of announcements.

14
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:48,768
Turn off your cell phones.

15
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,911
And don't forget, at the end of the session,

16
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:55,312
you're going to get to fill out an evaluation form.

17
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:58,855
You are instructed to check all the boxes

18
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:02,598
on the highest number level on all the questions.

19
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:06,560
And one more announcement I was going to make.

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,663
You're all familiar with the train jam

21
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:11,544
that I've seen described.

22
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,096
People get on a train in Chicago and they have 56 hours to make some games.

23
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:21,038
We're considering that maybe next year that we have a covered wagon jam.

24
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:26,160
We put a bunch of people in covered wagons to set them out for Missouri.

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,583
And the cool part about that is they'll have no excuse about quality because they'll have

26
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:33,303
six months to get it right.

27
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:42,815
Okay, what I'm going to do here over the next hour or so is to tell you about the Oregon

28
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:49,117
Trail game, where it came from, how it got invented, who invented it, how it got into

29
00:01:49,157 --> 00:01:55,579
the schools, how it became so popular, and hopefully at the end a few suggestions that

30
00:01:55,639 --> 00:02:03,842
might be of interest to today's game developers, lessons that we've learned from the Oregon

31
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:04,442
Trail game.

32
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:08,557
And I'm hoping there will be a little time for questions

33
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:09,157
at the end.

34
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,738
We are the last session of the day,

35
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,020
so we have a little flexibility maybe

36
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,241
to extend if there are a lot of questions.

37
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:18,321
But we'll see how that goes.

38
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:21,042
So let me just ask, how many of you

39
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,943
have played the Oregon Trail?

40
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:25,144
OK.

41
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:28,126
And second question is, how many of you

42
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,607
first encountered the Oregon Trail game

43
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:32,148
when you were a kid in school?

44
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:39,197
Okay, so that's typically the pattern, that's good.

45
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,619
And I think because there probably were a few people

46
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,759
who did not raise their hand,

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,540
let's just take about two minutes

48
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,021
to review what this game is about.

49
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:54,122
It is a simulation of an important event

50
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,563
in American history.

51
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,244
As you probably know,

52
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:01,525
let's try to get that.

53
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,885
Okay, as you probably know,

54
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:15,729
okay, as we probably know,

55
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:21,072
the computer always puts up question boxes

56
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:22,132
when you don't want one.

57
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:26,034
The country, what became the United States,

58
00:03:26,094 --> 00:03:27,394
was settled on the East Coast.

59
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:28,595
People,

60
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,962
came and they populated those states, but after a while it became clear for some people

61
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:44,004
this was not where they wanted to be and explorers had pushed out across this land and determined

62
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:50,185
that there was all kinds of farming opportunities and other opportunities for the future.

63
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:59,229
and spread the word that if you want to really have a new start on life, go west, is the advice.

64
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,270
And so they did.

65
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,133
And that people started traveling to the western part of what became the US.

66
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:11,435
Excuse me.

67
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:15,457
Perhaps, where is my assistant?

68
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,398
There is a box that keeps coming up that says,

69
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:19,799
Rescue and Recovery.

70
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:28,946
And that applies to me, I can see, but shouldn't be coming up on the computer.

71
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:37,356
I may have gotten it to go away.

72
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,210
Okay, so how did they get to the West?

73
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,412
Well, the explorers had mapped out some trails

74
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:51,434
over the plains, over the mountains,

75
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:54,736
all the way to the West Coast, the Pacific Ocean,

76
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:57,018
and perhaps the best known of those trails

77
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:59,940
was the Oregon Trail, most heavily traveled

78
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,502
during the middle of the 19th century.

79
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:07,025
And how did you travel on the Oregon Trail?

80
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:11,167
You use the vehicle of choice, the covered wagon.

81
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:13,369
You put your belongings in there.

82
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,370
You got your family crammed in there.

83
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:19,673
And for the next 2,000 miles, this is how you traveled.

84
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:21,895
It was about a six-month trip.

85
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:27,139
And this is what solidified the United States

86
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:30,521
as being the land as large as it became.

87
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:34,024
And so this Western migration is seen as very

88
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:35,345
important in American history.

89
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,463
The Oregon Trail game is a simulation of this trip,

90
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:45,626
this journey, this hazardous adventure

91
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,826
that these people went on.

92
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:51,069
And it was popular on personal computers,

93
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:53,591
starting in about 1979, for about a decade and a half.

94
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:59,354
It was the highest point of popularity.

95
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:04,397
It was arguably the best known school software of that era.

96
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:10,480
And perhaps for many of you, this is the era which found you in school and traveling the

97
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,761
Oregon Trail on a computer.

98
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:18,565
However, if we're going to get to the story of where the game came from, we have to go

99
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,186
back almost a decade.

100
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:23,508
So sorry.

101
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:32,554
So we're going to go back to the 1960s and 70s when computers looked like the thing that you see up on the screen.

102
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:39,640
They were huge. They required their own rooms to be locked up and kept in.

103
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:43,723
But this is how computers started coming into our society.

104
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:45,785
And they were used in business and in research.

105
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:49,908
It was inevitable that they would come to be used in education.

106
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:55,431
And so a whole new area of endeavor and of study,

107
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:59,713
educational computing, was born at this time.

108
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:04,075
Now, most of the use of computers in education

109
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:06,877
could be found at universities at that time,

110
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:10,639
but there were some schools that had a local university

111
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,620
in town and they found a way to connect

112
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,342
to the university's computer and they started offering

113
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:18,443
to elementary and high school kids.

114
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:21,216
the opportunity to use a computer.

115
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:23,498
Some of the larger districts had enough money,

116
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:24,719
they bought their own computer.

117
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:27,541
Now this was not the computer that they used

118
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,843
to keep track of their finances,

119
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:31,985
to keep track of their student attendance,

120
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:33,426
to keep track of the bus routes.

121
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:38,030
These were computers that were specifically designated

122
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,612
as to be used for instructional purposes.

123
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,695
Now what did people back at that time

124
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,196
do with a computer in a school?

125
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:50,764
Typically, in K-12 education, the activity was to learn,

126
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:53,525
to teach kids something about programming computers.

127
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,988
And the reason that that was the main activity

128
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:00,629
is because there wasn't much else you could do at the time.

129
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,632
There were no software applications available to schools

130
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:08,174
that would allow them to do things related to math

131
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:10,495
and science and social studies and so forth.

132
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:12,696
Those applications were very scarce.

133
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:21,860
So, this brings us to the fateful year of 1971 and three young men who were attending

134
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,860
college at the time.

135
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:28,482
They were attending Carleton College, a liberal arts school in Minnesota.

136
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:34,284
Two of them, Bill Heineman and Paul Dillenberger, were math majors, and the handsome fellow

137
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:37,806
on the right had decided that he was going to be a history major.

138
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,730
As a matter of fact, the first few years we were in college together, we didn't really know each other.

139
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:50,532
But coming into our senior year in the fall of 1971, we were brought together by one thing we had in common.

140
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,553
We were all planning to become teachers.

141
00:08:54,553 --> 00:09:02,275
And because of that, we had to do certain things in our preparation during our college years.

142
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:03,895
So...

143
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,403
the kind of culminating aspect of your teacher training

144
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:13,046
when you're in college is to do your practice teaching.

145
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,089
So this is where you're assigned to a school.

146
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:19,452
You're assigned to a supervising teacher in that school,

147
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:24,717
and you get to observe how schools work, what teachers do,

148
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:29,861
and eventually get the opportunity to teach kids yourself,

149
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,383
to take over classes, to...

150
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:37,967
to do that and this was all to determine whether, essentially, whether you had the guts to stand

151
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:40,409
up in front of 30 adolescents day in and day out.

152
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:46,332
So we took advantage of a program that allowed us to do our practice teaching in the city

153
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:53,817
of Minneapolis and we got an apartment together and the three of us set out to determine what

154
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:54,818
teaching was all about.

155
00:09:56,546 --> 00:10:00,087
The Minneapolis schools was a fairly progressive district

156
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:03,728
at that time, and they had set up a computer for the district

157
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:06,528
that all the schools in the Minneapolis district

158
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:09,629
could connect to, and kids could have a chance

159
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:10,549
to use computers.

160
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,711
My two colleagues knew something about computer programming

161
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:18,011
from their college studies, given that they were in math.

162
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:23,213
I knew absolutely nothing about computers at that time.

163
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:26,053
And after we had

164
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:31,409
After we had been in our schools for a few weeks,

165
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,710
my supervising teacher notified me

166
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,531
that I was going to, in about two or three weeks ahead,

167
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:40,833
I was going to teach a unit on the westward migration.

168
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:45,588
and that I needed to prepare myself to do that.

169
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:48,669
So I thought to myself, well, now,

170
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:51,469
how am I going to put this across,

171
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,730
this historical information, in a way

172
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,050
that kids are not going to fall asleep at their desks?

173
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:59,831
And I knew that the one thing I needed to avoid

174
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:03,032
was to assign them to read all about it in their textbook,

175
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:06,793
because that's what makes kids not like history so much.

176
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:16,018
So, I thought to myself that I had read about educators who had created games for the classroom.

177
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:22,482
Not computer games because there weren't that many schools that had computer access, but

178
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:30,446
board games, paper pencil games, things that would help you understand a concept better.

179
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:33,877
So I thought, well, maybe I could do the same

180
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:35,798
for the westward migration.

181
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:42,120
I created a very large map of the Western US area.

182
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,541
I drew in the Oregon Trail.

183
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,682
I thought about that the kids maybe

184
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:52,884
were going to draw cards or roll dice.

185
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:56,625
So I was ahead of Dungeons and Dragons on this thing.

186
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:04,847
And so, you know, some way was going to determine what happened to them at each stage along,

187
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:10,388
traveling along the trail, and they'd have little wagon markers that they could move.

188
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:12,108
That was my vision.

189
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,269
So I had all this stuff spread out on the apartment living room.

190
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:21,510
One day I was just getting into figuring out how this might work, and my two colleagues

191
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,010
came home.

192
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:29,146
They asked what I was doing, and I explained to them what it was I had to teach.

193
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:33,692
And they thought, well, that was a game was a pretty innovative way to go at this.

194
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:38,919
But the thing is, that game would be a lot better on a computer.

195
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:43,476
And that was kind of the spark that got us going on this.

196
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:49,798
We had at that time two weeks to create something

197
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,059
that could be delivered on the computer

198
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,080
that was available to our schools,

199
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,341
especially my school since I was the one teaching history.

200
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:03,763
And so we set about on this task.

201
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:09,179
Well, what did it mean to put something on a computer in 1971?

202
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,142
Well, the first thing is, how do you communicate with a computer?

203
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:21,827
You use this device, a teletype, which is kind of a typewriter on steroids.

204
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,923
It's a very large and heavy machine, but it's got a keyboard, doesn't have a screen.

205
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:33,024
You see the roll of paper coming out above the keyboard.

206
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:38,126
So when you type things on the teletype, they showed up on that paper, just like, kind of

207
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:38,966
like a typewriter.

208
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:44,448
And when the computer communicated back to you, its messages also got printed out on

209
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:45,429
that roll of paper.

210
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:54,314
It didn't print very quickly and there was no screen, no graphics, no audio-visual, well,

211
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:55,275
with one exception.

212
00:13:56,315 --> 00:14:00,458
Inside the teletype was essentially a bicycle bell.

213
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:08,812
And you were told when you bought the teletype that if you put a certain string of code in

214
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:15,298
your computer program, that when the computer got there, a message would be sent that rang

215
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:21,083
that bicycle bell, thereby indicating that something significant had just happened in

216
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:21,683
your program.

217
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:27,028
That's about all we had back then to wake the kids up.

218
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:33,017
So that's the teletype, and you know what a computer looks like,

219
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:35,679
but how did you make the connection between the two?

220
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,762
And to do that, we need a modem.

221
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:42,987
Now today, I'm guessing modems are about the size

222
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:44,969
of your fingernail, but back then they

223
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:46,750
were about the size of a shoebox.

224
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:50,814
And you see on the right-hand side what

225
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:52,736
was known as an acoustic coupler.

226
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:59,499
And this is the way that you could connect the teletype

227
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,921
through a phone line to the computer.

228
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:02,761
So how did this work?

229
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:06,724
Well, you were given the phone number

230
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:10,548
that was attached to the computer in another building

231
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:13,170
that would pick up your call.

232
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:18,074
And by the way, that round thing on the phone,

233
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:20,936
that's called a dial for those not familiar.

234
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,048
So you dialed up the phone and you listened,

235
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:26,249
and you heard a high-pitched tone,

236
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:27,710
and that was the computer.

237
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,271
And then you took that handset

238
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:34,153
and you thrust it into the acoustic coupler

239
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:36,515
so it ended up like you see on the picture.

240
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:38,256
Little light came on,

241
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,777
and then the teletype started chattering.

242
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:43,258
You had made a connection to the computer.

243
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,319
You could now go.

244
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,840
So that was state-of-the-art in 1971.

245
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,161
We started working on the Oregon Trail,

246
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:57,705
and my friends had told me that we could get something done

247
00:15:57,745 --> 00:15:58,425
in two weeks.

248
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,668
I think later I determined they'd lied to my face.

249
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:08,273
However, at the end of two weeks, we had a program.

250
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:14,778
We had version 1.0 of the Oregon Trail on a mainframe computer,

251
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:17,840
and as near as we could tell, the bugs were worked out.

252
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:22,987
So it was time, it was time to try it out.

253
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:28,653
Now, I started thinking about how I was going to do this

254
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:32,897
in the classroom because even though the school had a

255
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:35,120
teletype for accessing the computer,

256
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:37,823
it only had one teletype.

257
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,933
which I reserved for a couple of weeks.

258
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:45,418
It was put in my classroom next to the phone with the coupler.

259
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,305
And then I thought, but we can't have 30 kids trying

260
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:51,567
to use this thing all at once.

261
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:54,712
So I divided them up into small groups.

262
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:58,515
And I created a rotation of activities.

263
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:00,537
So you could be playing the game,

264
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:04,920
or maybe another group would be doing a map exercise,

265
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,763
another group would be reading something about the trails

266
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:10,464
and traveling west and so on,

267
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,626
until we got through the rotation

268
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,188
and every group had had a chance to play the game.

269
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:19,791
So we started doing this,

270
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:22,913
and how did the students react?

271
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,420
They were mesmerized.

272
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,482
With only one teletype in the school,

273
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:31,483
I don't think many kids in the school

274
00:17:31,563 --> 00:17:33,184
had actually had a chance to use it.

275
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:35,486
So this was the first thing they'd ever seen,

276
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:39,188
the first computer activity that they had ever witnessed.

277
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,790
And I think the other thing that probably

278
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:46,553
caught their imagination was, wow, this wasn't math.

279
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:48,474
We thought computers only did math.

280
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:51,533
No, you could do history as well.

281
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:52,735
You could do any subject.

282
00:17:53,436 --> 00:18:00,630
So we started out, and they took to it like ducks in water.

283
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:07,911
It was just like today, the first time you hand something over to a young child and,

284
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:11,214
you know, an hour later they know how it works and you don't.

285
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:16,078
They really got into it.

286
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:21,602
They seemed to be absorbing information from the program about this Western trek.

287
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:24,064
and they couldn't get enough of it.

288
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:28,547
My friends, who taught math, made up flimsy excuses

289
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:31,469
why their students should also try the program.

290
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,052
And so they got that going, and they came home

291
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:39,594
and they told me, once we'd shown this to some students.

292
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:44,519
We now experience at lunchtime and after school

293
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,142
that a line of kids forms outside our classrooms

294
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,484
because they want the chance to come in

295
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:52,626
and get on the teletype and play this game.

296
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:59,072
So we concluded that we had come up

297
00:18:59,152 --> 00:19:00,413
with something significant,

298
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:05,257
something that was teaching kids and also engaging them,

299
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:06,558
and that was important.

300
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:12,685
So we did this for a week or so, but it was now December,

301
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:18,387
and it's almost the holiday time and the end

302
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,107
of our practice teaching.

303
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:27,809
And therefore, we printed out the code to the Oregon Trail

304
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,529
program on the teletype.

305
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:32,030
So it came out on a scroll of paper,

306
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,391
the sacred scroll of the Oregon Trail.

307
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:39,767
Then, because we were leaving the school district,

308
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,748
and we didn't think we really had the right

309
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,170
to leave our stuff on their computer,

310
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,211
so we deleted the program.

311
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:49,873
But we had the sacred scroll.

312
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:56,317
And as we went back to finish up our college senior year,

313
00:19:56,878 --> 00:19:59,319
I guess we all, the three of us kind of wondered,

314
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:02,601
would we ever have a chance to get this thing going again?

315
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:07,637
Before we move on to answer that question,

316
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:10,019
let's take a little bit of a look

317
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,582
inside the Oregon Trail version 1.0.

318
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,426
So the Oregon Trail, as you probably know,

319
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:21,188
is a resource management type game

320
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,171
and a game that is played in turns.

321
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,171
as is true of many games.

322
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,654
So what would happen is the teletype would print out a date

323
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:37,759
in 1847, I think, and say you're ready to start your trip.

324
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,020
You got some instructions.

325
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,503
You bought some supplies with some money

326
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:43,724
that you had at the start.

327
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:48,509
And the computer then, at the beginning of each turn,

328
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:52,513
gave you a status, how many supplies you had left,

329
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:56,778
how much cash, how much food, how much clothing,

330
00:20:57,198 --> 00:20:59,941
how much ammunition, all the stuff

331
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:02,143
that you need to travel the Oregon Trail.

332
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:07,768
And then it would offer you the opportunity to make a strategy decision or two.

333
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:11,291
Like, are you going to keep going at this point?

334
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:13,052
Are you going to stop to rest?

335
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:20,938
Are you going to visit a fort where you could use your money to buy extra provisions?

336
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:23,681
Are you going to hunt? What are you going to do?

337
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:28,424
And then, the fateful question of how well are you going to eat?

338
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:33,633
If you didn't eat very well, you'd probably get sick.

339
00:21:34,614 --> 00:21:37,298
If you ate very well, your health would be great,

340
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:39,420
but you'd start running out of food faster.

341
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,163
So you had to kind of balance that decision making.

342
00:21:43,304 --> 00:21:45,267
That was then followed by the computer

343
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:47,489
going into its collection of.

344
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,451
mostly calamities that could befall you

345
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,672
to let you know what had happened.

346
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:57,673
Your oxen broke his leg, your kid got lost,

347
00:21:57,873 --> 00:21:58,853
somebody got sick.

348
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:03,615
Well, you're probably familiar with many of these things.

349
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:08,749
And so you then had to react to a number of them,

350
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:12,971
and the computer then moving you on to the next turn

351
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:16,292
would calculate what happened to your resources

352
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:19,674
and how much you had to start the next turn,

353
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:21,235
and on this went.

354
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:26,597
And each turn was set up to represent two weeks in the trip

355
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:32,459
so the entire trip would take about 10 to 12 turns

356
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,340
on the teletype.

357
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:38,245
Now this is of course just the general overview,

358
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:41,247
but underneath that there was a lot more going on.

359
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,070
And I know that you can't read the small print

360
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,972
from this age-old diagram.

361
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:53,213
That's why I've, down the right-hand side,

362
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:55,615
I've kind of annotated in larger print.

363
00:22:56,869 --> 00:23:00,272
But what I'm hoping to show here just visually

364
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:06,498
is that the path that the player takes in each turn,

365
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:08,860
this is one turn we're diagramming here,

366
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,163
actually had many different options,

367
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:16,066
many alternative routes, and many different things

368
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:17,027
that could happen to you.

369
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,831
So again, at the top, your resources are totaled up.

370
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,233
You make some strategy choices.

371
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:26,493
You could get attacked by strangers.

372
00:23:26,593 --> 00:23:29,434
You could, many things in that big box

373
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,274
are problems that could occur.

374
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:32,475
You could get ill.

375
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,395
And the computer kept track of your mileage,

376
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,996
and when you reached mile post roughly 950,

377
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:41,797
you were at the Rocky Mountains,

378
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:46,218
and so mountain-related problems started to happen to you.

379
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:52,302
And as you work your way down this chart with the computer

380
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:56,504
using probability statements to determine

381
00:23:57,164 --> 00:23:59,325
which things happen to you and how often,

382
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:02,567
when you went through all of that,

383
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:04,107
then it would take you back to the top

384
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:05,208
to start the next turn.

385
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:08,950
So I'm just trying to make the point here that

386
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,262
Well, let me start that over again.

387
00:24:12,402 --> 00:24:16,425
I must confess to you, we did not create the chart

388
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:18,467
and then program to it.

389
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:21,890
That would have been too deliberate.

390
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:24,292
We started programming.

391
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:26,013
This is Agile, by the way.

392
00:24:30,424 --> 00:24:38,175
We started programming and then when we got it to working the way we thought it should,

393
00:24:38,196 --> 00:24:45,186
then I went in and made this chart so in the future we'd remember how it actually worked.

394
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:54,384
But as it turned out, it's a fairly sophisticated simulation model,

395
00:24:55,084 --> 00:25:00,366
and because of all the different routes that the computer can take you through in every turn,

396
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:06,148
virtually no two trips to Oregon ever were exactly the same.

397
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:07,849
Which means what?

398
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:13,071
Players will keep coming back because they can't predict exactly what's going to happen.

399
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:19,293
Now another thing about the model is that even though we set up some probabilities for

400
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:24,376
how often certain things would happen, we thought that the model would be more accurate

401
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:32,361
if we pegged those probabilities not just to time passing, but to the terrain of the

402
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:32,721
trail.

403
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:38,420
the probability that a certain thing might happen

404
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:40,864
might be different at the beginning of the trail

405
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:42,808
or towards the end of the trail.

406
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,272
So how did we build that into the program?

407
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:57,279
Well, let's take the example of the fact that the pioneers that made this trip often came

408
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:01,399
into contact with people they didn't know, strangers.

409
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,541
Now these strangers might be friends or they may have mayhem on their mind.

410
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:10,021
They may want to rob you of your supplies and that kind of thing.

411
00:26:11,062 --> 00:26:12,782
So you had to deal with this.

412
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:20,704
We figured that it was probably more likely that you would meet up with strangers,

413
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:27,450
you know, coming upon the trail at the beginning of the trip rather than towards the end.

414
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:33,034
Because, number one, you weren't so far from civilization at the beginning,

415
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:40,201
so these people could ride out, try to rob you, and then, you know, go back to Independence, Missouri.

416
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:46,990
And also, because the geographic terrain at this point is very flat, it's the prairies.

417
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:52,756
Once you get into the mountains, what self-respecting thief is going to want to try to survive there

418
00:26:52,776 --> 00:26:59,463
for the meager rewards he's going to get for his evil ways?

419
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:04,906
So we thought that a graph like this was a good depiction

420
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:07,828
of the probability for this event

421
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:12,551
as mapped out against the terrain of the trail.

422
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,393
So along the X axis, we have the mileage from zero to 2000

423
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:20,055
and up the Y axis, we have probabilities from zero to 50%.

424
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:26,739
The math boys then had to figure out

425
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,960
how we could represent this mathematically.

426
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:33,527
So a formula, here is the formula.

427
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,529
So at the beginning of each turn,

428
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:39,472
the computer looked at the mileage you were at

429
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:42,595
and plugged it into M in this equation,

430
00:27:43,716 --> 00:27:51,463
and that generates the corresponding Y value on the curve.

431
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,920
So if you were at the 400 mile mark,

432
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,342
it might be a 50% chance that you were going to meet up

433
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:02,483
with some of these riders.

434
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:09,146
If you were at the 1,600 mile post on the trail,

435
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:09,906
it'd be more like 5%.

436
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,968
And so by using this method, we would

437
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:15,709
generate different probabilities,

438
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:18,951
not just based on what event are we talking about,

439
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,791
but also where we were on the trail.

440
00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:24,524
Now there's another aspect that had to be dealt with,

441
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:27,446
and that is the use of your firearm,

442
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:32,910
because there was no images, animation, and so forth.

443
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,130
So how do we do that?

444
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:39,274
Well, when it was time to use your rifle,

445
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:43,494
which means you had just chosen to hunt,

446
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:47,495
or because the computer said, for example,

447
00:28:47,615 --> 00:28:51,356
riders are approaching you, so you pick up your rifle.

448
00:28:51,776 --> 00:28:54,296
The computer would then quickly type out

449
00:28:55,296 --> 00:29:00,057
something like type bang, or type pow, or blam,

450
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:01,078
something like that.

451
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:05,579
And you, the player, had to type that phrase in

452
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,759
as quickly as you could and press return.

453
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:14,819
So how did the computer turn that into the results of using your trusty gun?

454
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:23,586
Well if you made a typo in your haste, then say for hunting, you got no food.

455
00:29:24,747 --> 00:29:30,911
If you spelled the phrase correctly but you were kind of a slow typist, you got some food.

456
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:34,455
But if you were a good speller and a good typist,

457
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:35,975
good eating tonight.

458
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:39,236
And your food supply was beefed up, if you'll pardon

459
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:43,917
the expression, for the next turn that you took.

460
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:49,039
So we didn't have little shooter guys running around

461
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:50,539
with guns and so forth.

462
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:55,260
But we might make the claim that Oregon Trail was

463
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,821
the first first-person shooter game in the history of games.

464
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:05,187
OK.

465
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:10,833
So this starts to give you an idea of how this worked.

466
00:30:11,114 --> 00:30:13,376
And again, the kids were fascinated.

467
00:30:14,197 --> 00:30:18,141
And we were sure that something could come of this

468
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:19,903
if we could just find a way to do it.

469
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:24,288
Well, the game sat dormant for a couple of years until 1974.

470
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:32,896
when I took a job with a newly formed organization in Minnesota called the Minnesota Educational

471
00:30:32,936 --> 00:30:40,422
Computing Corporation. It was a public agency that had been formed by the state of Minnesota

472
00:30:40,763 --> 00:30:47,388
to help schools come to terms with what it would mean to bring computing into the curriculum

473
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:50,291
and how to make that operational in the schools.

474
00:30:51,231 --> 00:30:57,875
We take our hats off to Minnesota on this because no other state in the country did

475
00:30:58,015 --> 00:31:02,498
something like this, which meant that the schools in the other states had a kind of

476
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:03,959
a chaotic situation.

477
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:08,602
How would they know how to make decisions about hardware to buy and software?

478
00:31:08,642 --> 00:31:10,503
How would they train teachers and so forth?

479
00:31:11,664 --> 00:31:12,604
But Minnesotans

480
00:31:14,487 --> 00:31:16,208
from their Scandinavian background,

481
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,210
like to get things organized.

482
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:24,635
And so they created MECC, MECC, to help carry that out.

483
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:32,188
I took a job about four months after MEC started up its operation, and one of the things that

484
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:39,634
MEC did was it operated one of those big mainframe computers to provide instructional, educational

485
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:45,378
computing to all the schools in the state, no matter where you were located, by setting

486
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:48,800
up a telecom network and the mainframe computer.

487
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:54,637
I noticed when I arrived that in that mainframe computer,

488
00:31:54,677 --> 00:31:57,179
there was a library of applications

489
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,603
that people had created, some good, some not so good.

490
00:32:01,784 --> 00:32:04,847
And I remembered that I had one of these sacred scrolls.

491
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:08,651
So I asked, would it be OK if I added something

492
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:09,632
to the library?

493
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:12,255
Sure, they needed all that they could get.

494
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:20,632
And so on one long weekend, I typed in 800 lines of code

495
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:27,335
from my kitchen at home to put the Oregon Trail game

496
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:28,816
back up on a computer.

497
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:32,077
And now it would be not just available

498
00:32:32,157 --> 00:32:33,978
to a few schools in Minneapolis,

499
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,259
it would be available to the entire state.

500
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:39,753
I realized, however, that the Oregon Trail 1.0,

501
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:43,235
having been created in two weeks,

502
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:46,877
had not exactly gone through the historical research

503
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:51,480
that we would probably want it to, to give it credence.

504
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:55,342
So I went in and started doing some of this research.

505
00:32:55,783 --> 00:32:59,485
I checked out the geography, the mileage of the mileposts,

506
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:02,527
and made sure that things were happening along the trail

507
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:05,508
when they should, depending on the geography.

508
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:10,631
When we had built probabilities into the game

509
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:14,435
as to how often the various events would happen,

510
00:33:14,855 --> 00:33:16,637
we were making educated guesses.

511
00:33:17,257 --> 00:33:18,939
But I found in the library that there

512
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:24,244
were books in which were printed the actual text from diaries

513
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:27,887
of people that made this journey in the 1840s and 50s.

514
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:31,871
And so I read through some of these diaries and kept score.

515
00:33:32,972 --> 00:33:36,494
Like how many days out of the entire trip was it bad weather?

516
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,255
How often did somebody get ill?

517
00:33:39,395 --> 00:33:43,957
And so on, and turn those into revised probability numbers

518
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:51,800
that would make the trip on the computer more in line

519
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,681
with what we know from history.

520
00:33:55,582 --> 00:33:58,303
And there was one other thing that needed to be dealt with,

521
00:33:58,523 --> 00:33:59,183
and that was.

522
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:01,966
the role of Native Americans.

523
00:34:03,147 --> 00:34:07,871
Because in the 1970s and maybe even to today,

524
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:12,154
you'll know if you go to see a Western at the movie

525
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:15,757
that we've kind of prolonged the stereotype

526
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:19,300
of these pioneers traveling in their wagon trains.

527
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:25,805
the Indians coming down out of the hills and attacking them and burning the wagons and so forth.

528
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:31,168
Well, it turns out from the diaries, it didn't work that way.

529
00:34:31,388 --> 00:34:38,253
Or at least it only worked that way a lot less than we might think from watching those films.

530
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:45,018
And as a matter of fact, there were diary entries showing that Native Americans helped the pioneers,

531
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:48,780
helped them stay on the trail, to know where the trail was going,

532
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,983
helped them understand the plants at the side of the road, so to speak.

533
00:34:54,524 --> 00:34:57,326
This one is nutritious, this one will kill you.

534
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:04,030
It was kind of helpful information to have, and they had it from years of experience.

535
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:11,093
So I made sure that there were events that came up in the game that reflected some of those kinds of things.

536
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:18,217
And also, I created a teacher guide. Do we have any teachers here? I should have asked.

537
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:20,175
We have a few.

538
00:35:20,195 --> 00:35:20,795
OK.

539
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:23,856
Well, as any teacher will tell you,

540
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:27,918
if you're giving me a new thing to use in the classroom,

541
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:29,378
I've got to have instructions.

542
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,679
I've got to have ideas.

543
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:32,380
I can't just do this from scratch.

544
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,041
So I created a booklet that MEC published

545
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:40,163
that had information about the game, about the model,

546
00:35:40,643 --> 00:35:45,284
about the research, a bibliography of books

547
00:35:45,485 --> 00:35:47,465
and so forth that you could bring to the classroom.

548
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:53,585
And that was, we did that at MECC for all of the applications that we created,

549
00:35:53,705 --> 00:35:59,208
and that's what gave MECC a good reputation with teachers for being educationally sound.

550
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:08,312
So, for about five years, the Oregon Trail was the most run program

551
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:14,055
on the Minnesota statewide educational system, like by a long shot.

552
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:20,732
We used to go into the airtight room where the computer was

553
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:24,393
to look at the master console to see the number of times

554
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,494
each application had been run that day.

555
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:30,836
And so the best ones had been run two or 300 times,

556
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:33,597
but Oregon Trail had been run like 10,000 times.

557
00:36:34,857 --> 00:36:37,498
So it was kind of becoming clear

558
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:39,719
that this was going to be a popular thing.

559
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:45,436
And after about five years, something interesting happened.

560
00:36:46,396 --> 00:36:49,737
As you may recall, I don't know,

561
00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:53,177
we were looking through a Radio Shack catalog one day,

562
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:57,138
and we found that this company was selling computers.

563
00:36:58,178 --> 00:37:00,739
Computers you could buy for less than $1,000

564
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,219
and put in your home.

565
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:06,760
So personal computers were coming to the marketplace.

566
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:11,674
And we realized at MEC that that was

567
00:37:11,714 --> 00:37:14,318
going to cause a big change, that schools were really

568
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:18,283
going to want to buy these kinds of computers

569
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,687
and actually own their computing power,

570
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:24,512
not, in effect, rent it from a big system.

571
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:31,770
And so we set up a team who took the best applications from that mainframe system

572
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:42,078
and recoded them to work on the Apple II and then beyond that other brands that survived the shakeout of the market.

573
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:50,613
And as a matter of fact, that led to, in 1985, the release of a new and improved version

574
00:37:50,973 --> 00:37:56,014
for the Apple of the Oregon Trail, which is displayed in the little image up there.

575
00:37:56,714 --> 00:38:03,316
This may well be the one you remember from school, the colored version, the one that

576
00:38:03,396 --> 00:38:04,016
played those...

577
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:14,524
tinny songs on Apple's 2-bit sound card, but the one that introduced you to traveling the

578
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:16,186
Oregon Trail by computer.

579
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:21,390
And as the years went on, new versions were released and new technologies were dealt with.

580
00:38:22,894 --> 00:38:28,617
And I put down at the bottom, just referencing that in the 90s,

581
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:33,019
MECC was purchased, like other educational software companies,

582
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,220
by larger.

583
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:40,143
Entities, corporate entities, who now found themselves

584
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:42,504
with educational content, but they didn't quite know

585
00:38:42,524 --> 00:38:43,225
what to do with it.

586
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:46,166
And in the case of the company that ended up

587
00:38:46,186 --> 00:38:48,548
with the Oregon Trail, they had someone create

588
00:38:48,568 --> 00:38:52,870
an arcade type version for your tablet or phone.

589
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:59,894
But this was not designed with the actual historical

590
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:02,496
data in mind and so forth.

591
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:02,696
So.

592
00:39:04,097 --> 00:39:10,520
If you have run into this version, it's a different kind of game, not the same thing

593
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,161
that we used to sell to schools.

594
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:18,164
So what made Oregon Trail so popular?

595
00:39:19,545 --> 00:39:21,826
Well for one, for many kids,

596
00:39:22,764 --> 00:39:30,029
in the 80s, this is the first computer they've ever seen, and this was a very popular thing

597
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:33,651
that many schools owned that could be used on that computer.

598
00:39:33,852 --> 00:39:39,616
And so, you know, you always remember your first experience is best.

599
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:44,700
Also, I think because we gave the kids an environment

600
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:49,523
that they could control, or some of the time control,

601
00:39:49,543 --> 00:39:52,124
that that was something they really liked.

602
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:54,825
They didn't like always going to the computer

603
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,427
and getting asked to do their arithmetic facts

604
00:39:58,707 --> 00:39:59,888
or their spelling lists.

605
00:40:00,628 --> 00:40:02,389
They wanted to be part of something

606
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:04,350
that they could influence.

607
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,792
And we put them right in the middle

608
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,493
of a first-person adventure.

609
00:40:10,771 --> 00:40:13,672
And when I've talked to game people in the present,

610
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:20,135
I believe it's fair to say that often the point will be made

611
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:22,136
if you don't have a good story,

612
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:25,197
you're not going to have the best game you can have.

613
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:27,558
The story is really a key component.

614
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,880
And here we gave kids a story to be a part of,

615
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,241
which was not very common back in the 80s.

616
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:41,353
And so what that means is it was very popular in the schools

617
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:43,775
in the US and a few other countries.

618
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:48,558
But that means that today, several decades later,

619
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,682
Oregon Trail is well remembered by people such as yourselves

620
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:54,903
that used it back then.

621
00:40:56,144 --> 00:40:56,764
For example.

622
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:00,916
About a year ago, I got on Reddit,

623
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:04,677
and you may be familiar with their Ask Me Anything feature.

624
00:41:05,237 --> 00:41:09,038
So I introduced myself and co-inventor

625
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:11,118
of the original Oregon Trail, Ask Me Anything.

626
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,739
Well, in a period of about six hours,

627
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:19,080
while I stayed at the computer, I got over 2,000 comments.

628
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,981
And these comments were, they were mostly positive.

629
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:33,292
except for the losers who couldn't get to Oregon because they didn't figure out the strategy.

630
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:44,906
But most, the most memorable thing to me is that there were more than a few comments that

631
00:41:44,946 --> 00:41:47,669
said I really enjoyed the Oregon Trail.

632
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:54,075
Of all the things we did in school with the computer, the Oregon Trail is the one I learned

633
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,056
the most from.

634
00:41:55,696 --> 00:41:58,399
And of course, that was the purpose from the very beginning.

635
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:05,776
I don't know if you watch network TV, but there's a great sitcom on, you might check

636
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:08,219
out on Wednesday evenings called The Goldbergs.

637
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:13,023
The Goldbergs is a kind of a wacky family in the 1980s.

638
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:20,370
The young son, the youngest of the two boys, is a computer nerd, and they often show him

639
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,593
at his Apple II, and in a couple of segments.

640
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:27,055
the camera swings around to show the screen,

641
00:42:27,515 --> 00:42:30,496
and what do you think is there but the Oregon Trail?

642
00:42:30,876 --> 00:42:33,257
So we're kind of a part of the culture.

643
00:42:35,078 --> 00:42:37,639
Perhaps you're familiar with a tribute version

644
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,980
to the Oregon Trail.

645
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:42,842
And this is not a typo in the image there.

646
00:42:43,182 --> 00:42:46,523
This is the Oregon Trail, which you may have heard of.

647
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:52,179
It's similar to the Oregon Trail in that it involves a trip across the country.

648
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,706
However, you take this trip in a car.

649
00:42:55,987 --> 00:43:00,471
And the setting is an apocalyptic US

650
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:04,194
that's been destroyed a lot.

651
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:09,157
And your biggest hurdle that you have to get by

652
00:43:09,277 --> 00:43:12,940
is all of the zombies that are running around the landscape

653
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,421
looking for your brains.

654
00:43:15,582 --> 00:43:19,065
I met the young men who make this game.

655
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:20,606
They're sane.

656
00:43:24,072 --> 00:43:27,053
And to my knowledge, this has been kind of a popular thing.

657
00:43:27,073 --> 00:43:30,615
I mean, they just launched it with a little bit of funding.

658
00:43:31,115 --> 00:43:33,076
But I think a lot of people have played it.

659
00:43:34,437 --> 00:43:38,839
And perhaps most important to me is

660
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:40,660
that we're in the Hall of Fame.

661
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:54,574
The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York

662
00:43:55,354 --> 00:44:00,516
is a place that catalogs and displays all the stuff

663
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:02,977
that kids have ever had fun with.

664
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:05,258
It is an amazing place.

665
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:06,379
You must go there.

666
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,122
And a couple of years ago, the Strong

667
00:44:11,202 --> 00:44:15,625
decided that they wanted to start emphasizing computer

668
00:44:15,665 --> 00:44:18,247
games as part of that, fits in with play.

669
00:44:19,248 --> 00:44:23,470
And to help emphasize that, they created the World Video Game

670
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,171
Hall of Fame.

671
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:29,594
So in 2015, they inducted six programs, of course,

672
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:32,756
the iconic Pac-Man, Tetris, World of Warcraft.

673
00:44:34,527 --> 00:44:37,688
Last May, again, they do this every year,

674
00:44:38,288 --> 00:44:42,210
and using their panel of experts and nominations

675
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,011
from the population at large,

676
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:49,053
they enshrined six more games, computer games,

677
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:50,993
and one of them was the Oregon Trail,

678
00:44:51,534 --> 00:44:53,915
and proud to say it's the only one of the 12

679
00:44:54,415 --> 00:44:56,156
in there so far that was created

680
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,916
with an educational purpose in mind.

681
00:44:58,336 --> 00:44:59,877
I'm sure more will follow.

682
00:45:01,938 --> 00:45:07,963
I got to be there at the little ceremony that they held, and it is really a special time.

683
00:45:10,646 --> 00:45:11,046
All right.

684
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:19,093
When we invented the Oregon Trail game, we had no guidance.

685
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:20,934
We had no examples.

686
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:25,739
Nobody had written books on how to create effective educational games.

687
00:45:28,347 --> 00:45:30,728
There were no university courses in this.

688
00:45:31,448 --> 00:45:34,049
There were no consultants to consult.

689
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:39,170
And so all we really had was our instincts as teachers,

690
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,430
as future teachers.

691
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,991
And fortunately, it appears that we got a lot of stuff right

692
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,892
that today you would know from all of your background

693
00:45:49,932 --> 00:45:53,413
and experience are the right things to do with a game.

694
00:45:53,553 --> 00:45:55,893
So just to quickly sum that up.

695
00:45:57,812 --> 00:45:59,754
We gave the player a degree of control.

696
00:45:59,774 --> 00:46:01,235
It wasn't all random.

697
00:46:02,276 --> 00:46:06,359
We put the player in the middle of a story that would engage him or her.

698
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:12,884
It was a very simple game to use, but there was a very sophisticated model underneath.

699
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:18,475
The resources were balanced well with the obstacles.

700
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:24,502
If you give kids something to do on the computer that's too hard, they'll give up.

701
00:46:25,203 --> 00:46:27,365
And if it's too easy, they'll get bored.

702
00:46:27,946 --> 00:46:31,790
So you have to have just the right balance so that it continues to be a challenge and

703
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,492
they come back time and time again.

704
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:37,335
When we talk about an educational game,

705
00:46:37,355 --> 00:46:44,258
I like to point out that the game becomes much more valuable

706
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:47,019
and much more successful

707
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:50,061
if you have multiple layers of learning.

708
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:55,858
So just to give my examples, what do kids learn from the Oregon Trail?

709
00:46:55,998 --> 00:46:58,040
Well, one thing they learn, it's a game.

710
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,686
And so you learn a strategy by playing the game and replaying the game.

711
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:05,047
It's a thought process.

712
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:10,153
Interestingly enough, this actually is another reflection

713
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:11,954
of what actually happened historically.

714
00:47:12,841 --> 00:47:14,941
When the first settlers took the trail,

715
00:47:15,342 --> 00:47:17,782
those that survived, when they got to the West,

716
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:22,603
wrote back to the family in the East,

717
00:47:22,663 --> 00:47:25,344
you know, Pony Express or however they got a letter

718
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,204
back there, and they said,

719
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:30,385
if you're going to come and join us out here,

720
00:47:30,405 --> 00:47:33,546
here's what you need to do because we know

721
00:47:33,686 --> 00:47:35,466
from being in the first wave.

722
00:47:36,307 --> 00:47:41,271
Here's the clothing, here's the cash, here's the thinking about the food, and so forth.

723
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:48,416
So the more that people made the trip, the more information was built up that would help them be successful.

724
00:47:48,476 --> 00:47:50,518
The mortality rate started to come down.

725
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:57,583
So that is a reflection, I think, of what happens when you play a game.

726
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:04,544
And it's the kind of thing that keeps kids interested in it.

727
00:48:05,284 --> 00:48:06,465
You learn about topics.

728
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:08,026
You learn something about history.

729
00:48:08,046 --> 00:48:09,206
You learn about geography.

730
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:11,387
You learn about resource management.

731
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:15,270
These are things that can be matched to the standards

732
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,912
that schools are now being held to in their programs.

733
00:48:21,226 --> 00:48:24,367
And then there's another thing that I experienced

734
00:48:24,447 --> 00:48:27,809
watching kids play this game in the early days

735
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:30,630
when, because of the teletype shortage,

736
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:32,971
you had to play as a group.

737
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:36,971
that there were things that happened in that group activity

738
00:48:37,952 --> 00:48:40,414
that were very interesting.

739
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:44,438
Kids figured out pretty quickly that there

740
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,520
were going to be lots of decisions that they had

741
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,841
to make in playing this game.

742
00:48:48,381 --> 00:48:52,265
And so how do 10-year-olds, 8-year-olds make decisions

743
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:53,326
when they have a group?

744
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:56,609
They yell at each other.

745
00:48:57,999 --> 00:48:59,820
I want it my way, I want it my way.

746
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,343
Well, the kids that I saw playing this game

747
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:06,305
eventually looked up at the clock in the classroom

748
00:49:06,685 --> 00:49:08,567
and realized if they didn't get this

749
00:49:08,647 --> 00:49:12,830
to be a more organized process,

750
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,211
they were gonna run out of time.

751
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,832
They'd never find out if they got to Oregon.

752
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:17,113
So what did they do?

753
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:20,156
They invented democracy.

754
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:21,797
They invented taking votes.

755
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:26,310
Forget the hanging chads.

756
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,611
They took votes.

757
00:49:28,952 --> 00:49:31,914
And so they realized that if they

758
00:49:31,974 --> 00:49:34,876
had one person designated to run the voting,

759
00:49:35,237 --> 00:49:36,077
they could take a vote.

760
00:49:36,197 --> 00:49:37,799
Majority rules, that's what we're going to do.

761
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:40,280
We'll get to Oregon in time.

762
00:49:41,661 --> 00:49:44,904
Another thing they invented, which to me harks back

763
00:49:45,004 --> 00:49:48,987
to Henry Ford about a century ago, is division of labor.

764
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:52,169
So in the early Ford plant.

765
00:49:53,018 --> 00:49:55,060
You know, one person made the wheels,

766
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,182
and one person made the transmission,

767
00:49:57,302 --> 00:49:58,904
and one person made the seats,

768
00:49:58,984 --> 00:50:00,645
and then they put them all together.

769
00:50:01,006 --> 00:50:03,088
They were very efficient at making cars.

770
00:50:03,648 --> 00:50:07,111
So the kids realized there's lots of stuff to do

771
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,973
when you're playing the game,

772
00:50:09,654 --> 00:50:11,896
and everyone was trying to keep track of everything

773
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:15,099
until they decided, okay, first of all,

774
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,740
the best typist in our group

775
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:18,982
needs to be the one sitting at the teletype.

776
00:50:19,795 --> 00:50:23,696
so that they don't do typos and we don't miss out on our hunting.

777
00:50:24,616 --> 00:50:25,857
Someone else watched the map.

778
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:27,237
Someone else watched the budget.

779
00:50:27,477 --> 00:50:29,478
Somebody else kept track of the voting.

780
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:33,999
This was all done in the minds of these kids.

781
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:46,473
And to me is a level of learning that in some respects transcends just picking up content and strategy suggestions.

782
00:50:46,593 --> 00:50:54,682
So if you're making games for the education market, the more levels of learning you can put in there, the more successful the product can be.

783
00:50:55,982 --> 00:51:00,504
And finally, I'm a big fan of collaborative design efforts.

784
00:51:01,605 --> 00:51:05,827
I've always thought that if we had put 10 computer programmers

785
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:08,448
in a room and said, make a game about history,

786
00:51:09,129 --> 00:51:10,849
we never would have gotten the Oregon Trail.

787
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,291
If we'd put 10 historians in a room and said,

788
00:51:13,351 --> 00:51:14,691
make a computer game, we never would

789
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:15,772
have gotten the Oregon Trail.

790
00:51:16,612 --> 00:51:17,533
But we had a.

791
00:51:18,862 --> 00:51:22,283
Two math guys, one of whom was well into computers,

792
00:51:22,343 --> 00:51:26,145
and one history guy, and that collection of backgrounds

793
00:51:26,545 --> 00:51:29,306
brought forth all the questions, all the new ideas,

794
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,867
all the suggestions that made Oregon Trail successful.

795
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:35,608
So if you're forming a team to make a game,

796
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:38,389
make sure you've got diversity on that team.

797
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,871
Speaking of team, here they are,

798
00:51:43,472 --> 00:51:45,752
25 years after the invention of the game,

799
00:51:45,813 --> 00:51:47,073
which was about 45 years ago.

800
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:53,104
That is myself, Bill Heinemann, Paul Dillenberger,

801
00:51:53,624 --> 00:51:56,486
Bill holding one of these sacred scrolls

802
00:51:56,687 --> 00:51:58,348
that was printed off the teletype.

803
00:52:00,529 --> 00:52:03,471
I found out recently that he still has that scroll

804
00:52:04,472 --> 00:52:06,954
and that at one point his son asked him,

805
00:52:08,555 --> 00:52:11,217
Dad, because I realize how valuable this thing is,

806
00:52:11,277 --> 00:52:15,420
would it be okay if I took over the sacred scroll?

807
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,001
To which Bill replied, no.

808
00:52:20,782 --> 00:52:28,769
So, anyway, a great pair of colleagues to have gone through this.

809
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:37,917
And the Oregon Trail, of course, has stuck with us now for over four decades, which kind

810
00:52:37,957 --> 00:52:42,521
of means that for all the learning that people got out of the Oregon Trail about

811
00:52:44,515 --> 00:52:51,217
history, I learned some things about life from the Oregon Trail, from the Oregon Trail

812
00:52:51,257 --> 00:52:56,698
game, and some of these things may apply to your own efforts in creating games.

813
00:52:56,879 --> 00:53:01,080
So let's just say, plan ahead.

814
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,060
There's danger out there.

815
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:05,281
Be patient.

816
00:53:06,401 --> 00:53:07,382
The journey is long.

817
00:53:08,902 --> 00:53:11,803
If you persevere, you'll find your green valley.

818
00:53:14,738 --> 00:53:19,943
even if the water's deep, sometimes you just have to cock your wagon and head out from shore.

819
00:53:20,384 --> 00:53:22,666
Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it.

820
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:47,594
We do have a few minutes and we can take some questions and I believe there are microphones

821
00:53:47,774 --> 00:53:54,579
in the aisles that could be used if anyone has a question that they're willing to say

822
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:55,260
publicly.

823
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,660
Hi.

824
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:07,848
What was, right here, what was the most surprising thing to you with the kind of explosion of

825
00:54:07,908 --> 00:54:09,690
popularity from Oregon Trail?

826
00:54:12,475 --> 00:54:19,405
Well, I guess I kind of struggle with that because

827
00:54:21,784 --> 00:54:23,665
I had nothing to compare it to.

828
00:54:23,685 --> 00:54:26,125
I was happy to see that people liked the game,

829
00:54:26,525 --> 00:54:30,286
and the fact that schools started ultimately purchasing

830
00:54:30,786 --> 00:54:35,487
the game from MEC in its Apple versions and so forth.

831
00:54:36,748 --> 00:54:38,928
It just seemed like kind of a natural thing,

832
00:54:38,988 --> 00:54:45,330
but I will say that if something surprising might be

833
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:50,971
that at the time that MEC was bought by an investment group

834
00:54:51,651 --> 00:54:58,392
to take it over. Oregon Trail, I think, accounted for about one-third of MECC's annual revenues.

835
00:54:59,113 --> 00:55:10,195
So the MECC group over the years developed about 250 to 300 products, and this one product was

836
00:55:10,535 --> 00:55:16,417
bringing in a third of the money. Wow. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Yes, sir. Amazing talk.

837
00:55:17,162 --> 00:55:23,964
I just wanted to say thank you for the experience of asking my teacher what Dysentery was in

838
00:55:23,984 --> 00:55:24,904
the following explanation.

839
00:55:24,964 --> 00:55:28,385
If I may clarify, Dysentery was not brought up in version 1.0.

840
00:55:28,865 --> 00:55:33,767
That was the Apple version where the team added it.

841
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:34,367
Yes?

842
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:37,348
Thank you for the fascinating peek into history.

843
00:55:37,608 --> 00:55:41,650
What are some educational games from modern times that you think are doing it right and

844
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:41,890
why?

845
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:47,790
I'm sorry, I'm getting a kind of an echo, so...

846
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:50,012
I'll yell, is that better?

847
00:55:57,856 --> 00:55:58,777
Well, let's see.

848
00:55:59,197 --> 00:56:03,840
First of all, I may not be as up-to-date as necessary.

849
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,643
But one thing that I'm fascinated with

850
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:13,206
is that perhaps the most popular educational game today is,

851
00:56:13,226 --> 00:56:19,330
OK, I'm drawing a blank.

852
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,091
What's the one that looks like you're

853
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,912
digging through all the bricks and making?

854
00:56:22,932 --> 00:56:23,573
Minecraft.

855
00:56:24,053 --> 00:56:25,093
Minecraft, thank you.

856
00:56:25,113 --> 00:56:25,214
Sorry.

857
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:35,640
I've seen notices on the internet where you can buy curriculum guides for the use of Minecraft

858
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,885
and suggestions for activities in the classroom that you can do with Minecraft.

859
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:42,468
So that's been kind of surprising.

860
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:54,494
But my sense is that if there was a golden age of educational software in terms of making

861
00:56:55,654 --> 00:57:02,397
programs that were deliberately teaching a particular part in the curriculum, I think

862
00:57:02,617 --> 00:57:04,898
that that was a little bit in the past.

863
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:10,561
And that since then, there's been a lot more use of the internet by schools

864
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:17,886
and various tools that help kids be creative and make their own videos,

865
00:57:17,926 --> 00:57:22,308
their own productions, their own science experiments, and so on.

866
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:26,131
So a particular game doesn't come to mind for me,

867
00:57:26,191 --> 00:57:28,132
but those are some of the things that are going on.

868
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:29,313
Thank you.

869
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:35,696
Kind of as a follow-up question, with modern technology, how would you design OrdinChild

870
00:57:35,736 --> 00:57:35,976
today?

871
00:57:35,996 --> 00:57:38,258
Okay, come forward.

872
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:39,480
I'm sorry, I'm getting the...

873
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:45,866
With modern technology, how would you design OrdinChild today?

874
00:57:45,886 --> 00:57:46,327
Oh, okay.

875
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:51,772
Well, the first thing we need is virtual reality.

876
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:58,669
But you know, but I have another answer to that question.

877
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:00,989
It's not really related to the technology,

878
00:58:01,169 --> 00:58:05,611
but if we were going to create something like Oregon Trail

879
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:08,852
today, I would create the Native American version.

880
00:58:10,332 --> 00:58:13,393
What was it like to be on the other side of, you know,

881
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:15,594
the other side of the wall, so to speak?

882
00:58:17,554 --> 00:58:20,035
That would be kind of fascinating,

883
00:58:20,115 --> 00:58:21,215
especially if they could.

884
00:58:23,363 --> 00:58:25,525
somehow communicate with each other.

885
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:27,827
I'll bring up one other thing,

886
00:58:28,007 --> 00:58:29,088
and maybe this would be,

887
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:32,030
today's technology would make it easier.

888
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:35,152
MEC experimented at one point

889
00:58:35,232 --> 00:58:36,613
with a version of Oregon Trail

890
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:38,134
that was a networked version,

891
00:58:38,855 --> 00:58:41,677
so that you could have multiple travelers,

892
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:45,340
and that the decisions they made would affect each other.

893
00:58:47,497 --> 00:58:49,758
And that was not an easy thing to pull off

894
00:58:50,899 --> 00:58:53,580
in the technology of the 80s,

895
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:57,943
but maybe today it could be done a lot better,

896
00:58:58,523 --> 00:59:00,024
and that would be kind of interesting

897
00:59:00,124 --> 00:59:03,887
to be in a wagon train with people you don't know, maybe,

898
00:59:04,447 --> 00:59:06,869
and to see what kind of social dynamics

899
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:07,669
would come out of that.

900
00:59:13,012 --> 00:59:13,653
You're very welcome.

901
00:59:15,772 --> 00:59:18,713
I'm from Minnesota and I played Farming Trail,

902
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:21,094
Old L.A., Number Munchers, all these games,

903
00:59:21,154 --> 00:59:24,075
and somehow I never knew that they were made in Minnesota.

904
00:59:24,535 --> 00:59:26,816
That there was any kind of computing stuff going on there.

905
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:30,638
I'm really interested to hear about what MET was like.

906
00:59:31,058 --> 00:59:34,459
Specifically, was the fact that it was a state-run,

907
00:59:34,879 --> 00:59:36,500
publicly-owned corporation,

908
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,521
did that make it easier to experiment with educational software

909
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:43,042
versus maybe a profit-oriented...

910
00:59:46,464 --> 00:59:48,745
Okay, let's see, there were a number of questions there.

911
00:59:49,366 --> 00:59:51,667
But the first thing that I might say is,

912
00:59:51,987 --> 00:59:53,088
you know, why people say,

913
00:59:53,128 --> 00:59:55,309
well, why did this happen in Minnesota?

914
00:59:56,509 --> 01:00:00,511
And the thing that perhaps people are not so aware of

915
01:00:00,651 --> 01:00:02,252
is that before Silicon Valley,

916
01:00:03,093 --> 01:00:05,094
there was a Silicon Valley in Minnesota.

917
01:00:06,174 --> 01:00:07,895
That during the 60s and 70s,

918
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:13,118
companies like IBM, Univac, Honeywell, Control Data,

919
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:18,634
and boroughs, some I can't remember,

920
01:00:18,934 --> 01:00:23,118
either had their national headquarters in the Twin Cities

921
01:00:23,739 --> 01:00:26,101
or they had large installations there.

922
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:30,085
And so Minnesota was kind of the computing capital

923
01:00:30,105 --> 01:00:33,929
of the country right up until the day that, you know,

924
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:35,971
WSNIAC developed something

925
01:00:35,991 --> 01:00:37,693
that didn't require a big room to put it in.

926
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:46,253
So it's kind of logical that it would have grown up there.

927
01:00:47,754 --> 01:00:50,115
Now let's see, what was another aspect?

928
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:52,817
Oh, what was MEC like?

929
01:00:53,197 --> 01:00:56,899
Yeah, well MEC's the only place I've ever worked that I would have paid them.

930
01:00:59,193 --> 01:01:06,944
Because, I mean, in addition to working with a crew of incredible educators, you know,

931
01:01:07,004 --> 01:01:09,086
former teachers who came to do this.

932
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:15,839
there just was a spirit and a camaraderie there.

933
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,020
And what was so exciting about it was

934
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,183
we were inventing something that hadn't been invented before.

935
01:01:21,663 --> 01:01:23,605
We were the first wave of people

936
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:28,648
that worked in the educational computing business,

937
01:01:28,728 --> 01:01:30,430
quote unquote.

938
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:37,515
So it's an experience that most people who worked at MECC

939
01:01:37,575 --> 01:01:38,696
would say they will never forget.

940
01:01:45,859 --> 01:01:47,445
Okay, it's a little after six.

941
01:01:47,806 --> 01:01:49,091
Thank you so much for coming.

942
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:51,018
I'll stick around if you want to talk.
