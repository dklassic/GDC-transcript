00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:09,956
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:12,477
Welcome to my talk from Assassin's Creed to the Dark

3
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:14,479
Eye, The Importance of Themes.

4
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:18,521
My name's Winifred Phillips, and I compose music for games.

5
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:22,223
You might know me from my work on the franchises Total War,

6
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:26,286
Little Big Planet, The Sims, God of War, and Assassin's Creed.

7
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:29,568
Some of you might have heard my music performed recently

8
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:31,969
in the Assassin's Creed Symphony concert tour.

9
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,571
And some of you might know me from my book,

10
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:38,433
Composer's Guide to Gay Music, published by the MIT Press.

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,852
Today we're going to be talking about musical themes.

12
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:45,615
And I'm going to be sharing some stories about my work

13
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:48,557
composing music for various projects of mine.

14
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:51,139
But before we dig into practical examples,

15
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:55,163
let's first take a quick look at one of the most iconic themes

16
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:56,924
in the history of music for media.

17
00:00:57,485 --> 00:01:02,729
I'm going to play an example for you now. Notice how we hear a short melodic phrase once

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,252
and then we hear it again. And it's exactly the same as it was before,

19
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:11,075
as if the music's saying, hey, you like that? Here, have another.

20
00:01:30,097 --> 00:01:35,126
Okay, so this is everybody's go-to composition for talking about musical themes.

21
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:40,296
It's one that everybody can identify within the first few bars,

22
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:42,740
and that's part of why it's such a great example.

23
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:47,425
Let's briefly consider this theme in terms of its hook.

24
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:51,590
Now, we all know that a hook in musical composition is a thematic element that's

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,396
designed to catch the mind. In Star Wars, it takes the form of that four-bar melody,

26
00:01:57,396 --> 00:02:02,321
and right away we can see one of the core design features of the Star Wars theme.

27
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:04,163
It's built around repetition.

28
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:11,193
In the Star Wars theme, we hear full statements of that main melody, complete with its internal

29
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:17,319
repetition. And then we get a contrast section or a bridge, and then we're right back to another

30
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:24,405
full statement of that same internally repeating main melody. And this pattern happens five times

31
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:26,346
over the course of the Star Wars theme.

32
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:29,040
So it's no wonder we remember the Star Wars main theme melody so well.

33
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,522
By the time we're finished listening to it, it's literally been drummed right into our heads.

34
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:39,886
The music, well, it's a big part of what makes Star Wars what it is.

35
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:44,448
It's essentially the musical signature of Star Wars.

36
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:48,990
So how does the idea of musical signatures fit into our work as game composers?

37
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:55,758
Well, in games, music has a particularly interesting and fundamentally important role to play.

38
00:03:55,758 --> 00:04:00,799
It seems that according to some really cool research conducted at the University of Geneva,

39
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,940
music has a special power.

40
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,001
Music is a super mnemonic.

41
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:11,104
It makes us remember things, and it does this better than, well, almost anything else.

42
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:16,686
Just like smells can bring back really vivid memories, music can do the same thing.

43
00:04:16,686 --> 00:04:21,888
And the fact that we hear game music while we're participating in something active and engaging

44
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:26,130
means that music has an even better chance of being remembered.

45
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,172
active experiences are better remembered than passive ones.

46
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:37,896
So this means that game music has a unique ability to define the identity of a game

47
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:44,280
and help players to remember it. But in order for the music to help remind players of the game,

48
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,763
the music itself has to be as memorable as possible. So that's where themes come in.

49
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:55,596
In this talk, we're going to be discussing what makes musical themes memorable,

50
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:58,297
including the importance of repetition.

51
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:02,819
We'll look at composition strategies that are designed to keep things fresh,

52
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,360
including variation and fragmentation.

53
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,463
We'll check out how musical themes hold up inside interactive music constructs,

54
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:14,704
and we'll discuss some of the different kinds of gameplay

55
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:17,665
that can benefit from a thematic musical approach.

56
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:23,367
Along the way, I'm going to be sharing some of my personal experiences composing thematic

57
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,589
music for my projects.

58
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:31,554
So, let's start with one of my most recent games, the latest entry in the award-winning

59
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:35,757
Dark Eye video game franchise, which is about to be released this spring.

60
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:41,954
I was really excited to compose the music for the Dark Eye Book of Heroes video game.

61
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:49,460
The Dark Eye Book of Heroes is an RPG fantasy video game based on the Dark Eye fantasy world,

62
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:56,327
which is the most popular fantasy RPG in Europe with over 35 years of fantasy lore and millions

63
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:57,007
of fans.

64
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:57,488
So, let's get started.

65
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:03,652
Right from the start, the developers and I decided that we would focus on a four-minute main theme

66
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:08,875
that would strongly assert the musical signature for the Dark Eye Book of Heroes.

67
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:15,199
Now, to make it memorable, I restated that theme in six distinct variations.

68
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,622
As game composers, we want that hook to grab hold and stick in the mind.

69
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:26,244
So while the Dark Eye Book of Heroes main theme does include development of its ideas

70
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:32,975
and it includes secondary sections and bridges, that main hook melody keeps on coming back.

71
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,297
Let's see how that works.

72
00:06:52,782 --> 00:06:52,926
you

73
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:04,009
As you could hear, it's an overt strategy that's designed to ensure a melody is going

74
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:04,809
to be remembered.

75
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:11,250
Of course, that was a pretty dynamic foreground melody, so what if we want to take a more

76
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,130
subtle approach?

77
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:17,420
When I was hired to compose the music for Assassin's Creed Liberation, one of the first

78
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,347
requested tracks was the main theme melody for the game, so I'm sitting there in front

79
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:27,455
of my keyboard and I'm trying to start composing a main theme for an Assassin's Creed game.

80
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:31,859
And I'm thinking about what makes Assassin's Creed unique.

81
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:35,003
The surreal nature of being in the animus.

82
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:42,590
A virtual world that exists kind of like an altered mental state, like dreaming or hypnosis.

83
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,354
What could I do as the composer to evoke this particular feeling?

84
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:52,931
Now, around that time, there was a lot of discussion of the four-chord technique that

85
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:56,394
Hans Zimmer popularized in movies like Inception.

86
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:59,156
Of course, the four-chord technique wasn't unique to him.

87
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:04,199
It actually owes a lot to pop music construction, but Hans Zimmer brought a lot of attention

88
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,160
to it.

89
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,923
Something about a simple repeating four-chord pattern feels very hypnotic.

90
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,665
And so I thought, well, why not?

91
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:18,167
Let's figure out a four chord progression, something that sounds interesting, and then

92
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:24,309
base the entire track off of it. I'd never done anything like that before and it could work.

93
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:29,590
So, here it is. The four chords of the Assassin's Creed Liberation main theme.

94
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:36,071
It took a little while to settle on them and then I recorded them using a really mellow synth pad.

95
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:41,413
I played them over and over and over again for about two minutes. So, here's what that was like.

96
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:02,831
The four chords became the foundation of the main theme.

97
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:06,252
And then it was just a matter of adding things to it.

98
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:06,953
Lots of things.

99
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:27,697
So while there is plenty of melodic material in the Assassin's Creed Liberation main theme,

100
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:32,684
the element that gets the most repetition is that sequence of four chords.

101
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:37,089
We hear that four chord pattern 14 times in the main theme alone.

102
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:43,197
Now this gives that four chord sequence some mnemonic heft within the body of the Assassin's

103
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:44,519
Creed Liberation score.

104
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,681
It's going to feel familiar when we hear it again.

105
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:52,589
And that allows it to be meaningful when it reappears as a broken chord sequence during

106
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:53,269
stealth gameplay.

107
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:41,736
or when that same four-chord sequence shows up during the game's main user interface menus.

108
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:48,781
Repetition can serve as a powerful musical signature, whether by virtue of a bold and

109
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:52,683
dynamic melody line or, in this case, a subtle chord progression.

110
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:58,787
If an element pops up during our music composition that seems perfect for recurrence,

111
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:05,212
we have to be ready to recognize that and act on it. For instance, in my music for the first

112
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:11,537
person shooter Homefront the Revolution, I composed an emotional theme for when an unlikely hero

113
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:17,721
suddenly delivers a remarkably inspiring speech about fighting back against oppression.

114
00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:24,066
Now, since the whole idea of the game centers around that concept, that musical signature

115
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:30,970
took on a really iconic character, and I privately named it the Stand With Me theme from a phrase

116
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,732
that that character used during that speech.

117
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:39,235
Afterwards, I made a mental note to use the Stand With Me theme again if I ever saw the

118
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:39,996
chance to do so.

119
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:43,398
It turns out there were quite a few chances.

120
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:46,420
Here it is as it was used in three different story missions.

121
00:12:47,864 --> 00:12:51,305
If you want to be safe, you gotta save yourselves!

122
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:53,826
You gotta take responsibility.

123
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:57,187
You want your home back? Take it!

124
00:12:57,187 --> 00:13:01,528
You want your life back? Get it back!

125
00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:04,109
You have to breathe. Get him up there.

126
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:05,529
It's for a reason.

127
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:06,130
He's done.

128
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,070
You have a brother to make.

129
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,411
You saved me.

130
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:16,613
People of America, we stand today facing a new dawn.

131
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:21,823
Thanks to the immense sacrifices of the resistance

132
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:24,624
and the loyalty of our European allies,

133
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:26,965
we have one final chance at freedom.

134
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:32,247
It must not slip through our fingers.

135
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:35,109
We have to ready ourselves once more

136
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:37,910
and stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies.

137
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,691
So now we've talked about the importance of repetition.

138
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:47,012
but we all know that repetition can get pretty stale if we don't approach it creatively. So

139
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:52,478
that brings us to the topic of variation. How we keep our themes feeling fresh.

140
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:57,236
Let's approach this subject from a much more cheerful perspective.

141
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,458
To date, I've worked on six LittleBigPlanet games,

142
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:04,241
four in the main franchise, and two downloadable content games.

143
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:08,663
And while the music in LittleBigPlanet can be very melodic,

144
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:12,906
the melodies don't tend to be repeated from one level to another.

145
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:16,448
Because of this, the music has a very episodic quality,

146
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:19,630
which actually suits gameplay in LittleBigPlanet pretty well.

147
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:24,798
Sackboy moves from one world to another, and the music completely changes.

148
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,862
However, there are a few exceptions to this rule,

149
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:32,930
and it's actually a good example of theme and variation in the LittleBigPlanet universe.

150
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:39,489
In Little Big Planet PS Vita, developed by Tarsier Studios for Sony Computer Entertainment

151
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:46,354
Europe, Sackboy explores a world called the Land of Odd, which includes Marianne's garden

152
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:48,796
of living puppets and clockworks.

153
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:54,160
The music I composed for this level included a melody featuring the sound of clockworks

154
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,681
and an ingenue voice.

155
00:14:56,322 --> 00:15:03,186
Now later on in the game, that same melody returns during a boat race, except now it's twice as hyper

156
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:07,149
and it's carried by a zany trumpet. So let's see what that was like.

157
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:37,743
While repeating melodies are few in the LittleBigPlanet universe, they definitely stand out and get

158
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:42,770
noticed when they appear, especially when they're expressed in dramatically different

159
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,192
instrumental arrangements.

160
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:47,347
Now, not all projects are going to offer the opportunity

161
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:50,730
to introduce such extreme variation.

162
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,074
It's an example of how far the variation technique can go.

163
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:57,236
And when variation isn't enough

164
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:58,898
and we need to go further than that,

165
00:15:58,898 --> 00:16:01,420
we can actually break our themes apart

166
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,222
and use fragments instead of the whole.

167
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:08,483
Now, the music I composed for the video game Spore Hero was very thematic,

168
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,524
including lots of repeating melodies.

169
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:13,225
One of the most important of these melodies

170
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:16,666
figured prominently in the main theme of the game.

171
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:21,347
And it was actually a pretty long melody that took a while to fully state.

172
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,668
So it was kind of a puzzle trying to figure out

173
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:29,229
how to make such an extended melody recur in the body of the game.

174
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:34,110
Now, when it wasn't possible to state that melody in its entirety,

175
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:42,993
I used it as a highly recognizable fragment that consisted of these five notes.

176
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:49,135
This five-note fragment was really useful in the body of the Spore Hero score.

177
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:53,036
Now, here is that five-note fragment as it was used in the game's opening menu.

178
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:07,802
And here's that same melodic fragment as it was used in the character creation menu.

179
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:21,805
Likewise, here's that five-note fragment again as it appeared

180
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:25,166
in the game's most important and frequently used stinger.

181
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:35,009
And finally, here's a little fun fact.

182
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:39,030
The Spore Hero theme gets really dramatic and epic

183
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,871
as you get towards the end of the game.

184
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:43,512
And it was actually this version of that melody

185
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:45,733
that was licensed from the publisher

186
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:49,035
and was used in a trailer for Avengers Endgame.

187
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,255
So here's what that was like.

188
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:27,947
It just goes to show that a flexible theme can be used in a lot of different ways, especially

189
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:30,449
when we break it down into fragments.

190
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:37,074
So now that we've taken a look at theme fragmentation, let's briefly consider how themes can enhance

191
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,935
different kinds of gameplay types.

192
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:46,261
We typically see recurring themes used frequently in story-driven narrative moments, especially

193
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,402
during cutscenes in cinematics.

194
00:18:49,023 --> 00:18:53,345
For instance, I composed the music for the Legend of the Guardians video game,

195
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:58,429
and I made sure in that musical score that that main theme melody was prevalent

196
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:03,151
during the game's start sequence and in its cinematic opening credits.

197
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:36,218
However, the role of music goes beyond cinematic uses.

198
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:39,641
While themes, well, they can propel a storyline,

199
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:42,043
using themes more frequently than that

200
00:19:42,043 --> 00:19:46,547
can also reinforce the identity of the game we're scoring

201
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:49,390
and serve as a musical signature for it.

202
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,951
For instance, while the main theme

203
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:53,734
was important during cinematic sequences,

204
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,957
the main theme melody also appeared prominently

205
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:58,058
during combat as well.

206
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:15,996
Themes can work during action, even in a game that isn't particularly narrative-focused.

207
00:20:15,996 --> 00:20:21,080
A good example of this is the Speed Racer video game based on the Wachowskis movie.

208
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,244
Now, it's really not a story-driven game, but nevertheless, my main theme melody is

209
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:32,028
just all over the place, in the opening cinema, during the races, and even in the end credits.

210
00:21:00,562 --> 00:21:14,467
These kind of recurring thematic uses can be employed during exploration, too.

211
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:19,589
In some of my music for the original God of War from Sony Computer Entertainment, I composed

212
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:25,251
an atmospheric choral theme that was used in some of the grander locations in the game.

213
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:17,440
As game composers working to incorporate themes into our scores, repetition really is our friend.

214
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,823
Repetition makes a musical theme more memorable. Now with that in mind,

215
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:28,065
it can be useful for us to create a rationale for why a musical theme is recurring.

216
00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:31,197
You'll remember the Stand With Me theme

217
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:33,259
that I composed for Homefront the Revolution.

218
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:37,103
It was used in moments of inspiring patriotism

219
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:39,465
and self-sacrifice.

220
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:42,127
So that became the underlying meaning

221
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,530
that that musical theme was meant to convey.

222
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,972
And it guided me in terms of choosing

223
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:48,954
when that theme should be repeated.

224
00:22:49,858 --> 00:22:55,360
For the four-chord theme from Assassin's Creed Liberation, I knew that I had a memorable hook

225
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,541
that could help to reinforce the identity of the game and provide a strong musical signature for it,

226
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:07,322
but I did want a clear narrative association that was going to guide me when choosing when that

227
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:14,984
theme should recur. With that in mind, I decided to use the four-chord theme in moments of

228
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:19,365
revelation, when mysteries were solved and secrets were discovered.

229
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:26,307
Here are a couple of examples of how the four chord theme functioned as a truth revealed.

230
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:28,988
But look at me now in the light of truth.

231
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:35,089
You, who know so well the pain of a life lived in secret,

232
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,650
shrouding your power in petticoats and lace,

233
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,191
pretending obedience to men who deny you the right to your own abilities.

234
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:46,012
Am I really so strange to you?

235
00:23:49,114 --> 00:23:55,198
Foxglove, you killed my father with your care and your tonic.

236
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:58,380
Why? Because he never truly loved you?

237
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,663
And Jeanne, my mother?

238
00:24:02,663 --> 00:24:07,386
So now we've discussed the importance of repeating musical themes

239
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:11,909
using the variation technique and also fragmentation

240
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,530
to support different gameplay types.

241
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:19,075
So now let's explore what happens when musical themes

242
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:21,338
are employed within more complex

243
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:24,201
interactive music constructs.

244
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:27,805
Interactive music systems are fantastic ways

245
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:31,550
to make music feel more responsive to player choice.

246
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:38,406
However, these interactive music systems can throw up big roadblocks when it comes to thematic

247
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:40,486
composition choices.

248
00:24:40,486 --> 00:24:47,208
Here are a couple of examples within two different systems, one where a thematic approach encountered

249
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:51,849
some roadblocks, and another in which the going was a bit smoother.

250
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:54,930
First, let's talk about horizontal resequencing.

251
00:24:55,737 --> 00:25:02,779
Imagine a piece of music as a deck of cards, with each card representing a short section of music.

252
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:07,920
Now imagine that the game can shuffle those cards whenever it wants,

253
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:14,222
changing the order of musical events. Now that's horizontal resequencing in a nutshell.

254
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:19,323
As a composer, it can kind of feel like we're constantly drawing a joker or a wild card.

255
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:24,685
It makes things really unpredictable, which makes thematic writing hard to pull off.

256
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:31,125
Here's an example. In Spore Hero there is a dancing mini-game that has your character

257
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:36,288
competing against other non-player characters. The music is structured so that it can switch

258
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:40,911
smoothly from generalized dancing to more special moves.

259
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:46,135
When I originally composed the dancing music, I incorporated the main theme melody into

260
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:47,876
it. Here's what that sounded like.

261
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:05,356
Unfortunately, when the game switched over to the specialized move, that melody would be abruptly cut off.

262
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,938
And, well, that just really didn't work.

263
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:11,762
So we ended up just removing that main melody altogether.

264
00:26:11,762 --> 00:26:14,244
Now here's what the final dancing minigame was like.

265
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:31,156
The final result, it worked well.

266
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,540
And the interactive music system functioned the way it should,

267
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,144
but it also temporarily stopped reinforcing

268
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:40,647
the musical identity of the game.

269
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:42,729
Now fortunately, as we've previously discussed,

270
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:45,553
there were lots of other opportunities in Spore Hero

271
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:48,736
to assert that defined musical signature.

272
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,568
Now, in another project, I tackled a similar issue

273
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:55,390
from within a very different interactive music system,

274
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,850
vertical layering.

275
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,212
So let's imagine music as a game of Jenga.

276
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:02,493
Picture a tower of wooden blocks.

277
00:27:02,493 --> 00:27:06,515
Now, imagine the game can pull blocks out of that tower

278
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:09,958
or add blocks to the top of the tower at any time.

279
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:13,421
And that's what vertical layering really is all about.

280
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:17,604
The music is stacked in simultaneous layers,

281
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:21,107
and the system adds or subtracts those layers.

282
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:26,331
This can pose challenges when we're trying to compose thematically.

283
00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:32,714
Case in point, during my work on Little Big Planet 2, I composed a jazz track that featured

284
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:36,157
an extensive melody that was carried by scat vocals.

285
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:43,961
The scat vocal layering allowed me to write a well-defined, extended melody line.

286
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:48,224
However, I did have to account for the fact that the system could just shut this melody

287
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:49,145
off at any time.

288
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:56,208
like pulling a block out of that tower of Jenga, I had to make sure that my whole tower wasn't just

289
00:27:56,208 --> 00:28:04,133
going to fall down. So I structured the supporting instruments so that they would carry a subtle

290
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:11,217
melodic line that felt like a simplified version of the foreground theme. That way the main melody

291
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:15,800
could be stripped out and the music would still work. So here's a taste of that.

292
00:28:17,117 --> 00:28:17,377
Oh

293
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,551
Thematic writing for interactive systems,

294
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,771
it can be tricky.

295
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:43,893
Sometimes it really works and sometimes it just doesn't.

296
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:46,114
When it doesn't work, we have to be ready

297
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:48,575
to discard the thematic hook

298
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:50,576
in favor of the interactive construct

299
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:52,797
so that it can properly function

300
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,878
if that seems like the right decision.

301
00:28:54,878 --> 00:28:59,099
Now, conversely, we can set aside some interactivity

302
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:02,160
in favor of satisfying thematic content

303
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,821
if that seems like the right choice.

304
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,408
The choice is never really an easy one.

305
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:11,874
So now we've discussed the nature of musical themes.

306
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:16,537
We've considered how a thematic hook can grab our listeners' attention.

307
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:19,979
We've looked at how overtly melodic lines can soar

308
00:29:19,979 --> 00:29:24,923
above their arrangements and how more subtle thematic elements can insistently

309
00:29:24,923 --> 00:29:30,286
burrow into our minds. We've explored the power of repetition.

310
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:36,151
We've thought about variation and fragmentation that can help keep things

311
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:37,071
feeling fresh.

312
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,808
When they recur, we've pondered the role of themes in different types of gameplay scenarios,

313
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:50,938
and we've examined the pros and the cons of using thematic material within interactive music systems.

314
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:57,470
Themes can serve as the musical signatures for the games for which they were written.

315
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:04,293
As game composers, if we decide to compose thematically, then we have to commit to that

316
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:11,396
approach and use every technique and tool at our disposal to maximize the effectiveness and

317
00:30:11,396 --> 00:30:18,378
the power of our themes. I hope you've enjoyed my talk today. Thanks very much for watching.
