00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:16,793
Hello and welcome to Inclusive Marketing for Indies, how to be intersectional.

2
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,386
I'll introduce myself before I get started.

3
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:24,047
My name is Melissa Chaplin, and I'm a consultant at Robot Teddy.

4
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:28,668
Before I started in this role, I have a background

5
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:30,029
in indie games marketing.

6
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,390
Over the past year and a half, I was

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,431
head of client strategy for a PR and marketing agency focused

8
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:38,012
on indie games.

9
00:00:38,012 --> 00:00:40,793
So I worked on a lot of projects.

10
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:48,615
in rapid succession on the strategy side of things. Going further back in my origin story,

11
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:54,036
before that I did a PhD in intercultural communication and intersectional feminism,

12
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:59,838
so that's part of why this topic is so close to my heart and hopefully by the end of this talk

13
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:01,138
it'll be close to yours as well.

14
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:07,327
So what I'm going to speak about today is first of all I'm going to define intersectionality.

15
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:14,616
What on earth does that mean and how are we going to be using it in this presentation?

16
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:19,581
Once we've established that I'll explain what on earth that has to do with indie games

17
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,503
and in particular indie games marketing.

18
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:29,651
When we've got through that initial hurdle, I will apply intersectionality as a framework to

19
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:37,519
different elements of your marketing campaign. So content, communications and community. For each

20
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:44,465
of those, I've got examples of games and projects that I've worked with and how they've approached.

21
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:51,898
an intersectional sort of marketing and how you might be able to apply that to your game as well.

22
00:01:51,898 --> 00:01:55,465
And finally, we'll sum everything up before I let you go.

23
00:01:56,998 --> 00:02:05,002
So what is intersectionality? This is a quite an academic term, but it became quite popular in

24
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:12,785
mainstream culture over the last decade or so. It was originally coined by Kimberley Crenshaw,

25
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:19,587
who's quoted here from Time magazine last year, describing it as a lens or prism for seeing the

26
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:23,789
way in which various forms of inequality often operate together and exacerbate each other.

27
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:31,769
Originally, KimberlÃ© Crenshaw came up with this as a way of explaining how black women

28
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,652
experience oppression, both in terms of their race and in terms of their gender.

29
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:42,255
Over time, since she coined it decades ago, it has grown to include other

30
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:51,351
aspects of identity, so things like sexuality and disability and so on and so forth.

31
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:56,236
So that's what intersectionality means, is an awareness of those different aspects of

32
00:02:56,236 --> 00:03:01,241
people's identity and how they can relate to them experiencing systemic oppression.

33
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:05,564
One earths not got to do with indie games marketing you ask?

34
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:12,966
Well I'm glad you did. I have been pleasantly surprised by how useful I have found my PhD

35
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:19,107
in my job. In particular I have found this grounding in an intersectional approach

36
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:26,809
and that toolkit really useful for approaching difficult decisions and conversations and

37
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:29,130
concepts in marketing.

38
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,611
So the way that I see it, the principles of intersectional marketing are first of all,

39
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:40,612
humility. You can't possibly get everything right and at some point you are going to offend and

40
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:49,315
upset someone and get it wrong, no matter how hard you try. If you start from the point of,

41
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:53,856
I don't know everything and I'm going to mess up sometimes, you will respond much more

42
00:03:53,856 --> 00:03:59,197
appropriately when someone does call you out on a mistake that you've made.

43
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,993
The next one is empathy. You've got to be compassionate and have empathy for other people

44
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:11,936
whose experiences might be different from your own. This is always something you're

45
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:13,937
going to need in any intersectional approach.

46
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:20,702
Finally, inclusivity. You should be trying to be as inclusive as possible if you want to be

47
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:26,527
intersectional. That doesn't mean that your games have to appeal to everyone. It's totally fine if

48
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:32,553
someone doesn't enjoy your game, say, because they don't like the genre. If they're like,

49
00:04:32,553 --> 00:04:34,634
oh well, point and click adventures aren't for me.

50
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:41,980
it isn't okay if they don't enjoy your game because your game is homophobic and you know

51
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,485
or your marketing messaging is homophobic and that's you know upsetting to them and so that's

52
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:54,710
what I mean by inclusivity. So I'll start with that first pillar of content and you know this

53
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:03,077
will give some worked examples. The first way in which content is relevant is representation.

54
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:03,397
Now

55
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:09,938
The reason why this is important is because if your game in itself is, you know,

56
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:16,146
reinforcing prejudice or stereotypes and upholding, you know, inequality,

57
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:20,191
then it doesn't matter how inclusively you try to make the marketing campaign.

58
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:24,015
Ultimately, it's going to fall flat because it doesn't mesh with the game itself.

59
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:32,680
So we'll start by talking about representation in a game that is one of my favourites,

60
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,282
Star Seeker and the Secret of the Sorceress Standoff, and I challenge you to say that

61
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:44,225
three times quickly. This is a murder mystery game, very kind of

62
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:47,627
small but perfectly formed is how I'd describe it.

63
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:54,468
And in it, Star, the main character who you can see on the left here, has pronouns default to

64
00:05:54,468 --> 00:06:02,870
they them. But one of the lovely options that the developer provided was to add in a choice

65
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,751
in the options menu. You could choose any pronouns you wanted for Star. It didn't affect the story at

66
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:13,952
all and doesn't affect their presentation at all. And it's just something that was a real kind of

67
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:15,652
nod to inclusivity.

68
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:21,297
And people really appreciated it and responded to this.

69
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:25,921
You know, reviewers picked up on it when they were writing about the game and said how much

70
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:31,567
they loved this feature. It definitely, you know, made people feel welcome when they were playing

71
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,529
this and I thought it was just a lovely example.

72
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,033
we did highlight it and advised the developer to highlight it on social media because we're like,

73
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:44,416
actually, you know what, that's really cool that you did this. And I think that, you know,

74
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:48,618
he was he was pleasantly surprised that we thought it was that it was even worth mentioning,

75
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:49,859
but it absolutely is.

76
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:57,496
Another game that I want to represent as good for representation is Guildlings.

77
00:06:57,496 --> 00:07:02,078
So we worked with Guildlings on their second installment.

78
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:04,800
It's an Apple Arcade game and it's absolutely fantastic.

79
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,342
If you haven't played it, I really, really recommend it.

80
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:15,426
It is an RPG in which battles are fought with emotions and feelings and mood.

81
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:22,053
It's a lovely game, and one of the things that makes it so lovely is that it has such a diverse cast of characters.

82
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:27,759
So, you know, the characters are diverse in terms of race and ethnicity,

83
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,725
in terms of not being stereotypical, you know, in terms of gender presentation,

84
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:35,007
and in terms of sexuality.

85
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:36,088
One...

86
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:46,812
My fan favorite character from the first installment was this very dashing mailman that you can see on the left hand side of the screen,

87
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:53,274
who is the object of affections of a boy who is one of the playable characters, Chaz.

88
00:07:53,274 --> 00:08:02,697
Chaz has a crush on the mailman throughout, this features in both installments of the game, and the community really loved it.

89
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:05,358
One of the things that I thought was so fantastic about this was,

90
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:12,201
it wasn't made into a kind of tokenistic element. It wasn't like this kind of, oh, and you know,

91
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:16,543
Chaz is gay or coming out or anything like that. It was just like, oh, yeah, you know,

92
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:22,646
obviously Chaz has a crush on the mailman, which, you know, is part of why it was so beloved by the

93
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:29,349
community as a feature because it wasn't there in a sort of obvious, oh, we're making a point

94
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:32,631
sort of thing. It was more just an element of this character.

95
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:37,033
And it was a really great example of representation done right.

96
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,773
I can't recommend this game enough.

97
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:44,135
And I really want to give a shout out here to Wholesome Games,

98
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:50,637
who have specifically said that for them to consider a game wholesome,

99
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:54,939
you know, it can't be upholding any sort of systemic inequality,

100
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,420
you know, and it should be inclusive.

101
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,561
I really I really appreciate that they've said that.

102
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:05,389
That doesn't mean that all intersectional games have to be wholesome, you know,

103
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:10,040
or have the kind of aesthetic that we associate with wholesome. What it does mean is that

104
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:14,783
If you want to consider your game in this sector,

105
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:16,403
if you want to be considered for features

106
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:17,864
and things like Wholesome Direct,

107
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:20,505
which I've worked with several games

108
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:22,306
who have been featured by Wholesome Games

109
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:24,727
and have found it really, really helpful.

110
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:27,988
It's given them massive community boosts.

111
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:30,509
Then you need to be thinking intersectionally

112
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:32,690
in your design and in your comms

113
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,572
because otherwise you will not be considered for this.

114
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:45,355
Another totally separate element of content is the accessibility of a game.

115
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:51,958
And increasingly this is something that journalists are aware of and writing about and picking up on.

116
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,939
And there are a couple of games that I've worked with that I think really stand out here.

117
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:05,662
First of all, Blind Drive, which came out earlier this year, is a game that can be played with no visuals whatsoever,

118
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:11,623
which has made it really accessible for any players who have impaired vision.

119
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:20,365
This is something that was picked up on by reviewers repeatedly as being a really great element of the game.

120
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:26,367
Olly Smith for Pocket Gamer, I've quoted here, who talked about how fantastic it was that this was an option.

121
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:32,551
The very minimal UI that you can see in the screenshot there can be completely turned off.

122
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:35,694
So you can play it just with headphones and no visuals whatsoever.

123
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:46,062
And the other thing that was really wonderful to see was the joy of vision-impaired streamers.

124
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:54,546
when this game came out and some of the launch day live streams and things like that that people did.

125
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:59,449
In terms of its content, it's not a cutesy game at all, intersectional doesn't mean cutesy,

126
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:09,674
but it is a game that has opened up possibilities and was very conscious of accessibility from the absolute beginnings of the design.

127
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,633
Another one I'd like to give a shout out to that isn't so off the wall in its accessibility

128
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:24,197
options, isn't so unusual, is Eater, which is published by Armour Games and is a bullet

129
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,018
hell.

130
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:32,860
ETA was praised in reviews, as you can see from this quote here, for accessibility options. In ETA

131
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:39,641
you can turn your damage up so that you do exponentially more damage, which is great if

132
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:44,802
you're finding it too challenging but you still want an element of risk. You can also toggle

133
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:49,482
invulnerability if you're like me and you just want to enjoy the story but you

134
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:54,583
couldn't get past any of the bosses without that.

135
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:59,666
It's actually a really great option as well because it's not something you have to

136
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:05,288
have on and that's the whole game. You can toggle it so when you struggle you can switch this on

137
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:13,572
and off as needed. Again, not a particularly cute game, although it may look it from the

138
00:12:13,572 --> 00:12:18,835
cat and the little character I've put here, but it's got some quite gruesome villains in it,

139
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:24,478
but this element was something that was really appreciated by a lot of people.

140
00:12:26,602 --> 00:12:36,926
So, okay, fine. We've made a game with intersectional content. We've made something that's progressive and inclusive.

141
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:43,709
What about communications? Like, how do we start to put this into action as we are actively in a marketing campaign?

142
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:50,275
So the first thing I want to say is you should absolutely be reaching out to diverse creators.

143
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:59,221
I've got the logos here for Black Girl Gamers and Rainbow Arcade, who are groups of streamers

144
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:03,544
who are black women in the first instance and LGBTQ in the second.

145
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:13,030
There are diverse creators out there and you should be prioritising having a range of

146
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,611
representation.

147
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:19,907
in the journalists and writers that you contact and also in any influencers and

148
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,852
streamers that you contact.

149
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:28,636
First of all, because it's the right thing to do. But second of all, because you should want to have

150
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:35,037
diverse voices and representation who are playing your game and promoting your game,

151
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:41,438
because that's how you access diverse audiences. Your audience will not be a monolith.

152
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:48,860
You know, gamers are a diverse bunch of people. Increasingly, there are studies that show that.

153
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,781
So as a priority, you should make sure that you are

154
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:56,290
demonstrating that in your PR approaches.

155
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,701
You know, it's good business, it's common sense,

156
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,444
it's also the ethical and moral thing to do.

157
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:13,049
With that being said, there are also other things that you can think about in terms of taking an intersectional approach to communications.

158
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:23,676
And one thing I want to highlight is the attitude that you take to other games, other developers and professionals and stuff like that.

159
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:30,159
And the example I have here is from the Big Adventure event, which was the brainchild of

160
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:38,784
Jordan, who works at HitSense, which is a small indie publisher. The Big Adventure event brought

161
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:45,828
together developers from, you know, loads of different games, hundreds, all of which were

162
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:51,632
adventure games, many of which were not published by HitSense and didn't have any connection to

163
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:52,812
HitSense.

164
00:14:53,933 --> 00:15:04,135
He had since organized this with an attitude of a rising tide brings with it all boats and included

165
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:10,957
developers in this event that maybe wouldn't have had the opportunity, the access, small

166
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:14,378
solo developers who have self-published and things like that.

167
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:22,321
And what happened was that actually the strength of numbers of the event meant that it got some

168
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:26,323
fantastic PR coverage. As you can see, there's an article in Polygon about it,

169
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:32,445
and the developers who participated saw increased sales as a result.

170
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:40,348
I think that one of the wonderful things about indie games is the attitude of camaraderie

171
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:40,909
that we see.

172
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:46,599
I'm sure there are examples of this not happening, but I've been really heartened by

173
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:52,666
how many people I've seen support one another,

174
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,827
how developers share each other's work

175
00:15:55,827 --> 00:16:00,429
and tweet each other's launch announcements,

176
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:04,190
and how there is this sense of shared experience

177
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,312
and support and community.

178
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:16,100
People are not going to buy just one indie game, broadly. They will buy multiple indie games.

179
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:24,585
You will be able to approach things in a much more intersectional way if you look at people as

180
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:34,071
your peers rather than your competition and embrace this community spirit.

181
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:37,600
I'm getting mushy.

182
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,724
I think that this is one of the most wonderful things

183
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:44,008
that we can have as people working with Indies.

184
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:51,258
And it's also a way that we can push back on kind of...

185
00:16:51,859 --> 00:17:02,963
the inequalities of studio size and funding and accessibility to promotional events and

186
00:17:02,963 --> 00:17:08,646
things like that. And I think initiatives like this are fantastic and a really great way of

187
00:17:08,646 --> 00:17:14,568
working intersectionally. So next we're going to talk about community, which is obviously

188
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:17,249
significant for almost every indie game.

189
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:24,405
And I'm going to start with a game that you might not think of immediately on this topic,

190
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:27,649
which is Not For Broadcast.

191
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:30,852
Not For Broadcast is far from a cutesy game.

192
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:36,478
In it, you are managing the news and you have to select camera angles.

193
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:43,021
And in one part of the game there's a streaker on a football pitch and you have to manage the

194
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:49,305
camera angle so that the audience don't see the streaker's genitals. It's not necessarily what

195
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:54,567
you think of as kind of in the same spirit as some of the other games I've mentioned.

196
00:17:56,203 --> 00:18:01,385
But one of the things that was really interesting about this game is that it was very

197
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:08,649
political, very obviously and explicitly political. And that actually sparked a lot of

198
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:14,332
very difficult communications for the developers to have with their community, especially because

199
00:18:14,332 --> 00:18:21,996
people were trying to interpret the game and how it reflects on the developers' personal politics.

200
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:27,698
and actually misinterpreting the developers' personal politics as a result.

201
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:38,040
It's set in a dystopian future and the government in it are a left-wing government.

202
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,502
Now, people started to therefore assume that that meant that the developers really supported

203
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:47,323
far-right movements, which they didn't and they wanted to clarify that.

204
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:54,753
Throughout this process of having to explain and have these conversations,

205
00:18:54,753 --> 00:19:01,080
the developers were always super patient with their community. They never got frustrated,

206
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,826
they were never defensive, they were always very open. I've got a screenshot here from a Steam

207
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:06,186
update.

208
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:14,557
What they wanted to do was really challenge people's sense of comfort in their own ethics,

209
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:20,863
and they also wanted to set up a situation where people who consider themselves to be progressive

210
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:25,508
could look at it and say, well, these people I might have voted for.

211
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:31,828
And that's a really, really difficult thing to deal with in a video game.

212
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:36,393
But the way that the developers approached this was very much with a sense of transparency,

213
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:42,700
with that humility that we talked about earlier, and always being kind of empathetic to the concerns

214
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,044
of the community. So I thought that was just a really great example.

215
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:56,627
Another example of really empathetic community management comes from another game that I love

216
00:19:56,627 --> 00:20:02,349
very much, Weaving Tides, which just came out recently. So a little mention for them.

217
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:09,912
Weaving Tides, I was working with on their Kickstarter campaign,

218
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:12,833
and we were planning to launch, as you can see from the screenshot,

219
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:21,905
in late March 2020, which was around about when the pandemic stopped being something abstract

220
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:29,608
that we were seeing occasionally in the news and started being something really quite scary

221
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:37,632
that was very close to home for us here in the UK and the developers were in Austria.

222
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:50,558
And we had a really tough conversation and a really hard call to make to delay the Kickstarter.

223
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:57,063
But developers felt very strongly and we felt very strongly advising them that it wouldn't be.

224
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:03,771
appropriate or sensitive to launch the Kickstarter when everyone was suffering from such

225
00:21:03,771 --> 00:21:14,645
instability and uncertainty about things like their livelihoods. So we made the decision to delay.

226
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:21,552
and in the end it was absolutely the right thing to do. The Kickstarter went really well a month

227
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:30,201
later, but also the community really appreciated how thoughtful the developers were and they

228
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:31,743
continued to be really empathetic.

229
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:36,605
and thoughtful throughout the entire pandemic.

230
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:43,448
They set it in their Discord so that people could opt out of seeing any updates that referenced COVID-19,

231
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:50,271
particularly if someone's in a Discord because they want an escape from difficult news,

232
00:21:50,271 --> 00:21:56,094
so they wouldn't have to see anything that referenced that.

233
00:21:56,094 --> 00:22:00,396
And that's just an example of how thoughtful they were throughout the whole process.

234
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:05,612
And it's something that I really admired and appreciated about their approach.

235
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:11,480
You know, it was a starting point of trying to make everyone feel welcome and included.

236
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,985
And, you know, it's also reflected in the game, which is lovely.

237
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:20,873
I really want to give this as an example, and this is not a game I worked on at all,

238
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:28,480
but it was such a fantastic moment of intersectional marketing that I just needed to highlight

239
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,462
this here.

240
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:34,986
And I experienced this as a community member, so from the reverse side.

241
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:44,614
Nosea is again a brilliant game. It's a werewolf game but single player and it's on the Nintendo

242
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:51,778
Switch and it was translated from Japanese into English and released in English earlier this year.

243
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:59,761
In that translation process there were some issues.

244
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:07,570
Nosey is broadly, you know, it's quite good for gender representation. Setsu, this character on

245
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,656
the right with the blonde hair, is non-binary. They're one of the main characters that you

246
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:17,221
interact with. This character, Rakyo, on the left is also non-binary.

247
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:26,232
But there was a really uncomfortable scene in the original release, which focused on

248
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:32,753
a discussion of Rakyo's physiology that was not really appropriate, and it felt a little

249
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:35,654
bit misgendering and unpleasant.

250
00:23:35,654 --> 00:23:40,935
And people picked up on this and were talking about it on Twitter, saying, oh, I love this

251
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:42,196
game, but what's that about?

252
00:23:43,196 --> 00:23:49,160
And the people who were tweeting about it hadn't tagged playism at all, but the community manager

253
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:56,824
spotted this and immediately said, thank you for pointing this out. I'm so sorry,

254
00:23:56,824 --> 00:24:03,728
we will fix it right away. And the person who'd made the original comment started saying, oh my

255
00:24:03,728 --> 00:24:09,591
god, I feel bad that you saw this. I tweeted it thinking that you wouldn't be looking.

256
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:16,009
and the community manager handled this absolutely appropriately from an intersectional standpoint

257
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:22,956
and said don't feel bad at all, we screwed up, thank you for bringing this up, we don't want to

258
00:24:22,956 --> 00:24:25,518
cause hurt and suffering.

259
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:31,421
you know, we can't leave it at this. And within, you know, a few days, I think it was that weekend,

260
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:39,285
they had patched the game to alter that scene and make it much more inclusive, you know,

261
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:45,828
to remove the uncomfortable misgendering and, you know, it's a better game for it.

262
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:51,371
This is such a great example of best practice for so many reasons. First of all, because

263
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:59,216
it's made the game better, you know, by listening to this feedback and responding to it swiftly.

264
00:24:59,216 --> 00:25:03,257
It changed it from being something that could have, you know, become a real sticking point

265
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:08,138
for a lot of community members and, you know, made people think less of the game,

266
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:11,319
into something that was dealt with and now people who buy the game, you know,

267
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:15,739
won't even experience that original, you know, misused pronouns.

268
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:24,341
because it's not there. Second of all, you can absolutely see that all of those principles of

269
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:30,883
inclusivity, empathy and humility are at play here. There's no defensiveness or protesting

270
00:25:30,883 --> 00:25:37,464
or anything like that, nor do they ignore the situation. Instead, they absolutely admit

271
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,845
fault straight away and correct.

272
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:46,790
which is, you know, it's all anyone wants really. People don't, you know, if people,

273
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,713
if people call you out on something, if people say this isn't right or this is uncomfortable,

274
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:57,759
it's not because they're trying to hurt you or your game. It's, you know, nine times out of ten

275
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,864
because they actually love you in the game and they want to, they want to help and, you know,

276
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:08,688
help fix a problem. And this is, this is a perfect example of this and how it can be done right.

277
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:18,346
So to sum up the main takeaways from this, because I think it's good to reinforce what

278
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:23,808
the actionable points are, the first thing is that you can use intersectionality as a

279
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:26,910
framework for approaching your communications.

280
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:33,521
you know, when you're doing your marketing, you can use this as just a way of thinking about,

281
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:37,188
you know, how to make decisions, how to frame things,

282
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:40,373
how to understand the viewpoints of your community.

283
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:47,684
The next thing is resist unjust power structures in everything you do.

284
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:52,045
Intersectionality is not something where you can talk the talk if you don't walk

285
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:57,227
the walk. You have to really commit to this.

286
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:59,468
Like I say, that doesn't mean making one type of game.

287
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:02,729
It doesn't mean, you know, that you have to have a certain aesthetic or anything

288
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:07,930
like that. But what it does mean is that you need to think about, you know, am I

289
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,911
helping marginalised people with what I'm doing here or am I hurting them?

290
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:21,736
It's not easy, but it is important and it's something that we all contribute to.

291
00:27:21,736 --> 00:27:26,778
If you're not part of the resistance, then you're part of the empire.

292
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:35,162
Finally, mistakes happen, own them. Even with all the preparation, even if you spend four years

293
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:39,804
doing a PhD on this, you will definitely still have moments where you think, oh,

294
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:46,650
you know, I messed that up, I said the wrong thing, I've hurt someone. If that happens,

295
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:52,775
then the best thing to do is to just own it, let go of any feelings of pride or ego about it,

296
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:59,161
and just approach it with that sense of humility. And that is what will lead you to the best

297
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:04,506
possible outcome for yourself, for your players, and for the rest of your team.

298
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,881
Thank you so much for listening to this.

299
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:12,763
And if anyone wants to ask me any questions

300
00:28:12,763 --> 00:28:16,044
or anything like that, you can find me on Twitter

301
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:19,185
and I'll leave it there.

302
00:28:19,185 --> 00:28:20,886
Enjoy the rest of GDC. âªâª
