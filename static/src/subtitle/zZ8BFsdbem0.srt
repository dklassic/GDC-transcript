1
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,844
Thank you, Ryan.

2
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:07,705
And thank you all for coming.

3
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:12,086
This is a pretty important talk to me.

4
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:14,787
I'm Robin Arnott.

5
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:18,489
I was the sound designer on Antechamber

6
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:20,089
and on The Stanley Parable.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,530
I love those sounds, thank you.

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,411
A few years ago, I've kind of taken my life

9
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:27,252
in a different path.

10
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:29,152
I've been designing this weird experience

11
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:30,573
called Soundself, which I'll be talking to you

12
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:32,654
more about later on in the talk.

13
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:43,313
I found myself moving from spending time with my indie game community, which I love, and

14
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:47,796
also finding myself more and more deeply embedded in the consciousness hacking, transformative

15
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:49,897
technology, neuroscience communities.

16
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:55,538
The endeavor, the exploration that's been really important

17
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:56,859
to me over this last few years

18
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,919
has been kind of a psychonautic endeavor.

19
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,641
It's been, on the one hand, looking at neuroscience,

20
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,841
looking at the ways we can hack consciousness,

21
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:04,562
but on the other hand,

22
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:07,163
deepening into a meditation practice,

23
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:10,804
deepening into a less frequent psychedelic practice,

24
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:15,827
and seeing what I learn about being from these explorations

25
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,007
and how I can apply that stuff to game design.

26
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:21,049
A few years ago,

27
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,113
Before his microtalk session, Rich Lemarchand said,

28
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,315
it's important for us to take inspiration from other games,

29
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,636
but it's even more valuable to take inspiration

30
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:31,897
from outside of games.

31
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:34,819
The other arts, the sciences, and the natural world

32
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,601
can all lead us towards new, marvelous,

33
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:38,662
and beautiful types of game design.

34
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:41,889
What I'm hoping to give you in this talk

35
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,231
is a window into what I've seen,

36
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,794
which is how these psychonaut practices,

37
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,055
meditation in particular,

38
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:53,419
can be rich fountains of inspiration for game design

39
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,880
that I think radically change

40
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,062
what it's possible to do with a game.

41
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,084
So here's what we're gonna talk about.

42
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:01,285
Chapter one.

43
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:05,525
We're going to approach the topic of meditation

44
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:07,046
and sit in silence for a minute or so.

45
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:09,508
For those of you who don't have a meditation practice,

46
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:11,490
don't worry, we can keep our game designer hats

47
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,290
firmly on our head.

48
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:14,612
We're gonna be approaching meditation as a game.

49
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:20,137
Chapter two, we're going to investigate a model

50
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:23,720
of understanding meditation and other

51
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:27,723
psychological experiences that has radically transformed

52
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:29,464
my understanding of what we can do with game design,

53
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:30,165
and that's trance.

54
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:34,580
This is the bulk of the talk, we'll be looking at trance and understanding it.

55
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:39,603
Chapter three, we're going to be going into the design of sound self and seeing how we

56
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:43,505
can take our understanding of trance, or how I've taken my understanding of trance, to

57
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:45,686
design something radical and weird.

58
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,628
And chapter four, we're just going to wrap up with some conclusions.

59
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,371
And at the end here, I've printed, this is a pretty dense talk.

60
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:55,773
There's a lot of stuff I'm fitting into this 30 minutes.

61
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:58,915
So if you lose track or something, don't worry about it.

62
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:04,338
I have some copies of a workbook up here I have for anybody who wants to take what you're

63
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:05,658
learning in this talk deeper.

64
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,880
And there will be a link at the end if you want to download that online.

65
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:12,362
But that's going to take everything here and go way practical with it.

66
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,263
Alright, so without further ado...

67
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:20,386
Chapter 1, in which we approach the topic of meditation and sit in silence for a minute or so.

68
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:25,048
So, please, let's all just close our eyes.

69
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,030
Take a big breath in together.

70
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,832
And a full exhalation.

71
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:36,753
Really enjoy your breath.

72
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:40,494
And push that last bit of breath out of your body.

73
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:43,976
Again, big breath in.

74
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:53,347
Full breath out. Part of what we're doing here is oxygenating your brain.

75
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,734
Now, release control of your breath and just observe it.

76
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:06,059
Notice the sensation of breathing.

77
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,546
And when you notice your mind wandering, and your mind will wander because that is what minds do,

78
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:15,287
just bring it back to the breath.

79
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:22,182
Let's just keep doing this for a few seconds more.

80
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:25,765
When your mind wanders, bring it back to the breath.

81
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:33,170
So keep your eyes closed, please, and keep doing this for a little bit more while I talk.

82
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:38,714
What is it we are doing right now?

83
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:42,677
We're playing a game.

84
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:45,479
This is a game with rules.

85
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,201
Bring your attention back to your breath.

86
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:55,134
What makes this game different from most of the games I think we talk about here

87
00:04:56,335 --> 00:04:57,715
is that playing this game

88
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,658
interacts with our identity structures in some pretty radical ways.

89
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,080
So please open your eyes.

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,141
That was just a simple mindfulness meditation.

91
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:12,903
Identity structures.

92
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,806
So the self as we experience ourself, as we think of ourself.

93
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:22,537
I want you to see that you're doing this right now.

94
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:24,479
You create ourselves.

95
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,881
We create ourself from our thought patterns.

96
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:30,924
The way we think of ourselves radically changes

97
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,706
the actions we take, what is possible.

98
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,590
The habit of identity superficially emerges

99
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,993
from self-reflectivity, excuse me,

100
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,814
self-reflectivity in our mind.

101
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:47,557
In a mindfulness meditation like what we just did,

102
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,766
helps us become aware of fluctuations in the mind, like our identity, and disidentify with

103
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:55,686
those fluctuations.

104
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:06,636
And when we stop identifying with mental fluctuations, especially identity, there are some really

105
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:09,478
exquisite states of consciousness available to us.

106
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:13,913
and I got drawn into this discipline of trance design

107
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:18,236
just simply because I thought mystical experiences

108
00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:21,838
were really cool, and I wanted to understand

109
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,760
how our minds normally operating one way

110
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:27,121
can access mystical experiences,

111
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:28,782
and I wanted to be able to make these experiences

112
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:31,204
more available to me and available to other people.

113
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:35,006
So, a mystical experience.

114
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:37,548
This is a great quote from Aldous Huxley

115
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:39,649
speaking about an experience he had on mescaline.

116
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:45,140
Visual impressions are greatly intensified and the eye recovers some of the perceptual

117
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,024
innocence of childhood when the sensome was not immediately and automatically subordinated

118
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:50,765
to the concept.

119
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:55,129
Interest in space is diminished and interest in time falls almost to zero.

120
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:05,018
In Catherine McLean's research on psilocybin, she found there were six characteristics

121
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:10,557
that were very common in people's mystical experiences.

122
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:12,819
Those are a sense of unity, that is,

123
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,880
there's no me, there's no you, there's no world,

124
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,282
there just is this one thing that is life.

125
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:20,985
A perception, an intuitive sense

126
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:24,608
that what we are experiencing is deeply true.

127
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:26,809
If you ever hear somebody saying

128
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,571
they had an experience that felt realer than real,

129
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:30,612
this is what they're talking about.

130
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:36,787
A quality of sacredness, especially for people approaching their practices or approaching

131
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:40,449
their experience of mystery from a religious background.

132
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,831
A positive mood.

133
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:49,935
My favorite description I've heard of the positivity that comes in these experiences

134
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:54,377
comes from Jill Bolt Taylor in her TED Talk, which I think is the most watched TED Talk

135
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:56,979
on TED.com still, which is my stroke of insight.

136
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,040
She describes...

137
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:02,994
Imagine dropping 40 years of baggage.

138
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:05,095
What freedom.

139
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:12,759
A quality of the transcendence of time and space, this is what Aldous Huxley was talking

140
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:13,680
about in the last quote.

141
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,641
And finally, a quality of ineffability.

142
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,683
Ineffability means it's impossible to describe.

143
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:22,164
So when Aldous Huxley said,

144
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:24,185
when the sensum was not immediately

145
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:26,386
and automatically subordinated to the concept,

146
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:27,447
this is what he's talking about.

147
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,629
Because we communicate with each other with concepts.

148
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,691
And any experience that is not compressed into a concept

149
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:36,793
necessarily cannot be shared

150
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:40,255
through our normal modes of communication.

151
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:44,578
So if we can access.

152
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:52,032
These states of consciousness through drugs, through prayer, through meditation, can we

153
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,352
do that with a video game?

154
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:57,814
And I don't think it will be a surprise to anybody in this room that I think the answer

155
00:08:57,874 --> 00:08:58,714
is certainly yes.

156
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:05,657
But in order to do so, I find it incredibly helpful to understand trance, because trance

157
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:07,398
is the mechanism that will bring us there.

158
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,521
Chapter 2, we use the wisdom of Dennis Weir's trance model to appreciate the multilayered

159
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:14,461
trances of a MOBA.

160
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,576
So, what is a trance?

161
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,579
I think we intuitively know what it means to be entranced.

162
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,322
I wouldn't be surprised if everybody in this room is here because at some point, probably

163
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:30,504
in our childhood, we were deeply entranced by a video game.

164
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:35,146
For me, I remember playing Sonic the Hedgehog on my Game Gear when I was a kid and just

165
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:38,208
falling into the loops of playing the early levels again and again.

166
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,450
I was deeply entranced by Sonic.

167
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:42,131
But

168
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:45,541
What actually is that that's happening?

169
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:50,603
I think all of us here are experts in creating trance more than anybody else in the world.

170
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:55,844
I think game designers know how to entrance people, and I think it really behooves us

171
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,905
to understand what it is we are doing.

172
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:06,808
So I find Dennis Weir's trance model really simple, easy to understand, and practicable.

173
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:12,119
Dennis Weir says a trance is a self-perpetuating mental loop.

174
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,322
So as soon as you have practiced something, like a game mechanic,

175
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:19,403
so thoroughly that you are doing it automatically,

176
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:22,325
you can be said to be entranced, entranced by that mechanic.

177
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:26,487
And the thing with trances, the thing with simple trances like this,

178
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:29,909
is that they tend to dissolve rather quickly.

179
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,331
So in order to get a trance to hold us, take us deeper,

180
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:40,036
We need not just a simple trance, not just a self-perpetuating mental loop,

181
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:44,979
but a network of mutually reinforcing self-perpetuating mental loops.

182
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:49,961
And the more mutually reinforcing self-perpetuating mental loops we have,

183
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:52,863
the more complex the network is,

184
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:56,325
the deeper the trance, the more stable the trance,

185
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,066
the further that trance can take us.

186
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:02,068
And complex trances like this naturally emerge

187
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:04,989
from the meeting of game mechanics with...

188
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:06,773
human psychology.

189
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:10,114
Elegantly interconnected mechanics

190
00:11:10,714 --> 00:11:14,976
tend to give us access to elegantly interconnected trances.

191
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:19,677
So if this sounds a little bit like flow to you,

192
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:23,038
which is a concept we really understand,

193
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:24,399
I think, pretty well in game design,

194
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,979
that we've pretty well internalized,

195
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,780
that's because flow is a type of trance.

196
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,141
But this pattern, these autonomous mental loops,

197
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:34,862
also describe addiction, habit.

198
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,960
meditation, and hypnosis.

199
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:45,407
So this is the tool that I would like to help you guys add to your toolbox.

200
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:52,473
So, our typical sense of self, as we saw it earlier, that identity,

201
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:55,976
is itself just a habit of the narrative mind.

202
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:03,792
Let's look at MOBA. I think MOBAs, like League of Legends, create these really tremendously

203
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:09,016
complex trances. They're fun to play. So what's that trance look like? And I'm going to go

204
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:12,639
through these pretty quickly. You don't need to worry about gathering exactly what's going

205
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:18,583
on here. But I just kind of want to demonstrate how complex a normal video game's trance can

206
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:18,743
get.

207
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,203
So I think in a MOBA, our core trance is we're identifying with a team and working together

208
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:26,304
to move forward, to progress together.

209
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:31,509
And this is reinforced by our attention moving towards optimizing, every decision moving

210
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:33,070
towards an ideal optimal.

211
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:36,353
Our relationship with our hero, our relationship with the map.

212
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:38,235
And it gets more complex.

213
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,796
Our optimization loops are reinforced by every resource.

214
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:43,117
And everything's a resource in this game.

215
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:44,617
Health is a resource, time is a resource,

216
00:12:44,657 --> 00:12:46,158
even attention is a resource.

217
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,019
And every skirmish we have reinforces our relationship

218
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,620
with our hero, with our team, with all of our resources.

219
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,960
So this is already becoming a pretty complex trance.

220
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,821
But every single one of these loops,

221
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:57,882
every single one of them,

222
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:00,382
is itself reinforced by a deeper trance.

223
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:02,503
A trance of paying attention.

224
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:04,864
And this trance is a complex trance.

225
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,399
of our successes and failures.

226
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:10,041
Our successes bring us into paying attention,

227
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,343
reward us for attention because they feel so good.

228
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:14,385
And when we fail, it hurts,

229
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,867
it punishes us for not paying attention.

230
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:19,350
There's time pressure.

231
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,612
So every moment I'm not paying attention

232
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,974
is a moment ceded to the opposing team.

233
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,118
And there's this tension between what is known

234
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:29,319
and what is unknown.

235
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:36,107
So if we're not paying attention, we're going to miss things and not be able to use that information.

236
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:41,111
And all of this creates for a really powerful attention trance that I think you'd be right to label as a flow trance.

237
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,573
So like I said, every single one of these loops,

238
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,936
and just have a look at this and I think you'll see how it happens,

239
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:54,260
every single one of these loops is reinforced by that deep and powerful complex trance.

240
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:58,536
And this trance, and for games like this,

241
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,498
for games as complex as a MOBA,

242
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:04,100
become more complex as we get to learn the game,

243
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,301
as we practice the game.

244
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:12,086
So, I think a good MOBA is really activating us

245
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:12,926
in our narrative mind.

246
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:17,310
We're thinking, we're cooperating with other players,

247
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,411
we're planning and executing on our plans.

248
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,633
And so I like to say that

249
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:25,936
The game meets us in this particular layer of our being.

250
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:28,279
The game meets us in this case on our narrative mind.

251
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,343
But to understand what makes a MOBA like this

252
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:33,526
so entrancing, we need to go deeper

253
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:34,348
than the narrative mind.

254
00:14:36,694 --> 00:14:45,502
And just as our identity, our sense of identity emerges as a trance from our habits of self-reflectivity

255
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:50,927
in our narrative mind, so too does the narrative mind itself emerge from the emotional body.

256
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:56,272
The mind labels emotions, numbing them in a symbolic container so that we're not crippled

257
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:56,713
by fear.

258
00:14:57,193 --> 00:15:00,676
And the mind also helps us understand the causes and effects of our emotions

259
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:05,239
so that we can move intelligently towards the sources of positive emotions

260
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,140
and away from the sources of negative emotions.

261
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,343
So the MOBA is not only meeting us in our narrative mind,

262
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:14,066
it's also strongly meeting us in our emotional body.

263
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:17,788
I think that flow trance I drew out is really an emotional body trance.

264
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:22,366
And activating people in the narrative mind

265
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:23,626
and in the emotional body,

266
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:25,806
I think that's something games do really well.

267
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:28,487
I think that's something we know how to do incredibly well.

268
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,528
So when a game like Journey comes along,

269
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:34,048
they're building on a whole web of knowledge

270
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:36,309
we already have, but they're bringing something novel,

271
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:38,970
they're bringing a novel trance into our emotional body.

272
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,011
These attachment loops that when they executed them

273
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:47,012
were just so powerful in Journey and felt so new too.

274
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:54,355
So I want to go back and look at that game we played earlier when we closed our eyes,

275
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,857
the mindfulness meditation.

276
00:15:57,518 --> 00:16:00,301
The core trance of this is focusing on our breath.

277
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:08,089
It's supported by returning our attention to the breath when we notice that our attention

278
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,652
is straight, which requires the development of a quality of meta-attention.

279
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,783
Now this is not nearly as complex as a MOBA, which is I think why people get bored when

280
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:17,863
they're learning meditation.

281
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:20,765
It doesn't hold on to us like a video game can.

282
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:25,268
But we're using, it's also a different kind of trance from a MOBA and we're going to go

283
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:25,789
into how.

284
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:29,811
So the words we're using here to describe these trances.

285
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:32,539
These are kind of attention words.

286
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:36,623
These are words describing a sort of deeper layer

287
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:38,444
of our being than the words we're using

288
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,086
to describe the trances in a MOBA,

289
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:42,828
which are much more action-heavy, action-oriented.

290
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,010
And this is a fantastically complex trance.

291
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:52,197
So if the mindfulness trance is operating

292
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:53,238
on the domain of attention,

293
00:16:53,258 --> 00:16:55,620
then what is it even is attention?

294
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:56,861
Attention is...

295
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:04,464
the highlighting and the feeding of certain aspects of our felt experience.

296
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:09,506
So even thoughts, you know, the content of your thoughts is certainly something that

297
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:14,088
occurs in our narrative mind, that we experience as narrative mind, but you can feel the feeling

298
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:14,809
of your thoughts.

299
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:19,951
And this is a sense just like heat is a sense, just like smell is a sense, just like the

300
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:20,771
sound of my voice.

301
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:23,472
And

302
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,824
That with thinking, with the qualia of thinking,

303
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:30,330
actually kind of resembles, for most of us anyway,

304
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,655
the qualia of voice, right?

305
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:33,857
It feels like a voice in our head,

306
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:35,080
which is kind of interesting.

307
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:40,796
So what makes the meditation trance different is not only that it's occurring on this deeper

308
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:45,980
layer of our experience, but from this deeper layer of experience, where the trance is embedded,

309
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:51,545
that trance in turn affects the narrative mind by helping us become aware of it.

310
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:56,328
And once we become aware of fluctuations in the narrative mind, the trance in our lower

311
00:17:56,389 --> 00:18:01,333
state of being can now affect the emotional body and calm down there, and so on.

312
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:03,822
And this happens through play.

313
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:05,708
We have a nice pretty map here.

314
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:08,527
It's got those blue colors and everything.

315
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:09,848
It just looks really nice, I think.

316
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:15,210
But this is just a map, and actually exploring this stuff

317
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,251
is done through the play.

318
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,352
The play of, for example, the meditation game.

319
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,554
And I don't think meditation games are alone in doing this.

320
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:22,954
I think we've seen some video games

321
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:26,176
that also do this effect of acting from one layer

322
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:28,457
to dissolve trances on another layer.

323
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:30,438
So, for example, Super Hexagon

324
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,279
is one of my favorite examples of this.

325
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,561
When you're playing Super Hexagon, its trances are definitely not activating you in the narrative mind.

326
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,722
It's definitely not activating you in your emotional body.

327
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,543
It feels less like I'm playing Super Hexagon and more like Super Hexagon's playing me.

328
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:46,843
Did anybody else have this experience with Super Hexagon?

329
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:50,404
Right? Like, there's something pretty crazy going on here.

330
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:52,645
It's acting on a very deep layer of ourselves.

331
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:57,646
And in doing so, it's actually working to kind of fuzz out our narrative mind.

332
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:00,647
In a very different way.

333
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:05,064
The Stanley Parable is activating us in our narrative mind.

334
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:06,624
These are trances in the narrative mind.

335
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:08,225
It's a story, we're thinking about it,

336
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,965
but it ties our mind in knots,

337
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:15,407
having an effect on our sensation of identity.

338
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,868
It's kind of, I kind of think of the Stanley Parable

339
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,828
as being a little bit like a digital zen koan.

340
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,950
So, where are mechanics meet, and stories,

341
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,170
where are mechanics and stories meet the player

342
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,711
in this massively complex trance we call the self?

343
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,465
has a tremendous impact on the player's experience.

344
00:19:34,665 --> 00:19:38,429
But not only the player's experience, who they are.

345
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,571
How our mechanics meet the player

346
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:43,773
at any of these layers of self

347
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:45,635
determines who the player is,

348
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:47,317
who they are practicing being.

349
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,619
And you can meet the player, for example,

350
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:52,161
in the emotional body and have them practicing fear.

351
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,003
Or you can meet them in the emotional body

352
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:55,424
and have them practicing compassion.

353
00:19:56,236 --> 00:20:01,497
If you meet them in the emotional body in such a way that it modifies existing trances

354
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:08,398
or habits in the other layers of their being, then you can effectively reprogram the narrative

355
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:10,039
mind or the higher layers of being.

356
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:14,279
So I'd rather, actually I want to change my vocabulary here a little bit right now.

357
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:17,680
I've been saying higher layers of being, lower layers of being, that's kind of confusing.

358
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,901
Just these lower layers of being, I'm going to start describing them as more subtle, and

359
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,301
these higher layers of being, I'll describe them as more superficial.

360
00:20:24,461 --> 00:20:25,982
They're no less real, but they're more superficial.

361
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,901
So, now's a really good moment, I think, for us to

362
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:35,284
ask some questions about how we might use

363
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:37,646
what we already know about trance here in our game designs.

364
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:43,169
Who am I asking my player to practice being in my game?

365
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:49,314
What structure of trances can continuously support that practice?

366
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:55,278
How is my gameplay setting up and reinforcing these autonomous loops?

367
00:20:56,938 --> 00:20:58,719
And just as importantly, how is my gameplay,

368
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,680
or the player's existing habits,

369
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:02,902
interfering with the trance structure

370
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,142
I'm trying to help them cultivate?

371
00:21:04,603 --> 00:21:08,805
A great example of this is if a player's existing habit

372
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:10,926
of trying to control the world might interfere

373
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:12,807
with a trance you're trying to give them

374
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,748
of humility and surrender.

375
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:18,570
And there are, so I've got a workbook up here

376
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,171
for anybody who wants to, I think I mentioned this earlier,

377
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:22,852
but anybody who wants to go kind of deeper into this stuff,

378
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:24,653
please come up afterwards, grab a workbook,

379
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:26,394
and I've got a lot more questions like this in there.

380
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,157
The upshot of all of this is that by understanding trance,

381
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:33,218
video game designers have a unique skill set

382
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:35,760
and a unique opportunity to design trances

383
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,221
that are as complex and powerful as a MOBA,

384
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:40,523
but operate on the pre-personal level of meditation

385
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:42,564
to alter player consciousness temporarily

386
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:44,746
and create a permanent psychological impact.

387
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:48,148
In other words, we can create digital psychedelics.

388
00:21:52,231 --> 00:21:53,852
And I humbly offer the word,

389
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,333
oh no, I'm not quite there yet.

390
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,929
In 1990, Terence McKenna said, I love this quote,

391
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:02,290
the drugs of the future will be computers,

392
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,410
the computers of the future will be drugs.

393
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,691
And I think we're just beginning to taste how we can do that.

394
00:22:07,771 --> 00:22:08,391
Just beginning to.

395
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,272
And I humbly offer the word technodelics

396
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:15,432
to describe these technological psychedelic experiences.

397
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:17,553
And the rest of my talk is going to concern itself

398
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:19,833
with the creation of technodelics,

399
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:21,674
and specifically my technodelic sound self.

400
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:23,414
Chapter three,

401
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:25,475
Recollections of the Transdesign of Sound Self.

402
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,127
So, does everybody know this game?

403
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:32,568
Most,

404
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:37,551
and maybe all video games provide a structure for the player to project

405
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:38,811
their sense of self into.

406
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:39,932
My avatar,

407
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:41,373
uh...

408
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:46,528
is an extension, is sort of a container for me to project my sense of agency into.

409
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:50,912
And meanwhile, part of the experience is defined as being not me,

410
00:22:51,893 --> 00:22:53,994
as being the environment, as being an enemy.

411
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:58,878
And the funny thing is here, like the trick that the game designers are pulling off without even realizing it,

412
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,540
is that the player is actually controlling the whole thing.

413
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:06,417
If you jump, it's not that Mario jumps up, you're also pushing the world down.

414
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:11,779
There's this awesome trick that happens so naturally where the player projects their identity into your avatar.

415
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,682
So wherever we, as game designers, use our mechanics or our stories to draw a boundary,

416
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:23,545
we invite the player's existing habits of separation to see themselves reflected in that boundary.

417
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:27,218
And I think there are really, really, really cool subversive ways to do this.

418
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:28,318
It's sort of like a glove.

419
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,258
Like, if you see a glove,

420
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,579
and you intuitively know it fits on your hand and you might try it on,

421
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,740
if you see something that looks like a ham,

422
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,360
you're less likely to try it on your hand.

423
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:43,681
But we can design gloves that fit your hand really neatly, like Mario does,

424
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,802
or we can design gloves that fit your hand in kind of an awkward way

425
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:50,723
and make you practice a slightly altered way of being.

426
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:53,299
And you could do that without going all the way

427
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,340
into the sort of techno-dellic craziness I'm about to describe.

428
00:23:57,241 --> 00:24:00,723
So in SoundSelf, I'm trying to do something entirely different.

429
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:03,284
I'm trying to give a player that.

430
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:09,704
mystical experience. Trying to give a player that sense beyond separation, that sense beyond

431
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:15,305
feeling myself against a background of otherness. So, if you're watching someone play Sound

432
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:19,406
Self, there really doesn't seem to be that much going on. They're chanting with their

433
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:24,547
voice and breathing and they're observing the experience and that's it. They just keep

434
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:30,548
doing that. And I'm going to go ahead and try to play you guys a video of somebody playing

435
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:31,068
Sound Self.

436
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:54,338
So that's all it is.

437
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:55,518
That's all they're doing.

438
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,501
And but what they're seeing is this.

439
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:17,229
So it's entirely abstract, and we do that so that there's no images, no symbols there

440
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:19,410
that you could just hang experience and identity on.

441
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,632
Nothing you can decide is an avatar, nothing you can decide is meaningful.

442
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:24,173
It's just abstract.

443
00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:30,797
Alright, if you don't mind giving me just a moment to pull up my stuff.

444
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,400
There we go.

445
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:44,430
Oh no. Sorry guys.

446
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:52,935
Here we go.

447
00:25:52,955 --> 00:26:02,800
Thank you for your patience.

448
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:10,179
Oh no, that's not what I wanted at all.

449
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:13,161
Let's just get past these videos so it doesn't get confused.

450
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:14,562
Here we go.

451
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:17,104
There we go.

452
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:20,506
And I press this button.

453
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,107
It gives me this thing.

454
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:27,011
There we go. Okay, thanks guys.

455
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:30,513
So, like I said, what I'm trying to do for players is

456
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:35,376
give them a mystical experience.

457
00:26:36,683 --> 00:26:44,727
which is an experience of the absence of our typical trances on these more superficial layers of our being.

458
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:50,551
But I notice when I sit to meditate, if I sit in silence for a moment,

459
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:58,335
before I can feel anything beneath my ego, anything beneath my mental fluctuations,

460
00:26:58,735 --> 00:26:59,956
I notice this pattern.

461
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:05,540
It's a habit, maybe a habit,

462
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,981
you could call it a habit of humaning.

463
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:10,665
And this habit of humaning is a very powerful trance.

464
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:12,948
That's a powerful trance that, as far as I can tell,

465
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:16,292
has three extremely powerful sub-trances supporting it.

466
00:27:16,953 --> 00:27:19,575
Firstly, a habit of looking out

467
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:22,319
and finding some things good and finding some things bad.

468
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:24,552
This is just anxiety.

469
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:28,975
Secondly, a habit of time, of imagining a future and a past.

470
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,016
Like right now I'm sitting here and I'm worried about time

471
00:27:31,036 --> 00:27:31,956
because I don't want to run out of time

472
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:34,138
and I want to give you guys all the interesting stuff, right?

473
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:35,919
And this is what that feels like.

474
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,342
And thirdly, a habit of sensing separation

475
00:27:40,782 --> 00:27:45,045
between, most I think, powerfully between self and other.

476
00:27:45,745 --> 00:27:46,966
And if this looks familiar to you,

477
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:48,967
that's because this is exactly the same trance

478
00:27:49,087 --> 00:27:51,349
the MOBA was using to...

479
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:54,370
bring player attention into the experience.

480
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,412
So a game can take these really powerful trances

481
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:59,692
that we have ongoing in our experience

482
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:03,534
and redirect that energy into a focus on gameplay.

483
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,015
But that's not really available to me

484
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:10,097
because I'm trying to disarm those very trances.

485
00:28:10,117 --> 00:28:13,038
So.

486
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:21,758
Here's how, here are some counter-trances that we're using in Soundself to try to dissolve

487
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:22,299
these habits.

488
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:28,184
For the habit of separating, for the habit of being anxious, you just relax somebody.

489
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:31,927
If you just relax somebody, they're going to find themselves less anxious.

490
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:39,173
For the habit of seeing time, by bringing the player's attention into the present, by

491
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:43,536
witnessing the beauty of what's here, we help them just not worry about time.

492
00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:46,429
And the habit of seeing separation is trickier.

493
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:51,030
For that, what we're trying to do in Soundself

494
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,152
is take the existing experience of identity,

495
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,812
the existing experience of selfness,

496
00:28:56,452 --> 00:28:58,873
and redirect that experience from being just in here

497
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:03,215
to including everything I hear and see in the game.

498
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:07,076
So here's what that looks like as Soundself's trance.

499
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,478
And our voice mechanic really powerfully supports

500
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:13,259
each of these three.

501
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:14,933
counter-trances.

502
00:29:16,274 --> 00:29:20,176
Firstly, by having the player practice a yoga quality of breathing,

503
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:23,518
by having them chant and then breathe in,

504
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:27,121
they're slowing down their body, which naturally calms down the physiology,

505
00:29:27,221 --> 00:29:28,922
naturally makes people feel less anxious.

506
00:29:31,043 --> 00:29:32,844
By having the player appreciate the present moment,

507
00:29:34,185 --> 00:29:36,547
oh, excuse me, by having the player chant,

508
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,868
that voice is felt here in the present moment,

509
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:40,269
you know, you feel it right here,

510
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,970
and as long as you're paying attention to your voice,

511
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,271
and you're paying attention to what you're hearing.

512
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:45,486
you're here.

513
00:29:47,547 --> 00:29:48,488
And finally,

514
00:29:48,508 --> 00:29:51,629
we're doing this really weird thing in sound software.

515
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:54,591
Once you begin chanting, there are these sounds,

516
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:57,432
the instruments of the game harmonize with your voice.

517
00:29:57,772 --> 00:30:00,373
So this sense of identity that you already feel

518
00:30:01,394 --> 00:30:03,795
with your voice, with that vibration in your chest,

519
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:07,157
you now associate that quality of me-ness

520
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:08,377
to everything you're hearing,

521
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:10,398
if you're relaxed enough.

522
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,101
And then by creating a synesthetic relationship

523
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:15,182
between everything you're hearing

524
00:30:15,642 --> 00:30:17,844
and everything you're seeing on the screen

525
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,084
or in the VR experience,

526
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:21,706
we further extend that sense of self,

527
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:23,767
that sense of identity to include the visuals.

528
00:30:24,147 --> 00:30:26,508
So we have this synesthetic connection

529
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:29,110
that draws us from our sense of self

530
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,771
as felt as vibration in our chest

531
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:34,353
through what we're hearing, through what we're seeing.

532
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:39,529
So there's a lot more going on in SoundSelf,

533
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:42,250
but I don't wanna go into all of that right now.

534
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,151
I just wanna show you this to show you,

535
00:30:44,391 --> 00:30:46,292
this is a trance that is as powerful

536
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:48,233
as most video game trances.

537
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:53,095
And that gives it a kind of a leg up on meditation trances

538
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:55,176
because we can use the electronic medium

539
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:57,618
to help sustain much more complex trances.

540
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:01,800
All right, so how does SoundSelf fit into this?

541
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,640
I think...

542
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:07,843
Sound-self's trances are occurring on this really deep layer of our being, even below

543
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:12,566
the distinguished senses, because we are affecting the way we experience our distinguished senses

544
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:13,527
in this synesthetic way.

545
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:21,051
So if sound-self's activating a trance on this, beneath our distinguished senses, beneath

546
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:26,114
our sense of sight and sound and so on, and in our just raw, uninterpreted sensation,

547
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:30,236
it is doing so in a way that numbs the narrative mind, that quietens the narrative mind.

548
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:34,848
with lots of weird techniques like we're strobing at them,

549
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:36,989
we're using binaural beats, just loud sounds

550
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:38,609
so that the player can't hear themselves think.

551
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,232
We're using that trance to change the way

552
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:46,433
that the player usually experiences

553
00:31:46,473 --> 00:31:47,534
their distinguished senses.

554
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,515
And we're also doing something,

555
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,015
though I can't pretend to understand what,

556
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:53,197
we're also doing something in the emotional body.

557
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:55,438
Because often I see people come out of sound self.

558
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:01,443
And this is a totally abstract experience and they're crying and that's baffling to me.

559
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:05,884
So I don't know what we're doing exactly but we shake up something in the emotional body and it's worth pointing out.

560
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:16,168
Alright, the difference, the big difference between sound self and I think the big difference between what we can do with technodelics and meditation though is that...

561
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:21,140
Soundself is holding the trance in place.

562
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:24,482
It's not teaching you how to feel

563
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:26,024
into these deep layers of your being.

564
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:29,066
It's just kind of numbing everything with brute force

565
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:31,547
so that you're put there.

566
00:32:32,328 --> 00:32:35,830
Whereas a meditation practice gradually teaches you

567
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,771
to guide yourself into experiencing

568
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,333
our deeper layers of being.

569
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:49,054
I think this makes sound self a lot more like a psychedelic than like a meditation practice.

570
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:51,395
And I think that's an important distinction.

571
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:56,297
And there are many, many, many more layers of self that have been explored.

572
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:57,177
There are many more models.

573
00:32:57,217 --> 00:32:59,038
But this is as far as I'm going.

574
00:33:00,658 --> 00:33:05,300
And if we draw inspiration from meditation techniques that activate us on these very

575
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:11,303
deep layers, then I think we can potentially make video game trances and technodelic trances

576
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:12,623
that activate us on those deep layers.

577
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:16,295
So does it work? Does sound self-work?

578
00:33:16,815 --> 00:33:18,336
From talking to people after playing it,

579
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:20,637
we often see people describe a sense of unity,

580
00:33:20,978 --> 00:33:22,999
we often see people describe positive mood,

581
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,920
transcendence of time and space, ineffability.

582
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,041
I almost never hear people describe

583
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:29,422
an intuitive sense of deep truth or quality of sacredness.

584
00:33:29,602 --> 00:33:30,883
But I think this is great, you know.

585
00:33:31,103 --> 00:33:33,504
I think this is really early technology

586
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:36,026
and it gives me a lot of hope

587
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:38,367
that it's giving people even this much.

588
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:42,148
that it's giving people something even this close to a,

589
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,909
the kind of experience you might get on LSD.

590
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:47,730
And I think with just a few more years of experiments,

591
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,951
a few more projects trying to do something like this,

592
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:52,571
we'll get more of a sense of the successes and failures,

593
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:53,412
what works, what doesn't,

594
00:33:53,652 --> 00:33:55,932
and we'll be able to activate this experience

595
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:58,413
of intuitive deep truth, this quality of sacredness.

596
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:02,174
So finally, and thank you all for your patience.

597
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:04,755
This has been, we've gone a little over 30 minutes,

598
00:34:04,815 --> 00:34:06,195
but I've got some conclusions.

599
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,569
Firstly, game design is an extremely potent form

600
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,113
for healing and self-transcendence,

601
00:34:14,694 --> 00:34:16,397
but unfortunately, most healers

602
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:17,919
are really shitty game designers,

603
00:34:17,979 --> 00:34:20,002
and most game designers are not interested in healing.

604
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:27,383
If you want to use trance but you're not interested in techno-delic design, like I am,

605
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:32,026
there are a couple of things you could do, and I go into a lot of stuff like that in this workbook,

606
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:37,651
but there's a few things you can do really easily just to give them a powerful experience.

607
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:40,793
And I think one of those things is bringing the player's attention back to the present moment.

608
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:45,437
If your mechanics, if the trance you lay in the player

609
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:50,681
draws them continuously back to the present moment, you're doing a real kindness for them.

610
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,771
And if you find existing trances and either disable them,

611
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:57,613
subvert them, or incite them in novel ways,

612
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:59,495
I think you're also doing something really awesome for them.

613
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:01,156
This is that glove metaphor.

614
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:06,379
What we can design is a direct extension of who we are.

615
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,502
So if you want to design new, radical, different things,

616
00:35:11,363 --> 00:35:12,884
you have to become aware of the trances

617
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:13,864
you're carrying with you,

618
00:35:13,924 --> 00:35:16,086
because those trances are encoding themselves

619
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:17,266
in your game designs already.

620
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:20,666
And I think two easy ways just to like,

621
00:35:21,627 --> 00:35:23,048
try on different trances, you know,

622
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:24,490
try different meditation techniques,

623
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,551
try different stories.

624
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:27,312
These things all program us in different ways

625
00:35:27,813 --> 00:35:31,296
and expose us to new trances.

626
00:35:32,016 --> 00:35:33,778
And there are plenty of meditation techniques

627
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,940
that just help us become aware of the trances

628
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,961
we've been carrying with us for our whole lives.

629
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,480
Please come up here and take one of these workbooks

630
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,840
if you're interested, but if not,

631
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,401
on the next page I've got a little link for it.

632
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:48,901
And finally, trance is a really, really, really,

633
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:51,922
really powerful form.

634
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,242
So please just be kind.

635
00:35:55,483 --> 00:35:56,183
Here's some resources.

636
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:58,103
For anybody who's interested in learning more

637
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,964
about this stuff or finding a community of people

638
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:02,004
who are using technology to alter consciousness,

639
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:04,985
tomorrow night there's a consciousness hacking meetup group.

640
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:06,545
I'll be there, I'd love to see you here.

641
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:08,965
Thank you very much.
