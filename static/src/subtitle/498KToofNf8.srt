1
00:00:06,829 --> 00:00:08,590
Hey everybody, my name's Pete.

2
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,872
I'm an art director at Epic Games.

3
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:14,835
I grew up drawing, got into computer graphics

4
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:18,178
while I was exploring architectural and technical drawing

5
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:19,198
as a high school student.

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,442
I graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design in 2000.

7
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,043
I've been making games since then.

8
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:27,545
And I came to Epic in 2005

9
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:30,307
because I really wanted to make sci-fi art.

10
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:32,769
I began as a high poly modeler.

11
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:35,511
I was focused on props and environment art.

12
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:40,133
And most of my work was for Unreal Tournament 3

13
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:41,574
and the Gears of War series.

14
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:43,835
You can see on the screen a bunch of the stuff

15
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:44,955
that I made back in the day.

16
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:50,398
And in 2011, we built a small team to develop Fortnite.

17
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:52,979
And I've been on the team since then.

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,901
I wanted to ask you guys, who all has played Fortnite?

19
00:00:58,842 --> 00:00:59,062
Wow.

20
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:01,023
That's pretty awesome.

21
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:06,194
So over the years, Fortnite has been worked on

22
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:08,896
by a ton of amazing game developers.

23
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:12,358
I wanted to come here today and present

24
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:14,120
a lot of the work that shaped Fortnite

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,020
into what it is today.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,982
And I'm gonna start with our gritty,

27
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:21,305
more serious art style that we had way back at the start,

28
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:24,687
and talk about how we hit our initial stylized approach,

29
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:27,669
and then how we iterated and refined

30
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,971
our environments and characters

31
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:32,333
through our launch period of.

32
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:34,416
Fortnite saved the world last summer.

33
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:39,359
So the original concept of Fortnite,

34
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:40,760
I'm gonna read this.

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,762
It's a survival horror game that makes third-person action

36
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:46,703
built around social fortifications

37
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:48,444
in a dynamic day-night cycle.

38
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,826
Scavenge by day, defend at night.

39
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,167
It's Minecraft meets The Walking Dead

40
00:01:53,387 --> 00:01:56,169
in an HBO-styled world where loners die quickly

41
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:58,210
and extinction is just a heartbeat away.

42
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,371
Social survival, work together or die alone.

43
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:08,900
These are some of the original mood boards and reference that we put together built around that concept.

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,447
We had the idea that the world was going to be scary and overwhelming, shrouded in mist,

45
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:24,736
and be really claustrophobic and lead to a lot of just really high-tension, high-intensity gameplay.

46
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:30,035
I'm pretty sure when I was putting this deck together

47
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:31,816
and going through all of our old stuff,

48
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:35,537
this is the very first Fortnite screenshot ever.

49
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:39,418
These are our original white box prototype meshes

50
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,439
that were made to prove out the building system

51
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,760
and our walls and how these things would fit together

52
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,261
on a modular grid so that we could construct the game.

53
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,863
We were really excited about getting going

54
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:55,383
and getting straight into development.

55
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:59,207
We went straight into doing concept art and paint overs.

56
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:03,330
We went with a lot of the typical things you would expect

57
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,252
from the initial mood boards of a lot of gray and brown,

58
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:10,354
a lot of really industrial looking things, pretty drab,

59
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:15,538
but also the intent was there to reinforce the initial mood.

60
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:19,160
We also may have invented the stranger things creature

61
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,741
up in the sky, don't tell anyone.

62
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,891
One of the things we knew we wanted to do

63
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:29,352
was make really, really awesome creatures.

64
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:34,956
And we started off with this concept of the creatures

65
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:37,117
that come out of the mist and are there

66
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,558
to basically eat your soul.

67
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,581
So that's what that guy does is he is the soul taker.

68
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:45,623
And we've got some other cool original concepts

69
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:48,065
of some of the original creature ideas,

70
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,207
including the guy who later became the Smasher.

71
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:52,868
You can see him down there with his big.

72
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,260
tree trunk hammer fist thing.

73
00:03:57,383 --> 00:03:59,486
And part of the initial brief of the project, too,

74
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:02,370
is that we wanted to have a zombie element.

75
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:07,733
We weren't quite sold on that idea because we were like,

76
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:09,454
it's 2011.

77
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:11,435
Everybody's making zombie games.

78
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:13,736
Are we really going to do a zombie game?

79
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:15,096
We've got to make it unique.

80
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:16,177
We've got to make it our own.

81
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:19,458
So we came up with the idea that the zombies would also be

82
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:21,919
a part of this whole Myst supernatural element.

83
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,541
So the zombies were basically all possessed by the Myst.

84
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:26,521
And you can see their.

85
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:29,943
you know, rotting flesh and missed legs

86
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,064
coming out of the front,

87
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,326
and the guy's skull has popped out of his mouth,

88
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:37,107
and he's definitely looking pretty freaky.

89
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:42,330
We also started building up our environment art as well

90
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,472
to prove out that we could take

91
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:45,872
those initial prototype meshes

92
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:50,495
and make them into usable assets to build a world with.

93
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:53,917
So these are our first environment shots

94
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:54,938
out of Unreal Engine 3.

95
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:59,316
So as we were putting this all together,

96
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:01,380
we got to a point in the development of the game

97
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,646
where we knew that we were doing this dynamic

98
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:08,053
day-night cycle, we had dynamic building and destruction.

99
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:11,020
And one of the things that I had started looking at,

100
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,661
trying to figure out, was how are we

101
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:16,883
going to make a realistic, immersive version of breaking

102
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:19,905
down walls, the idea of I'm pickaxing into a wall,

103
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:23,427
and it's going to start to erode away the wall right where I'm

104
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:23,827
hitting it.

105
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:27,349
And there's going to be structural beams and wires

106
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:30,131
and insulation and all the crap that's inside a wall.

107
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:32,012
And they were like, how do you do that?

108
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:35,173
I still don't even know how I would do that.

109
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:37,415
So we were thinking about that.

110
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:43,135
And we were also thinking about what we were going to do

111
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:45,356
for the long-term of the project.

112
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:50,217
And as much as the initial art approach was really cool

113
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:52,337
and something that we all liked a lot,

114
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:53,917
we were all passionate about it,

115
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,198
everybody was excited about it,

116
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:57,798
we knew it wasn't the right choice.

117
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:01,019
We were thinking about long-term games,

118
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:04,660
games as a service, free-to-play games,

119
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,180
these types of things that people would engage with

120
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:11,310
hundreds of hours, if not years of engagement.

121
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,171
And what we saw was a lot of those games

122
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,253
tended to be brighter or more stylized.

123
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:20,355
And we even had some data from back in the Gears of War days

124
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,097
that people would gravitate towards our brighter

125
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:24,998
multiplayer maps as opposed to the ones that

126
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,341
were more of a gray-brown, desaturated, bleak type

127
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:29,681
of feel.

128
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:35,544
So we went back to the drawing board on some concept art.

129
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:36,365
And.

130
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:40,564
One of our guys came up with this amazing piece of art that,

131
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:43,289
the moment I saw this, I was like, hell yeah,

132
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,692
we have got to make this.

133
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:51,894
It was such a cool combination of taking some of the core feel of the project and that mix

134
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:57,697
of like apocalyptic stuff and dirty stuff but also putting this really fun stylized

135
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:02,779
sweeping gestural form to the main shape of the building and getting bright sunlight and

136
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:09,322
blue sky and a lot of just really beautiful elements mixed in with how kind of horrifying

137
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:10,242
the core idea was.

138
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,026
So we got into more building sketches.

139
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:20,207
And you guys can see, if you've played Battle Royale,

140
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:23,328
that's the first version of Tomato Town right there.

141
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,689
He was actually a clown instead of a tomato guy.

142
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,051
And we started doing environment props.

143
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,692
These started to reflect some of the same shapes

144
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:35,873
that we were seeing in that big, huge, sweeping

145
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:37,033
building form.

146
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:41,825
We have a lot of these props, kind of as they're shown here

147
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:45,948
today, but we've pulled back from some of the human bits

148
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:48,470
inside trash cans is not something we're doing anymore.

149
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:53,214
We declared pretty early on that we wanted to shoot for a

150
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:53,854
teen rating.

151
00:07:53,954 --> 00:07:58,978
So if you want a teen rating, stay away from dismembered body

152
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,559
parts and blood in your game.

153
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,402
As part of figuring this out.

154
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,712
we took a bunch of the existing props that we had

155
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:10,493
and started just putting free-form deformations on them

156
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:11,694
inside 3D Studio Max.

157
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:14,835
This felt pretty weird and unnatural to me,

158
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,496
given how I sort of thought about things back then

159
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:21,798
and how these were all objects that were designed

160
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:23,198
and engineered to be a certain way,

161
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:25,519
and then we were just taking them and warping them out

162
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,720
and making them look kind of funny and broken,

163
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,641
but eventually we got used to it.

164
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,819
We also took our photo source textures

165
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,299
and we started doing a lot of Photoshop work

166
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,641
and cut out filters and layering the cut out

167
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,761
filtered versions on top of themselves over and over

168
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:46,143
to get more clear color separations

169
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:49,965
into the shapes of the original photo source textures

170
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:54,667
and also ramping up the colors and brightness and saturation.

171
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,252
and some of the other initial modular building pieces

172
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:04,114
we took and started bringing in some of that

173
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:05,856
really cool expressive shape language

174
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,137
into the window frames and door frames.

175
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:09,939
Even though we knew we were gonna stick

176
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,082
with the grid-based approach where all of our modular pieces

177
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:17,945
have these very rigid square edges,

178
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,688
we felt we could bring that feeling

179
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,789
of the original concept art into the world by.

180
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:29,354
just bringing that gestural form into all of the shapes

181
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:33,435
that exist inside each sort of atomic unit.

182
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:37,277
So pretty quickly, we were able to get

183
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:41,038
from that initial exterior feel to this,

184
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,439
and the interior to this.

185
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,281
And all of this was starting to feel a lot brighter,

186
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:50,722
a lot more fun.

187
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,192
It was still very set in the lighting and post-process and

188
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:58,152
how the fog is.

189
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:05,535
This hasn't proven out the full style of where we're at

190
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:09,376
today, but we kept making some content in this style.

191
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:12,557
We got our initial tomato town pizza clown guy.

192
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:18,219
And we also, pretty early on, felt the need to prove out.

193
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,311
the idea of building out tons of props to reinforce

194
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:24,872
the believability of the space and figure out

195
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,234
what are we actually gonna fill this world with

196
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,755
that players can harvest and gather their resources

197
00:10:30,855 --> 00:10:35,076
and can we actually make this world,

198
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:36,957
as it gets more and more cartoony,

199
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,638
still feel believable and natural

200
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,980
and something where players have a mapping in their mind

201
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,740
of I understand where I am

202
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,501
because these are clearly kitchen props.

203
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:54,685
These are the first stylized character concepts

204
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:55,745
that were done for Fortnite.

205
00:10:56,585 --> 00:11:00,167
They're really cool, but also weren't quite hitting

206
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:02,027
the sort of teen rated feel or

207
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:06,749
the sort of endearing quality that we were going for.

208
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:08,850
We did like the guy with the skull hoodie,

209
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,651
so we took him and refined him a bit.

210
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:13,952
And we got to our initial concept

211
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:15,252
for our first Fortnite guy.

212
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:19,594
And what we liked about this was just how clean

213
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:20,554
his silhouette got.

214
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:24,715
and how a lot of the sort of grimy details were cleaned up,

215
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:28,517
but he still had a little bit of that scavenger

216
00:11:28,577 --> 00:11:29,617
kind of badass feel.

217
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:33,058
So we went in and we modeled him

218
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:35,699
and it turned out really cool seeing this guy

219
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,840
with these really cool elongated proportions

220
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,282
and feeling like a really, really cool stylized scavenger.

221
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:46,443
So we got him in the game and there he is.

222
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,204
We also went back over our creatures.

223
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:54,287
And instead of making them terrifying,

224
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:55,807
they're a little bit, you know,

225
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,467
they're still scary to some degree,

226
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:01,188
but they have more of a sense of mischief about them.

227
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:06,189
And more, we used simpler line work in them,

228
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,709
and we started bringing in some of the swirling shapes,

229
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,430
like you can see on the guy's claw hands,

230
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,611
more of that swirl shape that reinforces the idea

231
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,151
that they were coming from the mist.

232
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,088
And we also toyed with the idea of doing more of a standard

233
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:25,030
zombie guy in a sort of funky way.

234
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,993
But we eventually realized we loved our original husk design

235
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,414
so much that we had to do a stylized pass on him as well.

236
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:36,156
So you can see we cleaned up all the gore and gross stuff.

237
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:37,317
We cleaned up the silhouette.

238
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:39,118
We simplified a lot of the details.

239
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:44,481
But we had to keep the skin hoodie, which was one of the,

240
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:48,063
I guess, the iconic feature of this guy as a zombie design.

241
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:51,085
And that's been there since the beginning.

242
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:55,447
So we modeled this guy out, and we modeled out the rest of

243
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:56,007
our creatures.

244
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:59,129
And we got everything up and running in UE3.

245
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:07,033
And after we got to that point, we announced the game

246
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,114
at the VGAs in 2011.

247
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:10,675
And we had a cinematic trailer for that.

248
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:13,937
Shortly after that, we constructed a

249
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:15,178
sizzle reel internally.

250
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:17,299
And this is like.

251
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:21,357
the oldest real gameplay video I could find of Fortnite,

252
00:13:21,737 --> 00:13:24,842
and I wanted to just share it with you guys.

253
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:26,705
It's two minutes and a half long,

254
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,087
and I'm just gonna let it play.

255
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:49,821
We really liked that Durrberger head.

256
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:50,881
It's pretty awesome.

257
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:56,323
So this is a good time to talk about how

258
00:15:57,283 --> 00:16:01,383
that was our initial stab at doing stylized

259
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:04,644
with respect to the original vision of the game.

260
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:09,525
And it was sort of what I look back on

261
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:11,385
and consider our starting point.

262
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:13,906
We really liked the direction of the game.

263
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:17,705
We wanted to keep improving it, and instead of trying to go

264
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:22,527
into a really aggressive early access launch in 2012,

265
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:25,869
we decided to hold the game back and keep working on it.

266
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,430
One of the big things we did there was we converted the

267
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,892
game and all of its assets from running on Unreal Engine

268
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,912
3 to Unreal Engine 4.

269
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:38,435
So this was sort of a big refactor of all of our art.

270
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:42,236
And from here, I'm going to talk about some of the work we

271
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:43,937
did there on environments and characters.

272
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,512
So we kept moving forward with environment concept art

273
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:56,236
and continuing to factor in the cool, stylized shape

274
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:58,878
language, but paying a little bit more respect to the fact

275
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:00,379
that our buildings would be on a grid.

276
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:06,823
We also knew, since we were making the world a believable

277
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:10,645
place, we were going to need a ton of assets to fill out the

278
00:17:10,685 --> 00:17:12,006
random level generation system.

279
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,671
So we took a shotgun approach to doing concept art

280
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:18,713
and started generating just massive amounts of stuff.

281
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:22,634
This is a sheet showing just how many different variants

282
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,195
of beds there are in the game.

283
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:27,297
And we made all of these as bespoke props.

284
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:31,679
And we did this concept art also to prove out

285
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,679
that that shape language would continue to work

286
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,220
throughout a lot of different ideas.

287
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:37,681
Sorry.

288
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,823
So we kept seeing coming up in the concept art.

289
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:45,737
this cool kinked line work and how the silhouettes were

290
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:46,417
really funky.

291
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,338
But some of the things were getting a

292
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:49,238
little bit too funky.

293
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:53,040
So we did a little bit of direction setting and guide

294
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,901
work to set things up in a format where people could wrap

295
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:59,082
their head around how to stylize these things better.

296
00:18:00,342 --> 00:18:02,903
So the idea was if you were starting with a box or a

297
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:05,644
rectangle, you could taper it up, you could taper it down,

298
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:07,245
you could bulge it, you could pinch it.

299
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:10,546
And we had a few other examples of squiggly lines

300
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:11,367
that we didn't want to do.

301
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:16,426
And we got into a really easy way for people to look at

302
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:19,888
a real world object and break it down into its major forms

303
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:22,590
and then get rid of all of the parallel lines

304
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,232
and make the shapes feel like they belong

305
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:26,152
in the world of Fortnite,

306
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,234
related to some of the concept art we were doing.

307
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:31,816
So this let us use photo reference

308
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:34,338
instead of having to do concept art for every single thing.

309
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:42,722
Here's just a couple examples of some things that are typically extremely mundane props

310
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:44,043
in most game worlds.

311
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:48,887
But when we were working on this, we were really excited about building all this content

312
00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:54,011
because using that stylized shape language and the bright colors and the textures really

313
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:58,675
made these sort of normal, everyday things feel much more interesting to look at.

314
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:03,241
Our awesome stylized shapes didn't always work

315
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:05,763
when we eventually got to the point

316
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:07,224
of adding crates to the game.

317
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,226
Our crates did not stack,

318
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:13,730
which set some of the level designers off a little bit.

319
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:18,595
So we made some alternate versions of our crates

320
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,356
that did stack,

321
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:21,077
and we were able to solve that problem that way.

322
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,059
And then we had other examples where the shape language

323
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,981
was also kind of fighting with gameplay and gameplay design

324
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,843
where we had some weapons and some guns

325
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:33,846
where the style was just getting too exaggerated

326
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,849
and too funky, where if you looked at the third person

327
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,051
shooting view of the gameplay of this,

328
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:42,434
you can't really tell what the character's aiming at.

329
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:47,839
Similarly, in our player built walls.

330
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:50,893
we were able to use our shape language really effectively

331
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:53,275
on some of the broader shapes like our metal panels,

332
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:57,039
but some of the finer shapes like the level one wood

333
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:57,919
or the level one brick,

334
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:01,182
like the way we were building these assets,

335
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:04,405
we couldn't really keep consistency in the shape language.

336
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:07,047
All the bricks, for example, are all pretty rectilinear

337
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:10,069
and they don't really exhibit the exact same art style.

338
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,711
So this was sort of a consistency bug

339
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:14,373
that kept getting into my brain.

340
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:21,966
We also worked through refactoring all of our textures.

341
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:24,708
All of the cutout style photo source textures

342
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:27,430
went through a new process where we hand painted them.

343
00:20:28,731 --> 00:20:30,552
Some of the failings of the cutout filter

344
00:20:30,592 --> 00:20:34,816
were that it would sort of just make a noisy mess

345
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:35,636
out of certain things.

346
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:38,018
And we just needed the artist's touch

347
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:41,621
of going through these assets and hand painting them

348
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:44,903
to really make them feel like more intentional

349
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,425
and more full of character.

350
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,835
The props themselves were also all being hand-painted at that point.

351
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:59,622
And one of the elements from the original style and tone of the game was the lived-in world,

352
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:02,165
which I was pretty convinced we had to keep.

353
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:09,172
Getting the wear and tear and really intentional bits of grunge and dust and...

354
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:15,967
scratches and leaky bolts and all the things that add a ton of character to these assets

355
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,549
were things that we stuck with.

356
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,193
Another thing that we've been doing, we're still working on actually as a point of Fortnite

357
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:31,956
being a living project, we're going through and adding normal maps and spec maps to a

358
00:21:31,996 --> 00:21:33,817
lot of the tiling textures that never had any.

359
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:37,519
So this is just an example of kind of the potential of where we can go.

360
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:41,503
This is also showing that we fully converted over

361
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,864
from colored spec to physically based rendering.

362
00:21:43,964 --> 00:21:47,166
So that was also a sort of daunting process

363
00:21:47,226 --> 00:21:50,508
because we had manufactured so many props with colored spec.

364
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,490
One of the rendering engineers came to me one day

365
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,192
and said, hey Pete, you know,

366
00:21:57,413 --> 00:22:00,094
Fortnite is the only Unreal Engine 4 game

367
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:01,215
using colored specular.

368
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:03,577
And we don't wanna support that in the engine anymore.

369
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:05,078
And I was just like, oh fuck.

370
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:06,178
So.

371
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:10,085
We had a million textures to go fix.

372
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:12,568
And we did it, and it's great

373
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:13,809
because it looks way better now.

374
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:17,053
But yeah, that was fun.

375
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:23,415
We've also iterated the look and feel of our lighting

376
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:25,676
and post-process quite a bit over the years.

377
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:28,778
We started off with that original kind of heavy depth

378
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:30,619
of field, really claustrophobic feel.

379
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,841
And over time, as we've brightened things up

380
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:37,163
and cleaned up the artwork, it's just felt very natural

381
00:22:37,264 --> 00:22:40,926
to reduce depth of field and crispen things up over time.

382
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:49,938
One of the problems that took a lot of effort to solve

383
00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:52,520
and many years to solve was the overall

384
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,200
sort of flat look of the game.

385
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:57,542
This is a recent screenshot,

386
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,284
but it's just missing one feature

387
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,085
called distance field ambient occlusion.

388
00:23:03,105 --> 00:23:06,627
And when you turn that feature on, you get that.

389
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:15,492
So going from that to that was pretty amazing.

390
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,783
If you're doing a dynamically lit game in UE4,

391
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:25,426
I would highly recommend using DFAO.

392
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:26,947
It's an amazing feature.

393
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:30,310
Given the whole game was lit with just a skylight

394
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,571
and a directional light,

395
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:35,174
that added the extra bit of depth and fake bounce light

396
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:36,835
that the game had been missing for years.

397
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:42,040
So I just wanted to take a second

398
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,422
and show off some of the other content that we've made.

399
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:45,783
We have.

400
00:23:47,173 --> 00:23:48,654
a bunch of different environment themes.

401
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:51,295
And in the Save the World side of Fortnite,

402
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:53,576
we have some pretty cool content that

403
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,597
took a lot of gameplay time and a lot of effort to get to.

404
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:58,598
And I feel like a lot of people probably haven't seen it.

405
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:02,639
So we have a desert environment that we worked on.

406
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,120
And we're working on more of this content.

407
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:21,447
And we also built a full tile set of sort of Transylvania-inspired Halloween-themed assets.

408
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:27,531
And this was also a perfect testing ground for the new volumetric fog in UE4,

409
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:31,735
which is one of the most fun features to play around with.

410
00:24:32,575 --> 00:24:35,738
It's very hard to not overdo it.

411
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:39,344
We used it pretty liberally in this environment,

412
00:24:39,764 --> 00:24:41,986
but we were also kind of like,

413
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:44,768
is volumetric fog the next lens flare?

414
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:46,889
Like, we gotta be careful here.

415
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:55,194
So, the next thing I'm gonna talk through is character art.

416
00:24:58,036 --> 00:25:00,198
One of the things that we knew from the start

417
00:25:00,618 --> 00:25:03,140
that we wanted was a lot of diversity in the game.

418
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:06,423
Characters are an expression of the player

419
00:25:07,043 --> 00:25:08,424
and how everybody is different.

420
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:11,525
And we knew we weren't gonna go with a

421
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,047
full-on character customization system

422
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:17,668
that lets you morph your face or change your skin tone

423
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:18,548
and all that kind of stuff.

424
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:21,250
We wanted to do more curated art.

425
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,831
So we've been working very hard over the years

426
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,992
to always make sure that we're building out

427
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:30,073
a lot of different looking people

428
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,815
so that we can have a lot of different representation.

429
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:38,179
When we started, Fortnite was not about

430
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:39,300
any single character.

431
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,401
Every character was this scavenger person,

432
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:45,082
a survivor in the sort of bleak world.

433
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,625
And some of those initial designs were really cool,

434
00:25:51,205 --> 00:25:53,466
but we also knew we wanted a ton of variety.

435
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,508
And our initial approach to getting there,

436
00:25:56,928 --> 00:25:59,629
back in the UE3 version, was character customization.

437
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:04,564
You saw some of the results of this in the video we played earlier where everybody was

438
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:13,448
running around with the burger hat. What this sort of led to was a bunch of really, really

439
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:20,471
silly, goofy stuff. We didn't really have a cohesive way of doing tons and tons of scavenger

440
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:28,134
gear as the thing that was going to define the IP. So we did wacky hats, silly backpacks,

441
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:33,754
And after we went through some of these accessory designs,

442
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:38,519
we manufactured a sea of characters

443
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,724
that are all things that are kind of still,

444
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:46,087
they're still in limbo in our content.

445
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:51,913
Basically, they're all not really enough meat

446
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:52,954
to build an IP from.

447
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,339
we could get like the irony of being a beekeeper

448
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,340
or a Canadian Mountie or a raver girl

449
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,820
or whatever idea we came up with.

450
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,301
We were kind of thinking about this in the same way

451
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:07,062
that we thought of the environment content

452
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:10,163
where we felt like we're just gonna make everything

453
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:11,023
and it'll be cool.

454
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:15,445
But what we found was we got a lot of feedback

455
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:18,446
from publishing groups and a lot of people

456
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:19,366
who were looking at the game.

457
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:23,785
feeling like the characters really weren't heroic enough or

458
00:27:23,905 --> 00:27:26,847
cool enough to really be appealing to a wide mass

459
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:27,468
market audience.

460
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,171
And we did sort of a key art exercise to

461
00:27:32,191 --> 00:27:32,972
look at them together.

462
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:37,175
And they look nice from a technical perspective, but

463
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:39,716
they're kind of a hodgepodge from a design point of view.

464
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:44,916
So our solution to this was we converted the game from more

465
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:47,698
of a play-your-way type of experience to more of a

466
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:48,859
class-based design.

467
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,021
And our first classes that we started looking at were core

468
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:54,783
to the gameplay were shooting and building.

469
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:59,827
And we started designing these outfits on our existing body

470
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:00,388
that we had.

471
00:28:00,408 --> 00:28:03,790
And we felt like they were OK, but they weren't really

472
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,873
solving the problem that we were facing, which is making

473
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,475
really cool, awesome heroes.

474
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:13,885
So we came up with the idea to do new body types.

475
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,067
And here was some of the first pass stuff

476
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:18,588
that we came up with for our soldier.

477
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:22,610
And we worked with a lot of different people

478
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,291
on these concepts.

479
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:27,013
These revisions were all very anime.

480
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:28,814
They were a little too noisy.

481
00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:32,756
They just didn't feel, they felt cool,

482
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,217
but not like the game we wanted to make.

483
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,019
And eventually we got to this guy,

484
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:40,480
who you might recognize as Jonesy.

485
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:45,806
This was like another aha moment in concept art

486
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:48,248
in the development of our game, where we saw this guy

487
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,069
and we're like, hell yeah, that is it.

488
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,073
So we took that and just pasted him

489
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:56,975
into a screenshot of the world just to verify

490
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,216
we weren't crazy.

491
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,297
And we said, yep, that feels pretty good.

492
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:01,338
So let's go make him.

493
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:04,721
And at the same time we were making him,

494
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,543
we started building out concepts for the builder guy.

495
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,845
And we wanted that to be on the large body type.

496
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:13,242
So we started prototyping what that would look like

497
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:15,722
and doing silhouettes and started building out

498
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:16,623
a dinosaur chart.

499
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:19,804
And eventually we got to full concept

500
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:23,945
on the large body type constructor.

501
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:26,366
And we looked at it and we said,

502
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:28,267
man, this is a nice piece of art,

503
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:30,427
but we're kind of back to square one

504
00:29:30,587 --> 00:29:33,829
where he's like kind of cool, but not really cool.

505
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:36,149
And we weren't quite sold.

506
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:38,390
Like the soldier was kind of automatically cool

507
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,270
because he's a soldier.

508
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,951
But this guy was like.

509
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:43,029
I don't know.

510
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:49,875
So we kind of took a step back and started to think a

511
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:52,497
little bit more high level about what would a whole

512
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:55,359
entire cast of characters look like, and what do those things

513
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,241
look like in a lot of other properties.

514
00:29:58,162 --> 00:29:59,663
And we looked at everything.

515
00:30:00,183 --> 00:30:02,265
We looked at every reference point you could imagine.

516
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:03,226
We looked at all the movies.

517
00:30:03,246 --> 00:30:04,187
We looked at all the games.

518
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:07,730
And the things that kind of stuck with us as we were

519
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,891
looking through things were.

520
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:18,498
The Ghostbusters property was really cool because we didn't like that they were all the same guy wearing the same outfit.

521
00:30:18,578 --> 00:30:23,342
We knew we didn't want to do that, but we really liked the idea that they were fighting magic with technology.

522
00:30:24,643 --> 00:30:29,147
And we also looked at the really cool sense of diversity that GI Joe has,

523
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:32,850
where you can have a ninja with a soldier with an American Indian,

524
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,815
but we felt like this was presented in a cooler way than our old sense of variety was.

525
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:44,308
And then with The Matrix, all of those characters

526
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:46,049
have this amazing sense of style,

527
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,311
and they feel really high fashion,

528
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:51,934
and they feel unique from one another, but also cohesive.

529
00:30:52,454 --> 00:30:54,495
And for the way that my mind was working

530
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:57,438
around the idea of cohesiveness, just the idea

531
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:59,839
that they all had sunglasses as a thing,

532
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,641
just tied it all together.

533
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:07,200
So we came up with this idea that we were going to represent

534
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,942
all of our class-based hero abilities with these sci-fi

535
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:13,123
gadgets that would explain away our ability to do magic

536
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:13,563
in the game.

537
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:18,246
We went through a whole entire process of figuring out what

538
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:19,226
these were going to look like.

539
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:21,868
What we landed on was

540
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:29,649
The idea of referencing a lot of the movies that we grew up with, you know, at Epic a lot of us are 80s kids.

541
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:37,895
So, a lot of the cool sci-fi movies from back then were things like RoboCop and Back to the Future and Ghostbusters.

542
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:49,744
We tied into a lot of those materials and shape designs and really trying to make things feel like they could have been built in Doc Brown's garage as opposed to coming from

543
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:56,213
you know, a sci-fi factory or HR Giger or Gear Stuff

544
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,253
or, you know, doing the sort of typical,

545
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:01,274
we have one of the rules in all of our sci-fi

546
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,074
is we don't have any of the tech lines

547
00:32:04,194 --> 00:32:07,575
with a 45 degree angle cut and then the line continues.

548
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:12,036
Like, yeah, so we stayed away from what we felt

549
00:32:12,216 --> 00:32:15,056
were kind of tropes in sci-fi and tried to do something

550
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:17,177
that felt more like a pop culture reference.

551
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:20,613
And so after going back over to the constructor,

552
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:22,613
where we got to was this version,

553
00:32:22,854 --> 00:32:25,734
where now he's got gadgets and gear

554
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,175
and a bunch of cool stuff on him.

555
00:32:27,895 --> 00:32:30,416
And we felt like, yes, this is pretty awesome.

556
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:36,238
And he's even got his cool deployable base power-up device.

557
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,041
So we went through all of our existing heroes

558
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:45,281
and we built all the models

559
00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:48,782
based off of the concept art that we had.

560
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,342
and incorporating all their new gadgets.

561
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:53,223
Like our Ninja has his jump boots,

562
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:55,665
and our Outlander has the power punch,

563
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:59,007
you know, rocket powered fist glove thing,

564
00:32:59,668 --> 00:33:01,569
and our Constructor's got his power pack,

565
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,693
and our Commando, the Commando kinda got the short straw

566
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:09,315
and only got grenades, but we still made them

567
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:12,297
cool sci-fi blue glow techie grenades.

568
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,422
What we found was going back and looking at

569
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:21,455
looking at all these heroes and looking at the concept

570
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:26,138
that they came from, we did them all in this style

571
00:33:26,198 --> 00:33:28,079
that was from the original Jonesy concept.

572
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,802
And this style was sort of an attempt to get to

573
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:36,624
a lot of creases and planarizations in the face.

574
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:40,767
And we went through and we diagrammed how this could work

575
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:42,928
on face anatomy for

576
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:47,177
any person or any hero, sort of starting off

577
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:50,179
as a generic guy, what were the creases

578
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:51,881
and planarizations that you would make?

579
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:53,242
How would you simplify a nose?

580
00:33:53,302 --> 00:33:54,563
How would you simplify the lips

581
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:56,845
to really fit into Fortnite style?

582
00:34:00,608 --> 00:34:06,613
And so our first version of this came out pretty cool,

583
00:34:06,813 --> 00:34:08,375
is how we felt about it.

584
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,160
and we stuck with this for quite a while,

585
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,881
and we built out a bunch of our heroes in this style.

586
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:17,301
And the more time we spent with them,

587
00:34:18,442 --> 00:34:19,962
the more we kind of realized,

588
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:22,562
like, hey, you know, maybe they're not really

589
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:24,583
as good looking as they should be.

590
00:34:24,683 --> 00:34:26,883
Like, maybe what we did with the planarization

591
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:27,923
and the cuts of the face,

592
00:34:28,403 --> 00:34:31,484
it wasn't really looking attractive or appealing.

593
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:34,165
It was mostly done to try and fit in

594
00:34:34,225 --> 00:34:36,245
with a lot of the edgy, angular style

595
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:37,765
that had been done in the rest of the game.

596
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,302
So just pulling our constructor head into Photoshop

597
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:47,565
and doing a very quick brush over the cheekbone,

598
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:52,368
I was kind of like, all right, this feels way better.

599
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:55,911
We gotta go work through all of these face designs

600
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:58,072
and make everything feel more natural.

601
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:01,862
And we even went over some of our character concepts

602
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:04,582
and reinvented them entirely with more of the eye

603
00:35:04,622 --> 00:35:08,863
towards the fashion idea of just making them feel

604
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:10,944
like they had cooler, more relatable clothes

605
00:35:11,464 --> 00:35:14,744
and making them a little bit less sort of video gamey.

606
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:18,305
She was a good example of where we reduced the number

607
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,745
of planes in the face quite a bit

608
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:23,626
and just had the sense of a crease on the jaw

609
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:25,266
and just a little bit of a crease

610
00:35:25,426 --> 00:35:26,627
over the crest of the nose.

611
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:31,331
a little bit of planarization in the hair.

612
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:33,553
And that was enough to make her really feel

613
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:35,134
like she fit with the rest of the game,

614
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:38,717
but also letting her face be beautiful at the same time.

615
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,602
And we went and did this over our soldier as well,

616
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,585
and reworked his body proportions, and reworked the face.

617
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:53,230
But we still weren't totally sure if we had nailed it yet.

618
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,504
We wanted to do everything we could to be positive that we

619
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:00,005
were on the right track with our style.

620
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:04,149
So we took the newer soldier face, and we started doing a

621
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:06,712
bunch of paint overs and a bunch of new style

622
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:07,513
explorations.

623
00:36:08,814 --> 00:36:12,057
And we started showing these to more and more people, and

624
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:15,441
getting people's feedback, and testing them, and getting data

625
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:16,402
around what we were doing.

626
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:24,288
I'm sure you guys are disappointed we didn't go with number four.

627
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:32,010
It turned out that we landed on something pretty close to the original take on that

628
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,572
guy and we weren't as far off as we thought.

629
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:44,114
All we really needed to do was go through and clean up the excessive edging and excessive

630
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:50,497
planarization and rework the proportions but sticking to the same initial character designs.

631
00:36:58,118 --> 00:37:02,361
So you can see the guy on the right is definitely,

632
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:05,443
comes across as more appealing and more endearing,

633
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:07,665
whereas the one on the left, when we made it,

634
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:10,226
we were like, sweet, this guy's awesome.

635
00:37:10,747 --> 00:37:13,128
But after taking the time to go over it once more,

636
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:16,170
we were like, oh, we had that artist moment of like,

637
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:20,893
that thing I made that I thought looked awesome,

638
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:23,255
I looked at it a year later and I was like,

639
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:24,876
what the fuck was I thinking?

640
00:37:27,076 --> 00:37:28,356
The new thing was so much better.

641
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:33,879
So, we also got into expression testing

642
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:36,900
just to verify that this stuff was gonna work

643
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,540
in the long run.

644
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,201
We didn't have a ton of animation work going on at the time,

645
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,903
so we had to kind of force this through the pipeline

646
00:37:42,923 --> 00:37:45,164
to see how well things would really work.

647
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:50,866
And using that newer shape, newer, smoother anatomy

648
00:37:50,926 --> 00:37:53,187
to inform the new bodies.

649
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:57,903
helped out a lot as well. We cleaned up a lot of the edgy,

650
00:37:58,103 --> 00:38:01,405
angular creases and like the calf muscles and the forearm

651
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:05,106
muscles and kept, we kept things angular and we kept our

652
00:38:05,146 --> 00:38:10,308
silhouettes really efficient, but also were able to find the

653
00:38:10,348 --> 00:38:15,530
appeal that we were missing before. At the same time we were

654
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:21,612
working through our female body types. And our medium female and

655
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:22,493
our smaller female.

656
00:38:23,327 --> 00:38:26,609
were definitely easier and more natural to make for us

657
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:27,890
than the larger body type,

658
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,372
who required a bit of iteration.

659
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:32,713
When we first started concept art

660
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:34,795
for Penny, our female constructor,

661
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:39,498
we were set on the idea of making her compatible

662
00:38:39,538 --> 00:38:41,600
with the male constructor in PVP

663
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,882
by making the silhouette be exactly the same.

664
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,725
And this idea seemed,

665
00:38:49,145 --> 00:38:50,646
it seemed like it was a sound idea

666
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:51,947
from a gameplay perspective.

667
00:38:52,861 --> 00:38:55,242
And we went back and forth on concepts for this.

668
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:59,864
And we tried to solve her by doing a bunch of different face

669
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,185
concepts and a bunch of different outfits

670
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:03,505
and a bunch of variants there.

671
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,586
But ultimately, what we had to do

672
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:12,729
was get away from the fact that she was a larger set woman,

673
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:15,650
but had these really skinny, spindly legs.

674
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,731
She just looked really unnatural.

675
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:20,792
So we went back to the drawing board

676
00:39:20,852 --> 00:39:21,893
and did some new concepts.

677
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,441
We had a more natural form to the body.

678
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,865
We got rid of the idea that we had to match the PVP mode so

679
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:30,425
precisely.

680
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:37,489
And this was a sort of first pass concept of Penny that was

681
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:38,350
more country girl.

682
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,712
And then we pulled in the sort of cool jacket and some of the

683
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:47,635
tech elements on the leg and gave her more of a cool, heavy

684
00:39:47,735 --> 00:39:48,356
utility belt.

685
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:53,435
And here was our final version of Penny.

686
00:39:58,398 --> 00:39:59,939
So we were really proud of this character.

687
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,821
It took a lot of development,

688
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:05,743
but ultimately we landed in a place that felt really good.

689
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:09,706
We had a ton of positive fan feedback on this character.

690
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:14,609
And after going back and redoing everyone in the game,

691
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,791
this was our final cast of heroes

692
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:19,051
that we shipped with last summer.

693
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:27,680
So I'm getting close to the end.

694
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,640
I wanted to define,

695
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,002
or I wanted to just talk through a few final thoughts.

696
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:38,243
One of the big things that I sort of learned on Fortnite was

697
00:40:39,463 --> 00:40:40,704
we defined a lot of rules.

698
00:40:41,424 --> 00:40:45,405
And for me, being a first time art lead and art director,

699
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:48,486
I didn't really know how to form a rule

700
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,167
and then figure out how to break a rule.

701
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:52,067
Things like the shape language

702
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:54,028
became kind of an obsession for me,

703
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:55,128
given my background.

704
00:40:57,112 --> 00:40:59,474
In modeling, I was very concerned with form,

705
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:02,756
more so than the overall picture,

706
00:41:02,956 --> 00:41:05,659
and I struggled to see the forest through the trees

707
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:07,861
when I was judging individual models.

708
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:10,983
So we tried really, really hard

709
00:41:11,103 --> 00:41:13,725
to force that edgy style into everything,

710
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:17,308
and ultimately, it made it take way longer

711
00:41:17,368 --> 00:41:19,730
for us to get to where we needed to be with our characters.

712
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:24,014
Understanding that

713
00:41:25,745 --> 00:41:29,829
The techniques you use to develop a style don't need to

714
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:30,710
be used everywhere.

715
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:32,832
Took a long time for me to understand.

716
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:37,577
If you want the impression that the game is fun and wacky

717
00:41:37,657 --> 00:41:41,641
and vibrant and funky with all of the shapes that it has, you

718
00:41:41,681 --> 00:41:44,043
just have to use them in the most prominent places.

719
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:47,546
Players are constantly interacting with door frames

720
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,848
and windows and things like that.

721
00:41:50,295 --> 00:41:52,417
which is where we would really have to push those shapes

722
00:41:52,497 --> 00:41:55,679
and that style versus feeling the necessity

723
00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:58,220
to apply that rule to every single asset.

724
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:01,982
So understanding that the art style is the sum of the parts

725
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,284
not repeating the same idea over and over.

726
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:11,028
Another takeaway for me on Fortnite is

727
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:15,090
just the idea of getting out of my comfort zone.

728
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:16,671
I think

729
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:20,163
Given the types of things that I was used to making

730
00:42:20,223 --> 00:42:21,664
before I worked on Fortnite,

731
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:26,585
I never really saw myself getting so into stylized art.

732
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,046
I thought that when I came on the team at the start,

733
00:42:30,146 --> 00:42:32,926
it was going to be something

734
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:35,087
that we would turn around quickly and ship quickly.

735
00:42:35,947 --> 00:42:39,968
But what it turned into for me was an avenue

736
00:42:40,028 --> 00:42:42,188
to learn how to do a whole new kind of art.

737
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,861
So it's been a real journey exploring the art style,

738
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:49,302
figuring out what works, what doesn't work.

739
00:42:50,483 --> 00:42:52,944
And the payoff is now we have an art style

740
00:42:52,984 --> 00:42:55,965
that people look at and people consider it unique.

741
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:59,507
And that feels really rewarding to myself at the team.

742
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:10,233
And my final thought for you guys is the biggest thing,

743
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:13,094
the biggest test on Fortnite was basically

744
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,632
We knew that we believed in this game.

745
00:43:17,872 --> 00:43:18,893
The team believed in the game.

746
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:19,914
I believed in the game.

747
00:43:20,635 --> 00:43:21,536
And I believed in the team.

748
00:43:22,577 --> 00:43:26,661
And the biggest point there is don't give up.

749
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:29,823
When you're working on something that is taking

750
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:33,807
forever and is a slog of redoing and redoing and

751
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:39,252
redoing, I just wanted to tell you guys that finding a way to

752
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:40,713
persist and finding a way to.

753
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,075
Do what you can to take control of the little things

754
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:46,735
and find a way to make them better for yourself

755
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:48,716
while you're going through the process of

756
00:43:50,156 --> 00:43:52,597
having to slow down to speed up

757
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:54,217
and having to redo things

758
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:58,018
and having to get through like big demos

759
00:43:58,118 --> 00:44:00,518
or other things that are forcing functions

760
00:44:00,658 --> 00:44:03,759
for you to be maybe not necessarily doing

761
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:05,620
the exact thing that you would prioritize.

762
00:44:06,862 --> 00:44:08,483
I would just encourage you that if you believe

763
00:44:08,503 --> 00:44:11,706
in that project, just stick with it and don't give up.

764
00:44:13,628 --> 00:44:15,850
So I wanna thank all the people who've worked

765
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,891
so hard to make Fortnite happen,

766
00:44:18,352 --> 00:44:19,593
and I wanna thank you all for coming

767
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:21,475
to see my presentation, thank you.

768
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,257
I have time for questions.

769
00:44:38,878 --> 00:44:40,960
I finished slightly earlier than I thought I would, but

770
00:44:43,422 --> 00:44:44,202
anybody have anything?

771
00:44:48,226 --> 00:44:50,988
I believe you're meant to go to the microphones, is what I

772
00:44:51,028 --> 00:44:51,388
was told.

773
00:44:51,408 --> 00:44:57,013
Test one, two.

774
00:44:57,493 --> 00:44:57,873
Can you hear me?

775
00:44:58,714 --> 00:44:59,074
Barely.

776
00:44:59,315 --> 00:44:59,895
Speak up a little.

777
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:05,712
So my question is, you shared some great examples of all the

778
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:10,234
iteration you guys did over and over to land on that style.

779
00:45:11,234 --> 00:45:13,696
Was that factored into the schedule from the get-go or

780
00:45:13,936 --> 00:45:15,537
the philosophy of how you're approaching the game?

781
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:18,938
Or did it emerge organically and schedules had to change?

782
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:22,900
And also, how did you incorporate feedback in that

783
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:24,421
whole iterative process, whether it was

784
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:25,802
internally or externally?

785
00:45:26,082 --> 00:45:27,223
Can you give examples of that?

786
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:31,271
That is a very good question.

787
00:45:32,393 --> 00:45:38,886
Building Fortnite was a very organic process within Epic.

788
00:45:39,347 --> 00:45:41,652
There were a lot of things that came up along the way where

789
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:46,029
the team was asked to sort of change target

790
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:48,209
or evolve the project along with the fact

791
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:50,410
that Epic as an organization was evolving

792
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,270
from being a company that shipped boxed products

793
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,371
to being its own publisher.

794
00:45:56,131 --> 00:46:00,372
So there were inflection points along the development timeline

795
00:46:00,412 --> 00:46:04,713
where it was like, your schedule is basically thrown out

796
00:46:04,873 --> 00:46:07,233
because we know we're just doing a whole new thing now.

797
00:46:08,173 --> 00:46:09,473
I know that's a little bit vague,

798
00:46:10,474 --> 00:46:11,814
but things like.

799
00:46:15,085 --> 00:46:17,987
We got an opportunity to do a Game Informer cover in

800
00:46:18,047 --> 00:46:19,468
something like 2014.

801
00:46:20,129 --> 00:46:24,331
So we automatically added time to our schedule of developing

802
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:27,994
the game to deal with the fact that we were creating demo

803
00:46:28,074 --> 00:46:30,696
assets all of a sudden, when otherwise we might not have

804
00:46:30,716 --> 00:46:32,037
normally taken the time to do that.

805
00:46:32,797 --> 00:46:32,857
Or.

806
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,322
We did a stage demo at one point with Apple to show off

807
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:38,443
the Metal API.

808
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:41,666
And that was a whole thing of like, all right, so the people

809
00:46:41,706 --> 00:46:43,688
who were making the game are making that demo now.

810
00:46:43,748 --> 00:46:45,890
So now we kind of need more time to ultimately deliver.

811
00:46:47,932 --> 00:46:51,035
And just the way that Epic tends to work is people will

812
00:46:52,428 --> 00:46:55,550
be allocated to a project, and then there might be a project

813
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:59,572
that has a great opportunity to do a demo or do something,

814
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:02,834
and those people might shift from this project

815
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:03,535
to that project.

816
00:47:03,595 --> 00:47:06,797
So the development timeline of the game was,

817
00:47:07,717 --> 00:47:10,019
I'm not quite sure how intentional anybody

818
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:11,660
can really say it is in hindsight.

819
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,642
And the feedback process, whether you're doing it

820
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:18,324
internally or bringing in, like how did that factor

821
00:47:18,344 --> 00:47:19,785
into your just your iterative process?

822
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:20,485
Oh, sure.

823
00:47:21,176 --> 00:47:26,361
We had a few moments where we, you know, before we were fully, I think fully sure that we

824
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:29,464
were going to be our own publisher, we had some publishers come in and look at the game.

825
00:47:31,566 --> 00:47:34,328
But at some point all of the feedback was driven internally.

826
00:47:34,548 --> 00:47:41,014
And then we also had probably two to three years of...

827
00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:44,853
beta testing and user experience testing

828
00:47:45,013 --> 00:47:46,634
in our UX lab inside Epic.

829
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:49,054
So we were getting feedback through

830
00:47:49,514 --> 00:47:51,915
both of those mechanisms as well.

831
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,375
Some of the character art we put into,

832
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,396
we put a bunch of images into a survey

833
00:47:57,436 --> 00:47:59,776
and we had people go through and kind of rank,

834
00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:03,097
you know, how do you feel about this character?

835
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:06,977
Is it, I hate it, is it meh, kinda cool,

836
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,918
is it fucking awesome?

837
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:12,355
So we went through that on a bunch of our character art.

838
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,539
And for a lot of that stuff that was in that middle space,

839
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:18,481
it was kind of 50-50.

840
00:48:18,921 --> 00:48:20,602
And we were like, all right, we need to do better than that.

841
00:48:21,643 --> 00:48:21,904
Thank you.

842
00:48:23,894 --> 00:48:33,020
Hello. Hi. Over here. So my question is, with such an organic way for you to arrive to the

843
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:38,343
style that you got, and with it being such a long process, how do you ensure that the

844
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:42,886
way that you stylize the environment and the way that you stylize the characters is consistent?

845
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:47,309
And also, do you find any challenges that were...

846
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:52,988
perhaps more challenging just based on the fact

847
00:48:53,028 --> 00:48:56,189
that you were working in a stylized environment?

848
00:48:59,190 --> 00:48:59,450
Sure.

849
00:49:02,292 --> 00:49:06,133
I think one of the big things for me was just learning

850
00:49:06,173 --> 00:49:09,254
that I didn't have to make the characters

851
00:49:09,434 --> 00:49:11,575
feel exactly like the environment,

852
00:49:11,735 --> 00:49:14,356
that we could get away with having them take on

853
00:49:14,396 --> 00:49:15,337
a bit of their own style,

854
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:17,998
which wasn't apparent to me at the beginning.

855
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:23,032
I was always, like, when I was a kid, I would watch cartoons and see, like,

856
00:49:23,232 --> 00:49:27,034
oh, okay, I can tell that there's a watercolor painted background,

857
00:49:27,114 --> 00:49:30,255
but I know exactly what the rock on this frame is going to move,

858
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:31,676
because it's clearly cell-painted.

859
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:36,438
And that inconsistency would be, like, a little bit of a deal-breaker for me,

860
00:49:36,658 --> 00:49:43,221
just in how I have a little bit of an analytical side on top of, you know, my more artistic side.

861
00:49:45,201 --> 00:49:49,443
Learning that we could do the characters in their own style was the secret to making them good.

862
00:49:49,463 --> 00:49:56,466
Because I think the early iterations, we were trying too hard to make them analytically cohesive with the environment.

863
00:49:56,726 --> 00:49:56,846
Right.

864
00:49:58,027 --> 00:50:01,748
What was the second part of your question again? Can you repeat it?

865
00:50:01,828 --> 00:50:03,069
Do you... Sorry.

866
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,731
Were there any challenges for you that were...

867
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:12,491
even more challenging just based on the fact that it was a stylized IP, for example, maybe

868
00:50:13,572 --> 00:50:17,273
in building modular sets, for example, for the environment.

869
00:50:17,994 --> 00:50:21,855
Yeah, I mean, going with that shape language definitely complicated some things.

870
00:50:23,156 --> 00:50:26,858
You know, you have to be really concerned with your collision and how players move through

871
00:50:26,878 --> 00:50:27,238
the world.

872
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:35,457
doorways for example, you couldn't have them be wide at the bottom and thin at the top

873
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:38,979
because a player will run in and their head might clip where it's angling up.

874
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:43,062
So there's all kinds of like tiny little gotchas that we went through.

875
00:50:44,663 --> 00:50:50,628
But overall I think a lot of it felt pretty natural as an evolution of what we'd been

876
00:50:50,668 --> 00:50:51,488
doing in the past.

877
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:54,610
I made a lot.

878
00:50:55,117 --> 00:50:58,460
of modular environment sets for Gears of War and UT,

879
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,281
so we had a lot of experience there,

880
00:51:00,402 --> 00:51:02,603
and we were able to get off the ground pretty quickly

881
00:51:02,663 --> 00:51:05,466
with Fortnite, with all that knowledge that we already had.

882
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,468
Do you find yourselves having to standardize

883
00:51:08,528 --> 00:51:10,710
a lot of things like doorways,

884
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,851
just so it would fit all of your characters,

885
00:51:13,012 --> 00:51:14,353
or do you guys just do a?

886
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:17,195
Yeah, we have like a minimum, kind of a minimum size.

887
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:22,557
Like, we want to make sure that all the big characters can get through any portal.

888
00:51:23,138 --> 00:51:28,345
And then we have other standardized sizes for AI as well in the PvE game.

889
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:33,232
So there are definitely a lot of rules there that had to be learned over time.

890
00:51:34,664 --> 00:51:35,864
Just one more quick question.

891
00:51:36,285 --> 00:51:39,727
You mentioned earlier that you were trying to transition

892
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:40,928
from your hand-painted textures

893
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:42,809
into adding normal maps to them.

894
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,051
How are you finding that transition?

895
00:51:46,511 --> 00:51:50,354
Are you having, are you running into a lot of issues

896
00:51:50,414 --> 00:51:52,875
where like maybe the normal maps are not really helping

897
00:51:53,796 --> 00:51:57,838
sell the look, I guess, or the appeal of the textures?

898
00:51:59,299 --> 00:52:00,980
We haven't done tons of them yet,

899
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,002
so I don't have a thorough answer, but.

900
00:52:03,938 --> 00:52:05,438
I think I know what you're getting at,

901
00:52:05,478 --> 00:52:08,579
because ultimately it's probably going to be a little bit

902
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:11,800
of a rabbit hole where a lot of the diffuse textures

903
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,440
have light and shadow already painted into them,

904
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,001
and we're going to have to pull back from that

905
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:19,082
and probably let the artists have a little freedom

906
00:52:19,142 --> 00:52:20,742
to interpret those textures and say,

907
00:52:20,802 --> 00:52:22,483
all right, well, this brick wall

908
00:52:22,523 --> 00:52:24,383
isn't going to be exactly the same anymore.

909
00:52:24,523 --> 00:52:25,843
I'm kind of redoing it with a new,

910
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:28,164
I'll do a model in ZBrush and we'll bake it out again.

911
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:31,705
So there'll probably be a lot of that in that work.

912
00:52:31,725 --> 00:52:33,205
Okay, thank you.

913
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:39,545
Hi, love the look of the game, the look you arrived at.

914
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:42,367
The success is really well-deserved, I think.

915
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:46,130
This is a pretty simple question, and you almost

916
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:46,710
touched on it.

917
00:52:47,571 --> 00:52:50,533
Scaling of props is a conscious decision to keep

918
00:52:50,593 --> 00:52:53,315
things maybe a little larger than would be natural compared

919
00:52:53,335 --> 00:52:54,195
to the characters.

920
00:52:55,376 --> 00:52:55,876
How did you?

921
00:52:56,979 --> 00:52:58,380
Our props are huge.

922
00:52:58,621 --> 00:52:59,541
Yeah.

923
00:52:59,962 --> 00:53:00,642
They're enormous.

924
00:53:01,563 --> 00:53:02,864
It's actually pretty ridiculous.

925
00:53:03,084 --> 00:53:04,786
And a lot of our marketing materials

926
00:53:04,846 --> 00:53:06,727
required us to go be like, all right,

927
00:53:07,048 --> 00:53:09,950
let's maybe make this rock or this car a little bit smaller.

928
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:19,298
And the intent there is you can only run so many actors

929
00:53:19,378 --> 00:53:22,401
in a level, and you also have the gameplay consideration

930
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:22,561
of.

931
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:26,173
every little thing a player is running to harvest

932
00:53:26,613 --> 00:53:27,934
is a new gameplay objective.

933
00:53:28,174 --> 00:53:32,658
So we definitely had a point where some of the props

934
00:53:32,678 --> 00:53:34,460
that we were doing were too small.

935
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,803
And we just worked hand-in-hand with the level designers

936
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:41,566
to figure out, OK, there's really nothing smaller

937
00:53:41,626 --> 00:53:45,249
than a mailbox in this game, because there's no point to it.

938
00:53:45,409 --> 00:53:48,531
It's just going to slow people down or get in the way, which

939
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:54,254
In some respects, it makes it so you can't as finely detail

940
00:53:54,294 --> 00:53:56,815
certain areas as you might want to.

941
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,517
But the benefit is that it keeps your levels pretty clean

942
00:54:01,577 --> 00:54:02,338
and easy to read.

943
00:54:02,418 --> 00:54:05,700
And people can plot their course from point A to point B

944
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,761
pretty easily when you have the right scaled props.

945
00:54:09,882 --> 00:54:10,422
Great, thank you.

946
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:16,852
Great talk, by the way, and I'm a big fan of the game.

947
00:54:16,872 --> 00:54:17,632
I've been playing it a lot.

948
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:18,453
Thanks.

949
00:54:18,573 --> 00:54:21,034
My question is, as an art director,

950
00:54:21,074 --> 00:54:23,615
you said at the very end you were talking about persistence

951
00:54:23,735 --> 00:54:26,117
and how finding that persistence to continue

952
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:29,118
to go even through constant iteration and reiteration

953
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:30,059
is very important.

954
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,760
So as an art director, were there

955
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:36,122
challenges for getting the team on board for reiteration

956
00:54:36,162 --> 00:54:37,182
and constant iteration?

957
00:54:37,242 --> 00:54:38,083
Is that difficult?

958
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:39,501
Yeah, for sure.

959
00:54:41,023 --> 00:54:43,664
We just basically had to keep talking to everybody and let

960
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:46,006
them know, hey, this game's going to come out, and it's

961
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:46,667
going to be awesome.

962
00:54:47,107 --> 00:54:50,389
And just get everybody hyped up about the future of the

963
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:52,451
game and how we knew we were building

964
00:54:52,511 --> 00:54:54,392
something really unique.

965
00:54:56,194 --> 00:54:58,956
Just the idea of going into a world and smashing a bunch of

966
00:54:59,016 --> 00:55:02,338
stuff and getting all the crap and building a cool fort and

967
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:03,619
all of the.

968
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:09,550
you know, metagame systems that we built are fairly compelling once you get into them,

969
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:15,660
if you're that type of gamer. So, we knew we were onto something and I think a lot of

970
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,923
the team believed in that.

971
00:55:22,014 --> 00:55:26,137
Hi, I'm working in the launch department for a game company.

972
00:55:26,718 --> 00:55:29,620
You just say every time you improve your character,

973
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,782
sometime you improve your character,

974
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,804
you are discussing with the launch team, right?

975
00:55:35,845 --> 00:55:42,650
And when your two team have different option,

976
00:55:43,431 --> 00:55:46,673
how did you convince them or how did they convince you?

977
00:55:46,693 --> 00:55:48,575
That's the question.

978
00:55:50,176 --> 00:55:50,376
Sure.

979
00:55:52,527 --> 00:56:00,553
I mean for us it was just about transparency and showing people work in progress and talking

980
00:56:00,633 --> 00:56:01,674
through where it's going.

981
00:56:01,774 --> 00:56:08,879
And I think every step that we took was it wasn't hard to get agreement on as being the

982
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:09,900
right step.

983
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:13,763
So it was a fairly organic process.

984
00:56:14,323 --> 00:56:19,868
I'm sorry it's a little vague but we just worked hand in hand and eventually we got

985
00:56:19,908 --> 00:56:20,028
there.

986
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:35,748
First of all, thanks for the amazing talk and my question is were there any artists like either concept artists or 3d artists?

987
00:56:36,228 --> 00:56:42,553
That were like very specialized in realistic style, but was very not getting used to this kind of style

988
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:46,736
I how how would you like help them to overcome this obstacle?

989
00:56:47,777 --> 00:56:53,502
Sure, so we have we have a number of people who who have spent a lot of time doing realism

990
00:56:53,682 --> 00:56:55,083
And I'm I'm one of them

991
00:56:56,506 --> 00:56:59,830
It's mostly about coaching through the ideas of

992
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,253
simplification, exaggeration.

993
00:57:02,273 --> 00:57:05,797
If you're going to put a bolt on a thing, the bolt should

994
00:57:05,817 --> 00:57:09,020
probably be five times the size of a real world bolt.

995
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:14,507
And one of the benefits we had was we built a ton of content.

996
00:57:15,622 --> 00:57:19,103
early on with a really small team who all kind of got the style.

997
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,545
So we had a ton of stuff that we could point people to and say, well,

998
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:24,505
the thing you're building is kind of similar to this.

999
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:26,466
So why don't we look at this example?

1000
00:57:26,726 --> 00:57:31,087
And we just had tons of visual examples for people to look at and follow and

1001
00:57:31,107 --> 00:57:34,128
learn from. So most people were,

1002
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:36,189
were pretty able to make the transition.

1003
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:43,031
You know, it was definitely, there's a different level of speed certain artists will take to do that,

1004
00:57:43,231 --> 00:57:49,053
but everyone who's come onto the team has been able to get up to speed and be productive within a couple of weeks.

1005
00:57:50,874 --> 00:57:51,374
Thank you so much.

1006
00:57:53,601 --> 00:57:54,281
Just a quick question.

1007
00:57:54,301 --> 00:57:55,922
Thanks for a great talk.

1008
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:57,362
And I love the art style.

1009
00:57:57,582 --> 00:57:59,723
It's fascinating to see the progression, especially how

1010
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:00,463
you smooth the face.

1011
00:58:00,523 --> 00:58:03,784
It's reminding me a lot of stop motion, like Leica and toys.

1012
00:58:04,344 --> 00:58:07,045
So my fan boy question is, any chance you'll release an art

1013
00:58:07,085 --> 00:58:09,806
book or a website showing art progression or toys?

1014
00:58:10,026 --> 00:58:10,546
Oh man.

1015
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:12,027
We'll get there.

1016
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:14,448
Yeah.

1017
00:58:15,228 --> 00:58:19,009
We don't have a ton of people in the department to take on

1018
00:58:19,049 --> 00:58:19,869
those types of things.

1019
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:20,870
But.

1020
00:58:21,438 --> 00:58:23,699
We have a ton of source material,

1021
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:27,001
and I'm really excited about the idea of doing that.

1022
00:58:27,081 --> 00:58:28,581
So I'm right there with you.

1023
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:29,262
I hope it happens.

1024
00:58:32,123 --> 00:58:32,944
Any last questions?

1025
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:39,187
Did you make some significant changes

1026
00:58:39,367 --> 00:58:43,549
in the engine's rendering to deal with still life visuals?

1027
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:48,932
The big feature that we got for Fortnite was the one I talked about a little bit in the

1028
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,515
lighting which was the distance field ambient occlusion.

1029
00:58:52,075 --> 00:58:56,721
I think if it wasn't for Fortnite we probably would not have come up with that solution.

1030
00:58:57,101 --> 00:59:00,425
It was definitely custom made for what we were doing on Fortnite.

1031
00:59:01,226 --> 00:59:02,768
And one of the other features that we

1032
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,282
really special requested about a year ago or so was the volumetric fog.

1033
00:59:10,042 --> 00:59:14,964
So that really improved a lot of the depth in the image and being able to see fog that

1034
00:59:15,044 --> 00:59:18,565
actually shadows in the world was pretty dramatic.

1035
00:59:18,785 --> 00:59:24,327
But for most of the course of the development, we were working with all of the engine builds

1036
00:59:24,387 --> 00:59:29,149
that came from the engine team without a lot of custom features for stylized.

1037
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:33,771
In fact, most of what we incorporated was more.

1038
00:59:35,215 --> 00:59:39,658
more of the features that are geared towards filmic and photo real.

1039
00:59:40,479 --> 00:59:44,681
And where that sort of is going for us in the game is we're maintaining the,

1040
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:46,582
the style of our content.

1041
00:59:47,103 --> 00:59:50,605
But I think the rendering style of the game from a technical perspective is

1042
00:59:50,685 --> 00:59:56,569
actually skewing more realistic and closer to becoming a real time rendered

1043
00:59:57,109 --> 01:00:03,653
Pixar film style of visual where we're going to get a little bit more material

1044
01:00:03,693 --> 01:00:04,233
definition.

1045
01:00:04,794 --> 01:00:07,596
and material separation and all the things

1046
01:00:07,656 --> 01:00:09,718
that you would associate with more

1047
01:00:09,738 --> 01:00:10,899
of a high-end rendered thing.

1048
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:12,420
Thank you.

1049
01:00:14,842 --> 01:00:16,924
Hi, I love the artwork, by the way,

1050
01:00:16,944 --> 01:00:18,765
it's fantastic looking stuff.

1051
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:22,568
When individual artists are working on iterating things,

1052
01:00:22,668 --> 01:00:24,750
did they keep ownership of the asset

1053
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:25,711
they were iterating through,

1054
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:27,312
or did you tend to swap over artists?

1055
01:00:29,413 --> 01:00:30,134
It's a good question.

1056
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:35,412
It's a little bit of both.

1057
01:00:35,972 --> 01:00:39,214
I try my hardest to let an artist

1058
01:00:39,254 --> 01:00:40,314
keep ownership of a thing.

1059
01:00:41,034 --> 01:00:44,316
I think that's a, it's sort of the management question

1060
01:00:44,456 --> 01:00:49,879
of how do you coach somebody to get it to the point

1061
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:52,060
where it fits into the game and it's shippable

1062
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,641
and they're making, they learn from that asset

1063
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:55,821
so that the next one they make,

1064
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:58,483
they're doing it at a higher quality level and faster.

1065
01:00:59,203 --> 01:01:02,745
So I try very hard to make sure people hold onto their work

1066
01:01:02,885 --> 01:01:02,965
and...

1067
01:01:04,111 --> 01:01:08,354
But there is also sometimes where the schedule just doesn't allow for it and you're like, all right

1068
01:01:08,454 --> 01:01:11,796
We're gonna pass this thing off to this person and this task might go over here

1069
01:01:11,896 --> 01:01:18,801
so, you know over over the many years we worked on it a little bit of both happened, but my personal preference is to

1070
01:01:19,882 --> 01:01:24,025
Make sure we're giving the feedback to the artists so that they know how to do the work correctly

1071
01:01:25,065 --> 01:01:25,386
Thank you

1072
01:01:29,469 --> 01:01:29,989
Anything else

1073
01:01:32,865 --> 01:01:34,477
Awesome, thank you guys so much for coming.
