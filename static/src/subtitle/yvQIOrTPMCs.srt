00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:15,356
This presentation was originally prepared for the Production Essentials Summit of GDC20, Cultural Intelligence for the Games Industry, by Tina Mary.

2
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:23,161
Due to the deferment of the conference, this content was delivered as a webinar on Thursday, March 26th.

3
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,623
The following is a curated copy of the content.

4
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:34,028
Thank you for joining me to learn more about Cultural Intelligence for the Games Industry.

5
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:39,812
My name is Tina Mary and I've been working in games since 2003. I've traveled extensively since

6
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:44,936
that time and lived in four different countries while shipping 25 AAA titles. I've worked with

7
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:50,060
some incredibly talented teams and franchises including Marvel, FIFA, Need for Speed and

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,205
Candy Crush. In my work with global teams I've noted consistently that culture really does matter.

9
00:00:57,246 --> 00:01:01,290
The teams and I have had many interesting conversations about how culture shows up in

10
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,511
the workplace and affects our collaborations.

11
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:14,080
In early 2018, I was very excited to learn about the cultural intelligence or the CQ framework and understand its potential to help us build amazing games.

12
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:28,252
As would seem appropriate in a webinar about cultural intelligence, we have attendees joining us from all over the world. Let's take a quick poll to see where we all hail from.

13
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,751
In today's presentation, we'll be covering three different topics.

14
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:45,413
The first topic will be to clearly define what is cultural intelligence

15
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,133
and the related capabilities.

16
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:48,394
How do we measure it?

17
00:01:48,814 --> 00:01:51,515
And what's the relationship to the business of making games?

18
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:56,437
The second topic we'll be exploring is cultural values.

19
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,938
What are they and how do they help you understand more about yourself

20
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:01,158
and the world around you?

21
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:07,723
Final topic will be about developing your cultural intelligence.

22
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:11,065
I promise you that you will come away with some tangible

23
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:15,687
insights into how you can improve cultural intelligence in yourself and your team.

24
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:23,931
Today's presentation will not only help you understand the definition of cultural intelligence,

25
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:27,913
but also bring together the relevance of CQ in terms of

26
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:32,995
the gaming industry and the practical implications that it offers for you.

27
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:40,217
In games development, innovation is critical to all areas of a business.

28
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:43,858
We've also been consistently told that more diversity in our talent pool

29
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,680
is not only the right thing to do, but will also lead to the outcome of more innovation.

30
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,841
However, without high CQ or cultural intelligence,

31
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:56,703
this may not hold true according to extensive research and studies.

32
00:02:57,723 --> 00:03:01,825
Let's look at the results of two similar teams with comparable technical ability.

33
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:03,985
The homogenous team.

34
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:09,156
will likely outperform the diverse team if they're both low in cultural intelligence.

35
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:16,202
However, once we introduce the quotient of high CQ, the diverse team starts to realize its benefits.

36
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:21,346
They see up to three times the number of innovative solutions and improved effectiveness.

37
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:28,492
And this is because diverse teams with high CQ are better equipped to create a place of safety and inclusion,

38
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:30,594
which allows innovation to flourish.

39
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:39,565
Okay, so here we have our formal definition. Cultural intelligence or CQ is the capability

40
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:46,430
to function and relate effectively in culturally diverse situations. But what do we mean by

41
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:54,297
culturally diverse? What do we mean in fact by culture? As we explore the concept of cultural

42
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:59,821
diversity and cultural intelligence, it's a good idea perhaps to step back and define the actual

43
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:00,742
word culture.

44
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,013
Gert Hofstad, who was a Dutch psychologist that specialized in intercultural studies,

45
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:12,695
stated that culture is a shared pattern of beliefs, values, assumptions,

46
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:15,936
and behaviors that differentiate one group of people from another.

47
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:23,159
In a way, Hofstad was telling us that culture really means what is accepted and familiar can

48
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,622
change from one different group or environment to another. We tend to think about culture in

49
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:30,823
the common context of nationality.

50
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:34,167
Where in the world are we from or where are parents from?

51
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:38,068
What ethnicity are we? What religion are we?

52
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:43,509
And so on. We can also think about culture in the concept of the family

53
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:45,790
unit. What is accepted and familiar and the

54
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,770
rules that can change from one family to another,

55
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,911
from one generation to the other. Think about the millennial versus Gen X versus

56
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:57,012
baby boomers. The rules of what is accepted and

57
00:04:57,052 --> 00:04:57,752
familiar show.

58
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:02,032
The rules at your friend's house when you were growing up were different than at home.

59
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:09,695
If we go to the school, we think about the difference in the culture between the classroom and the playground.

60
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:16,157
Even in the classroom, the culture in the mathematics class was probably different than the culture in your art class.

61
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:19,819
What was accepted and familiar in terms of behaviours was different.

62
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,900
And of course, then that brings us to the workplace.

63
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,442
At Electronic Arts, we had a variety of different organisational cultures.

64
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:35,334
At the studio cultures, EA Vancouver, EA Romania, EA Redwood Shores.

65
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:41,919
In EA Vancouver, we had the different cultures of the different studio groups, the central

66
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:46,242
art teams, the game franchises, FIFA versus NHL.

67
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:52,007
Even within the franchises, we had FIFA next gen versus current gen versus handheld teams.

68
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:58,171
You saw within the game teams, the disciplines collaborating and grouping together, producers

69
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:59,973
versus artists versus engineers.

70
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:08,649
So in all those cases, what we can do is think about culture perhaps as the way we do things around here, wherever here might be.

71
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:21,435
So we can now understand that cultural intelligence or CQ helps us relate to others who are culturally different than ourselves.

72
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:26,137
What benefits do we realize from that knowledge?

73
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:33,457
The production benefits of developing CQ in yourself and your teams are clear.

74
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:40,464
We can see increased profits and reduced costs as teams understand how to work more effectively

75
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,827
and identify improved opportunities.

76
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:48,933
As teams learn to collaborate and work more effectively together, they're going to become

77
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:50,515
happier and more engaged.

78
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:57,232
Cultural intelligence offers us a clear framework to manage bias in the business of making games,

79
00:06:57,552 --> 00:07:02,315
through anything from making decisions on hiring to game features.

80
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:08,899
And ultimately, it's clear that cultural intelligence can help us build better games faster.

81
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,821
What's in it for you?

82
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:19,354
If you develop cultural intelligence or your CQ skills, you will find it's going to be easier to adapt.

83
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:24,857
Whether you're traveling for pleasure, working on a brand new team, taking on a new role,

84
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:30,259
or maybe even being asked to take on an international assignment, you'll find it easier to adapt.

85
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:34,901
You'll be able to better enjoy the diverse experiences that life throws at us.

86
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:39,003
You'll be able to persist when cultural differences come about.

87
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:47,348
Find yourself more personally effective in all aspects of your relationships and you

88
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:50,929
are going to be a more desirable employee and colleague.

89
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,210
We like working with people who are high CQ.

90
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,731
They understand us and we relate well to them.

91
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:05,753
As we've now reflected on the definition of cultural intelligence and started to understand

92
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:11,315
its relevance to the business of making games, we should stop and reflect on two very important

93
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:11,735
points.

94
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,141
The first point is, yes, cultural intelligence can be measured as we've talked about.

95
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:22,943
If we look at the CQ capabilities, they can be defined and measured and quantified,

96
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:24,684
and we'll be looking at that next.

97
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:31,026
Using that information, we'll start to understand how the CQ capabilities can be improved

98
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:35,588
and how we can therefore improve our overall cultural intelligence.

99
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:41,630
There are several common myths about cultural intelligence I want to share with you.

100
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:48,038
The first is that individuals who have high emotional intelligence also have high cultural intelligence.

101
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:50,398
That's certainly not necessarily true.

102
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:58,721
High emotional intelligence measures our ability to effectively regulate and manage our own emotions and those of others.

103
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:02,362
However, this is very culturally conditioned.

104
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:09,144
In other words, our ability to detect happiness and sadness in others is reflected in our cultural traditions.

105
00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:12,005
Some cultures are very expressive, others are less so.

106
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:17,358
When you think about direct eye contact, in one culture that might reflect confidence,

107
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:19,880
in another it might reflect insubordination.

108
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,805
So really cultural intelligence is the next step in evolution beyond emotional intelligence

109
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:31,448
and allows us to work effectively with others from different cultures.

110
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:37,433
Another common myth is that international experience or significant travel

111
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:39,694
is going to bring us cultural intelligence.

112
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:41,636
Again, that's a pretty common myth.

113
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:48,042
In fact, the reality is that we can travel extensively, but never really go beyond the

114
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:50,905
tourist places and experience local cultures.

115
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:56,391
Even if we go live abroad, if we stay within the expat communities, we can quite easily

116
00:09:56,771 --> 00:10:03,278
lack an opportunity to develop our cultural intelligence despite our international experiences.

117
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:09,010
The next myth that's fairly common, especially for gaming, is that technical competence is

118
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,251
going to translate into success in a culturally diverse context.

119
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:16,734
The scenario here is often that you'll have a lead artist or engineer who's been very

120
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:22,137
effective in their local context, and they're being asked to undertake an international

121
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:24,778
assignment or lead a multiculturally diverse team.

122
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:33,123
Unfortunately, technical competence does not translate to success in terms of working

123
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,620
cross cultures.

124
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,026
Okay, time to look at the details.

125
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:46,070
The cultural intelligence or CQ capabilities are made up of four different

126
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,332
dimensions. The first is called CQ drive.

127
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:54,737
CQ drive gets at our intrinsic motivation and our extrinsic motivation

128
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:58,820
and confidence in dealing with culturally diverse contexts and

129
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,641
situations.

130
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:07,732
CQ knowledge measures our understanding of the cultural similarities and differences that we see

131
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:11,933
and how they affect the behaviors that we observe in ourselves and others.

132
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:21,855
CQ strategy is our awareness of how culture impacts us and our ability to plan and check

133
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:26,557
for the assumptions that we make prior to our culturally diverse interactions.

134
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:34,466
CQ action allows us to adapt our behaviors according to the cultural context, whether

135
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:40,889
through an adaption of verbal or non-verbal behaviors or communication styles. Together,

136
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:46,351
these four capabilities define the competence of cultural intelligence.

137
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:53,514
Now it's time to take a look at how those capabilities are measured and

138
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:57,536
have a slight understanding of the science behind cultural intelligence.

139
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:02,405
I want to be clear that today we're just having a very brief high-level look at this.

140
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:08,267
Anyone who may be interested in exploring this more deeply, I would encourage you to

141
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,369
reach out so I can provide you with more academic resources.

142
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:20,572
Cultural intelligence is measured using something called the CQS or the cultural intelligence

143
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:25,154
scale devised by scientists to help us predict our CQ capabilities.

144
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:31,046
It is done by using assessments which are benchmarked against worldwide norms.

145
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:37,551
To date, over 150,000 of these assessments have been completed across 168 countries.

146
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:41,134
The results are then aggregated into three different buckets.

147
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,497
Low CQ scores are reflected in the bottom 25th percentile,

148
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:49,240
and in the chart we're going to look at in a moment, we see them in a light grey band.

149
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:53,357
Moderate scores reflect the mid-50 percentile.

150
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:57,119
In other words, most of us see ourselves as moderate CQ.

151
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,302
High cultural intelligence is reflected in the

152
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:05,224
orange band and that reflects the top 25th percentile.

153
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:08,486
Let's take a look at an actual report now.

154
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:15,230
This is a sample cultural intelligence report

155
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,051
showing the summary page.

156
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:25,448
The first thing I want to bring to your attention are the three bands that we just talked about for the CQS or the Cultural Intelligence Scale.

157
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:31,493
They are reflected below for each of the capabilities in the color bands for each.

158
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:35,277
These reflect what we call the worldwide norms.

159
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:41,302
So again, reminder that the bottom 25th percentile we see in the light grey band,

160
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:45,065
the mid 50th percentile is in the dark grey.

161
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,890
and the top 25th percentile we see reflected in orange.

162
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,752
The next thing I want to bring to your attention

163
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:53,753
is the fact that the ranges look different

164
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:55,555
for each of the four capabilities.

165
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:59,077
This is because these, again, are based on worldwide norms,

166
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:01,139
and it might, for example, tell us

167
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,140
that since most people consider

168
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,143
their cultural intelligence drive to be relatively high,

169
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,926
we see a more modest band up at the top end of the scale

170
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:12,367
for the high scores.

171
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:16,215
The next thing I want to bring to your attention

172
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,937
are the absolute scores that are listed for each capability.

173
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:23,438
This represents the actual self-assessment

174
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,099
in this sample report.

175
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:28,720
For example, if we look at the first dimension CQ drive

176
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,580
and we see the number 75,

177
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,582
that reflects somebody whose score is in the middle

178
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,122
of the moderate range from the worldwide norms.

179
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:38,763
So this is a pretty average CQ score.

180
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:42,445
If on the other hand, we look at the next number,

181
00:14:44,387 --> 00:14:50,249
69 for CQ Knowledge, we note that it's almost at the top end of the moderate score pushing up

182
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:55,490
into the high percentile. This tells us that we need be less concerned with the absolute number

183
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,352
we're seeing on this report and be more concerned with where the number lies within the range of

184
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:07,354
the worldwide norms. Another example of how we can read this report would be the relationship

185
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:08,834
between two capabilities.

186
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,815
Here we see the circle around CQ knowledge

187
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:13,116
with an absolute score of 69,

188
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:16,098
and the capability is showing

189
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:18,500
is almost into the top 25th percentile.

190
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:22,223
Conversely, CQ strategy at 61

191
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,745
is almost in the bottom 25th percentile.

192
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:26,726
We can also infer,

193
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:29,969
in addition to these absolute number relationships,

194
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:33,652
that this person may be under utilizing their CQ knowledge

195
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,914
in relation to their ability to apply it

196
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,415
from a strategic perspective.

197
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:42,747
Once we look at the detailed report, we might better understand whether one of the sub-capabilities

198
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:46,529
of awareness, planning, or checking was more the culprit.

199
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:53,192
This report forms the basis of how we understand and measure cultural intelligence and becomes

200
00:15:53,272 --> 00:15:55,713
highly useful in building our development plans.

201
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:02,677
So we now understand how cultural intelligence is defined.

202
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:04,658
We understand that it can be measured,

203
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,060
and we understand it helps us relate

204
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,921
to others different from ourselves.

205
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,343
However, doing this helps,

206
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:13,665
it requires that we seek to understand

207
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:15,426
our similarities and differences.

208
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:17,408
And one of the ways we do this

209
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:20,170
is by looking at our personal value preferences,

210
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,571
or what's called our cultural values.

211
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,864
As we further explore the concept of working effectively with others that are culturally

212
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:32,927
different than ourselves, it's time to explore cultural values.

213
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:37,111
Cultural values represent our preferred way of working and relating to others.

214
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:39,012
They run deep within us.

215
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:47,941
They are built up over a lifetime of experiences and they form all of the assumptions and views

216
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:48,881
we have of the world.

217
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:58,130
In the bowl, you're swimming around and your view of the room is distorted by the water and the bowl that you're in.

218
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,891
Suddenly you're scooped into a new, larger bowl.

219
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:02,952
You panic. You can't breathe.

220
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:06,514
After a moment you calm down and realize this is just fresh water.

221
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:12,697
Put simply, the fish's view is distorted by the environment that it's in.

222
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:19,721
Similarly, cultural values and the culture that we're in distort our view of the world and the people around us.

223
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:26,699
We're never going to remove the water in the bowl for the fish, nor are we going to remove our cultural values.

224
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:39,542
They are who they are, but by understanding more about ourselves and our values, we can more effectively deal with the culturally diverse situations we may find ourselves in.

225
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:48,364
As we seek to explore cultural values, we can look to using cultural value profiles to do this.

226
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:52,540
There are a variety of tools and assessments in the market that are available,

227
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,741
most of which help us reflect on the practical implications of behaviors stemming from cultural differences.

228
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:03,823
So in other words, these profiles help us better understand our general perspective on life.

229
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:09,285
They help us uncover some of the potential biases that can come up when we're working with different cultures.

230
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,646
They are not intended to actually predict our cultural intelligence.

231
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:52,819
Context is about our preferred way of sharing and receiving information.

232
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:57,441
If we are low context, we prefer a direct form of communication.

233
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:01,363
Our culture says things like, say what you mean and mean what you say.

234
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:08,527
In a high context culture, a less direct or a very indirect form of communication is more typical.

235
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,788
Focus is on saving face and harmony.

236
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:18,172
And much more attention needs to be paid to what is not being said and body language.

237
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:28,420
When we complete a cultural value profile, we start to understand our CV orientation.

238
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,161
In the example below, we see the pink arrow pointing to low context.

239
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:39,763
So, if I have a low orientation, my profile might show an arrow here on the report.

240
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:46,244
I might have a peer whose report shows that they are high context or an indirect communicator.

241
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:50,255
The question for us becomes how do we deal with that difference?

242
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:53,657
How is it showing up in the way we communicate and collaborate?

243
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:58,218
What are the potential for miscues that we might experience as a result of that difference?

244
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:00,919
So what can that mean?

245
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,001
If I'm a high context person and I'm working with somebody who's low context,

246
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:11,443
I should be focusing on sharing information in an explicit and direct way

247
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:15,165
and focus on getting my message across clearly and explicitly.

248
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:21,306
Conversely, if I'm working with somebody who's high context or indirect, I want to recognize

249
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:26,050
the importance of silence and reflection, pay careful attention to what's not being

250
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,594
said and body language, and remember the importance of relationships.

251
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:38,400
That having been said, we learned from Erin Meyer, who's an international business professor

252
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,124
and cultural expert, that multicultural teams need low-context processes.

253
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:50,169
She explains this in her book, The Culture Map, and helps us understand that because multicultural

254
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:55,154
teams have many opportunities for miscues in how they share and receive information,

255
00:20:55,655 --> 00:21:01,861
we should coach them to default to low-context processes to avoid these misunderstandings.

256
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:10,028
You likely follow many of these low-context processes already, but let's take a closer look.

257
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,191
We want to ensure that agendas are sent before meetings, not only because we want to check

258
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:20,733
for understanding on what will be covered, but also be clear on what a successful outcome

259
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:21,973
will look like for that meeting.

260
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:27,976
Meeting minutes are shared not only to ensure that individuals who didn't attend the meeting

261
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:32,497
know what was covered, but it allows us to ensure we walked away with a common understanding

262
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:33,698
of any conclusions.

263
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:39,440
Information boards and daily scrums can help us better reflect on

264
00:21:40,237 --> 00:21:41,877
The status of their project.

265
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:45,038
Defining decision making processes

266
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:48,059
helps our team reduce noise around who should

267
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,540
make decisions when and why.

268
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,901
Establishing reporting processes.

269
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:54,801
How do we report to when?

270
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:56,342
What does complete mean?

271
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:58,682
Ultimately, at the end of the day,

272
00:21:58,742 --> 00:22:00,563
these low context processes are meant

273
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,944
to define what good looks like and remove

274
00:22:03,004 --> 00:22:05,745
as many assumptions as possible for your diverse teams.

275
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,292
What assumptions do we make in daily interactions with others?

276
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:14,413
Which biases show up and what is their possible impact?

277
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,615
How does culture come into the equation?

278
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,857
How much do we attribute behaviors different to our own

279
00:22:19,897 --> 00:22:22,878
to cultural preferences versus personality differences?

280
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,440
For example, if I'm low context

281
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,502
and I don't get the information that I expect

282
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:30,283
from somebody that is high context,

283
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:31,864
what should be my assumptions?

284
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,825
Do I think they're hiding information from me, for example?

285
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:37,026
Or that they have nothing relevant to share?

286
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:42,729
If you see a colleague nod in a meeting, what would you assume that nod meant?

287
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,833
If you then later heard them overheard them disagreeing with the comments you made in the

288
00:22:47,873 --> 00:22:53,778
meeting, what assumptions could you bring then? High CQ requires that we suspend judgment before

289
00:22:53,818 --> 00:23:02,404
reacting, but can we always? I want to take a moment to try a short test.

290
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:05,947
Imagine you're in a boat with your mother.

291
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:10,026
your spouse and your child and the boat starts to sink.

292
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:12,908
You're only able to save one of them.

293
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:14,549
Who will you save?

294
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,170
Will you save your mother,

295
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:18,652
your spouse or partner?

296
00:23:18,672 --> 00:23:20,393
Or will you save your child?

297
00:23:21,894 --> 00:23:24,156
How certain did you feel in your response?

298
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:30,960
When I did this test as part of my certification process,

299
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:34,283
I practically ran to the spot in the room that represented my

300
00:23:34,403 --> 00:23:36,244
answer because it just felt right to me.

301
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:44,238
And despite the fact that I consider myself relatively culturally aware and high CQ,

302
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:48,019
I really did assume most people would join me in that corner of the room.

303
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:49,999
What do you think really happened?

304
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,521
The results from at least one related survey provided these outcomes

305
00:23:56,762 --> 00:24:00,043
and factually mirrored what I saw in my own workshop.

306
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:02,723
Did these results surprise you at all?

307
00:24:03,524 --> 00:24:04,704
I was, at least at first.

308
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:10,106
At the time, the facilitator asked some of us to offer explanations for our responses.

309
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:16,391
Someone then explained to us, if mom were here, she would say, you can have more children,

310
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:19,613
you can marry again, but you will only have one mother.

311
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:25,378
For me, it was a strong reminder that we cannot take our values and assumptions for granted.

312
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:30,903
What's familiar and accepted to us as a basic value, of course, I should save my child,

313
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:34,426
might not be true for a colleague from another cultural background.

314
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:47,203
We've now had an opportunity to understand what is cultural intelligence,

315
00:24:47,563 --> 00:24:51,924
what's the relevance to the business of making games, how is it measured,

316
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:59,127
and how do cultural values come into the conversation. Let's talk about how we pull

317
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:04,549
that all together in terms of how we develop our CQ, how do we take actions,

318
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:08,070
and what can we do to help ourselves and our teams move forward.

319
00:25:09,753 --> 00:25:18,823
Let's now do a recap of the four CQ capabilities, and as we do so, reflect on which of these capabilities you'd like to develop in yourself or your teams.

320
00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:31,758
So CQ Drive is measuring our ability to gain enjoyment from culturally diverse experiences and our understanding of how we'll benefit from them. It also measures our confidence in those experiences.

321
00:25:33,017 --> 00:25:37,299
CQ knowledge is measuring how we understand cultures are similar and different and how

322
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,701
those similarities and differences affect the way people think and behave.

323
00:25:42,162 --> 00:25:49,106
With CQ strategy, we begin to understand and be aware of how to plan for multicultural interactions

324
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:54,669
and in CQ action we're able to flex our behavior both verbal and non-verbal

325
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:58,451
to behave appropriately in different cultural situations.

326
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,500
I think you're going to find this chart very interesting.

327
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,880
It comes to us courtesy of the Cultural Intelligence Center

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,461
and helps us understand that not all cultural intelligence

329
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,702
capabilities are created equal.

330
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:16,602
We want to sit back and reflect on what the desired

331
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:19,043
performance outcome is based on the role

332
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:22,384
that we have in the organization or our current needs.

333
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:26,345
As an example, if we look in the far left column

334
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:29,585
for cultural adaptation, you'll note that the only

335
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:34,042
Cultural intelligence capability that's ticked off is CQ drive.

336
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:39,766
This would represent the role of an expat or a member of a culturally diverse team.

337
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:45,110
And the most important capability for that individual to have is CQ drive.

338
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:49,674
If on the other hand, we are accountable for cultural decision making.

339
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:55,718
In other words, we're going to make a decision on which markets to collaborate with or build new products in.

340
00:26:56,379 --> 00:27:00,404
Then CQ knowledge and CQ strategy become much more critical skills.

341
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:06,010
Our CQ drive is not quite as relevant anymore, because it's not about actually working with

342
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:11,175
those different cultures, but understanding how they work. Similarly, if our role is

343
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:15,660
cultural negotiation, such as a business development person or a lawyer,

344
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,832
Then our ability to have strong motivation to seek out culturally diverse experiences

345
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,813
and to act appropriately under different circumstances are the two most

346
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:30,895
important capabilities for us to develop. In the fourth column, leading a multicultural team,

347
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:35,436
probably many of you can see yourself there if you're a producer or a director on a game team.

348
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:37,837
In this case,

349
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,552
CQ knowledge you'll notice is not ticked off and the reason for that is it's less critical to know

350
00:27:43,652 --> 00:27:48,974
specifics around how cultures are similar and different and more important on strategizing

351
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:57,317
on how you can help your own team be effective. Expanding into new markets such as your VP might

352
00:27:57,357 --> 00:28:03,179
do when building out a new product or deciding to bring a product to a new area of the world

353
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:07,761
requires that we have effective skills in all four of our capabilities.

354
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:20,902
We've covered a lot, so now let's reflect on specific strategies we can use to develop CQ in ourself and our teams.

355
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:33,770
CQ Drive. To improve CQ Drive, consider making a list of all the benefits that you gain and your team gains from having culturally diverse teams and from being high CQ.

356
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:40,155
Build a presentation and show your team that, so they can understand the ROI of building CQ.

357
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:50,334
CQ knowledge. Reflect on how cultural values are showing up in your leadership style. Look at the

358
00:28:50,374 --> 00:28:55,195
needs of your team and try to understand how you might need to flex your style accordingly.

359
00:28:57,416 --> 00:29:04,237
Strategy. CQ strategy and awareness. By adding an empty chair to a meeting, we can ensure that we

360
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:10,139
reflect a missing perspective. As an example of where the local team and our remote team is unable

361
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:10,659
to attend.

362
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:15,204
We can ask that the empty chair represent their perspective in the conversation.

363
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:20,548
CQ action is about getting out of our comfort zone.

364
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:25,232
By practicing non-typical behaviors, we can improve our CQ action.

365
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:31,257
An example for me would be using a quieter demeanor when I speak and perhaps less body language.

366
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:47,235
Let's take a look at how we can remove some of that noise and conflict by applying cultural intelligence best practices.

367
00:29:49,335 --> 00:30:06,179
So, first of all, let's reflect on feedback, whether the feedback is constructive criticism or praise, we should be thinking about what is the preferred cultural preference for the individuals we're working with. Do they prefer direct or indirect feedback? Should the feedback be provided in public or in private?

368
00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:11,588
Should I direct my feedback to the team as a whole or just to the individual when I'm praising somebody?

369
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,429
All of these things have cultural consequences.

370
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:20,131
When we're thinking about how we assign work, cultural intelligence comes into play

371
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:24,932
in terms of thinking about are individuals more competitive or cooperative in their

372
00:30:24,952 --> 00:30:28,974
cultural preferences? Do they like to see more individual or group goals?

373
00:30:29,574 --> 00:30:33,955
An example here would be when I was working on the FIFA Street project with the team in Russia.

374
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:39,546
The team in Vancouver thrived on individual goal setting for bug fixing targets and so on.

375
00:30:40,386 --> 00:30:44,770
However, the team in Russia worked much more effectively when we set group targets

376
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:48,334
and they worked on them together to achieve them over a period of time.

377
00:30:50,636 --> 00:30:53,458
This was because their culture is more collective in nature.

378
00:30:56,375 --> 00:31:08,939
When it comes to assessing performance or defining what good looks like, again, we should be considering cultural preferences and also going back to that recommendation of being as explicit as possible.

379
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:17,381
In other words, defaulting to low context. Define exactly what's going to be measured, how it will be measured, how it will be reported, and so on.

380
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:23,522
Help your team understand how their performance will be measured and how the project's performance will be measured.

381
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:32,713
When you're reflecting on how information is shared, again, consider what cultural preferences might come into play.

382
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:39,435
As an example, think about who's providing the feedback and how and when they're sharing information.

383
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:45,077
I learned as an example that in Romania, big news should never be delivered in writing,

384
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:48,538
and that due to a preference for hierarchy,

385
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,701
Big news should also be delivered by a big boss.

386
00:31:52,221 --> 00:31:54,603
So often we would fly in one of the senior leaders

387
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:57,224
to the studio to deliver big news in person,

388
00:31:57,564 --> 00:31:59,645
and then we would follow it up in writing.

389
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:04,828
Let's also take a quick look at some of the learning paths

390
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:07,589
that are available to you to develop cultural intelligence.

391
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,551
If we start at measuring cultural intelligence,

392
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:13,312
we have the opportunity to do formalized assessments

393
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:15,454
that are either self-based and or 360.

394
00:32:18,095 --> 00:32:25,340
We can do audits that are organizational audits where we can assess the collective CQ of an organization or a team.

395
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:33,246
We can do the act of self-reflection by understanding our CQ skills and how CQ is defined.

396
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:37,929
We can self-reflect and understand perhaps where our own opportunities for improvement lie.

397
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:46,275
By utilizing the opportunity to run events and workshops, we can spread the word and help train in cultural intelligence.

398
00:32:46,752 --> 00:32:49,534
We might utilize a leadership top-down approach.

399
00:32:49,874 --> 00:32:57,481
As an example, I recently ran a workshop for the CTO and his VPs of an IT organization within a larger company.

400
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:00,464
You might do a team-based training.

401
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:08,571
For example, the Central Art team at King did a cultural intelligence workshop across Barcelona and London teams.

402
00:33:09,592 --> 00:33:11,494
And you might take a bottom-up approach.

403
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:13,115
As an example here.

404
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:19,267
I heard about a case study where Bell chose to train their Filipina call centre staff

405
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:27,893
after they'd offshored the services and had some initial early poor feedback from customers.

406
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:37,621
That resulted in a significant uptake in improved customer feedback and they saw a definite

407
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:38,922
ROI with that approach.

408
00:33:40,678 --> 00:33:43,739
You might choose to do online and or self-directed training.

409
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:47,740
In that case, you have definitely a variety of e-learn opportunities,

410
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,060
both free and paid.

411
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,541
You can use a blended option.

412
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:57,402
You might use some personalized coaching and online courses

413
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:01,283
to direct your own professional development in this area.

414
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:04,784
Train the trainer is also an option.

415
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:08,465
As I mentioned, I have been certified in cultural intelligence.

416
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:16,088
By doing Train the Trainer, we can create running workshops. As an example, we create CQ champions

417
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:22,629
within the organization. We can take a further step in certifying individuals to train the

418
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:29,790
cultural intelligence model, which is what I have. As you seek to explore opportunities to

419
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:35,431
develop your cultural intelligence, I'd like to share a few resources for measuring and developing

420
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:36,692
your cultural intelligence.

421
00:34:37,157 --> 00:34:42,141
Start with the Cultural Intelligence Center. This is where I was certified. They offer a variety of

422
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:48,345
assessments, workshop certifications, and online resources, both free as well as product-based.

423
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:53,348
You can also look up for details regarding each of the cultural values

424
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:59,052
that we had in the list that I shared. For developing your cultural intelligence

425
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:03,695
knowledge, please also consider exploring Hofstede's Intercultural Dimensions Framework.

426
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:05,356
I provided a link to

427
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,633
A site where you can compare two different countries and understand similarities and

428
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:16,157
differences at a high level and provide yourself with a sophisticated stereotype to build your

429
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:16,637
knowledge.

430
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:20,479
Erin Meyer's book, The Culture Map, is fantastic.

431
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:21,920
I mentioned this previously.

432
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:27,563
She's an intercultural expert and a professor at a business school in Europe.

433
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,087
Her work in the book demonstrates the practical examples of applying cultural intelligence

434
00:35:34,147 --> 00:35:34,568
in action.

435
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:34,848
Thank you.

436
00:35:35,408 --> 00:35:45,372
There are effectively many case studies and this link that I've provided also allows you to do a free assessment using her 8-scale culture map.

437
00:35:51,015 --> 00:36:04,141
Thank you very much for taking the time to join me and learn more about cultural intelligence for the games industry. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to reach out through LinkedIn, email, or even phone.

438
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:06,323
Thank you, be safe, and be well.
