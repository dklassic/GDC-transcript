1
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:07,598
Welcome back.

2
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:09,899
This is our second session of the Serious Games Summit

3
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:12,000
and our Games for Health Day.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,883
Our next presenter, I first met about four years ago

5
00:00:17,883 --> 00:00:21,926
and had read about this wonderful piece of work

6
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:26,028
where there had been a virus outbreak inside World

7
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:30,010
of Warcraft due to a design flaw in some new content

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,091
that the game was putting out.

9
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:35,153
And there had been an article published.

10
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,802
by an epidemiologist who had gone back to look at what had actually happened

11
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:45,084
and try to understand it from their standpoint.

12
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:50,866
And, you know, I thought that would be a really interesting talk at a Games for Health conference

13
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:55,387
in that, especially because it was dealing with World of Warcraft, it's always good to,

14
00:00:55,387 --> 00:01:02,670
for content-wise, to associate yourself with the most popular game being played at the

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:02,890
moment.

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,110
You can almost never fail there.

17
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:09,835
But we got a lot more than we bargained for because not only did we get a great talk,

18
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:12,937
but we met somebody doing some really incredible work,

19
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:19,943
and it was really it was really apparent that the talk was connecting with people when like all of the senior scientists and

20
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:27,509
people from all kinds of different groups in the federal government who deal with trying to protect us from

21
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,650
epidemics and other kinds of

22
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,793
similar episodes ran to the front of the room and were like, I'm getting in line first.

23
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,063
So I had promised Nina that we should have this talk at GDC

24
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:43,247
because I think people should see what can come out of games

25
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:46,970
even if they're not purposely built for a serious purpose.

26
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,611
And things can actually happen.

27
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:51,053
And the behaviors of players inside the games that

28
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:53,815
are being made every day have potentially

29
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:58,219
interesting opportunities for the rest of the world

30
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,500
to learn from.

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,402
So you're going to get a chance to see some of that work

32
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:03,763
and some other work that's been built off of this.

33
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:12,569
So please welcome Nina Pfefferman.

34
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:12,889
Hey guys.

35
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,170
Thanks, Ben.

36
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,391
Every time Ben invites me somewhere, it's somewhere I've never been and somewhere I have a great time.

37
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:22,952
So you guys look awesome.

38
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:24,192
Thank you.

39
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:27,413
Just so I know the lay of the land, this is wonderful for me.

40
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:31,214
Usually I get to ask the following question and there's maybe one or two hands that go up.

41
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:32,675
How many of us are gamers?

42
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,208
Woohoo!

43
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,070
Okay, um, sub-question.

44
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,933
How many people are here from Blizzard?

45
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:42,896
All right, we can say anything we want now.

46
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,878
No, um, okay, so but how many people play WoW?

47
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:49,521
Okay, that's still, that's still orders of magnitude

48
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:52,144
above my normal response on this one.

49
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:53,325
I'm very psyched.

50
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:56,387
Normally, I give talks like this to epidemiologists

51
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:59,410
and people from public health and the federal government

52
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,331
and the Department of Homeland Security.

53
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,172
Um, none of whom admit.

54
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:05,014
to playing WoW even if they do.

55
00:03:05,014 --> 00:03:09,739
So, um, how many, how many, this is going to narrow it down a lot,

56
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:12,142
how many people were playing WoW in 2005?

57
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:12,382
Oh.

58
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:19,029
Okay, what are you guys doing here? You lived this. Okay.

59
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:26,391
So I'm going to talk to you today predominantly about the corrupted blood plague of 2005 in World of Warcraft and how we're using it.

60
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:31,532
And as Ben started to tell you, I'm going to take serious games in a whole different way.

61
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:38,713
Usually when the folks who start talking about serious games mean research into serious games, what they mean is,

62
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:45,114
how do we make the user experience of the game such that there's a benefit to the user,

63
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:48,715
and in the context of Games for Health, to their personal well-being?

64
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:57,398
And now I'm going to step back from that and say, actually, I want the beneficiaries of the research that I do to be everybody, not just the users of the game.

65
00:03:57,398 --> 00:04:03,800
And I'm going to use the game in order to gain insight into how I think public health practice should happen.

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,462
And I'm going to do it from the perspective of epidemiology, which is the study of disease epidemics.

67
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:11,323
And from my perspective, usually it's infectious disease.

68
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:15,525
But at the end of the talk, I'll sort of tell you about some stuff I'm doing with non-infectious disease.

69
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:18,508
because of something surprising that came out of some ongoing

70
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,468
work in a virtual world.

71
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,890
So I'm affiliated with way too many places,

72
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,492
but I'm a professor at a medical school.

73
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:28,133
I'm a professor in a department of evolution and ecology.

74
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,774
I'm a professor of applied mathematics.

75
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:33,976
And all of them let me have students with me

76
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:35,297
who play games, which is fantastic.

77
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:38,218
OK, so I want to make another disclaimer, which

78
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:42,320
is that I have shamelessly stolen lots of images

79
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,141
from Blizzard's website.

80
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,905
And they're all beautiful, and I own none of them,

81
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:46,766
and I hope they don't mind.

82
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:51,308
But yes, all of the pictures of Wow

83
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:53,269
come just from screen capture or from their website.

84
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:56,631
OK, so in case you guys don't know, how many of you

85
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,753
know what an infectious epidemiologist does?

86
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:00,574
That's pretty good, actually.

87
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:02,515
You guys rock in general.

88
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:04,496
First of all, actually, in the first session,

89
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,477
I don't know how many of you were also in the first session,

90
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:09,999
it sounded like the other room was having a lot more fun,

91
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:13,101
even though the talk in here was awesome and clearly better.

92
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:15,659
I don't know what was going on in the other room.

93
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:18,480
But, so I would encourage kind of yelling or screaming

94
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,641
or throwing things if it stops being fun,

95
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:22,643
because we clearly need to have more fun

96
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:25,504
than the people in the next room.

97
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:27,205
Yes, thank you, woohoo!

98
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:31,648
Okay, so what does an infectious disease epidemiologist do?

99
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,909
Well, we analyze disease risks to a population.

100
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,071
We work on figuring out what the origin

101
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:38,792
of a particular outbreak was.

102
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:47,643
We worry about public health strategies that can prevent outbreaks and make populations more robust to threats from the outside and from within.

103
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:53,046
And we investigate intervention strategies to end already ongoing outbreaks.

104
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:58,690
And we decide things like when do we make public health emergency announcements?

105
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,451
And what information do we give to the media?

106
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:03,793
And how do we communicate with the public about health risks?

107
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:09,968
And each of these things have different levels of feeling of emergency and behaviors that go with them,

108
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:14,172
especially when you think in your mind, just within the realm of infectious disease,

109
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:19,417
of the differences between communicating with people about the HIV epidemic and swine flu.

110
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:24,161
Right? Those are very different timescales of effect. They're very different levels of concern.

111
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:29,626
And you expect very different behavioral responses, depending on whether or not we, as the epidemiologists, screw up.

112
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:35,036
So we try very hard not to screw up, but we also worry about, well, if we screw up, how bad can it get?

113
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:40,360
Okay, so I'm a mathematical infectious disease epidemiologist.

114
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,506
I live in a smaller world than just all the things I told you about what infectious disease epidemiologists do.

115
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,288
I use math to try and answer all of those questions.

116
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:53,652
And so I try and predict, if outbreaks happen, where will they go?

117
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:57,595
What will they look like? What will the relative outcomes be? How bad will it get?

118
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,591
And there are a few different types of models.

119
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:02,531
So I'm going to quickly try and describe to you

120
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:05,372
all of epidemiological mathematical modeling

121
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:07,013
in about one and a half minutes.

122
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:08,113
We have basic models,

123
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:10,174
they are called the compartmental models,

124
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:12,075
where we bin people into health compartments.

125
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:14,556
You, you are healthy, but you could get infected.

126
00:07:14,556 --> 00:07:16,296
You, you are infected and you can infect others.

127
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:18,937
You, you have recovered from being infected

128
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:20,298
and are probably immune,

129
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:21,958
or you're dead, or things like that.

130
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:25,003
And we think of each of those compartments,

131
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:27,043
and we think of rates of transferring

132
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:28,883
among those compartments.

133
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:32,544
And then we try and come up with measurements for those rates.

134
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:35,444
And then very much like physicists,

135
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:38,445
we say, if there were 30 billion people,

136
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:41,125
then we'd get this completely correct.

137
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,746
And as it scales down from 30 billion,

138
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:45,006
we're getting it slightly less and less correct,

139
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,326
but it should still apply.

140
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:49,247
And then unfortunately, there's small town America,

141
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,347
and then it just doesn't work.

142
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:51,747
And we all know it doesn't work in small town.

143
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:54,416
And then we've got network models.

144
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,698
In network models, we draw, literally,

145
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:59,341
a network of everyone who meets everybody else

146
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:03,765
and has the possibility for transmitting an infection.

147
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:05,907
And then we try and say, well, if we

148
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:08,329
have those explicit contacts, what

149
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:09,630
do we know about the disease?

150
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:16,577
And then we get to make much more exact measurement about all of these disease transmission rates,

151
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:19,638
but we need to know a huge amount about the population.

152
00:08:19,638 --> 00:08:22,038
And now in small town America, this works great,

153
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,999
because we actually know a lot about contacts in a very limited range.

154
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:29,240
But then as soon as you scale up to reasonably sized town,

155
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,521
this breaks down entirely, because you don't know how often someone goes to the grocery store.

156
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:36,564
And then we get to agent-based models.

157
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:38,425
And those are the simulations kind

158
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:41,346
of like the AI controls for the NPCs in a bunch of games.

159
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:44,808
So these are the ones where we put some algorithms in back

160
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:46,468
of a particular object.

161
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:49,350
And then we say, here are the algorithms for decision-making

162
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,830
for that object.

163
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,351
And they look around, and they look

164
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:53,572
at the other people who are making decisions around them

165
00:08:53,572 --> 00:08:56,193
and their environment and what happened to them

166
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:57,234
in the last five minutes.

167
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:58,855
And they go, well, given all of that,

168
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:00,195
I'm just going home and bolting the door.

169
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:04,331
And then based on that, we see who comes into contact with whom.

170
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:09,374
And then on all of that, we model the spread of disease based on the contact patterns.

171
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:13,617
And in the compartmental models, we're assuming that random mixing happens.

172
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:19,020
All of the people from one compartment have an equal probability of meeting all the people in the other compartment.

173
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,403
And if we want to break it down a little bit, we can make sub-compartments.

174
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:24,124
But we really do treat everybody kind of as an average.

175
00:09:24,124 --> 00:09:27,286
And in the network models, everything is very explicit.

176
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:32,248
And in the agent-based models, the behavior isn't explicit,

177
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:38,510
but the algorithms for making those behavioral decisions

178
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,631
are explicit.

179
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,391
Everyone with me?

180
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,032
How many people are bored out of their wits already?

181
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,673
All right, I promise I'm getting off the epi now.

182
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:46,794
OK, so as a disclaimer, you don't need to know this.

183
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,995
I just made everything seem very lovely and easy.

184
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:52,416
It can all get very complicated.

185
00:09:52,625 --> 00:10:00,699
This is just one, this is actually like three quarters of a model to describe transmission with behavior for one disease.

186
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,125
So, only crazy people like me and my students do this at home for fun.

187
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:06,782
On the other hand, here's the deal.

188
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:09,683
What it brings us to is that in all of the models that we're using,

189
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:12,104
and these really are the models that we use,

190
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:15,984
when we as a group of epidemiologists decide

191
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,545
what flu strains to put in the vaccine for next year,

192
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,025
when someone says,

193
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:22,526
what happens if, God forbid, there's a smallpox release

194
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:25,106
in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday?

195
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:29,707
What will happen and what can we do to prevent it?

196
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:33,388
These are the models that we go to, all of us.

197
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:42,940
And so this brings us to the basic fundamental problem with all of these is that we're assuming the behavior of the people that we're modeling.

198
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:52,046
And there's a lot of behavioral change that we have to assume is going to happen in the case especially of an epidemic outbreak, when people are likely to be scared.

199
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:54,108
People are actually very difficult to predict.

200
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,334
We can use math to predict the disease really well,

201
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:58,775
once we know how people are going to behave.

202
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:01,416
These models actually, for as much as we can generalize them

203
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,298
and laugh about how simple they sound,

204
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:05,638
they actually do work really well.

205
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:08,579
We've got some great testing that says,

206
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:09,660
if we nailed the behavior part of it,

207
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,181
we've nailed the disease transmission part of it.

208
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:14,262
But then there's that behavior part,

209
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:15,963
and that part's really hard.

210
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:17,863
And right now, we basically guess.

211
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:20,044
We basically go, I don't know, what would I do

212
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:22,505
if tomorrow there was smallpox down the street?

213
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:23,566
I'd probably be scared.

214
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:23,966
What would I do?

215
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,521
What would I think to do?

216
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:27,501
The problem is that people are actually very bad

217
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,902
at making these kinds of hypothetical assumptions

218
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:32,323
about themselves, partially because they're not

219
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:35,744
in the moment and there's a lot of simply emotion feeding

220
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:38,224
into the decision making, and partially also

221
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:40,585
because that sort of scales up from the individual

222
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:42,906
to not being able to anticipate what

223
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:45,487
the actual environment around them

224
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:46,667
is going to be like at the time.

225
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,208
And so there are some really.

226
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:52,836
deep ethical, behavioral, philosophical questions that

227
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:55,519
come up that you just can't ask people, well,

228
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,743
what would you do if, and get a good response.

229
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:01,564
And we can try measuring current behaviors,

230
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:03,726
but again, that's in a very different context.

231
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:05,508
And so when we try and figure out

232
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:07,770
how do those current behaviors change if anything bad

233
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,772
is happening, we don't have a good way to know.

234
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,113
And the only thing that we do know

235
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,395
is that the ways we've tried to scale that in the past

236
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:15,297
haven't been that great.

237
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:20,058
So a lot of the times this comes into emergency evacuation modeling, things like people getting

238
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:21,519
out of the way of hurricanes.

239
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,682
The number of people who tell you they'll evacuate if someone tells them to evacuate

240
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:29,104
is actually very different from the number of people who actually put their stuff in

241
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:31,205
the car and leave.

242
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:36,508
So we know from experience, figuring out even people are bad at determining their own heroism.

243
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:38,810
There's actually a gap in both directions.

244
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,072
You get false positives and false negatives of would you run into a burning building to

245
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:42,532
save a child.

246
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:45,784
There are people who surprise themselves in both directions.

247
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:49,787
And it's not that they're not thinking really well about how to give you the right answer,

248
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:52,029
they just don't know the right answer, because it hasn't happened yet.

249
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:56,612
Okay, so how do we begin to understand these things when you've got to make these really

250
00:12:56,612 --> 00:13:01,896
basic assumptions? And so we just talked about this, we can ask the what would you do if questions,

251
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:01,956
but...

252
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:04,716
They get very complicated very quickly.

253
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:06,918
So just without answering out loud right now,

254
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:09,721
but think to yourselves, at what point

255
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:13,725
might you be willing to forego arriving at an emergency room

256
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:16,007
if you knew that your chance of dying was 98%

257
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:20,952
and your chance of infecting everyone in the emergency room

258
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:22,934
was also around 90%?

259
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:24,896
So would you show up and kill people

260
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:27,078
for a 2% chance of survival?

261
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:27,538
Maybe.

262
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,191
But that's a really difficult question to start asking.

263
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:33,113
What if you didn't know with that level of certainty?

264
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:37,836
At what point are you willing to stay and care for a sick child?

265
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:39,718
What happens if it's not your child?

266
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:45,262
So these have huge impacts on our outcomes

267
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:47,704
of our behavioral epidemiological modeling.

268
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:48,785
And so now we get to the fun part.

269
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:51,387
Now we get to see, OK, how does gaming help?

270
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:54,169
So in 2005, when some of the people in this room,

271
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,290
including me, were playing World of Warcraft,

272
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,996
There were 6.5 million players worldwide,

273
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:01,336
which is a number which I believe is now dwarfed

274
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:03,377
by the current game players.

275
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,737
But what makes it perfect from my perspective

276
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:08,898
is that WoW had at the time a really unique demographic

277
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:10,098
composition.

278
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:13,899
It wasn't just the stereotypical gamer.

279
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:16,760
It was working moms in the Midwest.

280
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,060
It was students.

281
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,180
It was professionals.

282
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,581
There was a large deployed soldier component

283
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:23,521
in World of Warcraft.

284
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:24,762
There still is.

285
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:32,715
There were scholars working in it, usually from the social sciences, not so much from the epidemiological sciences.

286
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:41,604
There were politicians. I think a few years ago there was the first real-world political rally in WoW.

287
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:42,946
Anyone go?

288
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:44,107
It was pretty cool.

289
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:44,347
Okay.

290
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:49,543
So a critical aspect, another critical aspect of WOW that made it a really good platform

291
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:52,765
for this kind of research is that it's a highly social game by nature.

292
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:56,867
It's not just that there was an aggregate of a lot of people logged in to a massively

293
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:59,948
multiplayer online game in parallel tasks.

294
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:03,710
It's that you had to have social interaction in order to accomplish these tasks.

295
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:08,112
And that's not unique to WOW by a long shot, but it was bringing all of these things together

296
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:09,413
that helped.

297
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:17,424
So one of the things that was critical from our perspective is that there were years and years of social history behind the groups that were interacting.

298
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:24,727
If you had a party going out or if you had a guild, that was a guild or a party that had been together for a long time before the outbreak happened.

299
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:36,871
And you also have high levels of interaction among strangers, people you're buying things from, people you're trading from, people who are joining you on quests because you just can't get your power together.

300
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:37,372
And in 2005...

301
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,298
Blizzard released something brilliant,

302
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:41,478
and they didn't mean to.

303
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:42,439
And no fault of their own.

304
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,639
This was not a design flaw.

305
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,761
You would have had to have been God to know that this

306
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:48,982
was going to happen.

307
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:53,264
Blizzard occasionally opens up new releases

308
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:55,485
to keep their high-level players interested

309
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:58,106
and keep low-level players engaged

310
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:00,527
without creating a huge disparity between noobs

311
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,288
and wizards, essentially.

312
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:06,930
So they opened up a new area in 2005 called Zul'Grob.

313
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,590
And as part of the challenge

314
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:13,746
for high-level players was Hakkar, a beautiful monster.

315
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:15,487
And as part of the challenge of playing Hakkar,

316
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:17,708
he cast an area effect spell called Corrupted Blood.

317
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:21,390
And what it did was cast as an area effect spell,

318
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,351
and if you were affected by it, you re-

319
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,053
part of it was to recast Corrupted Blood periodically.

320
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,734
And if you were a high-enough level player

321
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:32,015
to have fought your way to Hakkar,

322
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:33,336
this was kind of an annoyance.

323
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:35,497
It was meant to add to the challenge of battle,

324
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:37,858
but it wasn't meant to by itself be a dangerous thing.

325
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:40,496
because of course this was a high-level area.

326
00:16:40,496 --> 00:16:42,497
To have gotten there in the first place,

327
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:47,700
you had to have been robust to most of these threats.

328
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,300
And that's Hikari.

329
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,402
And yeah, he was gorgeous.

330
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,684
He's tall, he's red, he's beautiful.

331
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:56,565
There's a dramatic swooshing noise when he turns around.

332
00:16:56,565 --> 00:17:01,648
I'm easily affected by these things, I'm a gamer.

333
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:04,190
Okay, so here's where things didn't go as planned

334
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,491
when they opened up this area.

335
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:13,497
The higher level players didn't necessarily wait for the one of two options that Blizzard had in mind.

336
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:19,823
The two options being, either you killed Hakkar, in which case no problem, you healed from corrupted blood and everything was fine.

337
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:25,347
Or, Hakkar killed you, in which case, when you resurrected, no corrupted blood.

338
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:27,249
On the other hand, there are some other options for this.

339
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:32,793
Um, you can leave while still infected and run away.

340
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:40,608
Or you can summon and then banish your pet, and your pet could be infected, and when banished, your pet wasn't healed.

341
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:47,893
So when you re-summoned your pet, your pet came back with corrupted blood, which is of course a self-recasting area effect spell,

342
00:17:47,893 --> 00:17:50,695
which is an infectious disease process.

343
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:56,920
So, some of the people who went to fight Hakkar left and went back to the cities carrying infection.

344
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,042
And this is where things didn't go so much as planned.

345
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,243
So here is where players started to die.

346
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:04,940
And I don't know if you can see.

347
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,581
Can you guys, is the resolution okay for?

348
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:06,981
Okay, awesome.

349
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,903
First of all, there were skeletons.

350
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:11,024
This was actually a crucial aspect

351
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,405
from my perspective of the gameplay,

352
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,727
because normally when you've got player deaths in WoW,

353
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:15,428
no skeletons.

354
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,889
So wandering around with the ground littered

355
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:21,032
with the bodies of literally player characters

356
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,453
was actually kind of cool.

357
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:25,315
Also, Corrupted Blood was visually dramatic.

358
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:30,539
You exploded every few seconds in a little cloud of blood

359
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:31,299
and it went, pfft.

360
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:32,500
Yes, I'm big on the sounds.

361
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,631
The public gathering places were instantly shut down.

362
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:41,354
This is a guild hall or a trading hall.

363
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:41,714
Guild hall?

364
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:41,994
Oh, yeah.

365
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:44,555
That's Ironforge.

366
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:46,517
You can see, not much normal anything

367
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:47,497
is happening right now.

368
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:49,638
People are running around exploding in clouds of blood,

369
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:51,179
dropping dead, and turning to skeletons.

370
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,862
And the plague spread completely out of control.

371
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:58,884
So really, if you were logged in, you were affected.

372
00:18:58,884 --> 00:18:59,744
And it was amazing.

373
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:01,385
There was no normal gameplay happening

374
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:02,386
on the infected servers.

375
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:07,035
Blizzard tried to stop it by imposing a quarantine, which

376
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:09,197
is something we talk about in real-world epidemiology

377
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:09,817
all the time.

378
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:12,579
We talk about, OK, what happens if someone releases something

379
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:15,420
bad in Manhattan, one of the easiest places in the world

380
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,721
to quarantine, because you can only get to it

381
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,983
by bridge, tunnel, or boat.

382
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:22,864
And usually, we talk about that failing.

383
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:25,406
This was an example where, within Blizzard,

384
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:28,527
the quarantine failed.

385
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:30,308
Blizzard finally had to do something

386
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:32,910
we don't get to do in real life, which is to reset the servers.

387
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:39,618
So this went on actually for four or five days before they did this, and they were trying

388
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:40,318
in real time to fix it.

389
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:44,539
And some of them were really nice people and took the time out from being really stressed

390
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:45,119
to talk to me about it.

391
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,380
So I got to hear some of what they were trying to do, and it was brilliant, and none of it

392
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,422
worked in the same ways that we would be if there was an outbreak of something horrible

393
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:54,922
tomorrow.

394
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:59,403
A bunch of us would get phone calls from Homeland Security and we'd be scrambling on trying

395
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:02,384
to figure out what to do, and it would likely not work.

396
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:02,424
So...

397
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:02,464
So...

398
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:09,359
Actually, even the background perspective of the people in charge scrambling was actually a really good analogy for real-world events.

399
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:14,283
But did we as epidemiologists learn anything from this?

400
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:16,444
Well, how did the players behave during the plague?

401
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:20,827
Was it close to how people behaved during the real-world epidemic?

402
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:24,229
And the answer, actually, somewhat surprisingly at the time, is yes.

403
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:27,591
So, I was looking at this. I logged in because my student called me and said...

404
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:32,502
You know how we've been joking about running a disease in a game and using our output from that?

405
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:35,606
Well, we don't have to run the disease, it's happening.

406
00:20:35,606 --> 00:20:39,250
Log your character in and take a look and do it for research purposes.

407
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,016
On the other hand, we also had people doing that just for fun, which was amazing.

408
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:45,158
So that's my little...

409
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:51,044
Curiosity, but I can't get my pointer, but that's the curiosity part that we saw and that for us was the critical thing

410
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:56,249
We saw all of the things that we thought we would see we saw some courage. We saw some compliance with the imposed

411
00:20:56,249 --> 00:21:01,974
Quarantine we saw fear. We saw some suspicion of the quarantine and of blizzards motives and doing all of this

412
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:05,677
We saw some public concern the bulletin boards were going mad

413
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:09,240
I don't know if you guys who are playing this we're reading them the bulletin boards

414
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,823
there was everything from the equivalence of like aliens have landed conspiracy theories

415
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:17,034
to, oh, it's a glitch, though we set it tomorrow, everyone calm down and just have fun.

416
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:20,616
And there was everything in between. And there were people like, oh my god, if I,

417
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:24,079
if I, you know, what happens to my stuff if I can't go back and reclaim it? There were looters,

418
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:31,143
there were people maliciously running in and infecting guilds. And some of the stuff that

419
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:34,785
we, so forgetting the griefers, but the griefers are important. Forgetting the griefers, the

420
00:21:34,785 --> 00:21:37,387
important thing to us was to see the diversity of response.

421
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:40,857
And the ones that we were looking at epidemiologically were the ones,

422
00:21:40,857 --> 00:21:43,480
what are the things we hadn't thought to include in our models?

423
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,004
When we guess in our models, and we say, what should be happening?

424
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:48,706
What could happen? And we guess.

425
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:49,827
What did we forget to include?

426
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:52,930
And that's where things like curiosity really helped us,

427
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,132
because we'd never thought of that.

428
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:56,134
What happens if people rush into a quarantine?

429
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,543
Clearly, now that it's been pointed out to us, they're going to.

430
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:02,445
We have news organizations that are going to want to send reporters.

431
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:06,108
We've got people who are just curious and don't worry about the consequences or think

432
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:07,169
it's not as severe.

433
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:11,353
We've got people who are actually there to monitor the situation from an oversight perspective

434
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:12,634
who are going to need to get in.

435
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,876
We'd never modeled that before.

436
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,138
So it's actually improving our models.

437
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,419
So what did we learn?

438
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,582
It pointed out these behaviors we hadn't considered, which is very important.

439
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:23,463
But it's not everything we need.

440
00:22:23,463 --> 00:22:24,383
It's a great place to start.

441
00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:28,664
Of course, there are differences between in-game world choices

442
00:22:28,664 --> 00:22:29,344
and real world choices.

443
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:32,445
And one of the cool things about in-game world choices

444
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,346
is that gamers are actually pretty good at dealing

445
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:36,887
with probabilities.

446
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:38,407
Because we have sort of inherently this role of D20

447
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:41,148
and know what happens ingrained in our souls.

448
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:47,390
But we also note that only some people are gamers.

449
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,791
So the responses may be different.

450
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,131
We need to figure out what that is.

451
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:56,673
But so I like to make the analogy of this as being sort of clinical trials in mice for drug development

452
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:59,894
We know mice aren't people but they're a damn fine place to start

453
00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:03,335
Gamers are probably not exactly regular people, but it's a good place to start

454
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:03,715
and

455
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:09,138
Then there's a question of where are we going from here because that was a one

456
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:14,860
Moment in time brilliant thing that showed us something wonderful. We needed the fact that it was an accident

457
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,362
we actually the wrath of the Lich King expansion later didn't really help because

458
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:23,765
that was a planned event and everyone knew the effects were temporary and everyone knew

459
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:26,927
that whatever they were experiencing was meant for this to happen. Corrupted blood by the

460
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:30,029
fact that it wasn't meant to be there really gave us some great insight. And I'm going

461
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:34,411
to tell you very quickly about some stuff that is actually because of Ben and Games

462
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:39,474
for Health. When I came and gave a talk on the corrupted blood plague, I met the folks

463
00:23:39,474 --> 00:23:43,976
at Yville. How many people have seen Yville? Oh, I recommend Yville to you all, especially

464
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:47,998
for bringing out your inner child. Log in as an adult, play with the kids, they're awesome.

465
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:51,419
It is a social and science virtual world for tweens,

466
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:52,379
eight to 14-year-olds.

467
00:23:52,379 --> 00:23:56,381
And what we're doing, there exists with Yville

468
00:23:56,381 --> 00:24:00,203
developing this with Numedi and the company that makes it,

469
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:04,065
Ypox, which is a disease that you can get in Yville.

470
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:06,646
And it's been studied really well from an educational side

471
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,188
of what do kids learn about epidemics

472
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:12,209
by a wonderful professor, Yasmin Kafai at UPenn.

473
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,530
What we're doing now is studying risk perception.

474
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:23,321
in Weibel and how do the different attributes of the disease and the likelihood of catching it and the prevalence observed and the symptoms that are experienced,

475
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:30,864
how does that all feed back to the risk and health decisions that they're making as people caring for their own health within that game?

476
00:24:30,864 --> 00:24:40,207
This is what Weipox looks like. You can see she's all speckly. The rest of it I take no responsibility for. With Weipox, that's her fashion sense, somehow to wear a poinsettia.

477
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:45,294
But you can see that a bunch of people are saying achoo at the beach.

478
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:50,317
And that was one of the symptoms of WIPOX at the time, to interrupt what you were typing

479
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:51,357
with the word achoo.

480
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:55,319
And one of the really cool things that we noticed, and it's not infectious disease,

481
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,721
but it is affecting our research, is that we noticed that some of the kids in Wyville

482
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:01,542
were typing achoo into their own text.

483
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,123
It wasn't being auto-inserted.

484
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:08,425
And we stopped for a minute and we went, why on earth are they doing this?

485
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:12,799
Well, they can't mimic the facial splotches, but lots of people with the facial splotches

486
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,540
were covering up their faces anyway.

487
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,622
They were masks or pretty hats or things like that.

488
00:25:18,622 --> 00:25:21,024
And then they would cover up their faces and say, achoo.

489
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:22,925
So we thought a lot about faking.

490
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:25,167
We said, okay, well, what could this be?

491
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:29,009
Well, it could be that WIPOX is actually perceived as cool or good, right?

492
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:31,531
And that they were trying to do this.

493
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:35,874
Well, that wasn't in line with what we were reading in the chat or what they were saying

494
00:25:35,874 --> 00:25:36,394
to each other.

495
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:39,061
They were saying, no, WIPOX is really annoying,

496
00:25:39,061 --> 00:25:40,982
it's really bad, if nothing else,

497
00:25:40,982 --> 00:25:43,665
it's interfering with typing commands.

498
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:44,465
So it's really annoying.

499
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:48,288
If you want to say something in the middle of the word say,

500
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,010
the word achoo comes up, it didn't process.

501
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,972
We thought maybe they were just screwing with the studies,

502
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:54,433
because there are lots of kids running

503
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:56,875
their own epidemiological studies of WIPOX and Weyville.

504
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,276
Maybe they're just screwing with the data.

505
00:25:58,276 --> 00:26:01,399
But that didn't actually turn out to be

506
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:02,420
what we ended up thinking.

507
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,141
What we ended up thinking was that

508
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:05,402
it's actually a form of empathy.

509
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:11,540
It's actually an idea of, I'm feeling left out, all of my friends are experiencing this negative thing,

510
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,943
I don't know how to correctly provide empathy to them.

511
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:17,305
And so this led us to an interesting hypothesis.

512
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:19,347
And we're winding it up.

513
00:26:19,347 --> 00:26:24,631
Our interesting hypothesis, so this is a teaser for our coming research,

514
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:27,934
is actually that in looking at kids and addiction behaviors,

515
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:30,677
we've been focusing as public health people on saying...

516
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:33,376
Kids are not estimating their risk correctly.

517
00:26:33,376 --> 00:26:35,237
They're trying to get high and they're not realizing

518
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:35,977
they'll get addicted.

519
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:38,679
This led us to make the hypothesis, no, no, no.

520
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,780
What if kids are trying to get addicted

521
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,422
because they realize it's something bad

522
00:26:42,422 --> 00:26:43,562
their friends are going through

523
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,404
and they don't know how to provide empathy

524
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,064
appropriately to them?

525
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:49,106
And this may not be something that kids have to realize

526
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:50,947
that they're doing in order to do it,

527
00:26:50,947 --> 00:26:52,868
and which would drastically change,

528
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:54,730
and we're working on this study now,

529
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,812
drastically change how we would try and target

530
00:26:58,812 --> 00:27:00,373
anti-addiction campaigns for youth.

531
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:02,435
So it's an ongoing study.

532
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:05,016
Hopefully, I'll have results for you quite soon.

533
00:27:05,016 --> 00:27:06,416
And that's pretty much the end of the talk.

534
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,677
So I don't think this will ruin gameplay.

535
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:12,137
But if anyone would like to work with me

536
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:15,178
and has more than 100,000 players?

537
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:16,618
So yeah, so part of what we're doing

538
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:19,179
is now taking these insights and going back

539
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,360
into our epidemiological models.

540
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,480
And gaming in the nation's service, ha ha.

541
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,901
So thank you very, very much.
