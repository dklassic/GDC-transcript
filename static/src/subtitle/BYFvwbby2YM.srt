1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,792
I'm Eric Wolpaw, and I'm a writer at Valve.

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,734
I'm Chet Valsak, also a writer at Valve.

3
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:11,636
And today we are going to talk about making Portal 2.

4
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:14,779
And because we're going to talk about making Portal 2,

5
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:18,282
I just want to be clear that there's going to be a lot of spoilers in the talk.

6
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:21,845
So if you want to storm out, now would be a good time.

7
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:26,669
Talk's going to be about 30-35 minutes long,

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,751
and we want to leave some time at the end for Q&A.

9
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:31,253
So here we go.

10
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:39,578
Blues Brothers 2000, Ghostbusters 2, and my favorite, Titanic 2.

11
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:43,141
These all raise a question, why even make a sequel?

12
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:47,265
Yeah, sequels get a bad rap, which comes mostly from movies,

13
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:50,267
we think, where sequels rarely work in the first place

14
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:53,390
and are almost never better than the original.

15
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,454
Game sequels, though, have a long tradition

16
00:00:58,254 --> 00:01:00,196
of actually improving on the original.

17
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:05,416
The reason why I think is just because games in general get better with iteration.

18
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:12,546
Most of the first in a series of games tends to not actually capture the vision of the developers.

19
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:16,531
So the good news here is that making a sequel to a game is actually,

20
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:19,555
should be a lot easier than making a sequel to a movie.

21
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,800
Unfortunately, we still had a problem. This is a sequel to

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,861
Portal. Critics and players pretty much thought the game was

23
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:28,743
the perfect length. Most people thought the story was self

24
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:30,744
contained and they were just about satisfied with the

25
00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:33,706
experience. You know, at the end we blow up Aperture and we even

26
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:38,328
kill GLaDOS, kind of. So that was the problem. We made a game

27
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:41,030
with really no thought of making a sequel or extending the story

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,611
on how we would go and make about a sequel. Go about making

29
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:43,891
a sequel.

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,134
Jay Pinkerton, who's one of the other writers, helped us make this slideshow, and he put

31
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:53,918
these in this morning, these quotes, so I'm actually just seeing it for the first time.

32
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:59,162
Could Portal 2's writers possibly top what many consider to be one of the finest examples

33
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:00,463
of modern game writing?

34
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:02,024
In a word, no.

35
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:05,327
So they kind of gave it to us and then took it away there real quick.

36
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,771
So why make Portal 2?

37
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:16,710
we really just get to work on what we're interested in.

38
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,614
And the bottom line was Portal 1 was made by a small team of students that we picked up

39
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:26,697
from DigiPen who had made a small demo game called Nurbacular Drop.

40
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:31,961
And so that left like 150 people at Valve who actually didn't get to work on Portal,

41
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,583
but who loved Portal. And so after we released the orange box,

42
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:40,287
there were just a bunch of people who wanted to work on a Portal game.

43
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,329
And honest to God, it was as simple as that.

44
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:47,368
So then the question is where do we start? At Valve we don't

45
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:50,510
create giant design documents. What happened is after the

46
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,572
orange box we took about four months where the entire company

47
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:56,033
broke into small little groups of about three to four people

48
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:59,755
and we did design experiments. And this is you can kind of

49
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:03,197
pursue whatever interested you, whatever kind of crazy game play

50
00:03:03,237 --> 00:03:06,359
idea you wanted to explore. And a few of those experiments seemed

51
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,759
like they might be a good fit for Portal.

52
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,841
Right. And that's where we started. With a few simple

53
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:12,682
ideas and some goals and constraints.

54
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:16,619
At this stage of a project of Valve, we tend to start with a smaller team.

55
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,583
In the case of Portal 2, there was about 15 of us, so that we can kind of poke holes in

56
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:25,626
the concept before we get a big 60 or 70 person shipping team on it.

57
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:27,307
So that's what a group of us did.

58
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:33,191
And after looking at the result of everybody's design experiments and thinking a lot about

59
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:38,255
what a sequel to Portal might look like, we ended up making a few key initial choices.

60
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,602
So, the first thing was we decided to keep Aperture.

61
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:48,946
Aperture science seemed like it was the foundation, kind of, on which Portal was built.

62
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:53,630
From writing perspective, we thought there was sort of unlimited potential there to explore

63
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,312
this mad funhouse of science.

64
00:03:56,472 --> 00:04:01,736
So, having decided to keep Aperture, here's what we cut from the original version of Portal 2.

65
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:02,957
So we cut Chell.

66
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:03,797
She got out.

67
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:04,538
Good luck to her.

68
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:05,138
Who needs her?

69
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:05,318
Right.

70
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:05,939
Who needs her?

71
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:09,983
cut GLaDOS. She kind of died in the end. She had a nice little

72
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:13,388
story arc. It's time for a new villain. And we cut portals.

73
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:17,734
Sure. The name is in the title. But we figured we would worry

74
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:20,639
about that later. Who needs them? We have a sexy new

75
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:22,121
mechanic. Super confident in that.

76
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:26,247
So the new mechanic was something that came out of the

77
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:30,510
design experiments and it was called F-Stop. And this is from

78
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,031
our F-Stop Portal 2, our first mock up of it. This is kind of

79
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:37,813
the room where you were introduced to F-Stop. I'm not

80
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:40,135
actually going to go into the details of the mechanic because

81
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:45,117
hopefully someday we'll use it again. So in this version we had

82
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:48,839
a new antagonist and that was Cave Johnson who actually ended

83
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,842
up showing up in Portal 2 for part of the experience but

84
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:57,257
In F-Stop Portal 2, he was the whole show.

85
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,618
He was the main character.

86
00:04:58,638 --> 00:05:01,100
And these are some concepts from when we were originally

87
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,041
casting for him.

88
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,803
Originally, he was going to be this southern billionaire, and

89
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:08,766
he eventually kind of transmogrified into the

90
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:11,508
Midwestern millionaire that appears in Portal 2.

91
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:17,045
glados was not going to appear uh... except in this

92
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:18,267
little cameo

93
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:22,652
uh... where we have this thing called the gyroscopic liability absolver and

94
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:23,913
disc operating system

95
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:24,734
and uh...

96
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:29,446
referred to as Betty, and she would kind of roll out after Cave Johnson would

97
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:30,407
describe a test

98
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:35,691
and quickly rattle off some legalese stuff that would absolve Aperture of any

99
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:38,714
responsibility for the danger you're about to be in. It was like

100
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:43,458
in those ads for medicine where they show puppies while they're talking about

101
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:45,059
the rectal bleeding it's going to cause.

102
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:50,540
So this was also going to be a new era of Aptcher that you hadn't seen before.

103
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,384
It was all going to take place in the 1980s, about 20 years before the events of Portal 1.

104
00:05:56,545 --> 00:06:00,087
And it was all going to be about this robot uprising.

105
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:05,051
You can kind of see these mannequins in the lower right-hand corner having a smoke break.

106
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:08,334
And I found this picture. I don't know what it is.

107
00:06:08,354 --> 00:06:10,595
There's a giant chicken running through some offices.

108
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:12,397
I'm not sure what that was all about.

109
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:19,242
But anyway, so it was going to take place in the 80s and you were going to get to see a whole new part of Aperture before it had actually been destroyed.

110
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:29,087
So this is the very original, the opening sequence of that game, or of the FSOP portal.

111
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:35,010
This is where you're waking up in that version of the Relaxation Vault, if it plays.

112
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:34,779
So that was showing some of the transforming environments that we were going to go for

113
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,120
in that iteration.

114
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,295
So after about three months of working on this,

115
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:40,296
the team felt pretty good.

116
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:43,337
People seemed to like the individual component ideas.

117
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:46,098
But when we had something meaty enough to play test,

118
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:48,599
the constant feedback we got was that it was a lot of things,

119
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,260
but it wasn't Portal 2.

120
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:53,942
So lesson one, you don't need to burn everything to the ground.

121
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:56,483
So some of the things we added back in?

122
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,465
We added back in Chell, GLaDOS, and Portals.

123
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:11,351
So in terms of the portals, at the end of development of Portal 1, we had had a few

124
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:17,035
mechanics that we'd been working on, but because of the size of the team, we just didn't really

125
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:18,836
have time to polish them enough to ship.

126
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:23,079
Some things like the light bridge that's shown here, and the excursion funnels.

127
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,123
And so we went back to these and actually started trying to design puzzles with them

128
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:29,584
and figure out what worked about them.

129
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,391
And so we also went back to GLaDOS.

130
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,992
You know, in the last 10 minutes of Portal,

131
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:36,353
she's an interesting character to explore.

132
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:38,254
She's broadened herself at that point.

133
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,656
She has more emotions, for lack of a better term.

134
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:41,536
She's become more human.

135
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:44,038
And I think if most people look back at Portal 1,

136
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:45,358
that's the GLaDOS they remember.

137
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:47,199
They don't remember the early robotic GLaDOS.

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,520
You know, and as writers, we'd lived with her for years,

139
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,742
and so, you know, whatever we thought of her,

140
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:53,483
it was a skewed perspective.

141
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:55,964
Most gamers had only lived with her for a few hours,

142
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:58,325
and they wanted, they were ready for more of her.

143
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:03,948
So Chell bringing her back was kind of the least intuitive piece to us.

144
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:12,353
She's mute, she doesn't really have a character, she's just kind of this physical presence that you occasionally see glimpsed through portals.

145
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:18,216
And honestly, like Chet said before, we kind of felt as writers that she'd had her day.

146
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:21,538
She fought GLaDOS, she escaped, and we just let her be.

147
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:28,842
And we put her, we started this iteration of Portal with you waking up in the relaxation vault

148
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:33,185
and you were standing in front of a mirror so that you could see that you weren't Chell.

149
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:37,889
You were this other character we called Mel who had blonde hair and a different colored jumpsuit

150
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:39,931
and it was pretty obviously not Chell.

151
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:42,693
And to a person, playtesters didn't care.

152
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:47,117
At that point, it did not matter at all to them that they weren't Chell.

153
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:48,358
Until the point...

154
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:52,639
where she wakes up GLaDOS and GLaDOS does not recognize her.

155
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,022
And what we realized is that Portal 1 was this sort of intimate story

156
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:00,144
about the relationship you had with GLaDOS.

157
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:04,186
And when GLaDOS wakes up and doesn't recognize that you're the person

158
00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:08,388
that did these things to her in Portal, it's actually a blow to the player.

159
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,330
I mean, this was a place where to a person, the playtesters were like,

160
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,532
eugh, why doesn't GLaDOS know who I am?

161
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,073
So, Chell went back in.

162
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:19,661
And then at this point, we also added something new, and that

163
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:20,642
would be the paint mechanic.

164
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:24,105
We had hired the guys who made Tag the Power of Paint back in

165
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,427
the Left 4 Dead 1 days, and they actually helped us ship

166
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:27,347
Left 4 Dead 1 and 2.

167
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:30,850
And then they were somewhat independently working on using

168
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,811
paint with portals.

169
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:33,853
And they showed what they were working on to the Portal 2

170
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,234
team, and we brought them on board.

171
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:36,275
So there you had it.

172
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:37,716
We had our new mechanics for the game.

173
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:38,176
Yep.

174
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:41,559
So we had added a whole bunch of stuff in, although still

175
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,481
cut was the cake.

176
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,322
And nope, nobody missed it.

177
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:51,207
So this is where we were at this point after the F stop was

178
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:55,150
abandoned. Portal 2 would have portals, GLaDOS, and take place

179
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,672
in the aperture that players were familiar with from Portal

180
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:03,197
1. So here is the very first opening of that iteration of

181
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:03,697
Portal 2.

182
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:14,207
Activated. Hello. You have been detained in the relaxation vault for 9.

183
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:19,039
Zero. Zero. Zero. Four. Zero.

184
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,566
Sentry mode activated. Target acquired.

185
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,830
What's going on over there?

186
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,731
I don't see nothing.

187
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:23,315
Why am I not surprised?

188
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:25,478
Critical Error. Critical Error.

189
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:26,961
Do you smell something burning?

190
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:49,541
So, we wanted to make a game for both new and returning players.

191
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:56,607
We didn't want to force new players to play Portal 1 in order to understand what was going

192
00:12:56,787 --> 00:12:56,907
on.

193
00:12:57,447 --> 00:12:58,989
Unfortunately, Portal 1 was...

194
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:05,088
about 80% training arc. So the challenge we faced when we switched back to portals was

195
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:10,994
how to compress that and re-present it in a way that new players would be up to speed

196
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:15,598
on portals, but that returning players would still have something interesting going on.

197
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,742
So the good thing is we had some fresh eyes looking at Portal 1's

198
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:22,565
puzzles and we came up with some clever ways to kind of

199
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:25,988
streamline and combine training. For instance, in its original

200
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:29,511
form, this puzzle, what we call Portal Carousel, required

201
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:32,114
players to wait for the portal to move around the room on its

202
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:34,776
own schedule and you could see often players wouldn't look at

203
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:38,460
where the portal was coming up. It was just really hard for them

204
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,381
to learn and slow to solve that puzzle.

205
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:43,930
And then the new version of this puzzle, of the same map,

206
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,592
allowed the players to control the pace by opening up the

207
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:47,413
portal with a button.

208
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:50,856
This not only made the puzzle faster to solve, but by letting

209
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:53,778
players control the appearance of the puzzle, they actually

210
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:56,360
helped understand the new mechanic.

211
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:59,743
It seems pretty obvious, but it's a really big difference

212
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:00,263
between the two.

213
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:08,787
So, another thing we did was improve the game by actually removing one of the features of

214
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:14,468
Portal 1, which was the dreaded plasma ball. I don't know if you remember it, but we replaced

215
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:20,689
it with lasers. The plasma ball had had several drawbacks, primarily that there was a long

216
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:25,431
wait after failure before the plasma ball would come back, and also the way it would

217
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:29,251
kind of sneak up behind you and just vaporize you out of nowhere, and players often had

218
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,772
no idea why they just died.

219
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:41,713
But lasers had all the puzzle-solving properties of energy balls while also providing instantaneous

220
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:47,057
feedback loop for the player. Because a laser entering one portal and coming out of the

221
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:51,220
other was sort of a permanent fixture until you moved the portal, we noticed that it really,

222
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,242
really helped new players sort of understand what portals were doing.

223
00:14:57,658 --> 00:15:01,886
uh... the lasers also let us do a few things the plasma balls didn't for

224
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:02,247
instance

225
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:03,289
this is

226
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,492
the original

227
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:09,060
version of the part of the game where you destroy the neurotoxin facility

228
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:36,756
So that long, awkward part I just showed you was an accurate

229
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:39,657
recreation of what players did when they went in that room.

230
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:42,777
There's this kind of fundamental, axiomatic, physical

231
00:15:42,837 --> 00:15:45,618
principle of gamers that they will never look up at the

232
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:48,979
ceiling. They only look straight ahead, which I guess

233
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:49,599
we should have known.

234
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:55,481
But so here is the actual solution.

235
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:07,887
So it was kind of cool, but we were really having a hard time getting people to look up.

236
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:09,512
At one point we even considered just putting a...

237
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:16,176
Sign there that just said look up which seemed like it was gonna ruin the puzzle and just seemed kind of cheap and we had

238
00:16:16,196 --> 00:16:17,277
a rule against doing that

239
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:22,820
Having said that we put a lot of time into making the implosion in that room look really cool

240
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,621
And when we discovered people were turning away not looking at it

241
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:30,704
We actually did just put a sign in that says in case of implosion look directly at him throw implosion

242
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:36,747
So I guess the design rule there is don't be a tight-ass about your own rules. Just abandon them

243
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:41,623
Alright, so while we tighten up the Portal 1 training arc, we

244
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:43,804
still needed something more to entertain returning players.

245
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:47,145
And some of what we did was merely cosmetic. For instance,

246
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:50,686
here's the Portal 1 elevators. And then we can take a look at

247
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:54,266
the Portal 2 elevators and we'll see that somehow destroying

248
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:57,087
Aperture Science gave us all new elevators with video screens

249
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,928
around them that showed us cool little transition movies. I

250
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:03,108
mean, there is no logical reason we have new elevators. But

251
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,769
players never questioned it, never minded it. And so our

252
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:07,809
thought always was, you know, you don't need to be a slave to

253
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:08,410
the original.

254
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,572
If you're improving it, players won't care.

255
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:15,617
And so then we also set the game in some unknown, but long

256
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:17,078
amount of time after Portal 1.

257
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,861
So this way, the returning players, they see familiar

258
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:23,045
spaces in an entering altered space or in state.

259
00:17:23,906 --> 00:17:25,788
It also let them see their actions in Portal 1.

260
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,069
They're the ones who blew up the base.

261
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,211
They're the ones who caused all this plant overgrowth and

262
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:29,852
destruction.

263
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:31,073
And they got to witness it.

264
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:37,366
And the altered environments wasn't quite enough to rehabilitate the old space, so we

265
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:38,847
introduced a new character, Wheatley.

266
00:17:39,747 --> 00:17:43,308
He gave players an interesting companion, which was the final thing we needed to make

267
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,129
the training feel fresh.

268
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,930
Luckily, Wheatley solved a few other problems for us.

269
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:50,728
You know, Portal 1's story kind of sneaks up on you.

270
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,250
Players aren't sure if it's funny at first.

271
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,313
In fact, players don't even know there's a story until

272
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:56,594
about 2 3rds of the way through.

273
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,977
It's a really good trick, but you can't do it twice.

274
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,480
So for Portal 2, we need to do something new.

275
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,942
And Wheatley really quickly helps establish

276
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:04,683
the tone right off.

277
00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:05,584
You know it's a comedy.

278
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:08,307
He comes in, you're laughing, it's OK to laugh.

279
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:09,909
The rest of the game, it's OK for you to laugh.

280
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:13,721
And, you know, Wheatly also gives players a burst of exposition.

281
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:17,467
And the cool thing here is new players, they get told what happened,

282
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:21,515
and returning players are reminded of who they are, where they are, and what's happening.

283
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:26,131
And for new players, he also restates the entire plot of

284
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,593
Portal 1 and provides a brief glimpse into GLaDOS.

285
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:30,735
And that way, you also get to know that she's a big deal.

286
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:34,638
And then finally, when you have this likable companion, he

287
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,680
also actually lets us demonstrate something else to

288
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,022
new players, and that's that GLaDOS is a threat by having

289
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:40,103
her immediately kill him.

290
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,965
And that's not a spoiler, because he's not actually dead.

291
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:44,347
And that is the spoiler.

292
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:52,673
So there was a lot of positive things with Wheatley, but he did cause some problems.

293
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:58,399
The first problem was that we burned a lot of calories making sure you couldn't leave him behind.

294
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:05,465
When we first put him in the game, you spent a lot of time actually carrying him around.

295
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:08,948
And we let you drop him basically at any point.

296
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:10,770
The main reason we let you drop him because...

297
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:14,188
was because we were thinking well if you can carry him obviously

298
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:18,638
you ought to be able to drop it was just this kind of axiomatic assumption that

299
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,984
we made that we never really thought the challenge

300
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:27,161
The other reason you could carry him dates back to an early prototype sphere that was

301
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:32,283
this paranoid sphere that he carved out a section of old aperture as his own little

302
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:36,064
fipedom and it set up all these defenses to protect it.

303
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:41,166
Unfortunately, all the defenses were pointed in one direction and Kjell could just drop

304
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:45,248
in through a crack in the wall about two feet behind him and pluck him off his pedestal.

305
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:49,010
And here is an actual video of that original sphere.

306
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,974
Well I guess you won't be doing that, will you?

307
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:02,094
Not here you won't.

308
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:04,456
I'll mind watching you cause there's going to be one on now

309
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:08,859
Oh yes, oh yes indeed I can make sure you have that

310
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:14,083
I'd love to see Sawgat here

311
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:17,005
I'd dearly love to see that

312
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:22,670
I am absolutely just teetering on the precipice here lady

313
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,252
Put me down or I will go mad and open people

314
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:41,647
Put me down because I doubt very much that you are prepared for the terrible consequences of me going mental,

315
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:44,568
which, I swear to god, is this close to occurring.

316
00:20:44,689 --> 00:20:44,909
Right?

317
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:45,369
Blah.

318
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:46,049
Ow.

319
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:46,489
Urgh.

320
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:46,730
Ahhh!

321
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:46,870
Urgh!

322
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,310
Aaaaaaaagh!

323
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:54,006
So that last part at the end where you beat him against a wall and then throw him down the stairs

324
00:20:54,747 --> 00:20:57,609
caused us probably about a year of pain and suffering

325
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:02,074
because we liked it so much that we wanted to make sure that you could do it with Wheatley.

326
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:06,638
Unfortunately, being able to drop Wheatley meant that we had to gate the player

327
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,962
so that he couldn't just drop Wheatley and then wander off into the rest of the game.

328
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:14,925
And those gates took the form of these doors that Wheatley would

329
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:18,068
have to hack and they were at regularly scheduled intervals so

330
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:20,470
you could only get about 20 feet ahead of Wheatley.

331
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:24,313
Implementation wise, it was a huge pain in the ass.

332
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:28,497
And as the game progressed, the time that you spent with

333
00:21:28,557 --> 00:21:32,100
Wheatley off his rail was narrowed down to more or less

334
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,063
what it is in the shipping game, which is after he jumps off his

335
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:37,985
management rail and you don't catch him all the way up until

336
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:42,680
the point where you put him in the elevator that leads up to GLaDOS. It's probably about

337
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:50,383
five minutes in the shipping game. But having said that, this staircase in the GLaDOS wake-up

338
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:54,725
room is actually only there because we wanted you to be able to throw Wheatley down it.

339
00:21:57,146 --> 00:21:59,627
So at some point, fairly late in development...

340
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:04,986
We finally admitted how many problems dropping Wheatley was causing us and we just decided

341
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:08,667
during that part he was going to stick to your hands like glue. We put it in and we

342
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,829
assumed because we built it so much up in our heads that playtesters were just going

343
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:16,550
to revolt and they were going to be trying to throw him down and just be angry and not

344
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,392
a single playtester even cared that you couldn't drop him. None of them even tried. It was

345
00:22:21,412 --> 00:22:25,714
just another example of us having these kind of fundamental assumptions that we didn't

346
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:26,634
think to question.

347
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:29,555
the fact that you can't drop Wheatley, if you don't know you

348
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:35,096
can drop Wheatley, nobody misses it. So our second problem with

349
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:40,798
Wheatley rose out of temp audio. So this is Steven Merchant who

350
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:46,419
voiced Wheatley and his sessions happened and his VO came online

351
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:51,900
like in the last year, year and a half of development. Before

352
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,201
that, Wheatley's voice was provided by one of our

353
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:57,142
animators, Richard Lord.

354
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:01,837
This is the picture that Richard gave us when we asked him.

355
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:07,000
Actually, give us another picture of him on the toilet so you're getting a better one.

356
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:12,743
Richard is a super duper smart guy.

357
00:23:12,804 --> 00:23:17,546
He designs and animates all the iconographic animations.

358
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:22,338
that you see in the elevators and that were in some of our advertising. He's also got

359
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:27,162
this kind of nice voice that people like to listen to. And you heard his voice in the

360
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:34,389
clip of the Paranoid Sphere. So people liked his voice enough that when our first merchant

361
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:40,595
session got delayed a month right before E3 where we debuted Portal, we decided what the

362
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:43,097
hell, we'll just play the Richard audio.

363
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:50,443
And people liked it. And people liked it so much that when we finally got world-class comedic actor Stephen Merchant in there,

364
00:23:50,703 --> 00:23:55,648
there was this small but very vocal section of our fanbase that was just livid.

365
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,730
Wanted Richard back.

366
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,955
And at the end of the day, this is kind of a microcosm of the whole problem with sequels.

367
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:07,739
You know, with nothing to compare it to, the first version of anything can pretty much stand alone.

368
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,181
But once you put...

369
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:12,650
a replacement in there, there's going to be somebody who prefers it.

370
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,637
It's kind of the law of sequels, you just can't win no matter what you do.

371
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:21,085
Well, you can win, but sort of like a... you can't have a flawless victory.

372
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:21,987
So...

373
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:25,859
So our last problem was caused by Wheatley dying.

374
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:29,420
So originally, GLaDOS crushed Wheatley right after she wakes

375
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,140
up, and that was it.

376
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,520
You didn't see Wheatley anymore.

377
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,561
You know, he was just dead and gone.

378
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:35,481
And we thought that kind of finality let everyone

379
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:37,462
understand just how evil GLaDOS was.

380
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:40,342
This was back when GLaDOS was still going to be the main

381
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:42,883
antagonist, but the problem was after Wheatley dies, you're

382
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:45,403
going to meet six other Sphere personalities, each with

383
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:46,183
their own personality.

384
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:53,040
And as an example, this is one of the ones, this is some concept art for the, somebody we called the Morgan Freeman sphere.

385
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,193
So he'd been sitting on that little pedestal for a few centuries,

386
00:24:58,273 --> 00:25:00,574
and he was just incredibly, incredibly wise,

387
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:04,735
but only about the 20 by 20 space that he was trapped in.

388
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:08,176
So as soon as you dragged him 22 feet out of the room,

389
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:10,397
his mind was blown, and he was pretty much useless.

390
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:15,118
Although, as the game progressed, he eventually got his feet under him

391
00:25:15,178 --> 00:25:18,079
and started delivering some homespun wisdom

392
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,680
that all related back to this little 20 by 20 space that he'd been living in.

393
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:25,712
So back to Wheatley dying. It certainly worked in the term of

394
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:28,515
making people understand how evil GLaDOS was. They got that.

395
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:32,158
But people missed Wheatley. And with GLaDOS now in the mix and

396
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:34,180
none of the other spheres really having enough time to bond with

397
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,443
the player, we're missing something. Because even in a

398
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:40,085
talking game like Portal, you're still more or less riding in the

399
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:43,248
margins. And so then our simple answer was, let's just kill

400
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:44,509
Wheatley and then bring him back.

401
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:49,864
You know, we still get all the dramatic benefits of GLaDOS crushing them, plus we don't have

402
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:53,685
to throw away all the precious time we'd spend building this relationship between the player

403
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:54,165
and Wheatley.

404
00:25:54,805 --> 00:26:01,147
Even better, this led to a bunch of insight that we ought to make Wheatley the antagonist.

405
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:04,088
Because again, before he was just dead and he wasn't going to be the antagonist, and

406
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:06,569
now he's going to be the evil villain for the last half of the game.

407
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:09,171
And a lot of good things flowed from that one assumption.

408
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:11,153
It's another example where we try to solve a problem

409
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:13,255
without questioning the core assumption,

410
00:26:13,335 --> 00:26:16,018
and that was not to kill Wheatley, and then what do we do?

411
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:19,001
In this case, let's just kill him and bring him back,

412
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,242
and then it's fine.

413
00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:21,583
Everything works in retrospect.

414
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:24,927
Okay, and so now.

415
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,958
We've got a pretty good handle on the single player game. This

416
00:26:27,978 --> 00:26:30,681
is rough, but generally working in terms of plot and structure

417
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:33,483
and most importantly for what we test is pacing and

418
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:38,207
comprehension. Every play test we bring people in, we talk

419
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:40,910
about the pacing, comprehension, we make sure we have that

420
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,173
nailed, that's working, that's flowing. And the co-op mechanic

421
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:47,035
was working great on its own. Just the puzzles alone were

422
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:49,737
totally fun. So we figured the co-op story was going to be a

423
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:51,899
breeze. Smart thing on our part we thought, we'd save it to the

424
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:52,780
very end of development.

425
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,423
The problem is we discovered there's a huge difference between telling the Portal 2 story

426
00:26:57,463 --> 00:26:58,665
versus the single player story.

427
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:03,670
Yeah, since we figured people would play the single player first, we set the co-op story

428
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:06,573
after the events of the single player game.

429
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:11,759
And in this original co-op iteration, we actually thought we had a pretty good story going.

430
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,321
So with Chelgon...

431
00:27:14,193 --> 00:27:19,475
GLaDOS is just prepared to test for eternity with the two co-op bots that we introduced

432
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:20,415
in single player.

433
00:27:21,095 --> 00:27:25,177
Unfortunately, though, she quickly discovers that none of the tests she's doing is providing

434
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:30,379
any data because without any human observer, the tests are always in this sort of Schrodinger's

435
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,619
cat state of quantum uncertainty.

436
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,781
Like in this picture, is the cat hanging in there or is he not hanging in there?

437
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:38,241
Who knows?

438
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:39,722
Until somebody looks at it.

439
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:46,934
So what she does is she starts sending the bots into the bottles of Aputure to collect

440
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:51,675
human artifacts in the hope that they will help the bots become more human so she can

441
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,536
break through this kind of quantum problem she has.

442
00:27:55,996 --> 00:28:01,498
So we actually mocked this whole part up for playtesting all the way through the retrieval

443
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:09,740
of the first artifact, which was this Garfield-like cartoon called Dorfelt that some long dead

444
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,940
Aputure employee had tacked up.

445
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,941
on a bulletin board deep in the balls of Aperture. The bots find

446
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:20,162
it, they bring it back to GLaDOS and none of the three of them

447
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:23,503
can figure out what's funny about this door felt. So GLaDOS

448
00:28:23,644 --> 00:28:28,005
actually rewrites it to make it funnier. So the first three

449
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:31,646
panels, door felt is sitting next to an empty panel lasagna

450
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:35,828
and then his owner comes and he's really angry that door felt

451
00:28:36,068 --> 00:28:40,769
ate the lasagna. And then the owner says that he's activated

452
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:42,030
the neurotoxin emitters.

453
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:48,461
at which point Dorfelt feels regret, but only briefly.

454
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:54,606
So I just want to mention that Anthony Clark, who

455
00:28:55,206 --> 00:28:57,008
goes under the name of Nedroid, originally

456
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,030
drew this for Jay and I in a day when we were

457
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,071
trying to put this together.

458
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:01,872
So thank you.

459
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:03,973
So we had a comic.

460
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:06,846
And we were pretty happy with this direction. But what we

461
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:09,567
discovered as we play tested is there's some fundamental

462
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:12,289
differences between the way the story was going to work for the

463
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:15,270
single player versus the co-op. In single player you have a

464
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,071
captive audience. They will watch intently. They're fully in

465
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,132
the moment and they generally pay attention to the crafted

466
00:29:21,172 --> 00:29:24,874
experience. Co-op players on the other hand will interrupt your

467
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:26,675
best material to ask each other what they had for dinner.

468
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,321
So this means we had to simplify and change how we told the

469
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:33,383
story. And so what we do is we actually repeat the main story

470
00:29:33,443 --> 00:29:36,364
points many times in short little bits. That way if you

471
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:39,266
miss one, you can get it the next time. And this is also

472
00:29:39,286 --> 00:29:41,347
different though from how we handled it in the Left 4 Dead

473
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:43,328
series. Because we do co-op there and we tell the story

474
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,590
there, but there we know you're going to play the maps multiple

475
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,311
times, each play through you can pick up another little bit of

476
00:29:48,331 --> 00:29:48,751
the story.

477
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:52,073
For the co-op in Portal 2, we actually wanted you to get

478
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,814
everything in the first pass.

479
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:54,814
So that was the difference there.

480
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:57,055
And the mystery GLaDOS presents is simple.

481
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,816
And if you're paying attention, it's pretty

482
00:29:58,956 --> 00:30:00,197
obvious, but it's co-op.

483
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:01,837
So it's the fun of going through with your partner.

484
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:03,098
You're making up your own stories.

485
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:05,259
You're going along towards the next human genocide.

486
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,401
But there's also one other major difference between

487
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:10,381
single player and co-op players that was not obvious

488
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:12,042
to me when we started play testing.

489
00:30:12,642 --> 00:30:15,964
And that's during testing of both parts of our game, we

490
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:17,305
actually have people sit in a room.

491
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,285
They're separated.

492
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,374
and we have a camera on the game that they're playing, but we also have cameras looking at their faces so we can see their reactions.

493
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:29,880
So this is a photo I grabbed off that system of a player actually playing the single player part of Portal 1.

494
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:33,244
And this is what they look like during the entire part.

495
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,287
He's probably watching the funniest section of Portal 2 right now.

496
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:36,827
You can see he's...

497
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,413
completely stoic and unsmiling.

498
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:45,116
There's no hint that he's enjoying it at all.

499
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:47,059
But when you debrief him afterwards,

500
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,682
you're like, oh, great, it was super funny.

501
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:50,024
But again, in the moment,

502
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:53,108
they're just staring at the screen, solving puzzles,

503
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:54,851
looking incredibly angry.

504
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:58,249
So there's a strange thing that happens in co-op. We have

505
00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:01,032
people in separate rooms again. They can't see each other. We

506
00:31:01,052 --> 00:31:02,914
sometimes test them with no microphones so they couldn't

507
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:05,656
talk to each other. There's no way they can communicate with

508
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:09,259
each other and yet they laughed, they smiled, they joked, right?

509
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,501
They were having, they had all these regular things you have

510
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,604
when you're next to someone. All these regular social norms

511
00:31:14,644 --> 00:31:16,346
they carried through into the game even though they didn't

512
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:18,468
have the communication and the other person couldn't see their

513
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:20,890
face, you know, smiling or laughing.

514
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,772
So this is an important takeaway from anyone out there writing a

515
00:31:24,812 --> 00:31:27,534
game. If you're going to do a comedy game, make it co-op.

516
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:29,775
Because otherwise you're going to have years of misery and

517
00:31:29,815 --> 00:31:31,236
self-doubt as you watch playtesters.

518
00:31:31,296 --> 00:31:34,278
It's awful. It's the darkest thing you can possibly do.

519
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:42,142
So just real quick, we also tried a competitive multiplayer

520
00:31:42,182 --> 00:31:46,345
mode, which we put together over the space of a month or two.

521
00:31:46,385 --> 00:31:49,467
And it was kind of a mix between the old Amiga game, Speedball.

522
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,852
and Portal, except with none of the good parts of either of those two things.

523
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:59,353
It was super chaotic, difficult to tell what was going on, and no fun.

524
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:04,335
So the only real good news about this part was that we cut it pretty quickly

525
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:08,657
and were able to use those resources to develop co-op a little bit more.

526
00:32:09,498 --> 00:32:14,502
Alright, so in this point in development, we've got this co-op story set, we're on our way with that.

527
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:18,886
We have most of the single player story set, we just have one major problem.

528
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:20,888
We have no ending to the single player story.

529
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:25,592
And we had the same struggle when we were making Portal 1, the ending didn't come until really, really late.

530
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:27,154
And that turned out to be one of the highlights of the game.

531
00:32:27,634 --> 00:32:30,797
So we had that going for us, but still at this point, we had no ending.

532
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:34,140
We did have some things that we knew, though.

533
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,082
We knew you were going to have to confront Wheatley.

534
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:39,497
We knew you were going to have to remove him from the GLaDOS chassis.

535
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:43,701
We knew he was going to have to get some sort of comeuppance for causing you all that trouble.

536
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:50,428
And something we knew from Portal 1 was that this final puzzle shouldn't be particularly

537
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:50,948
difficult.

538
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:55,513
This should not be the most difficult puzzle in the game because long, thoughtful puzzle

539
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:58,115
solving is completely not climactic.

540
00:32:58,796 --> 00:33:00,638
So with that knowledge...

541
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:05,666
we were able to at least start designing the final battle and start iterating on that,

542
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:10,029
and that was coming together great. What was missing was any sort of story part to that,

543
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:18,156
which was bad for Jay and Chet and I. And this is an early version of the solution we

544
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:22,620
initially came up with. And you'll, you may, it's a slightly different version of the

545
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,604
N-Chamber, you'll recognize some things, but I'll just play it through.

546
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,026
Core, are you ready to start the procedure?

547
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:35,147
Corrupted core, are you ready to start the procedure?

548
00:33:38,189 --> 00:33:44,952
Stalemate detected. Transfer procedure cannot continue. Unless a stalemate associate is

549
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:50,535
present and can press the stalemate resolution button. Press button to replace core.

550
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:07,064
Stalemate button has been destroyed.

551
00:34:08,265 --> 00:34:13,408
Transfer procedure cannot continue.

552
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:17,030
Unless a stalemate associate can say the word yes.

553
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,312
Stalemate associate, do you wish to start the transfer?

554
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:26,815
Yes.

555
00:34:28,556 --> 00:34:31,758
Stalemate resolved. Core transfer initiated.

556
00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:37,764
So confused, so were all our play testers. That was Chell

557
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:41,605
speaking. The confusion reaction was pretty much all we saw from

558
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:44,246
players not really understanding who was talking and they were

559
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:47,406
super underwhelmed. That's the end of the game. This is a

560
00:34:47,446 --> 00:34:51,067
classic idea of you have this great idea, you're pitching it,

561
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:53,287
it sounds awesome. Oh, my God, Chell's finally going to speak.

562
00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:55,868
Word's going to come out. One word. She's going to say one

563
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:57,788
word and it's going to be the one that ends the game. And then

564
00:34:57,828 --> 00:35:01,129
you actually test it. Boy, did it suck. Boy, that was bad.

565
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:09,977
So this is where we were. There's a release date bearing down on us and we have no ending.

566
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:18,881
So going back a little bit, at one point earlier in production we had this idea that scattered

567
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:24,804
throughout the game there would be these fake endings. When this rose out of, when we were

568
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:29,026
watching Portal 1 playtest, there's a part about two-thirds through the game where you

569
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:29,446
ride...

570
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:33,309
uh... an elevator into a fire pit and you're supposed to escape the fire pit

571
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:34,690
and that's when you go behind the scenes

572
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:37,052
a small percentage of playtesters

573
00:35:37,492 --> 00:35:38,853
were just fine with riding

574
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:42,636
the elevator into the fire pit like that was a good ending for them it was

575
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:46,578
it was dark but they they liked it like it just ended with them dying so we

576
00:35:46,598 --> 00:35:50,061
thought well we will service those people and we had these scattered

577
00:35:50,121 --> 00:35:50,861
throughout the game

578
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:55,302
parts where Chell would die and that would be the end and we'd play a song and if you

579
00:35:55,342 --> 00:35:59,144
wanted to you could just quit there. So we had one that was like two minutes into the

580
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:04,628
game and if you died there, there was just a song that I think just Jay and I sang. I

581
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:09,931
mean we hadn't done anything yet. It was just about reviewing those first two minutes kind

582
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:16,515
of wistfully what had happened. And then later in the game there was a part where there's

583
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:18,596
a crack in the ceiling and you could see the moon.

584
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:23,226
and you could put a portal on the moon and if you put one on the wall it would suck you out

585
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:28,007
onto the moon and you would asphyxiate while listening to a sad song about the moon.

586
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:33,028
And that one actually worked. For the people that found it, which was a small

587
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:38,910
percentage of our playtesters, they really liked it. We eventually cut the alternate endings

588
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:43,191
partly because of how much work it was going to be for how little payoff and partly because

589
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:47,232
other than those two we kind of overestimated how many great fake endings we were going to

590
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:48,052
be able to come up with.

591
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:55,990
So anyway, there we were, not long to go until we're really going to have to finish this

592
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,813
game and ship, and as Jay and Chet and I, in one of these sort of flot, sweat-soaked

593
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:05,655
ending meetings, trying to figure out desperately what's going to happen, and somebody made

594
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:09,438
the connection that if we resurrected this moon thing...

595
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:11,943
It solved all our problems.

596
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:13,864
Wheatley would get sucked out of the chassis,

597
00:37:13,884 --> 00:37:16,866
he'd get a comeuppance that was kind of deserved,

598
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:18,267
but it wasn't really that bad.

599
00:37:18,307 --> 00:37:19,688
He's still out there in space.

600
00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:25,933
And it was this perfect mix of being totally awesome and completely stupid.

601
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:29,378
So, that's what we did.

602
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:33,340
And in retrospect, this is another example that we kept finding of an obvious solution

603
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,902
that was just sort of sitting there all along.

604
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:40,065
In fact, it was probably one of the biggest lessons we learned is try to give yourself

605
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:44,908
enough time for the obvious to become obvious because at a certain point, most of the answers

606
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:48,631
to what you need to do are buried in what you've already done.

607
00:37:52,110 --> 00:38:04,774
So that was the last major puzzle piece. We finished the game, we released it, and then as far as how it turned out, this year there was a pretty clear winner of the most Game of the Year awards. And that was Skyrim.

608
00:38:05,294 --> 00:38:06,314
But, um...

609
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:09,835
Still, you know, pretty clear we were number two.

610
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,736
Yeah, no shame in being number two. At all.

611
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,797
And so, that's where we ended.

612
00:38:13,977 --> 00:38:15,377
That's where we ended. We're gonna do some Q&A.

613
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:32,689
So I don't know how Q and A works. Oh, no questions. I

614
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:37,815
could ask a question. So my question is, thanks for portal

615
00:38:37,835 --> 00:38:42,360
portal 2 and Altman Murray. Could you say a little bit about

616
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,466
the role of the writer at Valve, of writers in general?

617
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:48,853
Yeah.

618
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:54,218
So I mean, part of it is we use the title writer because we

619
00:38:54,238 --> 00:38:56,099
need to have a title on our business cards,

620
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:56,920
is what people ask.

621
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,941
But everyone at Valve has a lot of different roles.

622
00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:02,905
And so it really depends on what's going on.

623
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,508
I mean, as writers, obviously we're writing this story.

624
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:08,569
We're writing, reloading, and all the things

625
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:09,610
that need to be in the game.

626
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:13,233
But it's a really collaborative effort at Valve.

627
00:39:13,293 --> 00:39:15,915
So everybody weighs in on the writing,

628
00:39:15,955 --> 00:39:17,296
and we weigh in on everything else.

629
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:27,995
Yeah, we try and spread ourselves out in terms of, you know, like Chet and I wire, and Jay as well now, wire the dialogue into the game.

630
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:31,876
We don't just kind of throw it over the wall and hope that the game turns out okay.

631
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:39,139
Which is especially important for a game that's supposed to be funny because the time, you know, tenth of a second here and there just ruins the gag.

632
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:47,644
Kind of following up on that, a lot of what made the first Portal special was how well

633
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:49,866
your voice actress understood the material.

634
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,208
There was a real sense of a relationship there.

635
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:57,651
You also took huge strides in Portal 2 by working with J.K. Simmons and Stephen Merchant.

636
00:39:58,012 --> 00:40:02,235
Can you talk some about the casting process and the recording process of working with

637
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:02,415
them?

638
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,055
Sure.

639
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:06,117
Is that Tom Chick?

640
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:06,758
Yes, it is.

641
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:11,701
So originally we...

642
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:19,134
were, we had cast an actor named Richard Ayoade, who is from the IT crowd, and Garth Marenghi.

643
00:40:19,154 --> 00:40:26,718
Yeah. And we were actually having some trouble getting our schedules right, which is when

644
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:32,260
we eventually switched to Steven Merchant. And we, honestly, Jay and I did not think

645
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,043
he would do it, because we assumed he was just so, so wealthy from owning half the office

646
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:39,964
or however much he owns. But we sent him a packet of materials.

647
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,191
And he said okay.

648
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:46,776
And we had actually been writing with sort of Stephen Merchant's voice in our head,

649
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,978
more so even than Richard Ayoade's.

650
00:40:49,558 --> 00:40:53,542
So it ended up being a good fit.

651
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:59,407
And with J.K. Simmons, I think we just always sort of pictured his voice

652
00:40:59,447 --> 00:41:02,830
whenever we heard Cave Johnson when we were writing lines.

653
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:05,333
And again, we asked him.

654
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:06,394
It's amazing when you just...

655
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:11,485
call up an actor's agent, they're more or less willing to do it. And it tends not to

656
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:14,447
be... it's less expensive than you think. I mean, I don't know if it's that way with

657
00:41:14,507 --> 00:41:18,389
every actor, but with character actors, they want to work. It's an easy gig for an actor.

658
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:21,971
They don't have to get dressed up, they don't have to go in make-up, they show up for four

659
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:26,414
hours and do their work. Stephen Merchant, actually, we did four and a half sessions

660
00:41:26,514 --> 00:41:31,698
with, including the first one where we had to go to London, the rest of them we did ISDN

661
00:41:32,258 --> 00:41:35,920
from Seattle. So we have about 16 and a half hours of Stephen Merchant.

662
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:42,299
doing stuff. And JK Simmons, basically, he read the stuff and nailed it the first time.

663
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:50,306
Stephen Merchant, we kind of let him just, with 16 hours, we let him just sort of mess

664
00:41:50,326 --> 00:41:55,771
around with the lines and he did a lot of improvisation, you know, some of which we

665
00:41:55,911 --> 00:41:58,893
used or some of which we would edit together to make a coherent thought.

666
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:04,393
after the fact. There's definitely something nice about having actors that you know their voice,

667
00:42:05,114 --> 00:42:09,176
that you can write to it directly instead of a lot of times we'll cast people and you find out

668
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:14,938
they can't say anyone, they can only say anybody or every actor has some weird hangup. You can

669
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:18,360
listen enough of their body of work that you can kind of understand what they can do. I won't name

670
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:24,383
it. We had an actor, this is not the world's greatest line and we stole it from aliens, but

671
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,664
we wanted him to say stay frosty.

672
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:28,885
stay frosty!

673
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:31,627
and for some reason he thought we were telling a dog to say it

674
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:33,527
could not read, it's like, stay frosty!

675
00:42:33,548 --> 00:42:35,148
stay, stay!

676
00:42:35,448 --> 00:42:37,889
and we're like, no no, it's like, stay frosty!

677
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,610
he's like, oh I get it, I get it, I get it

678
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,691
stay frosty!

679
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,252
so it's probably just as well that we didn't ship

680
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:44,973
a line from aliens, but...

681
00:42:45,767 --> 00:42:48,068
But the other great thing about Steven Merchant is he speaks so

682
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,289
fast and for a character that's delivering a lot of exposition,

683
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,131
that's amazingly awesome. He speaks fast and clearly.

684
00:42:54,191 --> 00:42:58,312
And he really threw himself into it. I don't think he plays a

685
00:42:58,352 --> 00:43:01,374
lot of games and I don't know that he's played Portal 2, but

686
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,995
he cared a lot about what was happening. It was terrifying

687
00:43:04,055 --> 00:43:04,295
because...

688
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:08,481
We didn't have an audition. We were just giving him some money to do it.

689
00:43:08,782 --> 00:43:11,607
And we're flying to London, Jay and I, after making this big decision.

690
00:43:11,887 --> 00:43:15,653
And if he had sucked or not cared, because he was going to build a new deck on his house,

691
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:17,096
we were super screwed.

692
00:43:18,504 --> 00:43:22,468
he from you know minute two of the session he was asking questions he was

693
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:27,333
he just he really knocked it out of the park and then also Ellen McClain who

694
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:32,198
does GLaDOS we her we just record with ever every couple of weeks whatever we

695
00:43:32,238 --> 00:43:38,364
need you know she has a handle on that on that character and that's all I have

696
00:43:38,384 --> 00:43:41,026
to say about that. You guys have to fight it out who goes I don't know how this works.

697
00:43:41,528 --> 00:43:45,974
you. This is a question about your anecdote of the testers, the single player testers being

698
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:49,979
very frosty and the multiplayer testers being very animated. Do you know if the

699
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:54,666
multiplayer playtesters were actually enjoying the experience more or were they just emoting

700
00:43:54,786 --> 00:44:00,111
about it more? At the end of the playtest when we would have them talk about highs and lows and

701
00:44:00,131 --> 00:44:06,996
that kind of thing, they seemed equal. It seemed exactly on par or equal. We'd started separating

702
00:44:07,817 --> 00:44:12,080
them from, like, so way back when I think it first started at Valve, we would actually sit

703
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,462
in the room with the playtesters, but then they would perform.

704
00:44:15,577 --> 00:44:19,300
um, because they had an audience and so that's why we would move them to the isolated booths.

705
00:44:20,101 --> 00:44:25,144
And the feedback would have been the same for either, you know, the single player or the co-op.

706
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:26,845
They were both, you know, both having a good time.

707
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:30,748
Yeah, they're just way more demonstrative in co-op.

708
00:44:30,848 --> 00:44:37,313
Uh, when you approach writing a game that will change, uh, through iterative, uh, design, um...

709
00:44:37,904 --> 00:44:40,907
where do you go for like a overall theme?

710
00:44:41,588 --> 00:44:45,592
How does that change when you're changing the game so widely with playtest?

711
00:44:46,873 --> 00:44:48,875
In terms of... by theme?

712
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:50,857
Overall theme of the narrative?

713
00:44:51,497 --> 00:44:54,120
Oh, well, I think we...

714
00:44:55,421 --> 00:44:57,043
you know, if we think of the theme as being...

715
00:44:58,704 --> 00:45:00,066
so for instance in Portal...

716
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:05,073
the theme is basically I'm going to have this relationship with GLaDOS.

717
00:45:05,153 --> 00:45:06,814
I mean, that's the most important thing to us.

718
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:12,299
So we wanted to make that central and we wanted these other characters to somehow,

719
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,443
whatever we added or whatever events had happened,

720
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:19,966
it needed to kind of deepen your relationship to GLaDOS.

721
00:45:20,006 --> 00:45:23,849
So that was there from the beginning and carried through the whole time.

722
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,030
We always held on to that.

723
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:28,373
This isn't really a theme, it's more of a writing.

724
00:45:29,244 --> 00:45:35,749
rule we had was that with a silent protagonist, there's this danger that you get into a position

725
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:39,652
where you have a bunch of characters talking about something and you're just sort of observing

726
00:45:39,712 --> 00:45:45,216
it and you're standing around just with nothing to do. So one of the rules we had in the writer's

727
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:50,640
room was that the characters needed to always be talking either to you or directly about

728
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,523
you, just so you would always feel, even though you couldn't participate in the conversation,

729
00:45:54,823 --> 00:45:56,524
that you were the center of attention.

730
00:45:59,272 --> 00:46:01,054
generally answer your question.

731
00:46:03,175 --> 00:46:07,739
So I really enjoyed exploring the drawings on the walls and I was just wondering if you

732
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:11,562
could talk about kind of when in the process you guys started thinking about what those

733
00:46:11,582 --> 00:46:17,667
would entail and how deep you went with those with the, I guess the physics and astronomy

734
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:18,808
that you guys included in those.

735
00:46:20,169 --> 00:46:22,651
And just generally talk about those, I really found them interesting.

736
00:46:23,529 --> 00:46:26,450
Well that was kind of as we were expanding the Ratman's role.

737
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:30,011
Yeah, this is kind of goes back to the thing we were talking about with the elevators where

738
00:46:30,051 --> 00:46:32,312
the elevators got way better looking between the games.

739
00:46:32,952 --> 00:46:36,013
The guy, the Ratman got way better at art between the two games.

740
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:37,094
Just because we...

741
00:46:37,114 --> 00:46:38,154
We dedicated an artist to it.

742
00:46:38,174 --> 00:46:39,815
Yeah, we had an artist who could do it.

743
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:45,721
that's the main reason of that. And some stuff is back solving.

744
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,443
So in other words, that was kind of cheap to bring online at the

745
00:46:48,543 --> 00:46:52,205
end. So when we decided late that you were going to go to the

746
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:54,867
moon, well, it was pretty easy to go back and have the Rat Man

747
00:46:54,907 --> 00:46:57,489
drawn all sorts of pictures of the moon all over. It makes us

748
00:46:57,529 --> 00:47:01,931
look super smart. Yeah. And oddly enough, the national song

749
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,274
that plays in his den was originally the moon sad song.

750
00:47:05,694 --> 00:47:07,895
Yeah, it was going to, they were going to, the national was going

751
00:47:07,915 --> 00:47:10,477
to do the sad song, you know, you had a good time, but you

752
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:11,658
died on the moon sort of thing.

753
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:20,633
of time. Yeah, hi. I was just wondering, when I was playing I noticed there were a lot of

754
00:47:21,093 --> 00:47:29,997
references to Greek mythology in the story. More so with like Prometheus. I was just

755
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:35,079
wondering what the reason was for putting those in the story. That's because Pinkerton read

756
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:41,301
some Greek mythology I think. That's really honestly about the, it was weird we made the

757
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:42,101
connection one day.

758
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:47,635
that, I don't know if this was unconscious or what, that

759
00:47:48,155 --> 00:47:51,418
basically what happens to GLaDOS is almost exactly what happened

760
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:55,841
to Prometheus. And so we just added it to the Oracle turret.

761
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:59,664
I think some of the other illusions may be accidental.

762
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:02,927
That's one of the things we discovered is that when you have

763
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:05,149
a game with enough content, there's just going to be some

764
00:48:05,189 --> 00:48:09,392
crazy coincidences that make you look, again, super smart that

765
00:48:09,432 --> 00:48:10,453
you may not have planned for.

766
00:48:11,704 --> 00:48:16,787
Carolyn apparently means free man. Is that right, Jay? But

767
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:19,649
Carolyn also just happens to be the name of Jay's mom, which is

768
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:25,773
why we actually picked that. So. Still worked out. Thanks.

769
00:48:26,593 --> 00:48:28,814
Do you ever struggle between balancing the comedy and the

770
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:31,096
drama of the piece? Like where you had a joke you really liked

771
00:48:31,156 --> 00:48:34,238
but you had to cut it because it was ruining a story beat?

772
00:48:35,403 --> 00:48:38,065
I mean, yeah, it's, you know, there's a lot of stuff we cut.

773
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:43,170
There's a whole set of tracks we cut because of gameplay that we had, good beats in, funny stuff.

774
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,614
And there's, we definitely went back and forth on, for instance,

775
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:52,098
the part where GLaDOS is deposed and Wheatley takes over.

776
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:55,701
We originally had some more jokes in there.

777
00:48:56,545 --> 00:49:02,490
and we took some of them out and we still have an ongoing argument where I still feel like when he's going in and he's like,

778
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,212
this is going to hurt, isn't it? I wish he was just more scared there.

779
00:49:05,452 --> 00:49:08,334
Like, there are times when we're like, let's just not go for the joke here.

780
00:49:08,354 --> 00:49:15,880
Yeah, because I mean, a lot of times if you go for the joke, you're purposely undercutting the main focus of that bit of story.

781
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:17,521
So, it's a toss-up.

782
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:18,562
It is something we struggle with.

783
00:49:21,434 --> 00:49:27,717
Hi, so you did sort of start the talk out with this, but I wanted you guys to go in a little more about sort of managing, I guess, fan expectations.

784
00:49:27,957 --> 00:49:35,821
So I know I was talking to some of your colleagues around like the EP2 time, and they were really nervous about how the Hunter was in the teaser trailer, but there wasn't really gameplay around it.

785
00:49:36,442 --> 00:49:47,228
And I'm wondering just about like, you know, if there are any promises you may regret or just like things that you revealed about the game before it was done or before it was tested that, you know, just kind of put you in a tough position.

786
00:49:47,628 --> 00:49:48,788
What was the thing you said they cut?

787
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:53,870
No, not that they caught, but like when the Hunter in Episode 2 was in the teaser.

788
00:49:54,350 --> 00:50:02,091
We did show, we showed the suction vents that just never turned into, I don't know if you remember,

789
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:07,652
it was, we presented it as a puzzle mechanic and you could break a tube or something and suction

790
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:13,093
would come out and you could redirect the suction through portals. It was super cool,

791
00:50:13,614 --> 00:50:16,494
but we just never really found a great puzzle.

792
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:25,005
use for it. Well, except for the end. Yeah, the mitigating factor is we did use it in the end when you get sucked onto the moon, but we didn't really make it into a puzzle.

793
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:35,396
But I mean, that happens with all the games we've ever shown at any event. I mean, there's still people that are swearing that Left 4 Dead 1, the beta that we showed at this event, was the greatest version of that game ever.

794
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:38,958
But the truth always is, there's always a little bit of smoke and

795
00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:41,279
mirrors going on there, and really the best version is the

796
00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:43,719
version we shipped. Because at some point we go, this is a

797
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:46,620
really cool thing, let's get rid of it. No, it's like, there's a

798
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,601
bunch of problems, it's not really working as well as you

799
00:50:48,641 --> 00:50:52,602
think it is. And so what we end up shipping is going to be the

800
00:50:52,622 --> 00:50:54,682
thing that, you know, we made the best choices on.

801
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:57,123
Yeah, I mean, people ask us sometimes, or, well, not so much

802
00:50:57,183 --> 00:51:00,244
anymore, but some of the promotional videos we originally

803
00:51:00,264 --> 00:51:02,325
did for Portal 2 showed some test chambers.

804
00:51:02,765 --> 00:51:04,827
that didn't really make it into the final game.

805
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:07,310
But a lot of those weren't even decent puzzles.

806
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,412
They were just something there to show off a mechanic.

807
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,257
People still, some people still think that they're going to be great puzzles

808
00:51:14,317 --> 00:51:15,338
and want to know why we cut them.

809
00:51:15,558 --> 00:51:18,041
The good news is we're going to release a puzzle creator pretty soon

810
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:21,684
so they can try and recreate them themselves and find out how bad they were.

811
00:51:22,105 --> 00:51:24,107
Thanks.

812
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:31,583
Yes, I was just wondering what decisions led to the potato, both from this purpose it served

813
00:51:31,623 --> 00:51:33,745
narratively but also just why a potato?

814
00:51:34,846 --> 00:51:38,390
So Jay and I would take these long walks trying to figure out what we were going to do with

815
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:42,615
the story and we knew GLaDOS was going to get deposed and she was going to have to come

816
00:51:42,675 --> 00:51:46,479
with you and we were trying to figure out what was

817
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:51,652
the most humiliating thing that could happen to her. And we figured turning her into a potato

818
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:56,777
battery was pretty bad. And then I think Jay said potatoes, and then it was kind of a sealed deal

819
00:51:56,797 --> 00:52:01,381
because we had a name for it. And it just seemed super sad that she would be in this shriveled,

820
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:09,708
crappy little potato. And you could put it on the gun. And yeah, we we originally also had this

821
00:52:09,788 --> 00:52:13,872
idea. There's another reason it was a potato was the bird was going to play a bigger role. So.

822
00:52:15,129 --> 00:52:20,673
Because we knew we were going to need to explain later on why she wouldn't just tell you how

823
00:52:20,693 --> 00:52:23,155
to solve the puzzles that Wheatley had set up for you.

824
00:52:24,115 --> 00:52:29,079
And so our thought was the bird, every couple of chambers, was going to come in and attack

825
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,860
the potato and eat part of it.

826
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,323
And she was going to keep getting stupider and stupider as we went along.

827
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:40,827
There was a couple problems with that in that we didn't want her to get stupider, that was funnier when we set it than when we actually tried to write it.

828
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:48,350
And then it also turns out that it's actually a big honking deal to get a bird to fly in and attack your view model.

829
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:51,671
And so people were like, are you sure? This is going to be a lot of work.

830
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,732
But it was good because it actually just drove us to the much simpler solution,

831
00:52:55,032 --> 00:52:59,893
which is they've got this hardwired thing that if they try and tell you the answer to the puzzle,

832
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:01,554
they have this physical, like, uh...

833
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,420
pain reaction to it, which was just a way easier solution. And

834
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,900
the bird was in there plenty still.

835
00:53:07,781 --> 00:53:08,001
Thanks.

836
00:53:09,681 --> 00:53:13,363
Did all those hours spent watching testers test ever make

837
00:53:13,383 --> 00:53:14,643
you feel like GLaDOS?

838
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:17,344
Yeah, it is, it is a...

839
00:53:17,564 --> 00:53:21,366
But also it gets you nauseous. It's tough. Portal's a tough

840
00:53:21,446 --> 00:53:21,906
one to watch.

841
00:53:21,926 --> 00:53:25,247
Yeah, motion sickness. But it is, it is kind of just a, a

842
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:30,509
giant, uh, uh, uh, analogy for, for...

843
00:53:31,218 --> 00:53:34,726
actual how we make the games is what GLaDOS does.

844
00:53:36,574 --> 00:53:40,836
So your experience in game design sort of informed the concept of the story?

845
00:53:41,036 --> 00:53:42,496
Like the, this huge testing lab?

846
00:53:42,516 --> 00:53:43,397
A little bit, some of it.

847
00:53:43,477 --> 00:53:46,117
I mean, I know that when Wheatley makes his first test chamber,

848
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:48,498
I think it was Phil Coe maybe made that,

849
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:53,260
and he just used like the standard thing that everybody does when they first make a level,

850
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,102
which is to just make this big box with the word test on it, or their name or something.

851
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:03,244
So yeah, in some ways that, you know, Wheatley was this kind of neophyte level designer.

852
00:54:04,504 --> 00:54:04,724
Thank you.

853
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:07,799
How do you guys generate your scripts?

854
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,740
Do you each take a mission?

855
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:11,742
Or do you bounce them back and forth?

856
00:54:11,762 --> 00:54:14,204
Do you lock yourself in a room and say, no one's getting out

857
00:54:14,224 --> 00:54:16,486
of here until we have the level three?

858
00:54:16,807 --> 00:54:19,109
It depends where we are in the process, what we're working on.

859
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:21,331
How far away we are from a recording session.

860
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:24,013
If it's like three weeks, we're not doing anything.

861
00:54:24,213 --> 00:54:27,096
If it's three days, yeah, we're sweating it.

862
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,558
And we tend to sit in a room, more so now.

863
00:54:29,618 --> 00:54:33,342
We've been getting more in this sort of writer's room kind

864
00:54:33,382 --> 00:54:34,002
of thing where.

865
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:44,069
We'll bring our ideas, we'll try and hash them out all together and then maybe separate and just sort of smooth everything out.

866
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:49,775
Especially when you're doing the jokes. If the jokes aren't making anyone in the room laugh, they're not going to work.

867
00:54:50,756 --> 00:54:55,682
Ultimately, you get kind of punchy and then they seem like they're working and then they don't.

868
00:54:57,588 --> 00:55:03,611
But that's me. A lot of it is a group write, where we sit down and we map out what needs to get written,

869
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:08,193
you know, where a dialogue needs to be, and then we just try and as a group go through it.

870
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:19,437
So, as I was playing Portal 2, I felt it was a really clear example of this kind of hero's journey kind of story,

871
00:55:19,518 --> 00:55:25,960
with three acts, and especially the player descending in this sort of underworld in the second act.

872
00:55:26,694 --> 00:55:28,815
So can you say something about how intentional this was?

873
00:55:29,755 --> 00:55:32,775
Well, we certainly wanted our hero to go on a journey.

874
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:35,816
And we definitely, there's a structure of storytelling, right?

875
00:55:35,856 --> 00:55:38,496
I mean, three acts is pretty standard.

876
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:41,337
We didn't really reinvent anything there and it seemed to fit pretty well.

877
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:43,998
Yeah, part of the thing with going into the underground was

878
00:55:44,118 --> 00:55:48,378
Portal 1 starts with you waking up and feeling very alone.

879
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,159
And Portal 2 didn't start that way because...

880
00:55:51,697 --> 00:55:56,001
for various reasons, but we still wanted to have an area where you did feel like you were

881
00:55:56,041 --> 00:56:01,066
now alone in a place you didn't understand, which is why when you get dropped down that

882
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:05,831
pit, we give you a while to just sort of take it in, you know, after having basically been

883
00:56:05,871 --> 00:56:08,133
accompanied by someone the entire time.

884
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:14,619
But yeah, I don't know that there was any conscious hero's journey sort of thing going

885
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:14,760
on.

886
00:56:16,452 --> 00:56:21,035
Thanks. What do the lights mean? Can we keep... We have two more questions, right? We can do

887
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:26,918
those. Yeah. Uh, yeah, Valve has a pretty awesome... I'm a shirt, by the way. Oh, thank you. I

888
00:56:27,038 --> 00:56:31,080
appreciate that. It's just a Street Fighter shirt, don't worry. Um, Valve has got a pretty, uh,

889
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:35,563
awesome reputation for releasing free content, and so I'm just wondering, have you ever

890
00:56:35,603 --> 00:56:40,505
considered releasing Michael's version of Wheatly? Like his entire... Assuming he did... He

891
00:56:40,545 --> 00:56:44,127
didn't do the... He didn't do the whole game. Oh, no, we didn't get, like, none of the stuff

892
00:56:44,207 --> 00:56:46,048
after Wheatly takes over, except for maybe...

893
00:56:46,754 --> 00:56:50,097
a couple times when we didn't have merchant stuff we'd bring Richard back in.

894
00:56:50,637 --> 00:56:53,520
But yeah, it would be a huge, huge undertaking.

895
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,841
Got it. I assumed you already had the audio track.

896
00:56:55,901 --> 00:57:03,787
No. And the other problem is it would need to match the timing of the merchant lines or else it would be like 10 times more.

897
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:04,348
Never.

898
00:57:04,408 --> 00:57:06,089
Okay. All right. Yeah. So that's not...

899
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:06,930
Yeah.

900
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:08,131
Let's not go there.

901
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:08,671
All right.

902
00:57:08,931 --> 00:57:09,192
Thank you.

903
00:57:09,352 --> 00:57:09,732
Well, thank you.

904
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:15,567
Um, so the two big, like, memes that came out of the first

905
00:57:15,707 --> 00:57:19,511
portal were the cake and the companion cube, uh, and I want

906
00:57:19,531 --> 00:57:22,174
to commend you guys for not going back to that well in the

907
00:57:22,214 --> 00:57:25,378
second game, but was it ever, like, really tempting to just go

908
00:57:25,438 --> 00:57:27,500
for that layup and bring those back or were there people

909
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,463
involved who were like, we gotta have the companion cube, people

910
00:57:30,523 --> 00:57:31,164
loved it, like...

911
00:57:31,184 --> 00:57:32,926
Well, the companion cube is back, so...

912
00:57:33,066 --> 00:57:33,346
Yeah.

913
00:57:33,467 --> 00:57:34,887
I don't know if you're setting me up to a...

914
00:57:34,907 --> 00:57:36,108
Sorry, I just...

915
00:57:36,228 --> 00:57:37,408
No, the fan cube is there.

916
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:40,089
We don't focus on it a lot.

917
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,911
We felt like that we could bring back in a sort of,

918
00:57:42,931 --> 00:57:45,612
I don't know, for lack of a better word, a wasteful, funny way.

919
00:57:46,312 --> 00:57:48,013
The cake I think we make one reference to,

920
00:57:48,053 --> 00:57:51,294
but no, nobody was really pushing us to do it.

921
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:51,855
We just knew...

922
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:55,016
I mean, we were pretty confident that we could just come up with

923
00:57:55,716 --> 00:57:57,457
a story that didn't rely on that.

924
00:57:58,998 --> 00:58:00,538
You know, we figured...

925
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:04,831
people had lived with the cake jokes enough that they probably...

926
00:58:04,851 --> 00:58:06,251
Yeah, I mean, that is the thing though, right?

927
00:58:06,431 --> 00:58:10,093
Like we were talking about internally, we lived with GLaDOS this whole time.

928
00:58:10,593 --> 00:58:13,434
And so for us, not that we're sick of her, but we had lived with her a lot,

929
00:58:13,474 --> 00:58:14,755
and we were thinking maybe we should try something new.

930
00:58:15,155 --> 00:58:17,596
But everybody lived with the cake is a lie jokes, right?

931
00:58:17,656 --> 00:58:19,677
I think we all had our share of those.

932
00:58:19,737 --> 00:58:20,977
Yeah, I mean, it was great.

933
00:58:21,337 --> 00:58:23,478
Yeah, but so no, nobody pressured us.

934
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:25,939
And honestly, I've never had anybody come up and say,

935
00:58:26,259 --> 00:58:28,860
you know, I wish there was more cake in the game.

936
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:37,960
Yeah. Do you have anything left for a third one? Maybe. No.

937
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:43,365
No. So I mean, honestly. It's like when we also do like why it

938
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:46,627
takes us so long for DLC. We don't worry or think about that.

939
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:48,509
Like holding something back because you think you're going to

940
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:51,951
run out of ideas. Don't ever do that. Just go. Just put it all

941
00:58:52,071 --> 00:58:54,593
in. You know what? You're going to have those horrendous days of

942
00:58:54,654 --> 00:58:57,196
like the ending where you're like just staring at each other

943
00:58:57,236 --> 00:58:58,837
thinking there's no way you're going to come up with anything.

944
00:58:58,877 --> 00:58:59,157
And you do.

945
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,963
Yeah, there's some way to solve it. So don't hold back. Yeah.

946
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:06,407
And also, one of our goals was to not have like a cliffhanger

947
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:09,090
ending. We wanted, you know, we felt like Portal had this nice

948
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:12,513
satisfying ending and we wanted Portal 2 to feel the same way.

949
00:59:12,593 --> 00:59:15,897
Like at the end, there, maybe there were some unresolved

950
00:59:15,937 --> 00:59:19,120
questions, but it felt like everybody had their end. Yep.

951
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,124
So I think that's it. Is that it? So thanks guys. Yeah, thank

952
00:59:23,144 --> 00:59:23,585
you so much.
