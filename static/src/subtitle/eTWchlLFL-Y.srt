1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,025
So hi, I'm Laura Lynn.

2
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:11,308
This is You're Not Broken, as you can probably

3
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:12,048
guess from the screen.

4
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:14,850
So I have a confession to make.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,291
This talk was not easy for me.

6
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:19,253
And in fact, the minute I submitted it,

7
00:00:19,293 --> 00:00:21,275
I had this feeling of, oh, god, what have I done?

8
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:23,877
And I've spoken at GDC quite a bit,

9
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:26,859
but it's always about facts and metrics and design principles.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,722
In fact, if you've gone to my GDC talks, any of them,

11
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:33,444
you'll know that I don't even do a bio at the front,

12
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:34,705
because I hate talking about myself.

13
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,874
So as I started getting ready and rehearsing this talk,

14
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:39,635
and I was going through the slides,

15
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:41,096
I got this sudden panic feeling that I'd

16
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:42,877
be like three slides in, and everyone would be like,

17
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:45,038
oh my god, this lady's going to talk about herself for an hour.

18
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:49,820
And I started panicking, because I don't like

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,400
talking about myself.

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,281
So I actually made a metric for you

21
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:54,802
about how much I'm going to talk about myself, just so you know.

22
00:00:55,562 --> 00:00:57,723
It's really just to illustrate what I'm going to talk about,

23
00:00:58,203 --> 00:00:59,524
so you know that I'm coming from somewhere

24
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:01,205
where I understand what everybody is going through.

25
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:03,946
And so then I kept rehearsing, and I was like, oh god.

26
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:05,494
I'm going to be like five minutes in it,

27
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:06,054
everyone's going to say,

28
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:07,836
this is the most depressing shit I've ever heard.

29
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:09,437
And everyone's going to run away.

30
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,519
So, then I worried about that.

31
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:15,462
And I said to a friend of mine that preparing this GDC talk

32
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,865
about how our creativity is affected by trauma and stress

33
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:20,646
is giving me trauma and stress.

34
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,709
So, here's where I ended up.

35
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,810
I will pinky swear promise

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,231
that I don't talk about myself anymore

37
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:29,473
than I have to, to make my points.

38
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,444
that really it's not going to be depressing.

39
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:33,565
In fact, it's quite the opposite.

40
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:34,926
So stick with me through this beginning here.

41
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:37,487
So a little bit about my road.

42
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:41,050
I've been a game developer since 1994,

43
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,832
largely in creative leadership roles,

44
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:45,333
in fact, all in creative leadership roles.

45
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:48,716
So lead designer, creative director, game director,

46
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:49,916
VP of design, that sort of stuff.

47
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:53,619
And a part of doing that in commercial game development

48
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:57,122
means that you are effectively on the assembly

49
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:57,982
line of creation.

50
00:01:58,843 --> 00:02:00,224
And I don't mean that in a demeaning way.

51
00:02:00,697 --> 00:02:05,940
It's not repetitive. Even making a sequel means making all sorts of new innovative design decisions,

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,083
so it's not an assembly line from that perspective. But it is an assembly line from the perspective of

53
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:17,405
you have to come into work every day and be reliably, predictably, effectively creative.

54
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:23,108
That is your job. It's a predictable pattern, and in fact it becomes the pattern of your life,

55
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:25,790
if your life is around making games like mine is.

56
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:29,618
And so it's about shipping game after game, year after year.

57
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:30,678
That's the pattern of your life.

58
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:31,319
That's your road.

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,063
But then in 2012, my road changed.

60
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:39,205
I was diagnosed with stage 4 head and neck cancer.

61
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,047
So side note, that little bit at the bottom

62
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:45,030
there that says P16 positive, that

63
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,871
means it's caused by the HPV virus.

64
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:49,393
If you have kids, you have family of kids,

65
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:50,994
you ever plan to have kids, you know any kids.

66
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:53,476
Get those kids vaccinated against HPV.

67
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:55,558
Do not hesitate to do that.

68
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:56,218
So.

69
00:02:57,623 --> 00:03:00,845
Suddenly, I'm on a road that feels a little bit different.

70
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:04,146
It feels less certain.

71
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:05,707
It feels darker.

72
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:10,110
And my destination all of a sudden feels unclear.

73
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,931
The rhythm of my life was totally disrupted.

74
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,933
But as anyone who's dealt with cancer before knows,

75
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,314
you immediately go into a different kind of pattern.

76
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,881
That was my radiation song.

77
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:33,443
I listened to it every day when I drove to radiation

78
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:34,163
for seven weeks.

79
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:37,226
I had chemo every week along with that.

80
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,127
That's the standard treatment for head and neck cancer.

81
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:41,368
So seven weeks doesn't sound like a long time.

82
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:44,631
But it takes like eight months to a year

83
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:46,632
to recover from head and neck cancer treatment

84
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:48,073
because it's one of the worst cancer treatments.

85
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:50,915
The combination of the chemo making you ill

86
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:52,736
and the radiation to your esophagus

87
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:53,837
means you literally can't eat.

88
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:54,698
You have a stomach tube.

89
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:55,618
You're on fentanyl patches.

90
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:56,219
It's not great.

91
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,001
So it takes a while to get over it.

92
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:01,848
I worked from home during that time,

93
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,389
and it seemed like it took forever.

94
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,191
But I noticed something about my ability to work.

95
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,033
And it wasn't just because sometimes I was sick.

96
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:13,016
When I was working, and it was something

97
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:16,638
about planning or meetings or leadership stuff,

98
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:19,160
I was largely OK.

99
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,160
I was a little slower than normal

100
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,161
because I wasn't feeling well.

101
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:24,783
I had to focus a little bit more, but it was mostly fine.

102
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,105
But when it came to creative decisions,

103
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,262
or creating a new story, or designing a new system.

104
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:33,822
Nope.

105
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:36,824
That assembly line was not just broken.

106
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:37,464
It was gone.

107
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:38,424
It was an empty factory.

108
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:39,245
That was it.

109
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:41,666
And so there was this about six-month period

110
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:45,588
where I couldn't do what had really defined me

111
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:46,588
for most of my life.

112
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:51,390
And I started to wonder, was I able to do this before?

113
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,431
How was I able to do this?

114
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:56,493
One of the things that was lucky in that circumstance was,

115
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,951
I could hang it on something called chemo brain, which

116
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:00,172
I'm going to talk about more in a minute.

117
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:05,115
But it was a principle that was kind of new at the time

118
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:08,078
I went through the first cancer for how chemo actually

119
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:10,499
affected the brains of people going through it.

120
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,361
So when you go through cancer, you

121
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:16,223
go into that post-cancer cycle, regular scans every three

122
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:18,085
months, every six months, then every year.

123
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:23,028
If I got to the three-year mark without the cancer returning,

124
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:25,950
there was a 99% chance it would never come back.

125
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:30,429
So I'm crawling out of the hole, getting back to the pattern of my life.

126
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:36,150
I'm back on the road again. And I hit that three-year mark. But they're learning more and

127
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:43,212
more about HPV-related cancer all the time. So 2015, back again. This time it's in my lungs,

128
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:49,953
stage 3b, very close to stage 4. So now this road is different again,

129
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,313
especially since in my situation,

130
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,681
I lost both grandfathers to lung cancer about two weeks apart.

131
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,463
I had lost my uncle to lung cancer in 2012

132
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:00,743
when I was dealing with cancer.

133
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:03,145
And my mom had died of lung cancer a year before.

134
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:06,266
So this was not awesome, to say the least.

135
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:09,248
And you don't have much time to think about it,

136
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:11,089
because here we go again.

137
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,795
So I was a rare case of going through primary chemo

138
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:22,315
treatment twice.

139
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:23,115
They don't usually do that.

140
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,573
They did it in my case because they wanted to treat it

141
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:28,493
as a new primary and because I was so young for a cancer

142
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:28,793
patient.

143
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:32,014
So here I am, going through chemo again,

144
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:33,354
working from home again.

145
00:06:33,374 --> 00:06:34,675
This feels familiar.

146
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:36,275
I know what this is like.

147
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:39,016
Well, actually, I kind of didn't because it took me longer

148
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:41,336
to recover this time, even though lung cancer treatment is

149
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:44,417
way easier than head and neck cancer treatment.

150
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:48,098
And I was like, is it because I'm like three years older?

151
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,358
Am I weaker because I went through this before?

152
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,013
I just could not be creative.

153
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:53,774
I couldn't do my job.

154
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:55,575
I didn't feel like myself at all.

155
00:06:56,275 --> 00:07:00,778
And in fact, there's one moment that I'll never forget where,

156
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,520
sorry if I get emotional, I sat on the couch

157
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,981
and I said to my husband, I am a talentless hack.

158
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:10,143
And I meant it in that moment.

159
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:11,804
And I thought I had always been a hack

160
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:14,826
and I would always be a hack and I would never create ever again.

161
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:16,387
And I meant it.

162
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:19,809
So now I'm back in the cycle, right?

163
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,451
You're doing the scans.

164
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:22,272
I'm cancer-free.

165
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:23,613
I'm back on the road again.

166
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,535
My road's changing every time I get back on it,

167
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:27,795
because I'm changing.

168
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:30,978
But there was this moment of recognition where I thought,

169
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,141
I've been here, and I've come out of this,

170
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:39,904
and I'm coming out of it again, and I'm learning something.

171
00:07:41,205 --> 00:07:43,086
And I want to understand what it is that I'm learning,

172
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:43,807
because I'm a designer.

173
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:45,728
I look for patterns.

174
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:46,689
That's how I look at life.

175
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:48,530
I want to understand this pattern.

176
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:52,256
So six months in, it's back again.

177
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:54,237
It's blooming in both lungs.

178
00:07:55,238 --> 00:07:57,439
And this time, I get a special new word attached to it,

179
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:59,360
which is incurable.

180
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:01,962
So that's a new experience.

181
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,164
And this is a totally new road.

182
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:09,367
And unlike the other roads, I mean, it sure feels dark.

183
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,089
But where it's different is I absolutely do know

184
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:13,890
the destination of this one.

185
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:16,892
Metastatic lung cancer returns after treatment.

186
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:18,593
Not a lot you do.

187
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,146
Don't have a lot of time.

188
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:24,768
So spoiler alert, I'm not going to die on stage.

189
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:25,788
I promise you.

190
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:28,489
Well, I mean, I guess the building

191
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,289
could collapse or something.

192
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:31,410
I'm not going to die of cancer on stage.

193
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:31,910
I promise.

194
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,491
In fact, I feel really good about this month, this year.

195
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:38,452
Pretty much not going to die this year.

196
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:40,473
Feel great about next year, too, pretty much.

197
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:42,813
I'll be talking about that a little bit more at the end.

198
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:44,834
But I didn't want to do this whole thing with you feeling

199
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:47,555
like I have death just behind me with this scythe

200
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:48,295
over the back of my neck.

201
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:49,857
It's not quite like that.

202
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:54,019
So all of this is happening as we in America

203
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:56,640
go through a presidential election, which is super fun.

204
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,341
So I'm not going to get political,

205
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:01,482
but I will say most of my friends

206
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:03,803
were not pleased with the output of the election.

207
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:06,544
And in fact, some of them were devastated.

208
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:09,486
So it's the day after, literally the day after,

209
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:15,248
and I'm on Facebook and Skype and Slack and Twitter.

210
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:17,269
I'm talking about a way forward.

211
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:18,830
I'm talking about the future.

212
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:21,897
And I had a friend say to me, how is it possible

213
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,819
that you are able to be like this?

214
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,180
Because I know the election results wrecked you.

215
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:29,002
How is it that you're able to do this?

216
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:31,383
And I thought about it for a minute.

217
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:34,265
And I said, honestly, well, I guess

218
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:36,346
I've developed some tools for dealing with bad news.

219
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:38,968
And I realized from that moment I had.

220
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:41,610
And it wasn't just for dealing with bad news.

221
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,191
It was navigational tools.

222
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,556
to help me find my way back to the person that I was,

223
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:47,617
which is a creative person.

224
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:50,659
To find my way back to the ability to be creative again.

225
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:54,561
And so that's why I'm here, despite not

226
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:55,582
liking to talk about myself.

227
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:57,563
Because I know I'm not alone.

228
00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:00,545
I've seen other developers try to power

229
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:02,046
through hardship and personal tragedy.

230
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:05,528
Things like divorce, bankruptcy, long terms of unemployment,

231
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:08,389
losing a spouse, losing a child, losing a parent.

232
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,871
I've watched it damage and end careers.

233
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:14,187
And it's not like what we do is not already hard enough.

234
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,671
So when you take the stress that we're already under

235
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:21,033
and you add that stress, and then you

236
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,035
feel like you can't create, like you're completely blocked,

237
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:27,398
and you blame yourself, you're crushing your own self-worth.

238
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:30,100
And we don't need to do that to ourselves.

239
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,521
We need to find a way forward.

240
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,544
So I believe that so strongly that I'm up here talking

241
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:37,266
about how I've learned to get through difficult times.

242
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:38,306
I want to share what I've learned.

243
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:41,427
And because I'm a designer, and that's the way I look

244
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:43,087
at the world, I've got steps.

245
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:45,888
So I'm going to talk about the six steps

246
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:49,809
that I found effective to get through difficult times

247
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:50,890
and regain your creativity.

248
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:59,473
So step number one, recognize and acknowledge

249
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:00,573
what's happening to you.

250
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:03,494
So again, I had the advantage.

251
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:06,115
Chemo brain, which by the second time

252
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,655
I went through radiation and chemo.

253
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:10,253
There were books about it, because it was being recognized

254
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:10,593
so much.

255
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:12,834
Here are the symptoms of chemo brain.

256
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:17,315
Things like being unusually disorganized,

257
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:20,176
difficulty concentrating, finding the right word,

258
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:23,037
learning new skills, multitasking,

259
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:27,498
its short attention span, short-term memory problems,

260
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:30,879
taking longer than usual to complete routine tasks,

261
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,219
trouble with verbal and visual memory.

262
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,360
Do these sound familiar if you've

263
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,420
been through a time of trauma?

264
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,981
And in fact, the second time through.

265
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:39,865
I'm a compulsive researcher, by the way,

266
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:42,807
so I spend ridiculous hours researching cancer

267
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:43,607
every time I go through it.

268
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:46,329
And that's three times now, so a lot of research.

269
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:48,650
So I liked this quote that I started

270
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,171
seeing when I was going through chemo the second time.

271
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,413
For many sources of data, we now know

272
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:56,114
patients experience impairments not just after chemo,

273
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:59,316
but after surgery, radiation, hormonal therapy,

274
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:00,676
and other treatments.

275
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:06,480
And I started thinking, maybe it's not just the treatment.

276
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,840
Maybe the treatment makes it worse because you're sick.

277
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,043
But maybe it's just exacerbating something

278
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:15,345
that would happen anyway after you get diagnosed with cancer.

279
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,587
Because getting diagnosed with cancer sucks, right?

280
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:19,668
It's super traumatic.

281
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:20,669
You have to tell your friends.

282
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:22,010
You don't know what's going to happen.

283
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,251
It's awful, right?

284
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:26,213
So maybe, actually, it's not chemo brain.

285
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:29,516
Maybe it's trauma brain, right?

286
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:30,857
Maybe this is the common experience.

287
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:31,717
And that's when I started thinking

288
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:34,239
about all of my friends who had been

289
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,281
through some of the triggers of emotional distress.

290
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,262
So yeah, there I am under health.

291
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:40,063
That's me.

292
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:43,784
Although, honestly, like everybody who has lived,

293
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:45,565
I've been through other things, right?

294
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:51,728
Divorce, loss of a spouse, loss of a child, loss of a parent,

295
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:57,311
moving, unemployment, all of these things, bankruptcy,

296
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,292
having your house foreclosed.

297
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:01,993
All of these things cause us distress.

298
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,554
And when you're in those times of stress,

299
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:06,955
you feel fundamentally lost and broken.

300
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,396
from a creative perspective, because you can't set aside

301
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:14,297
those strong emotions like fear and sadness and worry

302
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:14,897
and anger.

303
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:17,398
Those are the emotions that make us feel broken.

304
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:21,359
If you feel broken, your creative work is broken.

305
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,460
And so making great games and being creative

306
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,601
means we have to make ourselves whole again.

307
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,103
So I know it kind of sounds dumb when

308
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,123
I say you have to recognize what's going on.

309
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,184
And this is where you feel like.

310
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:38,406
I don't have to recognize that my mom just died because my mom just died.

311
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:39,927
I know that that happened.

312
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:41,208
But that's not what I'm saying.

313
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:45,752
Acknowledging the fact that something happened is not the same as acknowledging that it had

314
00:13:45,812 --> 00:13:49,654
a profound effect on you or understanding what that effect is.

315
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:56,360
And in fact, we pride ourselves on being logical people in game development, but the nature

316
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,182
of this situation that you're in robs you of your objectivity.

317
00:14:00,443 --> 00:14:02,104
So even the second time through.

318
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:04,536
I didn't understand what was happening to me.

319
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:06,518
Sitting on the couch, talentless hack,

320
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:08,940
that was the second round of chemo, not the first.

321
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,801
And even still, I didn't understand

322
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:11,662
what was happening to me.

323
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:16,726
We're all here because we have what it takes

324
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:17,867
to make it in game development.

325
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:20,629
It's a super competitive and demanding field.

326
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,072
We got here by being tougher and stronger and pushing through.

327
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:26,594
So we feel like we should be able to do that

328
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:28,055
for all of our problems in life.

329
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,557
And it's especially bad for us because

330
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:32,869
Our career is often the center of our life.

331
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,950
We've learned that if we focus, we can shut everything else out

332
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,791
if we focus on the problems we're trying to solve creatively.

333
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:41,511
But trauma doesn't work that way.

334
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:43,192
In fact, it's the opposite.

335
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:46,033
Trauma completely robs you of the ability

336
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,573
to focus on anything but the trauma.

337
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:52,094
So if you look at these again, chemo brain,

338
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:56,055
these are actually some signs that you're responding

339
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,336
to a stressful situation.

340
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:00,397
You need to be aware of these signs in yourself.

341
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:02,347
and recognize them when you see them.

342
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,748
Other creative symptoms to be on the watch for,

343
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,389
when your thoughts just don't flow.

344
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:11,230
The blank sheet of paper is the worst anyway.

345
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,670
I hate it.

346
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,330
It's always a struggle.

347
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,331
But when you're in this situation, you just can't.

348
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:18,372
You're just blocked.

349
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:18,932
You're stopped.

350
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:22,353
And nothing seems to flow at all,

351
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,534
except thinking about the terrible thing.

352
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:26,394
That flows.

353
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:29,075
Boy, that's all you can think about, and you can't stop it.

354
00:15:29,115 --> 00:15:30,115
I'm gonna talk about that in a minute.

355
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:31,099
how to stop it.

356
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,080
But that is one of the main symptoms

357
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,381
that no matter what you're doing,

358
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,441
your brain just goes back to it.

359
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:40,663
Another symptom, you're paralyzed.

360
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:41,543
You can't make decisions.

361
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:45,705
Any creative decision feels like the hardest decision you've

362
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:46,565
ever had to make in your life.

363
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,327
And as soon as you can bring yourself to make one,

364
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,427
it's the worst mistake you ever made.

365
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:53,928
And you immediately want to take it back.

366
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:56,369
You have no confidence in any decisions that you make.

367
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,950
And finally, imposter syndrome.

368
00:16:00,615 --> 00:16:02,037
the worst imposter syndrome ever.

369
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:04,879
Where you're not just convinced that right now you suck.

370
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,820
You always suck, you will ever suck,

371
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,721
you sucked when you were born,

372
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:09,342
you're just the worst person on earth.

373
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,824
And absolutely, you're gonna feel that way in that moment.

374
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:15,126
So when these things are happening, you need to recognize it.

375
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,048
You need to recognize the words coming out of your mouth,

376
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:18,949
the thoughts in your head.

377
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,211
Things like I can't get started or I can't focus.

378
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:25,454
Being in the middle of working on something,

379
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:26,735
going, wait, what was I thinking about?

380
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,256
Because your mind has been back

381
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:29,937
on whatever you're going through emotionally.

382
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,469
Things like, I'm just too tired to do this.

383
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,670
Or I'm ashamed to ask this question to admit that I can't

384
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,570
finish this by myself.

385
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,291
Or it never used to take me this long.

386
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:44,231
These are the signs that you're responding to this thing

387
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:44,992
that you're going through.

388
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,012
And you need to know, it's not you.

389
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:49,933
Really, it is not you.

390
00:16:50,513 --> 00:16:51,873
And here's why it's not you.

391
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:54,354
I'm going to talk for a few minutes about what

392
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:58,175
creates a state in which you can be creative based

393
00:16:58,215 --> 00:16:58,835
on some studies.

394
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,511
So first, if you look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

395
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:03,512
it's super obvious.

396
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:05,793
There's creativity way at the top of the pyramid.

397
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:07,975
The stuff that I'm talking about that's

398
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:09,656
disruptive traumatic events in your life,

399
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:11,438
all the way at the bottom of the pyramid.

400
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,780
I'm down there in physiological at this point.

401
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,782
But most cancer treatment is there in safety,

402
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:18,743
safety of your body and mortality.

403
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:20,865
Employment is in there.

404
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:21,766
Family is in there.

405
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:23,947
Property is in there.

406
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:27,811
So if you have that low layer of the pyramid completely

407
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:28,271
disrupted.

408
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:31,249
How do you expect the top of the pyramid to be normal?

409
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,853
So when you look at studies about what

410
00:17:35,913 --> 00:17:39,295
makes people more able to be creative and more effectively

411
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:42,417
creative, you see things like this, sleep.

412
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:46,460
So everybody knows getting good regular sleep

413
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,821
makes you more productive.

414
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:49,962
But a study at Harvard Medical School

415
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,964
showed that students who were asked

416
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:54,265
to solve a creative problem before they went to sleep

417
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:57,948
performed better, solved the problem better and faster.

418
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,971
than students who did not think about it

419
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:00,892
before they went to sleep.

420
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:04,353
Regular sleep aids your creativity,

421
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:06,074
and it aids your problem solving.

422
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:08,916
And sleep is the first thing to go

423
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:11,017
when you're going through the situation.

424
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,778
As everybody knows, it's absolutely

425
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:13,718
the first thing that goes.

426
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:16,059
Daydreaming.

427
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:20,781
So studies have shown that regular daydreaming,

428
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:23,003
leaving the task at hand mentally for a moment

429
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:24,884
and thinking about something else,

430
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:27,165
actually helps you solve the problem.

431
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:28,563
It keeps you creative.

432
00:18:29,223 --> 00:18:31,484
And the best way I can describe that is,

433
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:33,105
I'm sure everybody in this room

434
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,126
has been stuck on something for days

435
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:38,147
and solved it driving or showering

436
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,528
or planning a vacation, right?

437
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:43,470
That's because releasing the main part of your brain

438
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,471
from dwelling on it is letting another part

439
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,411
of your brain solve it.

440
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:50,293
When you're in situations that are traumatic and difficult,

441
00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:51,854
you don't daydream.

442
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:53,975
Anytime your mind wanders off a task, it's back.

443
00:18:54,795 --> 00:18:56,977
I have to, oh, I'm gonna have to sell my mom's house.

444
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:58,571
You don't have to go through all her stuff.

445
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,532
Oh my god, I forgot to contact this person I need to contact.

446
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:03,073
That's all you can think about.

447
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:07,254
Collaboration is a big part of creativity,

448
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,535
being able to bounce your ideas off of other people.

449
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:12,036
When you're going through these situations,

450
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:12,916
you're often alone.

451
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:14,437
The situation requires it.

452
00:19:14,897 --> 00:19:16,077
You're in court for the divorce.

453
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:17,518
You're traveling for the family's death.

454
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:19,138
You're home for chemo.

455
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:21,479
But also, you just don't feel like talking to people.

456
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,380
So even when you're at work, you hold yourself up at your desk

457
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,161
or your cube or in your office.

458
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,960
You eat your lunch at your desk.

459
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:30,602
You're just not talking to people or collaborating

460
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:31,342
the way that you used to.

461
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,344
Here's an obvious one, sunshine.

462
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:38,206
Not just for vitamin D, though.

463
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:40,047
A 2002 study found that high school students

464
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:43,409
who were asked to design murals that were later judged

465
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:47,931
by independent critics were more highly rated

466
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:51,093
if they created outdoors, in the sunshine,

467
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,774
versus students who created indoors with no sunshine.

468
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,636
And when you're going through something like a divorce,

469
00:19:57,174 --> 00:19:58,875
or cancer treatment, or the death of a loved one,

470
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:00,636
how often do you go out in the sun?

471
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:02,978
Pretty much not at all.

472
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,240
Safety.

473
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:10,284
The concept of feeling safe in your creative environment

474
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:10,804
is important.

475
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:13,006
If you've watched John Cleese's creativity talk,

476
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:13,647
it's a part of that.

477
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:17,870
You feel so profoundly unsafe when

478
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,351
you're going through this, especially since you

479
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:20,752
are so critical of your own ideas,

480
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,374
you don't feel safe talking about those ideas to anybody

481
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:23,515
else.

482
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,447
Again, I know it sounds obvious, but happiness.

483
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:31,928
There's actually a study that linked students

484
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:34,049
who were thinking happier thoughts with the ability

485
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:36,630
to also create new ideas more easily.

486
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,151
The very fact that we're unhappy inhibits our creativity.

487
00:20:41,651 --> 00:20:43,012
And finally, habit.

488
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:45,873
People underestimate the amount

489
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,513
that habit affects our creativity.

490
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:50,314
There's a reason that my opening was talking

491
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,935
about the assembly line of creativity,

492
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:53,515
because it is a habit.

493
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:54,936
We don't think about it that way.

494
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:56,402
We think about it as our jobs.

495
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,403
But every day, when you go up and you

496
00:20:58,443 --> 00:21:00,384
perform the rituals to go to work and you do your job,

497
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:03,185
that is a habit that you have formed around creativity.

498
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:06,486
And you can forget how to be creative.

499
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,068
So here is something just to make the point of how

500
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:11,868
you can forget things.

501
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:14,329
So when you're going through head and neck cancer treatment,

502
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:16,009
which is also why I have to drink so much,

503
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,871
you take so much radiation to your esophagus

504
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:21,572
that you can't swallow.

505
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,713
So you have a stomach tube for nutrition.

506
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:30,513
So your doctor tells you, but you absolutely positively have to swallow at least a sip of

507
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:35,155
water a couple times a day. Because if you don't, your body will forget how to swallow.

508
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:41,957
And I'm not kidding. If you don't do that, you have to go into special physical therapy for them

509
00:21:41,997 --> 00:21:47,059
to teach you how to swallow. And some patients fail and can never swallow again their whole lives

510
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:54,522
because they spent four months not swallowing. So if your body can forget how to swallow,

511
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:59,685
Your brain can certainly forget how to be creative when you break those habits.

512
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:05,048
Having creative habits, having habits that support creativity,

513
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:08,450
make you more productive and they make you more creative.

514
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:13,572
So, when I say acknowledge what you're going through and how it affects you,

515
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,714
I mean acknowledge that it's breaking this cycle.

516
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:21,757
It is breaking all of the things that you took for granted as a part of your life

517
00:22:21,797 --> 00:22:25,238
and didn't even understand were feeding your creativity.

518
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:28,989
So in those moments, it's not you.

519
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,390
You feel broken and it's not your fault.

520
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:34,132
You are the way you are because of what you're going through.

521
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:35,473
You can't shake it off.

522
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:37,615
It's gonna be with you for a while.

523
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:40,057
You have to acknowledge that this is affecting you

524
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:42,719
in deep ways and whatever it is,

525
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,682
you have to just take it and deal with it,

526
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:48,043
which is what I'm gonna be talking about in a minute.

527
00:22:48,863 --> 00:22:50,805
And a small side note, it's never too late

528
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:54,047
to retroactively realize that you are going through this.

529
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,406
Because as creative people, we carry all of our failures

530
00:22:57,446 --> 00:22:58,146
with us all the time.

531
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:00,407
We remember our terrible decisions.

532
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,268
We remember all the mistakes we made,

533
00:23:02,788 --> 00:23:03,808
all the things we were wrong about.

534
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:05,349
That's how we grow as creators, right?

535
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:06,910
So we don't take the same bad shot again.

536
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,911
And if you take a bad shot once, you're like,

537
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,351
I remember, that sucked.

538
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:12,112
I'm gonna do a different one this time, right?

539
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:13,072
That's why we grow.

540
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:17,554
If you failed at a time when you were going through

541
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:18,715
something like this, forgive yourself.

542
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:20,856
Don't carry that as a failure.

543
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,657
Because it's not your fault.

544
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:26,289
You don't need to have that on your list of failures.

545
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:28,450
If there's any failure there, it was a failure

546
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,031
for you to understand what you were going through

547
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:30,851
and how it affected you.

548
00:23:32,572 --> 00:23:33,713
So that was step one.

549
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:36,935
So once you understand what you're going through

550
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:39,016
and you can kind of figure it out,

551
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:42,377
the next step is to find ways to center your thoughts.

552
00:23:43,498 --> 00:23:45,119
And I've said this to people in the past who

553
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:48,521
are going through stuff, and it seems impossible.

554
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:48,961
I get it.

555
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:51,302
I totally get that it seems impossible.

556
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:52,162
So.

557
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,747
It sounds, I know it's possible though,

558
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,090
because when you are told you have incurable cancer

559
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,351
and you're laying in bed at night in the dark,

560
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:04,673
what are you thinking about?

561
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:08,316
You're thinking about, is it growing inside me?

562
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:09,376
Where is it growing?

563
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:10,877
Is it going to be a mysophagus?

564
00:24:10,937 --> 00:24:12,018
Is it going to stop me from breathing?

565
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,279
Is it going to hurt?

566
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,280
When is it going to kill me?

567
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,881
How soon is it going to kill me?

568
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,503
Who haven't I told it that it's going to kill me?

569
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:22,005
So if I can learn to stop that, anybody

570
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:23,166
can learn to stop their thoughts.

571
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:25,406
So I'm going to talk about how I did that.

572
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:27,667
But the one thing I do want to mention

573
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:30,927
is that even if you think you can distract yourself,

574
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:34,908
unless you can learn to control and still your thoughts,

575
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:37,809
your unconscious mind is still working on it.

576
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:39,509
You have not succeeded.

577
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,290
And trying to be creative with your subconscious mind

578
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,331
working on it is like trying to be creative during this.

579
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:51,052
Oops.

580
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:52,712
That's weird, my video didn't play.

581
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,278
It was an auctioneer belting out an auction of a cow

582
00:24:57,878 --> 00:25:00,099
and trying to be creative over the yammering voice

583
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:00,739
of an auctioneer.

584
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:04,120
And you do need to tell your thing.

585
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,700
There we go.

586
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:04,780
And 8, 9.

587
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:04,920
At 9, 40.

588
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,580
Here, 9, but it in 40.

589
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,100
1, but it in 2.

590
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,681
9, but it in 2.

591
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:07,481
2, but it in 3.

592
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:07,761
Now, 4.

593
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:08,721
44, but it in 5.

594
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:09,862
Here, 9, but it in 46.

595
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:11,262
Here, at 5, it has 6.

596
00:25:11,482 --> 00:25:11,962
At 46.

597
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:13,883
So that's what your brain's doing the whole time you're

598
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:14,383
trying to create.

599
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:16,924
And yeah, you need to tell it to shut the fuck up.

600
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:18,945
You need the tools to be able to do that.

601
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:19,805
So here's what I did.

602
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,906
So going through the first cancer.

603
00:25:24,518 --> 00:25:25,579
I could not sleep.

604
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,100
So that's priority one, because if you're tired,

605
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,881
you're just effed.

606
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,502
You've got to be able to sleep.

607
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,004
So what I did that helped was relaxation recordings.

608
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:37,547
The kind I use is by a guy named Andrew Johnson.

609
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,848
They're on the iOS store and Android store and the web.

610
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:42,090
There are dozens of other options.

611
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,732
And like many things I'm going to mention in this talk,

612
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:47,834
they run the whole gamut from super practical,

613
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:52,297
like listen to nature sounds, all the way to super fruity,

614
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,758
like here's your horoscope.

615
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:55,712
Let's talk about a mystical journey

616
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:57,493
you're going to take to your past lives.

617
00:25:57,793 --> 00:25:59,934
So wherever you are on that scale,

618
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:02,816
whatever you think is bullshit or not bullshit,

619
00:26:02,836 --> 00:26:03,696
there's something for you.

620
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:05,938
So if you see a whole bunch that you're like,

621
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:08,739
I want someone to talk to me about God,

622
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:11,921
not talk to me about nature sounds,

623
00:26:12,442 --> 00:26:13,282
there's something for you.

624
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:14,543
And if you think that's bullshit,

625
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:15,383
there's something for you too.

626
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:18,165
So don't be discouraged by what you see when you first start.

627
00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:21,447
So every night, I would go to sleep every night

628
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,768
listening to this.

629
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:28,372
And initially, it was great because having the voice

630
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:31,073
gave me something to focus on instead of my own thoughts.

631
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:33,733
But over time, I trained my brain

632
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:36,554
that when I heard this, I would get sleepy. ♪♪

633
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:56,396
Hi, I'm Andrew Johnson.

634
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:01,659
Take some time now to make sure that you're sitting comfortably.

635
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,600
Put your feet on the floor.

636
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,102
Put your hands on your lap.

637
00:27:09,203 --> 00:27:10,843
Take a nice gentle deep breath in.

638
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:13,505
And out.

639
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:16,766
And just allow your eyes to close.

640
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:19,968
Just allow your eyes to gently close.

641
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,901
Take your mind on a little journey.

642
00:27:27,182 --> 00:27:28,182
Down through your body.

643
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:31,184
Down through your legs.

644
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:33,966
I get sleepy if you're listening to it now still.

645
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:37,249
Because I was trained that that means it's time to sleep.

646
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:38,830
And that's what you want to do.

647
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,770
This is about training.

648
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:42,612
You hear this all the time.

649
00:27:42,632 --> 00:27:43,493
It's true.

650
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:44,854
Meditation helps.

651
00:27:45,514 --> 00:27:46,275
I'm a gadget nerd.

652
00:27:46,635 --> 00:27:48,796
I had a biofeedback device called Wild Divine.

653
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,197
I think they may be out of business now.

654
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:51,558
But if you look up Wild Divine, I

655
00:27:51,578 --> 00:27:53,519
think they have a Kickstarter for some new gadget that's

656
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:53,800
similar.

657
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:56,990
But there are other biofeedback devices for meditation

658
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,450
that are out there.

659
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,471
It helped me not just because I'm a nerd,

660
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:02,994
but because I was able to have something tell me when

661
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,716
I was in the correct physical state, which

662
00:28:05,756 --> 00:28:07,657
meant I could return to that physical state.

663
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:10,419
I actually learned to lower my blood pressure

664
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,881
by thinking about lowering my blood pressure

665
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:14,081
and clearing my thoughts.

666
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:16,103
So it can be a very powerful tool.

667
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:18,044
I signed up for Headspace.

668
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:21,006
It's an online program for meditation.

669
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:22,107
Has a great trial.

670
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:23,348
And you can try to see if you like it.

671
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:26,050
It's about building the habit of meditation

672
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,692
through small sessions at first and longer sessions.

673
00:28:29,232 --> 00:28:31,233
I found that guided meditation was way better,

674
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:33,555
because when you're trying to deal with something difficult,

675
00:28:33,675 --> 00:28:36,337
if you give more than about two minutes of silence,

676
00:28:36,897 --> 00:28:38,278
your brain goes back to it again.

677
00:28:38,878 --> 00:28:41,960
You need someone to train you to control that.

678
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,582
I also really like Buddhify, because it

679
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,924
has little bitty meditations for different times of the day

680
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:49,325
that are about what you're doing at the time,

681
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:51,666
like walking to work or taking a break from work.

682
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:53,913
taking a break in the evening before you sleep.

683
00:28:55,174 --> 00:28:57,475
As soon as they came out with the Breathe app for the watch,

684
00:28:57,515 --> 00:28:59,597
I got it and programmed it for every hour.

685
00:28:59,977 --> 00:29:02,419
So every hour, my watch would buzz and remind me

686
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:04,120
to close my eyes and breathe for a minute.

687
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,682
And unless I was in a meeting, I absolutely did that.

688
00:29:07,683 --> 00:29:08,883
So there's lots of these options.

689
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:10,244
You need to find the ones that work for you.

690
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:12,966
But it's important to do it, to find something

691
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:15,468
that gets you to sleep and to find things that help you,

692
00:29:15,548 --> 00:29:16,849
train you to clear your thoughts.

693
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,352
So something else that helped me, because I'm a giant nerd.

694
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:22,379
is a productivity method I'd studied

695
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,420
called getting things done.

696
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:27,562
So a part of the theory of getting things done

697
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:32,405
is that you have all this time in your brain,

698
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:33,486
this giant list of things that you

699
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:34,486
don't want to forget that you need to do.

700
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,968
And some of them you do at work, and some of things

701
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:38,068
you have to do at home, and some of things

702
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:39,909
you have to do the weekend, and some of things

703
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:41,190
you have to do next time at your mom's house.

704
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:43,531
And your brain is always worrying about all of that

705
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:44,572
because it doesn't want to forget it.

706
00:29:45,453 --> 00:29:48,074
So you make lists based on when something is relevant.

707
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:50,519
So you have the list of things I'm going to do at mom's house

708
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,901
and the list of things I'm going to do at home when I get home tonight,

709
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:54,802
and the list of things I'm going to do over the weekend.

710
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:58,165
And the important part of this is you're training your brain.

711
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:01,748
Because over time, your brain actually learns,

712
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:06,332
hey, if I put that list or that thing on the list of stuff I want to do at mom's house,

713
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,534
and then I do it when I get to mom's house,

714
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:12,117
my brain learns to stop worrying about it as soon as it gets on the list.

715
00:30:13,318 --> 00:30:14,959
So I made lists.

716
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:18,834
And as dumb as it sounds, I was doing a whole bunch of research

717
00:30:18,894 --> 00:30:21,275
at the time, and researching cancer is thinking about cancer

718
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:21,755
all the time.

719
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:24,576
So I would book my research times

720
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:27,057
and not let myself research except for that time.

721
00:30:27,097 --> 00:30:28,978
And over time, I stopped thinking about it,

722
00:30:30,018 --> 00:30:32,079
or I thought about it less, because I

723
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:34,539
knew there was a time later that I would be thinking about it.

724
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,780
And I actually developed my own visualization technique

725
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:38,521
based on this.

726
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:44,883
So picture that you are floating on a screen on your back.

727
00:30:46,442 --> 00:30:51,404
moving along with the current. Take whatever it is that you can't stop thinking about,

728
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:56,446
that you're worried about, that you can't do anything about, and mentally bundle it into a

729
00:30:56,486 --> 00:31:01,709
bundle. And visualize yourself taking that bundle and setting it down in the stream beside you.

730
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:08,471
You can see it moving with you on the stream because it's in the current, just like you're

731
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:15,014
in the current. And that means it's going to travel with you. If you get stuck in the reeds,

732
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:16,600
it's going to be stuck in the reeds.

733
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,241
You don't have to carry it because it's going to be there.

734
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:24,723
You can let it go and visualize it floating away from you.

735
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:25,803
Let it go.

736
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:28,544
And I found that helped me a lot too.

737
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:32,186
So whatever works for you, whatever it is,

738
00:31:32,886 --> 00:31:34,707
you need to find those tools that

739
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:36,948
let you still your thoughts so you can

740
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:38,108
be in control of them again.

741
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:41,609
So here's the next step.

742
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,191
Then you need to start going beyond yourself.

743
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:47,354
So I am a hermit.

744
00:31:48,755 --> 00:31:49,475
I'm not even kidding.

745
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:50,776
I don't go to speaker parties.

746
00:31:50,956 --> 00:31:52,437
If there's a party I'm obligated to go to,

747
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,438
I'm the one in the corner for the least amount of time

748
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:56,459
immediately leaving as soon as I possibly can.

749
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,382
So it sounded fine that I would be working from home

750
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:04,043
during chemo because I would be immunocompromised.

751
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:06,424
But it's so isolating.

752
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:09,446
And we forget how much connection with other people

753
00:32:09,906 --> 00:32:11,407
is what fuels our creativity.

754
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:14,368
Those of us who have worked out of offices

755
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:15,549
and then worked from home know.

756
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:18,492
the effect that it has on your creativity.

757
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:20,913
So you need to find ways to incorporate other people.

758
00:32:22,194 --> 00:32:25,596
You can start with the people around you, friends and family.

759
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:28,478
And more important, you can enlist them

760
00:32:28,518 --> 00:32:30,879
in helping you with the first three things on the list.

761
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,161
Like my boyfriend would see me, would

762
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:37,343
glance at my computer screen and see it was cancer research

763
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:38,544
studies and tell me to stop.

764
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:42,967
Because he knew that I wanted to think about cancer less.

765
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:46,236
I have another friend who, when I would be talking on Slack

766
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:49,458
with her about, I just can't solve this problem,

767
00:32:49,498 --> 00:32:51,659
I'm super stuck, I feel so stupid,

768
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:53,760
she would say, how much have you eaten today?

769
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:55,922
Because when I was going through chemo,

770
00:32:55,982 --> 00:32:57,283
it would get to be four or five at night,

771
00:32:57,303 --> 00:32:59,804
and I would have had nothing, literally nothing to eat.

772
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:02,726
And she knew that affected me, and she would tell me to eat.

773
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:05,307
So enlist your friends with the signs.

774
00:33:05,768 --> 00:33:07,229
Let them help you because they want to.

775
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:11,551
Therapy is a huge help.

776
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:12,772
And if you're a therapy skeptic.

777
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:16,347
For whatever reason, you need to think about it differently

778
00:33:16,387 --> 00:33:17,788
when you're going through a traumatic period.

779
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,769
You see a podiatrist when there's a thing on your foot.

780
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,850
There's a thing on your heart.

781
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,091
And you need to see a specialist about it.

782
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:28,032
And you don't need to be shy about it or feel weird about it.

783
00:33:28,613 --> 00:33:32,314
So I didn't get therapy for my first two cancer sessions.

784
00:33:32,374 --> 00:33:33,735
But incurable, yeah.

785
00:33:34,575 --> 00:33:36,896
I went to a specialist who deals with people who have cancer.

786
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:40,498
And when people talk about therapy,

787
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:44,294
They usually talk about how good it is to unburden.

788
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:48,498
But honestly, it's a two-way street, at least for me.

789
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:50,320
And maybe that's just a part of who I am.

790
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,321
For me, it was super helpful having

791
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:55,484
someone who doesn't know me tell me it's not my fault.

792
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:57,706
It was helpful to hear someone who's

793
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:00,969
dealt with a bunch of people in this exact situation tell me,

794
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:02,290
everybody goes through this.

795
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,371
Of course you're going through this.

796
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:04,471
This is normal.

797
00:34:05,492 --> 00:34:09,696
Because hearing that from a husband or friend,

798
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,517
of course they say that.

799
00:34:10,937 --> 00:34:11,938
You feel like they have to say that.

800
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:12,670
Right?

801
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:15,032
Hearing it from somebody who's a professional is different.

802
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:18,273
You can find online resources.

803
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:19,634
I mean, obviously, vet them and make

804
00:34:19,654 --> 00:34:20,514
sure you're comfortable with them.

805
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:22,656
But there are lots of online resources

806
00:34:22,736 --> 00:34:23,776
for whatever you're going through.

807
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:26,378
So for me, it was Cancer Survivors Network Forum

808
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:27,978
for my first cancer, because they

809
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,879
had a really good head and neck cancer forum.

810
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,720
But their lung cancer forum isn't great.

811
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:34,081
So I found a different one, which was called Inspire,

812
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:36,263
and went there through lung cancer and then

813
00:34:36,463 --> 00:34:37,743
immunotherapy, which I'm in right now.

814
00:34:38,664 --> 00:34:40,185
Twitter, Facebook, whatever it is.

815
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,085
Find a community of people that you can trust and talk to who

816
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:45,086
are going through the same thing.

817
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:48,366
And then you'll find the other way

818
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:51,467
that I found really helped me, which is helping other people.

819
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:55,868
So the act of talking about what you're going through

820
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:57,948
with people going through something similar

821
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:00,589
doesn't just help you, it helps them.

822
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,789
And then it circles back around and helps you again.

823
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:06,130
Because saying to somebody else, oh, I

824
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,910
know exactly how that feels, and it's not your fault.

825
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,855
I went through that same thing, and I couldn't work for a week

826
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,215
when I was going through the stage of chemo.

827
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:14,296
You're telling yourself that too.

828
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,316
You're telling yourself that it's OK.

829
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,737
And actually helping people, even going

830
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:20,517
through something different.

831
00:35:21,317 --> 00:35:22,757
Telling that person at the office

832
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:25,158
who didn't finish something because he was up

833
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:26,998
all night with his kid because they're going through a divorce,

834
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:28,959
telling him it's OK.

835
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:29,599
God, that sucks.

836
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,239
I'm so sorry.

837
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:31,339
Don't worry about it.

838
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,279
Of course you couldn't finish it.

839
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:35,200
It's reinforcing to you that what you're going through

840
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,320
is important, and maybe it's OK that you couldn't finish

841
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:37,860
something too.

842
00:35:38,644 --> 00:35:44,747
Right? Helping other people helps you. Now the big question is, how much do you want to tell

843
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:48,130
other people that you know or publicly about whatever you're going through? And that's an

844
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,933
individual decision. So I'm speaking here only from my own perspective. Everybody has to make

845
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:57,976
this decision for yourselves. I talked about every cancer publicly. I had a blog. I talked about it

846
00:35:57,996 --> 00:36:04,900
on Twitter. I really thought before I talked about incurable cancer on Twitter, because I was like,

847
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:06,682
who is ever going to hire me again?

848
00:36:07,435 --> 00:36:08,876
if I say I have incurable cancer.

849
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,237
Which, if you think about it,

850
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:12,818
sounds like a problem that's gonna solve itself, doesn't it?

851
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:16,500
But, turns out, I did have to interview

852
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,721
after talking to people about incurable cancer.

853
00:36:18,941 --> 00:36:19,962
It's not the end of the world.

854
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:23,344
And in fact, the more you talk about

855
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,244
what you're going through,

856
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,585
the more you shine a light on it.

857
00:36:27,606 --> 00:36:29,187
The more it stops being a dark secret,

858
00:36:29,207 --> 00:36:30,528
the more it stops being the thing

859
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:31,488
that you're trying to hide,

860
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:33,909
the more it stops being a negative,

861
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,850
and the more it starts to become

862
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,811
just a part of who you are.

863
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:44,603
So step number four, you need to find low pressure creative

864
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,024
outlets.

865
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:50,148
So if you remember this, you've forgotten.

866
00:36:50,728 --> 00:36:51,529
You've broken your patterns.

867
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:55,472
But you don't want to launch back

868
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:56,853
into something super complicated again,

869
00:36:57,874 --> 00:36:59,315
because you're just going to be doubting yourself.

870
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:01,076
It's not going to be a pleasant experience.

871
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:02,778
If you're trying to continue to work

872
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:03,979
while you're going through whatever it is,

873
00:37:04,499 --> 00:37:05,720
you know how hard it is every day.

874
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,821
You don't need to bring that home, too.

875
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:10,915
But what I am saying is, if you can find small creative

876
00:37:10,955 --> 00:37:13,916
activities that are low pressure and not associated

877
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:16,657
with your day job, you can start to get that part of your brain

878
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:19,037
firing away again in a nonjudgmental way.

879
00:37:19,758 --> 00:37:20,958
So here are a couple of things that I did.

880
00:37:22,078 --> 00:37:22,438
Rock band.

881
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:24,259
So rock band is awesome.

882
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,460
But rock band is also magic, because rock band

883
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,620
makes you feel like you're creative

884
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,121
and you're really not being creative at all.

885
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:31,001
Right?

886
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:32,818
but you feel like you are.

887
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:34,559
That's the magic and the design of rock band.

888
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:36,360
Karaoke has a little bit,

889
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,321
that there's something just really special about rock band.

890
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:40,422
So you and yourself with rock band

891
00:37:40,462 --> 00:37:42,984
and a guitar controller or a microphone in a room,

892
00:37:44,465 --> 00:37:46,086
even though, and you are being judged

893
00:37:46,106 --> 00:37:46,766
because you're being scored,

894
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:47,787
but we're all game developers.

895
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:49,227
So we look at that and we're like,

896
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:50,968
oh, okay, I know I just need to push these buttons better.

897
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,569
And you still feel creative.

898
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,751
So it's a great, sounds strange,

899
00:37:55,811 --> 00:37:56,952
but it's a great first step

900
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,933
toward feeling that you can be free

901
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:00,574
and like you can express yourself again.

902
00:38:01,892 --> 00:38:02,393
Coloring books.

903
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:04,154
Coloring books are actually great.

904
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:05,955
I had a friend mail me a whole bundle of them,

905
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:06,795
and it was fantastic.

906
00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:12,439
And I remember there was a period of time

907
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:15,601
where I was fucking paralyzed over picking a color,

908
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:17,723
literally paralyzed.

909
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:20,825
Chief creative officer of a major third-party developer,

910
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:23,587
and I was paralyzed picking a color for a coloring book.

911
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:27,149
Getting in this creative situation again is hard.

912
00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:28,950
You need to find little ways, right?

913
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,051
I picked a color, and it was OK.

914
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:32,514
And that was a part of the journey back

915
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:34,074
to being creative again.

916
00:38:35,695 --> 00:38:36,915
I also really like Zentangles.

917
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:39,676
So Zentangles, you can buy a kit on Amazon

918
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:40,436
or look up how to do them.

919
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:43,237
But basically, you have a card of a fixed size.

920
00:38:43,897 --> 00:38:45,418
You divide the card into segments

921
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:47,458
and then fill the segments with patterns.

922
00:38:48,018 --> 00:38:49,299
And you don't invent the pattern.

923
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:50,239
You copy them.

924
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:52,980
And you can even roll the dice for what pattern goes where.

925
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,801
So it can be zero creative decisions when you start it.

926
00:38:56,361 --> 00:38:57,081
But you do it in ink.

927
00:38:57,861 --> 00:38:58,421
No do-overs.

928
00:38:58,441 --> 00:38:58,902
You're committing.

929
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:02,900
And over time as you do it, both the ritual of drawing

930
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,580
the pattern is therapeutic.

931
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:06,501
But over time, you'll find yourself

932
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,562
starting to make creative choices like,

933
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:10,942
huh, I think that pattern should be a little bit bigger,

934
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:12,303
or I like that one better.

935
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:14,283
So it's another good thing on the road.

936
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:17,644
But whatever you find, you need to find little things not

937
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:20,045
connected with your work where you

938
00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:21,886
can have a judgment-free environment

939
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:23,746
to start being creative again.

940
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:28,568
So then, once you've done all of those things,

941
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,809
You're ready for step five, which you

942
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:33,129
are going to plan your escape.

943
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:38,593
Say we get into the cage and through the security doors

944
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:41,294
there, and down the elevator we can't move,

945
00:39:42,015 --> 00:39:45,017
and past the guards with the guns, and into the vault

946
00:39:45,057 --> 00:39:45,777
we can't open.

947
00:39:45,957 --> 00:39:47,178
Without being seen by the cameras.

948
00:39:47,878 --> 00:39:48,759
Oh, yeah, sorry.

949
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:49,820
I forgot to mention that.

950
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,381
Yeah, well, say we do all that.

951
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:57,284
We're just supposed to walk out of there with $150 million

952
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:59,185
in cash on us without getting stopped.

953
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:05,759
Yeah.

954
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,180
Oh.

955
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:11,421
Okay.

956
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,764
So you're going to go on the creativity heist.

957
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:22,286
And it's a specific plan.

958
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:24,427
So remember these things?

959
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:27,689
The things that contribute to creativity?

960
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:30,470
You're going to use those to take your brain back.

961
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,751
So here's how you're going to do it.

962
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:34,131
Step one.

963
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:36,647
you're gonna make sure you can sleep every night.

964
00:40:37,507 --> 00:40:39,287
Nothing else matters until you can sleep every night

965
00:40:39,527 --> 00:40:39,867
for a week.

966
00:40:40,848 --> 00:40:42,968
And whatever you find lets you sleep every night,

967
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,608
you keep doing it.

968
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:46,589
Like, until you feel like you don't need to do it anymore.

969
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,329
And if you ever relapse and can't sleep,

970
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:49,089
you start doing it again.

971
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:51,830
And nothing moves until you can sleep.

972
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:53,990
As soon as you can do that,

973
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,550
you find ways to take breaks to daydream.

974
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,451
If you have to force it,

975
00:40:58,471 --> 00:41:00,211
you make yourself plan into your next vacation,

976
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:02,832
you make yourself look at childhood videos.

977
00:41:03,372 --> 00:41:07,374
or photos, you make yourself play a game that's nothing like the game that you're making,

978
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:16,019
you find ways to disconnect during the day. Next, you reach out to other people, you find a way to

979
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:19,940
connect to other people and talk to them about what you're going through. All of these are mandatory.

980
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:25,663
You can figure out how to do it. It can be anonymous, but you need to find a way to talk

981
00:41:25,703 --> 00:41:29,925
to people about what you're going through. You're going to get some fucking sunshine.

982
00:41:30,546 --> 00:41:31,986
You're going to come out of wherever you are.

983
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:33,745
You're going to sit by a window.

984
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:35,526
You're going to sit at a park bench.

985
00:41:35,566 --> 00:41:38,387
You're going to find a way to get some sunshine at least

986
00:41:38,487 --> 00:41:38,887
once a day.

987
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:43,010
You're going to make sure you have a safe space to create.

988
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,511
Sometimes that means your co-workers.

989
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:49,033
Sometimes it means only some of your co-workers.

990
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:52,675
Sometimes it means finding one person that you trust

991
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:55,236
and bouncing your ideas off of that person first.

992
00:41:55,256 --> 00:41:56,116
Hey, can you read this doc?

993
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:59,509
You need somewhere that feels safe for you

994
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:00,970
to take those first creative steps

995
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,132
so you're not doing it in front of your whole normal audience.

996
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:06,895
And then you're going to gather things around you that

997
00:42:06,935 --> 00:42:10,418
make you happy, even if it feels artificial at first.

998
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,881
When I was walking to work every day after chemo,

999
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:16,243
the second chemo, I had a Spotify playlist

1000
00:42:16,263 --> 00:42:17,804
called Walking, you know, inventive.

1001
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:20,406
And it was happy music by God.

1002
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:22,048
And I listened to it every day, and it

1003
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:24,550
didn't matter how I felt. That was the playlist

1004
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,751
I listened to when I walked to work,

1005
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:27,412
because it framed me for the day.

1006
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:29,320
And so you're going to do these.

1007
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,300
You're not just going to do them.

1008
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,561
You're going to schedule these things.

1009
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:35,462
You are building habits through doing this.

1010
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:38,824
That's the whole point is to build new habits,

1011
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,225
to rebuild those habits that you lost.

1012
00:42:42,345 --> 00:42:44,026
So one good way to do that is journaling.

1013
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:46,347
There are a lot of different journals.

1014
00:42:46,387 --> 00:42:48,228
Again, this is one called the Dragon Tree Journal

1015
00:42:49,028 --> 00:42:51,690
that has like life rituals and stuff like that in it.

1016
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,672
Again, these run the whole gamut from the journal of,

1017
00:42:56,415 --> 00:42:57,075
Have you slept?

1018
00:42:57,155 --> 00:42:57,775
What did you eat?

1019
00:42:57,855 --> 00:42:58,735
Did you exercise today?

1020
00:42:58,755 --> 00:43:00,156
Which, by the way, exercise is a great way

1021
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,576
to get that sunlight.

1022
00:43:02,656 --> 00:43:04,637
Going all the way from that, though, again,

1023
00:43:04,737 --> 00:43:09,758
to the side of let's talk about Zen, let's talk about gratitude,

1024
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,439
let's talk about past lives.

1025
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,159
So wherever you are on that spectrum,

1026
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:14,560
there's a journal that's going to work for you.

1027
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,100
So you just have to look for the one that's right.

1028
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,641
But the point is, there are planners

1029
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:22,962
that are not around work, but are around goals

1030
00:43:23,022 --> 00:43:23,742
and personal life.

1031
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:25,703
So find one of these.

1032
00:43:26,695 --> 00:43:29,136
fill it out, write about your experiences.

1033
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,497
There's actually evidence showing

1034
00:43:31,517 --> 00:43:33,197
that journaling every day becomes

1035
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:34,578
a key part of creativity.

1036
00:43:35,098 --> 00:43:36,258
It unlocks part of your brain.

1037
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:37,879
It encourages you to solve problems.

1038
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:43,301
So what you're doing here is you are rebuilding habits.

1039
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:46,782
You are starting the assembly line up again.

1040
00:43:47,563 --> 00:43:51,204
And it's going to be crazy and wacky and feel disconnected.

1041
00:43:51,884 --> 00:43:55,866
But over time, it's the way that you get back to yourself

1042
00:43:55,906 --> 00:43:56,046
again.

1043
00:43:56,672 --> 00:43:59,975
It's the way that you get back to predictable creativity,

1044
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:01,616
which is what makes you feel like yourself again,

1045
00:44:01,676 --> 00:44:02,536
if you're anyone like me.

1046
00:44:03,797 --> 00:44:06,399
So, now you've gone through all of these steps,

1047
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:10,882
and once you're doing that reliably,

1048
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:14,585
and you feel like you have started to get back

1049
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:18,447
onto the assembly line again, it's time for the last one.

1050
00:44:19,828 --> 00:44:21,589
Which honestly, is just to endure.

1051
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,671
When I was going through both cancer treatments,

1052
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:25,672
especially the second one,

1053
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:28,628
I had a lot of friends and people tell me,

1054
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:31,209
you're such a warrior, you're so brave.

1055
00:44:31,229 --> 00:44:35,511
And I was like, those are the warriors,

1056
00:44:36,212 --> 00:44:37,232
the doctors that saved my life.

1057
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:38,793
Those are the warriors.

1058
00:44:39,954 --> 00:44:40,214
Me?

1059
00:44:40,234 --> 00:44:44,376
I kind of just took it, right?

1060
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:45,216
I just waited it out.

1061
00:44:45,956 --> 00:44:46,737
That's really what I did.

1062
00:44:46,757 --> 00:44:52,239
I just sat it out and waited for it to pass, right?

1063
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:53,440
Waited for things to change.

1064
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,100
I mean, certainly,

1065
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:57,982
Now I know to take a more active role in recovering my creativity,

1066
00:44:58,442 --> 00:44:59,863
but when it comes to whatever you're going through,

1067
00:44:59,943 --> 00:45:02,446
all you can do is endure it, is wait it out.

1068
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,508
So there's this interesting study on creativity

1069
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:08,170
from the Georgia Institute of Technology

1070
00:45:09,431 --> 00:45:14,115
that showed that whether you brood over negative things

1071
00:45:14,896 --> 00:45:18,559
or actively reflect on them helps determine, quote,

1072
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,903
whether you slump into depression or jump into creativity.

1073
00:45:24,152 --> 00:45:27,215
Now I am not saying that you need to look at your trauma

1074
00:45:27,815 --> 00:45:28,376
positively.

1075
00:45:28,796 --> 00:45:30,577
If somebody told me I didn't look positively

1076
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:33,520
in curable cancer, I'd probably punch them in the face.

1077
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,841
So I am not saying that at all.

1078
00:45:36,582 --> 00:45:37,543
If it sucks, it sucks.

1079
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:39,444
And you need to be honest about it sucking.

1080
00:45:40,065 --> 00:45:43,307
But I do believe there's a little bit of a choice there.

1081
00:45:44,728 --> 00:45:48,932
I do believe that we can choose to reflect on what's happened.

1082
00:45:49,772 --> 00:45:51,514
Like I can stand up here and talk to you about the fact

1083
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:52,875
that, yeah, this cancer is probably going to kill me.

1084
00:45:53,475 --> 00:45:54,675
And that's okay, right?

1085
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:56,656
Because I reflect on what that means.

1086
00:45:56,716 --> 00:45:57,356
I've thought about it.

1087
00:45:58,116 --> 00:46:01,517
I'm not carrying it around like something I'm breeding on.

1088
00:46:01,918 --> 00:46:02,698
I'm reflecting on it.

1089
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:03,418
There is a choice.

1090
00:46:04,818 --> 00:46:05,619
And what I'm saying, though,

1091
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:06,859
is that you can also think about

1092
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:08,780
the things that you're gaining

1093
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,380
in going through the bullshit,

1094
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,362
like wisdom and perspective and resilience,

1095
00:46:15,122 --> 00:46:16,202
because you are gaining things.

1096
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:18,263
And that's what you reflect on,

1097
00:46:19,503 --> 00:46:21,104
because you're not just enduring.

1098
00:46:21,704 --> 00:46:23,225
When you look at it, all of these steps.

1099
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:26,484
have that recognition, that sense of awareness,

1100
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:30,046
that sense of pondering built into them.

1101
00:46:30,866 --> 00:46:33,887
You're not just enduring, you're enduring and you're growing.

1102
00:46:35,487 --> 00:46:37,508
So when you start radiation treatment, you get a tattoo.

1103
00:46:38,748 --> 00:46:40,229
Actually, with this shirt, you can kind of see it.

1104
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:43,470
It's so they can place the equipment reliably every day

1105
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,291
when you're laying on the table.

1106
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:47,411
So every day for three years, I'd

1107
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:48,412
look in the mirror after showering

1108
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:51,633
and there's my little beauty mark I never had before.

1109
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:53,553
And I don't think.

1110
00:46:55,727 --> 00:46:58,809
that it's a coincidence that I would wake up every morning

1111
00:46:58,829 --> 00:46:59,430
and look at that dot.

1112
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:02,633
And it was the first time after 20 years in the industry

1113
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:05,255
that I talked about being a woman in game development.

1114
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:07,657
And I don't think it's a coincidence

1115
00:47:08,698 --> 00:47:09,939
that I would look at that dot every morning

1116
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,881
and write for Gamasutra about diversity.

1117
00:47:13,722 --> 00:47:15,764
I don't think it's a coincidence that at this point,

1118
00:47:16,304 --> 00:47:19,727
I look at two dots because I needed a second one for lung

1119
00:47:19,747 --> 00:47:20,028
cancer.

1120
00:47:21,108 --> 00:47:22,910
I don't think it's a coincidence I look at those every morning,

1121
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,652
and I'm here talking to you.

1122
00:47:25,582 --> 00:47:26,922
The things that we go through change us.

1123
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:29,742
And they can change us in good ways and bad ways.

1124
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:31,203
I have lots of side effects.

1125
00:47:31,963 --> 00:47:32,543
And that's OK.

1126
00:47:33,223 --> 00:47:33,863
But they change us.

1127
00:47:35,444 --> 00:47:39,865
So I said I'd circle back around to Mr. Death here,

1128
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,205
and exactly where his scythe is positioned at the moment.

1129
00:47:43,825 --> 00:47:46,346
So I went into a clinical trial.

1130
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:47,946
I'm the second one on the left.

1131
00:47:50,307 --> 00:47:51,987
It combines two immunotherapy agents.

1132
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:56,680
It was phase one when I went in it about a year and a half ago.

1133
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,821
I don't know if it's even phase two yet.

1134
00:47:58,861 --> 00:47:59,801
It might be going into phase two.

1135
00:48:00,742 --> 00:48:03,523
So in June of last year, they released the first results

1136
00:48:03,743 --> 00:48:06,384
at one of the big cancer conferences.

1137
00:48:07,404 --> 00:48:10,605
So in previously treated patients

1138
00:48:10,705 --> 00:48:12,886
with SCCHN, which is head and neck cancer,

1139
00:48:15,647 --> 00:48:17,088
the combined ORR was 23%.

1140
00:48:17,568 --> 00:48:18,808
That's objective response rate.

1141
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,990
Believe it or not, 23% is high for immunotherapy.

1142
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:24,362
That means 23% of the patients responded to it.

1143
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:26,984
They had one CR and six PRs.

1144
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:29,006
A PR means a partial response.

1145
00:48:29,627 --> 00:48:31,488
It means your tumor shrank or stayed the same,

1146
00:48:31,888 --> 00:48:34,410
which is a victory in metastatic and curable cancer

1147
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:35,971
because it means they're not growing and killing you.

1148
00:48:36,952 --> 00:48:39,794
They had one complete response, meaning the cancer is gone.

1149
00:48:40,735 --> 00:48:41,196
That was me.

1150
00:48:41,876 --> 00:48:42,737
I was that one response.

1151
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:49,782
Yes.

1152
00:48:49,922 --> 00:48:50,403
Science.

1153
00:48:51,504 --> 00:48:51,924
For the win.

1154
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,884
So I still have incurable cancer.

1155
00:48:55,904 --> 00:48:57,405
This cancer probably is going to kill me.

1156
00:48:57,425 --> 00:48:58,966
I feel pretty good it's not going

1157
00:48:58,986 --> 00:49:01,187
to be this year, based on other things in the study.

1158
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:03,688
Feel pretty good about next year, too.

1159
00:49:04,648 --> 00:49:06,729
But I also feel like the luckiest person

1160
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:07,750
on the face of the Earth.

1161
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,532
I should not be standing here right now, right?

1162
00:49:12,272 --> 00:49:14,013
So I get scans every two months.

1163
00:49:14,153 --> 00:49:15,234
It could mutate any time.

1164
00:49:16,234 --> 00:49:17,835
Still, luckiest person ever.

1165
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,736
And when I first responded to the trial,

1166
00:49:21,557 --> 00:49:22,417
it took a while to sink in.

1167
00:49:24,385 --> 00:49:25,606
I am on the road again.

1168
00:49:26,746 --> 00:49:30,067
Hey, I need to care about stuff I didn't think I needed to care about.

1169
00:49:30,727 --> 00:49:31,467
I had a will.

1170
00:49:31,527 --> 00:49:31,987
I was ready.

1171
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:36,388
And now I'm like, oh, I guess I should finish my car payments.

1172
00:49:37,629 --> 00:49:38,609
Right?

1173
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:44,450
But what I've learned, though, in going through this, is that we're all on the open road.

1174
00:49:45,171 --> 00:49:45,571
All of us.

1175
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:47,971
Every minute we're alive, we're on the open road.

1176
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,592
And the thing I wanted to tell you is, I'm nothing special.

1177
00:49:52,212 --> 00:49:53,713
I am a game developer, just like you are.

1178
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:55,579
And I went through some shit.

1179
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,621
Everybody goes through some shit.

1180
00:49:58,301 --> 00:49:59,262
It's really not special.

1181
00:50:00,943 --> 00:50:01,504
I endured.

1182
00:50:01,524 --> 00:50:04,866
And I grew, and I changed, and so will you.

1183
00:50:06,067 --> 00:50:07,729
And I've learned that no matter what was going on,

1184
00:50:07,749 --> 00:50:09,390
I wasn't broken.

1185
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:10,431
I'm not broken.

1186
00:50:11,251 --> 00:50:12,312
None of you are broken.

1187
00:50:13,573 --> 00:50:16,175
No matter what's happening to you, you're not broken.

1188
00:50:16,996 --> 00:50:17,556
You're growing.

1189
00:50:18,257 --> 00:50:19,958
All of us are growing.

1190
00:50:21,499 --> 00:50:23,581
So I have a few minutes for questions.

1191
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:24,121
Sorry.

1192
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:27,558
But I know what it's like to not want to talk about stuff

1193
00:50:27,598 --> 00:50:28,098
in front of people.

1194
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:28,679
Hi.

1195
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:31,841
So my DMs are open on Twitter if anyone

1196
00:50:31,861 --> 00:50:34,283
wants to ask any questions privately or talk.

1197
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:35,724
So thank you.

1198
00:51:01,652 --> 00:51:04,214
So any questions if anyone's feeling brave?

1199
00:51:05,435 --> 00:51:08,657
And it's OK if there aren't any, because yeah.

1200
00:51:10,438 --> 00:51:11,418
Yes, there's a microphone.

1201
00:51:11,438 --> 00:51:11,819
Actually, I'm sorry.

1202
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:12,399
I should have mentioned that.

1203
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:13,460
There's a microphone in the center,

1204
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,521
which makes it worse, sorry.

1205
00:51:17,402 --> 00:51:18,803
Now you don't just have to ask this question.

1206
00:51:18,823 --> 00:51:21,485
You have to actually get up and move and then talk loud.

1207
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:22,405
So sorry.

1208
00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:24,887
I just didn't want to make people wait for me to walk

1209
00:51:24,927 --> 00:51:25,147
around.

1210
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:31,547
I live with an invisible illness and one thing that I struggle with is going a really long

1211
00:51:31,607 --> 00:51:33,048
time between jobs.

1212
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:39,471
And it's very hard sometimes to interview with someone and say, Hey, I was out of the

1213
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:43,873
industry for two years because I was undergoing really severe treatment.

1214
00:51:44,473 --> 00:51:47,254
But I'm fine now and I can work really well.

1215
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:47,334
Yay.

1216
00:51:48,354 --> 00:51:53,296
How do you deal with those gaps or how do you talk about those gaps when you interview?

1217
00:51:54,265 --> 00:51:58,167
Yeah, so super fun making the decision

1218
00:51:58,187 --> 00:51:59,267
that you were going to look for a new job

1219
00:51:59,307 --> 00:52:01,668
when you've talked about having incurable cancer in public.

1220
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:02,248
That was awesome.

1221
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:06,349
Ray of hope, not talking about it publicly yet,

1222
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:07,070
but I got a new job.

1223
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:08,710
So it's not impossible.

1224
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:10,111
You actually can do it.

1225
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:14,072
The thing that makes it tricky, honestly,

1226
00:52:14,112 --> 00:52:15,493
in that situation is the law as well.

1227
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,173
So secretly, I'm a lawyer.

1228
00:52:17,753 --> 00:52:19,394
I did that before I was a game designer.

1229
00:52:19,854 --> 00:52:22,295
So I unfortunately have to put that hat on occasionally,

1230
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:23,055
whether I want to or not.

1231
00:52:23,115 --> 00:52:23,535
So this is my.

1232
00:52:23,955 --> 00:52:26,116
lawyer hat even though I'm not giving you legal advice.

1233
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:27,637
That's the problem, right?

1234
00:52:27,737 --> 00:52:29,899
Is you don't want to talk about a disability in an interview.

1235
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:33,161
When I was interviewing for the role that I'm taking,

1236
00:52:34,662 --> 00:52:35,923
I actually didn't say any, I mean,

1237
00:52:36,423 --> 00:52:37,604
it's not hard to figure out.

1238
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:38,845
You read my Twitter.

1239
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:40,706
I mean, obviously when I started looking for a job,

1240
00:52:40,726 --> 00:52:41,767
I stopped talking about it briefly,

1241
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:43,228
but just look at my Twitter.

1242
00:52:43,248 --> 00:52:44,909
I mean, it's not super hard to figure that out about me.

1243
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:49,432
But I didn't talk about it till they gave me the offer.

1244
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:52,393
And I said, by the way, I need to know that it's OK that I'm

1245
00:52:52,413 --> 00:52:54,614
going to have to fly to Los Angeles because it's in Seattle.

1246
00:52:54,634 --> 00:52:57,475
I'm going to have to fly to Los Angeles one day every two weeks

1247
00:52:57,515 --> 00:52:58,276
for the trial treatment.

1248
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:00,257
Non-negotiable.

1249
00:53:00,897 --> 00:53:03,478
So I think it is tough.

1250
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:06,979
I think I'm going to tell you what my boyfriend told me.

1251
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,621
And I'm going to try to say it without crying.

1252
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,302
If they're the kind of company that you can't be honest with,

1253
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:14,903
you don't want to fucking work for them anyway.

1254
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:19,899
If you can't be who you are and they want to support you in that and they think these

1255
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:25,303
things make you better, and these things make you awesome, then you don't want to work for

1256
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:26,343
them anyway.

1257
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:28,084
So, that would be my advice to you.

1258
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:28,444
Thank you so much.

1259
00:53:28,464 --> 00:53:28,525
Yes.

1260
00:53:28,545 --> 00:53:28,985
Yes, yes, yes.

1261
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:29,185
Thank you.

1262
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:29,385
Thank you.

1263
00:53:29,405 --> 00:53:29,465
Yes.

1264
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:29,745
Thank you.

1265
00:53:29,765 --> 00:53:29,825
Yes.

1266
00:53:29,845 --> 00:53:30,025
Thank you.

1267
00:53:30,045 --> 00:53:30,105
Yes.

1268
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:30,346
Thank you.

1269
00:53:30,646 --> 00:53:31,947
Yes.

1270
00:53:31,987 --> 00:53:32,687
Thank you.

1271
00:53:32,707 --> 00:53:32,887
Thank you.

1272
00:53:34,074 --> 00:53:46,941
Hello, you mentioned how you're very open when it comes to talking about your cancer and how it's up to everyone to make that decision for themselves whether or not or how open they want to be when it comes to talking about what they're going through.

1273
00:53:47,721 --> 00:53:56,166
What would you recommend for someone who wants to be a lot more open about what they're going through but finds it really, really scary and difficult to do that?

1274
00:53:56,707 --> 00:53:58,347
Oh yeah, I mean that's a holy crap.

1275
00:53:59,188 --> 00:53:59,248
Hi.

1276
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,121
I don't, I mean, I'm the worst case scenario

1277
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:06,362
because I'm super private and I really am a hermit.

1278
00:54:06,382 --> 00:54:08,804
I mean, I had to get over it to be a creative lead.

1279
00:54:08,824 --> 00:54:10,384
So in my job, I'm not a hermit at all,

1280
00:54:10,884 --> 00:54:13,105
but you give me any, as soon as I get home from work,

1281
00:54:13,186 --> 00:54:14,306
I am like locked in a closet.

1282
00:54:14,366 --> 00:54:21,129
So I think what I found helpful, honestly,

1283
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,911
one of the hardest things about being diagnosed with cancer

1284
00:54:24,951 --> 00:54:26,031
is telling everybody who loves you.

1285
00:54:27,252 --> 00:54:27,712
Super rough.

1286
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,693
And I actually started to understand the widening circles

1287
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:35,515
of who you tell things to when at different times.

1288
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:37,075
It's interesting when you think about it, right?

1289
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:39,096
Like, these are the people I have to tell first.

1290
00:54:39,736 --> 00:54:40,977
These are the people I have to tell second.

1291
00:54:41,437 --> 00:54:43,738
These are the people I can tell on Facebook.

1292
00:54:43,818 --> 00:54:45,839
And all of those people should hear before I say it on Twitter.

1293
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:51,841
But honestly, for me, talking about it on Twitter was the easiest.

1294
00:54:53,102 --> 00:54:56,623
Because I don't have a personal relationship with a lot of the people there.

1295
00:54:57,234 --> 00:54:59,195
Anybody on Twitter that I have a personal relationship with

1296
00:54:59,235 --> 00:54:59,715
already knew.

1297
00:55:00,816 --> 00:55:04,639
It was so removed from everything,

1298
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,701
and at least for my Twitter community, so supportive,

1299
00:55:07,581 --> 00:55:08,402
that I found that easier.

1300
00:55:08,422 --> 00:55:09,763
I also found it easier to blog,

1301
00:55:10,703 --> 00:55:12,205
because it was me telling people,

1302
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:13,746
like typing my thoughts,

1303
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:18,769
and then posting the blog to Twitter or to Facebook, right?

1304
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:19,770
I found that that really helped.

1305
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:22,012
One of the main things you have to,

1306
00:55:22,092 --> 00:55:23,313
at least for me, that was a problem was,

1307
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:24,634
I didn't want people to look at me

1308
00:55:24,674 --> 00:55:25,735
like I was in any way diminished.

1309
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:27,790
or feel sorry for me, right?

1310
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,031
That's why my spoiler alert, I'm not gonna die,

1311
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:30,951
was at the front of this, right?

1312
00:55:30,971 --> 00:55:32,072
I don't want people looking at me that way.

1313
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:35,494
So that's what I would say, is find some way

1314
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:40,036
to talk about it that you can share

1315
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,137
with a little bit of distance

1316
00:55:41,997 --> 00:55:43,218
to kind of get yourself used to it.

1317
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:44,798
Cool, thank you so much.

1318
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:45,279
You're welcome.

1319
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:47,500
Yes.

1320
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:48,640
Hi.

1321
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:53,243
Sometimes you go through a trauma, right?

1322
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:55,924
And it's a bad event.

1323
00:55:56,784 --> 00:56:02,987
Um, and there's a long healing process, but, um, the nature of random events in

1324
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:09,810
life is that sometimes you get a bad run and you clearly have, um, how do you,

1325
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,271
um, talk to the people around you?

1326
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:17,173
Um, who, who see that you're struggling, right?

1327
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:22,655
Um, because there's tons of good advice here for how to try to find a way out

1328
00:56:22,815 --> 00:56:23,235
yourself.

1329
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:29,316
But it's a complicated dynamic system to be in relationship to a lot of people who love

1330
00:56:29,336 --> 00:56:32,402
you and want you to succeed and know that you can do better than you're doing right

1331
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:32,542
now.

1332
00:56:37,141 --> 00:56:40,764
Yeah, really struggle not only with that internal sense

1333
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,786
of worthlessness or diminishment,

1334
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:48,570
but also with not wanting to disappoint the people

1335
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,811
who are trying to help you get out of it, right?

1336
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:54,834
Did you find any resources about how to communicate

1337
00:56:54,874 --> 00:56:55,515
with those folks?

1338
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:56,916
Yeah, so what I'd recommend,

1339
00:56:56,976 --> 00:56:58,377
even if you're not dealing with cancer,

1340
00:56:58,437 --> 00:57:00,318
is that you Google what not to say

1341
00:57:00,338 --> 00:57:01,139
to people who have cancer.

1342
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,761
People say some pretty amazing things

1343
00:57:03,781 --> 00:57:04,662
to people who have cancer.

1344
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:05,783
Luckily, I didn't have a lot of that,

1345
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:06,883
but it's wacky.

1346
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:12,354
But what I learned in looking at that was that you just need to be honest.

1347
00:57:13,414 --> 00:57:13,695
Right?

1348
00:57:13,915 --> 00:57:14,936
Sometimes not in the moment.

1349
00:57:15,836 --> 00:57:18,178
If somebody says something to you or is trying to help in a way

1350
00:57:18,198 --> 00:57:21,301
that's not actually helpful or is not helping when you feel like they should,

1351
00:57:22,582 --> 00:57:23,303
let that moment go.

1352
00:57:24,163 --> 00:57:26,605
And at a more neutral time, you need to be honest.

1353
00:57:28,206 --> 00:57:30,508
I was forced into that when I went into the incurable cancer

1354
00:57:30,528 --> 00:57:34,652
because I said to my boyfriend about some of his relatives, I said,

1355
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:41,933
I do not want a single post about broccoli curing cancer or right to take this special

1356
00:57:42,353 --> 00:57:43,194
Chinese herb.

1357
00:57:43,354 --> 00:57:44,254
Just get that out.

1358
00:57:44,434 --> 00:57:44,674
Right.

1359
00:57:45,334 --> 00:57:49,416
I do enough research that if there's something that is anti-cancer, I know about it probably,

1360
00:57:49,996 --> 00:57:53,798
but I don't want any of that mystical crap when I'm trying to go through this.

1361
00:57:54,418 --> 00:57:56,018
And I just you just have to be honest.

1362
00:57:56,519 --> 00:57:59,460
If you can't be honest, find a loved one who can.

1363
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:01,895
Again, get that distance from yourself.

1364
00:58:02,695 --> 00:58:04,356
When you're in these situations, the last thing you need

1365
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:06,036
is to take more burden on yourself.

1366
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:07,577
You already have enough.

1367
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:10,338
So find a loved one, like me enlisting my boyfriend

1368
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:11,638
to tell his relatives that.

1369
00:58:12,278 --> 00:58:14,159
Find a loved one who maybe can have that conversation

1370
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:16,159
for you, but you really just have to be honest,

1371
00:58:16,219 --> 00:58:18,840
because, and the other thing I'll say,

1372
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,680
as difficult as it is to say,

1373
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,201
is if there's someone that's poisonous and difficult,

1374
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:21,941
just get them out.

1375
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:23,882
That's it, done, cut it.

1376
00:58:24,422 --> 00:58:24,882
You don't need it.

1377
00:58:25,442 --> 00:58:26,122
It's not helping you.

1378
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:28,923
You don't owe them anything other than

1379
00:58:30,325 --> 00:58:32,185
you know, maybe a reason for why you're cutting them out.

1380
00:58:32,845 --> 00:58:35,986
But that's what I would say is you just have to be honest

1381
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:36,986
and tell people what you need.

1382
00:58:37,466 --> 00:58:39,187
They can't guess unless,

1383
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:41,027
even if they've been through what you've been through,

1384
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:42,128
they honestly just can't guess.

1385
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:46,269
Sure, thanks.

1386
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:46,569
Go ahead.

1387
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:53,310
So my entire family has this concept of just let it go.

1388
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:54,911
Some of them are too frozen.

1389
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:56,331
I'm sure everyone has heard that song by now.

1390
00:58:59,643 --> 00:59:03,665
I have always struggled with the concept of how to let it go.

1391
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:07,306
I always feel like there's this demon on my shoulder that's just constantly whispering

1392
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:12,909
doubt and just terrible things about me that I know are not true.

1393
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:22,753
How do you get it to either shut up or to feed the angel, I'll say?

1394
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:25,374
So it's those steps.

1395
00:59:25,654 --> 00:59:27,015
The first step is still in your mind.

1396
00:59:27,655 --> 00:59:28,836
You need to be able to control your thoughts.

1397
00:59:30,437 --> 00:59:33,839
At this point, I can actually stop thinking about dying.

1398
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:37,280
I will find myself going online and researching.

1399
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,662
I research the trial that I'm on pretty often.

1400
00:59:40,382 --> 00:59:42,203
And I will find myself going to look at statistics,

1401
00:59:42,243 --> 00:59:44,264
and then I'll be like, no, nope.

1402
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:45,985
I am not doing that.

1403
00:59:46,646 --> 00:59:48,707
You just have to build the tools.

1404
00:59:49,087 --> 00:59:51,228
But the thing is, it's not willpower.

1405
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:54,590
It's not a failure in you that you can't do it.

1406
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:55,471
It's training.

1407
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:57,172
It is exercise for your brain.

1408
00:59:57,972 --> 00:59:59,053
You need to think about it that way.

1409
00:59:59,878 --> 01:00:01,739
I also recommend CBT therapy.

1410
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:05,280
A lot of what I'm talking about in this actually is CBT therapy.

1411
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,020
I have my undergrad with psychology.

1412
01:00:07,601 --> 01:00:09,321
And again, I'm not qualified to practice it.

1413
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:13,603
But I can say that repeating the same exercise

1414
01:00:14,023 --> 01:00:14,803
will train your brain.

1415
01:00:15,443 --> 01:00:17,724
And the first exercise is not to train yourself

1416
01:00:19,185 --> 01:00:20,865
that those thoughts are bad, but to train yourself

1417
01:00:20,885 --> 01:00:22,146
to control your thoughts at all.

1418
01:00:23,026 --> 01:00:25,827
So meditation, things like that, that's

1419
01:00:25,847 --> 01:00:26,927
what's going to get you to the point

1420
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:28,348
that you can start to control those thoughts.

1421
01:00:29,557 --> 01:00:29,837
Thank you.

1422
01:00:30,518 --> 01:00:30,698
Yeah.

1423
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:32,079
Hi.

1424
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:34,220
So, first of all, thank you.

1425
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,161
You're welcome.

1426
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:43,545
So, I just wanted to ask, you know, I'm kind of struggling with, you know, having been

1427
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:48,568
unemployed for a few months and I get into this weird feedback loop where, you know,

1428
01:00:48,608 --> 01:00:54,372
I'll have anxiety over this unemployment, then I'll feel guilty because like, oh, another

1429
01:00:54,432 --> 01:00:58,054
one of my friends has been unemployed for longer and they're putting on a good face.

1430
01:00:58,493 --> 01:01:03,636
And then that makes me feel more guilty, which makes me feel more anxious, like, oh my God,

1431
01:01:03,656 --> 01:01:05,077
they're dealing with this so much better than me.

1432
01:01:05,097 --> 01:01:08,859
You're talking about the section that I deleted from my talk because I didn't have enough

1433
01:01:08,899 --> 01:01:09,139
time.

1434
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:13,160
which I had a video of John Oliver talking about whataboutism,

1435
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,480
because you're whatabouting yourself.

1436
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,281
You're whataboutisming yourself, right?

1437
01:01:17,981 --> 01:01:20,442
So I went through all this radiation

1438
01:01:20,942 --> 01:01:23,083
and had been wondering, where is my superpower?

1439
01:01:23,863 --> 01:01:26,503
Because I have gotten so many scans.

1440
01:01:26,543 --> 01:01:30,284
I get CT scans with radioactive contrast every two months.

1441
01:01:30,504 --> 01:01:32,065
So where is my superpower?

1442
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:33,865
And I realized that my superpower

1443
01:01:33,965 --> 01:01:36,446
is to make anyone who's complaining to me about anything

1444
01:01:36,486 --> 01:01:38,306
shut up when they remember I have incurable cancer.

1445
01:01:38,847 --> 01:01:41,769
Right? No one wants to talk to me about any problem ever.

1446
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:44,952
Right? Because they're comparing. You can't compare.

1447
01:01:46,052 --> 01:01:48,374
Everyone goes through things like this uniquely.

1448
01:01:48,995 --> 01:01:50,876
Your experience is unique from someone else's.

1449
01:01:51,937 --> 01:01:55,059
You cannot compare, because everything that's happened in your life

1450
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,862
has combined to make you unique from someone else.

1451
01:01:58,682 --> 01:02:01,745
You have things in your past that might make what you're going through easier or harder

1452
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:03,966
than someone else going through the exact same thing.

1453
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:05,608
I absolutely know that...

1454
01:02:07,147 --> 01:02:09,908
It's my design background and my objectivity

1455
01:02:09,949 --> 01:02:11,789
that enables me to stand up here and talk about this stuff

1456
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,350
so objectively, right?

1457
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:14,571
I'm trained for it.

1458
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:16,451
Other people couldn't do that.

1459
01:02:16,972 --> 01:02:18,552
So you need to not compare yourself.

1460
01:02:19,313 --> 01:02:20,953
You need to tell other people not to compare.

1461
01:02:21,994 --> 01:02:24,815
You need to acknowledge what they're going through, right?

1462
01:02:25,736 --> 01:02:27,957
So let's talk about being unemployed together.

1463
01:02:28,817 --> 01:02:30,218
Let's talk about what we're doing together.

1464
01:02:31,298 --> 01:02:33,579
When you say something, I mean, you can acknowledge it

1465
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:33,919
and say,

1466
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,581
If you're complaining about being unemployed,

1467
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:40,122
you can say, yeah, I know it's been even longer for you.

1468
01:02:42,123 --> 01:02:42,824
Put it on the table.

1469
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:43,444
It's a fact.

1470
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:45,005
Don't feel guilty about it.

1471
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:46,245
Just acknowledge it.

1472
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:48,126
But don't, what about yourself?

1473
01:02:48,747 --> 01:02:49,667
It's not helping anybody.

1474
01:02:50,247 --> 01:02:51,268
So I think I'm out of time.

1475
01:02:52,349 --> 01:02:53,549
And I think you're also the last question.

1476
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:55,510
Did you have a follow up?

1477
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:56,291
We can talk after.

1478
01:02:57,171 --> 01:02:59,512
Because I can also, I'll go to the follow up area.

1479
01:02:59,532 --> 01:03:00,733
So OK, everybody.

1480
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:01,413
Thank you.
