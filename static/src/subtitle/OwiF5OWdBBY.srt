00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:08,028
The first talk of the day, as you can see,

2
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:10,189
is Steve and Nina here from Fulbright

3
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:11,690
talking about level design in Tacoma.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:11,730
-.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:19,615
-.

6
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:19,675
-.

7
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:19,715
-.

8
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:19,755
-.

9
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:19,795
-.

10
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:19,835
-.

11
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:19,875
-.

12
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:19,915
-.

13
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:19,955
-.

14
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:20,015
-.

15
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:20,055
-.

16
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:20,095
-.

17
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:20,355
-.

18
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:20,395
-.

19
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:20,435
-.

20
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:20,475
-.

21
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:20,515
-.

22
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:20,556
-.

23
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:20,616
-.

24
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:20,656
-.

25
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:20,696
-.

26
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:20,736
-.

27
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,421
So I am a level designer at Fulbright,

28
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:38,503
and obviously I worked on Tacoma.

29
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:40,684
Tacoma, for those of you who haven't played it,

30
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,165
here's a screenshot of it.

31
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,608
It's a first-person 3D exploration game

32
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:47,809
set on a space station in the near future.

33
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,511
It's about a woman named Amy who's been sent

34
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,994
to retrieve an AI from a space station called Tacoma

35
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,696
that has been recently evacuated for a reason

36
00:00:56,736 --> 00:00:58,757
that you as the player are not fully aware of

37
00:00:58,797 --> 00:00:59,578
in the beginning of the game.

38
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:07,287
And you play as Amy and sort of discover what happened with this crew that left and why the AI is still there and all this stuff.

39
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:12,032
So the game is really about exploring the station to learn about what happened there recently.

40
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:18,760
And the story is communicated on multiple levels throughout the game, both mechanically and through the environment,

41
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:20,462
which is what...

42
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:24,947
sort of this whole topic is, because it's all sort of relating back to level design

43
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:25,267
for us.

44
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:31,009
So we'll explain what some of our design goals were, how they relate to level design specifically,

45
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,050
and what it was like actually implementing them throughout the development of Tacoma

46
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,571
from the beginning to the end, basically.

47
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:43,072
So I'll pass the torch along to Steve, who will kick off our little discussion.

48
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:44,593
Peace.

49
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:46,814
Thanks, Nina.

50
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:50,077
Let me see, can I angle that a little bit?

51
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:50,558
No, I can't.

52
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:57,364
So, yeah, I was the co-story lead

53
00:01:57,564 --> 00:02:02,049
and kind of the creative direction force of the game.

54
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:05,232
And I come from a level design background.

55
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:09,576
So, like Nina was saying, Fulbright, Fulbright.

56
00:02:10,403 --> 00:02:13,524
in the Level Design Summit is a piece of level design jargon.

57
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:16,705
So like the name of our studio is a level design term.

58
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:18,966
So we have a very like level design centric

59
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:22,127
kind of founders syndrome about how we tell stories

60
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:25,368
and what the focus of our design process is

61
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,508
and how we relate to the player.

62
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,669
So on my side of the talk,

63
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,530
I'm gonna talk a little bit about the kind of top down.

64
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:37,651
direction and player experiential intent behind the game,

65
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:40,013
how we got to that from Gone Home

66
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:41,354
and what we were trying to do with Tacoma

67
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:45,178
and how we worked together to put that on screen.

68
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,081
So yeah, our first game at Fulbright was Gone Home,

69
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,061
which there's a screenshot of up here,

70
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:57,062
which was a game about exploring an empty house,

71
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,983
well, empty of people house,

72
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:02,103
to find out about what happened

73
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:04,484
to the people who lived there.

74
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:07,105
It was a story exploration game,

75
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:11,806
a walking simulator of early vintage.

76
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:16,390
And it really focused on just the environment,

77
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,613
the objects in it, and what you could learn from that

78
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:23,577
and finding audio diaries that explain the story within that.

79
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:28,122
But going from Gone Home to Tacoma,

80
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:30,344
we wanted to expand on what we do

81
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:33,267
with these kinds of games mechanically and work.

82
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,837
more on how the player is involved

83
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:39,479
with the moments in the story

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,723
and how they engage with finding the story actively

85
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,085
in a way that we didn't in Gone Home.

86
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:48,027
We wanted to bring the player closer

87
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:50,250
to moments in the story as they happened,

88
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,092
while also allowing them to have the full freedom

89
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:55,355
to find every detail they're interested in

90
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,736
like they had in Gone Home.

91
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:01,927
So as part of that, we were really heavily inspired

92
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,549
by immersive theater productions like Sleep No More,

93
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,392
where the audience shares the space with the performers

94
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:12,214
and follows them through the performance space

95
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,895
and kind of chooses their own path

96
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:15,956
through these scenes that are happening.

97
00:04:17,197 --> 00:04:19,779
Something that is, I'll talk a little bit more

98
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:21,740
about Sleep No More, it's a performance

99
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,482
that's been in production for like, I don't know,

100
00:04:24,582 --> 00:04:27,384
like six, seven years now in New York.

101
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:32,987
and it takes place across three floors of a converted hotel,

102
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,528
and I think it's actually a converted warehouse

103
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:35,869
that they made look like a hotel.

104
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,411
But basically, you as an audience member in this space,

105
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:41,632
and there's a lot of performers that are moving through it

106
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:44,374
along their own paths, and you as an individual

107
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:46,295
can only follow one, you know,

108
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:47,555
you can only be in one place at one time.

109
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,637
So the performance is an hour long,

110
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,758
but it loops three times over the course of the night,

111
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,080
and so you as an individual can say like,

112
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,020
oh, I followed.

113
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,212
these performers into this scene

114
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:00,273
and then follow that guy last time,

115
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,794
I'm going to follow the lady

116
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:03,255
that was the other side of it this time

117
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:05,176
and see more of the total,

118
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:08,839
but you're kind of building up partial information

119
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,900
about what the entire performance is

120
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,781
through what you choose to observe.

121
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:15,663
We wanted to take that core experience,

122
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:19,245
which we felt is really unique and valuable,

123
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:23,028
and convert it into a form that felt native

124
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:26,190
to a digital experience.

125
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:31,669
And so for us, what that meant was that since this is a

126
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:37,471
digital game, instead of it just looping and you choosing

127
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:38,631
what you're gonna do on the next loop,

128
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:42,093
we could give you the ability to fast forward and rewind

129
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:45,354
and pause and be in control of both the performance

130
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:49,195
and your experience of it instead of just your experience

131
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:49,915
of the performance.

132
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:54,658
So we wanted to give players the tools

133
00:05:55,118 --> 00:05:57,119
to understand the story as it happens

134
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,480
by actually being able to have hooks into it

135
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:03,222
and what they are seeing of it and what it's doing

136
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:04,903
along with being observant.

137
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:08,104
Basically to be a more active observer

138
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:10,385
than we had in our prior games.

139
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:17,402
But we didn't start from this as our set of core mechanics

140
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:20,223
when we started working on Tacoma.

141
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:24,925
When we started, we had a bunch more traditional

142
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:27,787
progression style.

143
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:31,329
We started with a story and progression structure

144
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,530
that was very close to Gone Home.

145
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,891
Here we have the first thing you do in Gone Home.

146
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:38,637
is move an object and find a key and unlock a door with it,

147
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:39,917
which is extremely traditional.

148
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:41,778
We do have some locked doors and stuff in Tacoma,

149
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:46,441
but it was more at the center of what we were doing

150
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:48,242
in our first rev of the game.

151
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:52,124
This progression style is derived

152
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,006
from classic audio diary-based level design,

153
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:59,608
so I worked on the, multiple people at the studio

154
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:03,690
worked on the Bioshock series before we worked at Fulbright.

155
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:06,748
And I kind of learned how to tell a story

156
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:08,810
in a level from those games.

157
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:14,334
And I was very familiar with how you stage out spaces

158
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:18,057
to place story breadcrumbs to have the player

159
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:20,598
kind of move through a story as they move through a space.

160
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:24,141
And in a lot of ways, I was probably too familiar with it

161
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:26,523
because we said, we should do that again.

162
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:29,965
And that's fair, right?

163
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:30,766
Like, I don't know.

164
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:35,666
it's a legitimate way to make a thing.

165
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:38,187
But as we started to do it,

166
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,030
we kind of realized that it wasn't speaking fully

167
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:45,032
to what we actually wanted to do with the game.

168
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:48,634
In a mostly linear story game,

169
00:07:48,654 --> 00:07:52,897
you use audio diaries to match the player's flow

170
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:53,938
through the space.

171
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:56,279
In Gone Home, you're discovering this story of

172
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,494
a young woman named Sam who's a high schooler

173
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:00,995
and kind of what's happened to her

174
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:02,856
in the year that you've been away.

175
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:05,297
She moves to a new house,

176
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:06,677
which is the house you're exploring,

177
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,617
goes to a new school,

178
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:10,679
meets another young lady at the school

179
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,299
and they fall in love.

180
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,900
And so, you know, in the game,

181
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,901
this is the first part of Gone Home.

182
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:21,663
This is the entry and the West Hall of the house.

183
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,524
And so, you know, we arrange the plot points

184
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:29,024
in the order that you'll most likely encounter them.

185
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:32,606
And it can feel non-linear,

186
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,887
it at least is player-driven and self-guided,

187
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,728
but it still is saying we're going to send you

188
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,990
on a reliable path through these spaces

189
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,070
that tell you a linear story.

190
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:43,971
And in its original state,

191
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:46,373
Tacoma followed this same design approach.

192
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:48,414
The spaces were laid out kind of as a string of pearls,

193
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:52,996
and each point in it contained an isolated

194
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,882
section of the story or a plot point or a moment,

195
00:08:57,882 --> 00:08:59,744
and you moved through them and they were basically spent

196
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:01,425
and then you continued on your way.

197
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:05,868
And our first pass included these AR projections,

198
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:08,510
these 3D recordings that ended up being the core

199
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,512
of the finished game, but they were much more isolated.

200
00:09:11,572 --> 00:09:13,834
They were essentially visual audio diaries.

201
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,956
I think that we've seen these a lot in games,

202
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:18,578
where you kind of are playing a sci-fi game

203
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:21,139
and you walk into a room and a hologram shows up.

204
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,961
you don't really need to look at it usually.

205
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,084
It's just, you know, it's visual flavor for an audio diary.

206
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:29,706
But as we were doing that,

207
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:33,489
we realized that, yeah, it wasn't really different.

208
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:34,830
It wasn't really, you know,

209
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,171
something that we hadn't done before.

210
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,113
It was just a sci-fi version of here's your audio diary.

211
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:43,977
And so, you know, with that version of the game,

212
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:47,860
we basically, it showed us what we wanted to do

213
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,302
with this, you know, element of what we were doing.

214
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,319
because it showed us what it wasn't doing.

215
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,202
So, you know, the fact that these AR characters

216
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:05,447
actually fit in our kind of stayed level design process

217
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:08,329
showed that they kind of weren't having enough impact

218
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:12,052
on the game, because they didn't force us

219
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:13,072
to design it differently.

220
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,135
There were one or two places in the original version

221
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:19,916
of the game where these AR scenes kind of spread out

222
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:23,258
over more space and showed us the potential of like,

223
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:24,739
oh, okay, this person leaves the room

224
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:26,960
and you can either stay in the room or follow them

225
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,081
and you're kind of doing that piecing together.

226
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,743
But it still was localized.

227
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:33,864
It was still on the scale of just like,

228
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:36,365
you know, kind of a 20 foot radius

229
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:38,887
or 40 foot radius or something.

230
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:42,809
But it showed us that we could do more with it.

231
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,041
if we thought about level design differently.

232
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,284
Our levels needed to be reshaped

233
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:53,187
to embrace nonlinear interconnected AR scenes,

234
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:56,469
which means they needed to be designed for those scenes,

235
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,591
not be designed and then we put the scenes into them.

236
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:04,054
They needed to be just larger and more complex,

237
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:05,135
have more going on in them.

238
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:06,696
The scenes needed to be longer,

239
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:07,957
they needed to cover more area,

240
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,919
and the kind of area they covered needed to be different.

241
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:18,614
It basically was the thing that forced us out of our traditional, you know, shock game,

242
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:24,557
audio diary level design territory, which is good, but it also meant that we had a lot

243
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:26,378
of new problems to solve, which is also good.

244
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:27,905
except when you're trying to ship a game,

245
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:28,645
because it's hard.

246
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,366
It takes a long time.

247
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:35,748
So, you know, our AR scenes turned from these points

248
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:38,109
where you would kind of encounter one character,

249
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:40,950
a couple of characters, and either two webs.

250
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:43,391
They had multiple characters

251
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:45,552
that all had individual threads

252
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:47,753
that were running parallel to each other

253
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,214
and that, like Sleep No More,

254
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:51,955
you couldn't see all of at once.

255
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:55,577
In fact, you can't see all of any of our central AR scenes

256
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:56,577
unless you.

257
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,645
pause and rewind and move through them a number of times.

258
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:00,765
Pardon me.

259
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,026
And we leave that to the player to determine

260
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,887
how deep they want to go into seeing

261
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:08,108
the content of these scenes.

262
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,950
But that was also good because that is in line

263
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,470
with what we wanted the player's relationship

264
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,651
to Gone Home to be, which is to say,

265
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:19,632
there's a house here, there's a bunch of stuff in it.

266
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,414
find all the stuff, it's because you wanted to find

267
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:24,935
all the stuff, not because you felt like you had to

268
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:26,536
or you're checking off a list or whatever.

269
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:30,097
And so similarly, at the point that we expanded

270
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:33,199
on what our AR scenes were, it reinforced

271
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:35,660
that central player experience in a totally different form.

272
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,421
So that's good.

273
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:38,482
But it took us a while to get there.

274
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:40,423
It took us a first version of the game

275
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:42,224
that we were like, oh, this isn't what we're doing

276
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:44,625
to realize what that was.

277
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,645
So now when you play Tacoma,

278
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:53,168
you see our version of what it means

279
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:58,893
for these AR scenes not to just be visual audio diaries

280
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:01,636
but to be the central mechanic of the game,

281
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,738
the way that you discover the story

282
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:05,920
and what the rest of the game is supporting

283
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,542
as opposed to being a supplemental part

284
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:09,603
of the overall experience.

285
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,644
So.

286
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:17,426
That was our direction, right?

287
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,728
We worked together to discover the mechanics

288
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:21,149
and what the requirements were

289
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,851
for that central player experience.

290
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:25,653
But then the question became,

291
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:29,515
how do we actually build those spaces and build the scenes

292
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:32,838
and do the work to support the player

293
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:34,839
through that entire experience in the details,

294
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,681
not just at the high level.

295
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:38,402
And so Nina's gonna talk a little bit

296
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:41,184
about that process of putting it on screen.

297
00:13:48,222 --> 00:13:49,262
Wow, nice job, Steve.

298
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:54,223
I'll be back later.

299
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,964
I'll clap for you.

300
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:56,104
We'll clap for you every time.

301
00:13:57,724 --> 00:13:59,605
One thing I want to add to what Steve was just saying,

302
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:02,066
which wasn't in my slides, but now I want to say it,

303
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:06,107
is that people, other developers, might find it interesting

304
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:09,128
that in that process of going from more of a string of pearls

305
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:12,729
approach to this interconnected AR scene approach

306
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,890
with the rewinding and fast-forwarding that we ended up with,

307
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,281
We had a whole full version of the game that we had built

308
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,242
that we just basically completely threw in the trash.

309
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:25,743
And that was over a year of work, maybe?

310
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,545
Sometimes you do pre-production on purpose.

311
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,966
Sometimes you realize you were doing it afterwards.

312
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:33,806
Yeah, exactly.

313
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:35,467
You spend a year on pre-production without realizing it.

314
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:38,923
So this was all a big learning experience for us, I feel like.

315
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:41,324
And yeah, we really did kind of end up

316
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:43,806
starting largely from scratch when

317
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:47,047
we found the actual mechanics that we felt inspired by.

318
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:50,009
So maybe just a little nugget that people

319
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:50,829
might find interesting.

320
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:57,992
So I'm going to talk about paper mapping and gray blocking

321
00:14:58,072 --> 00:15:00,033
and all that sort of implementation stuff.

322
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:04,351
So what I knew when I started paper mapping,

323
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,415
which I think it was like me, Steven, tied in,

324
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:08,216
I did a lot of it though,

325
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:13,043
what I knew was that from this earlier version of Tacoma,

326
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,264
the thing that was inspiring us,

327
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:15,906
that made us want to change the game so much.

328
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:20,798
were the scenes that were taking place in these more open, interconnected spaces where

329
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,944
characters in our scenes could walk around from room to room and sort of like pass each other

330
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:31,749
in a natural way. And that felt like a pretty good structure for our AR scenes, and I'll get

331
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:36,874
into a little more detail about what that means, but I came into the paper maps knowing that.

332
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:45,383
And I knew a little bit about the AR scenes that Steven Carlo were developing and I knew that each part of the station

333
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:49,906
would serve to house a specific character with a specific job

334
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:57,653
And thus would need the realistic facilities to support these functions. So with that in mind I focused on creating

335
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:05,019
nonlinear spaces that would support both the future AR scenes and sort of the more utilitarian aspect of like

336
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:06,518
Who are these characters?

337
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:07,819
And what are they actually doing there?

338
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,701
What do they have to do to realistically fulfill their job

339
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:12,603
in their section of the station?

340
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:15,045
So it's like, we have like our botanist

341
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:17,727
has like his botany wing, sub wing,

342
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:20,630
and then we have like our engineer has like her area.

343
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,393
So it was sort of like job based sections of the game

344
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:25,094
that I was paper mapping early on.

345
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:31,500
So here is some text and not the paper maps because that's the next slide.

346
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:35,383
Let's see.

347
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,645
Oh, it's because I didn't hit the button correctly.

348
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:42,409
Okay, so to get more into paper mapping, here are some actual paper maps.

349
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,691
I want to talk about why I think sort of our initial approach worked so well with AR scenes

350
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:50,731
that were eventually built with these.

351
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,632
And these are two of the early admin paper maps.

352
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:58,113
So the administration wing is like sort of the first big wing that you encounter in the

353
00:16:58,153 --> 00:16:58,373
game.

354
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:07,135
And it contains the operations facilities and the personnel, the admin and operations

355
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:08,836
facilities and it's called the personnel wing.

356
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:09,416
Sorry.

357
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:14,425
So the earlier paper map is the one on the left,

358
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:19,827
and then the one on the right is sort of closer to what our final, like, gray block ended up being

359
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,427
and what the final level is now in the game.

360
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:26,348
So while I was paper mapping and working on that one on the left, which is the early one,

361
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,789
I'd ask myself how the rooms would be laid out

362
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,850
and what order they would be laid out in, sort of in the space,

363
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,291
such that the people who live there could actually use them realistically.

364
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,262
So I think this is especially important because Tacoma is about a bunch of characters that

365
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:45,423
are living and working on a space station like in isolation with this small group.

366
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:49,004
So they're like literally living in their workspace.

367
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:54,666
And so how do I design a space that seems like it would actually be tolerable to someone

368
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,747
who is in this sort of extreme situation?

369
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:02,929
So one of the obvious questions for this is like where does the bedroom belong in this kind of space?

370
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:06,150
Where do the personal spaces belong in this like primarily?

371
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:10,452
Workspace oriented station, you know, yeah, I interject. Yeah

372
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:17,734
So something that as far as the paper map goes something I think is a couple things. I think are probably interesting are a

373
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:28,708
So Robert has done a blog post at some point about sort of like the stages of being a good

374
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:33,790
level designer basically and how there's sort of like complexity and interconnectivity of

375
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,090
space that you learn over time.

376
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,411
And I think that you'll see that.

377
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:41,138
The one on the right is a much better version of that

378
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:43,099
than the one on the left.

379
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,843
And it both supports our scenes better

380
00:18:46,963 --> 00:18:49,965
because the spaces kind of have overlap

381
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:51,066
the way the scenes do,

382
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:53,888
but it also just naturally makes it feel

383
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:56,150
like a more believable place to be.

384
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:57,912
Especially on a space station,

385
00:18:57,952 --> 00:18:59,713
it's like they want to have a conservation of space.

386
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,215
So as far as the fiction driving what we do,

387
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:03,616
we were like, also we should bring it in

388
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:05,098
so there's not wasted space.

389
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:06,479
It's up.

390
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:07,600
The other thing that I think is,

391
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,100
hopefully

392
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:10,038
I don't know, it's interesting to me,

393
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:15,160
is that Nina, before she worked at Fulbright,

394
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,781
had only made smaller 2D games,

395
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:21,983
and so this progression is also Nina learning

396
00:19:22,063 --> 00:19:25,524
to be a 3D level designer as this process was going on,

397
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,045
and I think kind of like,

398
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:29,126
it was very interesting to me to see.

399
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:34,128
your paper maps evolve as you kind of did a lot of revs

400
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:35,829
of like, I'll paper map it, then I'll gray block it.

401
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:38,651
Oh, I can see why that isn't really what it was going for.

402
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:40,633
I'll paper map it again based on that.

403
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:43,895
So some of the progression, I think, of the spaces

404
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,397
was also like your learning process

405
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,799
as kind of becoming a level designer, which was cool.

406
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, it's hilarious.

407
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,282
I was looking through all my old notebook of paper maps

408
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:56,924
and I looked at the first one and it was just like a box.

409
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,411
Like I divided the box a couple times.

410
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:01,571
Gotta start somewhere.

411
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:02,992
It was so bad.

412
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:04,913
I didn't put that in any of the slides.

413
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:06,014
Too embarrassing.

414
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:08,375
But yeah, I did a lot of paper maps

415
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:11,316
and one of the things we did focus on was yeah, like

416
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:14,758
cutting out stuff, like cutting out as many hallways as possible

417
00:20:14,938 --> 00:20:17,739
and just like making our spaces as compact as possible

418
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,041
to also support the realism and the utilitarianism of these spaces

419
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:23,642
because like you wouldn't...

420
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:26,708
it doesn't make sense to have such a sprawling space station.

421
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:29,130
That wouldn't make sense for the company in the game

422
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,812
to build such a huge space with a small amount of people

423
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:34,995
who have, as we explore in the game, crappy jobs.

424
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:38,317
So it's a small, very compact space.

425
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:40,619
And the paper map process was super iterative.

426
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,682
So the time difference between these two paper

427
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:44,883
maps are pretty wide.

428
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:47,705
We did a lot of iterative paper mapping,

429
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,006
especially in the beginning.

430
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:51,068
So.

431
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,926
Like I was talking about the bedrooms.

432
00:20:54,126 --> 00:20:58,108
So when we're thinking about like where a bedroom would go

433
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:00,428
in like a workspace on a space station like this,

434
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:01,989
you probably, when you think about it,

435
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:04,850
you probably don't want it near the entrance of a wing

436
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,030
because that doesn't feel very private, right?

437
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,991
You also don't want to put someone's bunk

438
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,091
right next to their office

439
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:13,072
because like who wants to sleep next to their office?

440
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:14,733
Like you probably don't want to do that.

441
00:21:15,513 --> 00:21:17,494
And even though this is like a corporation building it,

442
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:19,174
I still don't think they would even do that.

443
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,275
That would be really evil.

444
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:22,295
We could have gone that direction.

445
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:25,556
So we wanted to make sure that there was a clear separation

446
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,917
between public and private spaces on the station,

447
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:30,318
given the fact that the station was built

448
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,959
for long-term postings on it for these people.

449
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,521
So I iterated on these paper maps with this concept in mind

450
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:40,302
and came to a decision that our levels should have

451
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,002
the sort of hub and spoke structure.

452
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,644
So for example, admin's hub is the dining room.

453
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:48,965
So you can see it's sort of like that central space

454
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:50,565
where all the other spaces branch off of it.

455
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:58,815
And each space that branches off the central hub is separated to a different degree based

456
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:00,956
on whether it's a workspace or a private space.

457
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:09,380
So most workspaces branch directly from the hub without much space in between since they're

458
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,682
meant to feel more easily accessible by multiple members of the crew who might need to use

459
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:14,162
them for work.

460
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:17,013
So the conference room is right next to the dining room.

461
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,413
I have it circled right there.

462
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,734
And that conference room even has a window looking into the hub

463
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:24,435
because the conference room is like an extra public space

464
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:25,935
where like they're having meetings

465
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,395
with many different people on the station.

466
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:33,097
And the conference room is also like, it's also sort of like associated

467
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:34,537
with the dining room because it's like these sort

468
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:36,117
of like public gathering spaces.

469
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:38,698
And this wing is really like dedicated to that because it's

470
00:22:38,718 --> 00:22:39,518
like administration.

471
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:40,378
This is where people come.

472
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,737
to meet with their supervisor, Evie, to have meetings with her,

473
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:46,037
to go to the conference room, to eat.

474
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:49,478
And so it kind of makes sense to have these places closer

475
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:50,558
together for us.

476
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:55,279
And then sort of the opposite of that is the private space.

477
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,039
And in this wing, I have circled here

478
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,660
where the bunk is for Evie.

479
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,680
Evie St. James, she's the station administrator,

480
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,581
so she lives in the administration wing.

481
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:07,661
And her bunk has this sort of nice hallway

482
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:10,482
that's connected to that hub space.

483
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:10,722
But.

484
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,543
it has the separate hallway unlike the conference room

485
00:23:13,563 --> 00:23:16,064
which literally just has a door and a window

486
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,464
separating it from the hub space.

487
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:21,946
So this is like an example of how we're like

488
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:24,427
separating private space more deliberately.

489
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:29,729
And this kind of approach with the hub and spoke structure

490
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:32,150
and separating private spaces really deliberately

491
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,110
works super well for AR scenes

492
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,951
because you can have conversations.

493
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:38,990
that intersect and break off in a natural way.

494
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,733
So for example, you see a lot of conversations in Tacoma

495
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:44,494
intersect in the hub space of a wing

496
00:23:44,594 --> 00:23:46,035
where the characters would naturally

497
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:47,155
be passing by each other.

498
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:49,337
So like say there's one part where it's like,

499
00:23:49,357 --> 00:23:50,818
Evie like comes out from her office

500
00:23:50,858 --> 00:23:52,359
and she's walking through and then she ends up

501
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,660
in a conversation at the dinner table

502
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,102
because she's like naturally moving from a private space

503
00:23:57,142 --> 00:23:59,263
to a public space and encounters a group there

504
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:00,784
and stops to talk to them.

505
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:03,226
And then like.

506
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,571
with these more public spaces, it makes sense

507
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:06,751
that they would be gathering there

508
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:07,972
to hang out with each other, right?

509
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:13,255
So the open interconnectedness of these spaces

510
00:24:13,315 --> 00:24:15,836
worked super well because of that natural flow of people

511
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:18,557
through them based on how they would be

512
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:19,738
living their lives naturally.

513
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,740
So I have some more examples of this.

514
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,001
So we have Sarah right here who's at the pool table

515
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:29,042
in the administration wing talking to Odin

516
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:31,924
who's the station AI, and she talks to Odin a lot,

517
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:32,484
and it's great.

518
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:36,945
And so she's in this open space that the dining room overlooks.

519
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:40,267
So she, you can see sort of like there's an upwards ramp going up,

520
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:44,049
and there's a dining room above, and then she's below with Odin.

521
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:47,330
And soon enough, she's like, she's sitting there playing pool,

522
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,192
and then Nat actually comes over to the railing,

523
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,353
which I have her little yellow arrow pointing to Nat,

524
00:24:53,774 --> 00:24:57,115
and she like calls Sarah over for cake, which is happening.

525
00:24:57,518 --> 00:25:01,941
upstairs. This is kind of a neat moment because it's like you're maybe as a player you're focused

526
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,604
on what Sarah's talking about to Odin and that's your full attention is focused on that

527
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:10,607
and then suddenly you hear this voice you know Nat calling out like hey like look over here

528
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:15,911
and you as the player will like shift usually and like look up see Nat calling to Sarah.

529
00:25:16,318 --> 00:25:17,999
and then see another group of characters

530
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,321
gathered up around the dining table.

531
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:22,503
And then that gives you a lot of information about,

532
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:25,206
oh, okay, so there's another part of the scene happening.

533
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:27,207
While I've been paying attention to Sarah,

534
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:29,950
maybe I should rewind and go see what Nat

535
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,271
was talking to those people about.

536
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:32,672
So that's sort of a nice moment

537
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:34,354
where the hub is really a space

538
00:25:34,374 --> 00:25:35,875
where you can kind of like see multiple

539
00:25:36,716 --> 00:25:38,237
nodes of conversation happening

540
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:40,579
and be made aware to go check out

541
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,260
another part of the scene later.

542
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,441
It's kind of nice.

543
00:25:44,013 --> 00:25:46,034
You guys want to hear a dorky level design thing about that?

544
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:48,816
It's a scripting thing, actually.

545
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:51,458
So you don't want to be able to hear everybody from everywhere.

546
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:55,121
Something that I think most developers don't really, well,

547
00:25:55,702 --> 00:25:56,883
anyway, in this kind of game, it's

548
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,464
not very common for you to have to really worry

549
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,266
about a lot of overlapping conversation.

550
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:02,026
But we did.

551
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,387
So it was like, how do we make it

552
00:26:03,407 --> 00:26:05,869
so you can hear people a little bit from far away,

553
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:07,370
but it's not just stepping on each other?

554
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:09,752
Some of that is our programmer, Hannah,

555
00:26:09,812 --> 00:26:11,093
put in a system where if you're.

556
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:13,144
looking at a character, they're louder,

557
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,465
which is nice if you look away from somebody,

558
00:26:15,485 --> 00:26:16,145
they get quieter.

559
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:20,166
But that doesn't really speak to something

560
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:21,626
like someone literally calling

561
00:26:21,826 --> 00:26:23,107
all the way across the space.

562
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:27,368
So you could do something smart and programmery to do that,

563
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:28,208
or you could do like we did,

564
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:30,188
which is when she yells,

565
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:33,469
we script her voice range to be twice as far,

566
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,590
and then we put it back to its normal range

567
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,230
when she's done.

568
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,090
Yeah, we do that in a bunch of spots.

569
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,171
With the like, yeah, the far away conversations

570
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:41,191
where people are like, hey.

571
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:44,152
Yeah, so don't overthink it sometimes.

572
00:26:44,212 --> 00:26:45,132
Just turn it up.

573
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:49,074
Yeah, so this worked out really well.

574
00:26:50,134 --> 00:26:51,094
And also if you think about it,

575
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,755
it would have felt sort of,

576
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:56,316
I think it would have been less rewarding

577
00:26:56,516 --> 00:26:58,457
given our mechanics if we had, for example,

578
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:01,018
had this playroom where Sarah is separated

579
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,439
by a hall and a door from the dining room

580
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:06,500
because then Nat would have had to walk down the hall

581
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,901
to get Sarah and the player wouldn't be able

582
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,442
to see the crowd at the dinner table.

583
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:14,507
Right, so this sort of hub structure where the spaces are interconnected and

584
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:18,389
looking into each other gives us the opportunity to make these moments where

585
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:19,950
you can see things in the distance like that.

586
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,033
Which wouldn't work as well with too many very separated rooms that don't look

587
00:27:26,073 --> 00:27:26,513
into each other.

588
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:36,636
So, obviously not every AR scene is going to have conversations that are always interconnected

589
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:38,297
like this and flowing in and out of each other.

590
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:43,400
Sometimes there's going to be very private moments that we want to isolate, or that the

591
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,321
characters would want to isolate themselves.

592
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:50,904
The screenshot I have up there is when Evie goes into her office, which is a private space,

593
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,745
and she takes something out of a drawer.

594
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:57,247
You can look at it, it's a photo of her sister, and she has this sort of private moment.

595
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:04,231
So it's for these private moments where characters are being more introspective

596
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:09,192
or having like a one-on-one conversation that it's useful to have the private

597
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:14,494
spaces be separated like we did on purpose sort of for the utilitarian aspect.

598
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:18,875
It also helps us sort of design scenes that can have private moments because we

599
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:24,417
have specific parts of the level that are designed to sort of make that possible.

600
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:29,605
We dubbed in some of the sound of constructing these levels

601
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:31,467
into the background of the talk for your pleasure.

602
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:32,088
Yeah, the dub.

603
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:34,771
The construction dub, not subbed.

604
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:42,540
So we found a lot of useful ways to design AR scenes that

605
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,302
made good use of the hub and spoke structure.

606
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:48,546
And there were still, wait, why did I?

607
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:51,411
I love it.

608
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:53,092
I love PowerPoints.

609
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:57,395
So, like I was saying, we found these useful ways

610
00:28:57,575 --> 00:29:00,737
to design levels that supported AR scenes

611
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:02,718
that could have both interconnected moments

612
00:29:02,778 --> 00:29:05,860
where characters are talking to each other in groups

613
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,841
and flowing in and out of conversations,

614
00:29:08,662 --> 00:29:10,743
and also the private stuff that happens

615
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,204
in these more private spaces.

616
00:29:12,324 --> 00:29:14,465
We had found all these ways to design the levels

617
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:15,926
to support that stuff, which was great.

618
00:29:16,793 --> 00:29:21,101
but we still had some elements of the level design

619
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,685
that had to adapt to our AR scene specifically.

620
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:26,430
So Tacoma is a station where people live.

621
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,355
So for example, there's a lot of tables and chairs and beds.

622
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:32,869
and various objects that the characters would naturally

623
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:34,350
have to interact with while they're going

624
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,370
about their daily lives.

625
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:39,373
Like, wouldn't it be weird if no one ever sat in a chair?

626
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,534
Like, that's just something people do,

627
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:42,835
so you would expect it to see

628
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,957
in these daily life scenes, right?

629
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:50,940
So we're a pretty small studio with one, one, one

630
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:54,463
full-time animator who animated almost all of it

631
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,204
with some help later on, which was awesome.

632
00:29:56,863 --> 00:30:02,966
but she did a great job and but it meant that once the AR scenes were animated

633
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:09,749
there couldn't be significant changes to like what the animations were because she was making a lot

634
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:15,011
of animations and had to keep going so we could you know ship the game so we want to stay on

635
00:30:15,051 --> 00:30:19,853
schedule and if a character sits on a rock like Clive does in the screenshot

636
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,626
That rock can't move.

637
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:24,807
The level designer put it there at one point,

638
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,048
Noelle animated everything specifically

639
00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:27,828
to line up with it.

640
00:30:28,268 --> 00:30:31,090
If we move it, like, she's not gonna update the animation.

641
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,271
That's on us.

642
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:36,612
So we had a lot of animation dependencies like that

643
00:30:36,832 --> 00:30:38,973
that were in communication with the level design

644
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:41,134
and that we as level designers had to work around

645
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:41,795
and be aware of.

646
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:44,804
So here's an editor screenshot.

647
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:48,486
If I was placing or moving objects or architecture,

648
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:52,068
I'd know that they were labeled as animation props,

649
00:30:52,168 --> 00:30:54,989
animation-dependent props, so I would know not to move them.

650
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,332
And sometimes you would also just watch a scene

651
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:02,192
to make sure you weren't placing something

652
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:03,453
in an awkward position that...

653
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,841
a character was already moving through.

654
00:31:07,142 --> 00:31:09,043
Like if I wanted to do some set decoration,

655
00:31:09,063 --> 00:31:10,465
I would have to make sure like,

656
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:12,967
don't put this like pile of garbage, right?

657
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:14,489
Where Evie's like walking,

658
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:15,610
because why would she walk through that?

659
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,431
She would trip over it.

660
00:31:17,212 --> 00:31:18,993
So we had to be very careful about stuff like that.

661
00:31:20,074 --> 00:31:21,996
Because these AR scenes were being animated

662
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:25,880
sort of simultaneously as we were like building these levels

663
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,021
and placing a lot of stuff.

664
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,863
So it was all happening in parallel, which was.

665
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:36,259
a lot. It was intense. So sometimes we actually took advantage of this effect. Like I was

666
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,521
talking about not wanting to place the garbage where Evie would clip through it while she's

667
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:42,902
walking through it, because that would be weird. Sometimes we actually took advantage

668
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:49,724
of that for narrative reasons, which was fun, because seeing a character clip through something

669
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:54,446
could give the player some information about the time when that AR scene actually took

670
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:54,726
place.

671
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:54,786
So...

672
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:04,125
Basically, it could help the player understand the timeline of the narrative through observation

673
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:09,815
of what objects were moved after the events in the AR scene occurred, or perhaps objects

674
00:32:09,855 --> 00:32:12,800
that had not moved since the AR scene had occurred.

675
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:21,258
So, for example, in Botany, here we have Sarah's leg clipping through the hose right at the

676
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:22,259
bottom there where her foot is.

677
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:29,042
And later on in the scene, you actually see Andrew setting up that very hose as part of

678
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:29,542
the scene.

679
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:33,264
He's sort of doing some maintenance to help the oxygen situation on the station.

680
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:37,786
So you can see him in this screenshot stepping over the same hose that she was

681
00:32:38,382 --> 00:32:39,543
formerly clipping through.

682
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:43,286
So while for the most part we tried to prevent

683
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,788
AR scene characters from clipping through stuff

684
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:49,030
in ugly ways, sometimes it was fun to provide

685
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,213
this kind of narrative detail where you could have

686
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:53,834
the situation, because if you think about it,

687
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:56,356
every level's always in cut scene mode,

688
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:59,739
but a lot of the environment is static like this hose.

689
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:01,440
So if you're watching it carefully,

690
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,582
you can kind of catch these weird moments

691
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:05,684
where it's like, oh yeah, this was moved during the scene

692
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:06,805
and I can kind of see that.

693
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:09,701
and what is the thing Andrew is actually touching.

694
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:11,722
It's kind of fun to show the player, like,

695
00:33:12,022 --> 00:33:14,363
this is an actual object that this character

696
00:33:14,423 --> 00:33:15,784
really did touch at some point.

697
00:33:18,466 --> 00:33:21,708
So, the environment really needs to be in conversation

698
00:33:21,948 --> 00:33:24,990
with these animations in both time and space.

699
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:27,251
based on this example I just gave.

700
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:31,332
So while the level design of the floor plan was done before,

701
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:33,133
like the paper maps and stuff was done

702
00:33:33,193 --> 00:33:34,773
before these animations existed,

703
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,214
we were still able to have our AR scenes

704
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:40,754
be a narrative conversation with the environment

705
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:43,795
using like set decoration moments like that

706
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:48,236
that were placed sort of later after the paper mapping

707
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,156
and gray blocking was done.

708
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:49,597
So that was fun.

709
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:56,679
So I want to go a little deeper into this time and space aspect of AR scenes,

710
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,359
being in conversation with the environment.

711
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:03,261
Because one of our big challenges was guiding players

712
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:05,962
to these things called AR desktops, which I have circled up there.

713
00:34:07,383 --> 00:34:11,624
AR desktops are the characters' computer desktops that they'll open from time

714
00:34:11,664 --> 00:34:13,765
to time at specific points in an AR scene.

715
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:16,466
And when I say desktop, I mean like literally like their computer

716
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:17,726
with their emails and stuff on it.

717
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:18,266
Like you can...

718
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:22,536
Frob, you can click whatever that thing,

719
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,917
the button in the air, and it opens their desktop

720
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:26,698
in your vision.

721
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,081
So, given the spatial nature of AR scenes,

722
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:35,782
this means an AR desktop is only accessible to a player

723
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:38,344
during a specific window of time during an AR scene.

724
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:43,726
So for example, Nat only opens that desktop

725
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:47,168
for like 30 seconds a minute into the scene.

726
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,222
and then she'll close it after it being open for a couple seconds.

727
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:55,967
Because that's the amount of time she takes in the scene to check her email or whatever she's doing.

728
00:34:57,549 --> 00:35:02,973
So, early in development we found that players were frequently missing out on these error desktops

729
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:06,597
entirely during playtests. They would just miss them, not see them,

730
00:35:06,657 --> 00:35:11,241
maybe be near it in a scene but be facing the wrong way for example, and just totally whiff on it.

731
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:14,098
and then would move on and just have no idea

732
00:35:14,118 --> 00:35:16,100
that there was all this extra story stuff

733
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,981
for them to discover, which is a problem for us.

734
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:21,743
So AR desktops often contain some

735
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:23,385
really great narrative beats,

736
00:35:23,765 --> 00:35:25,066
so we wanted to fix this issue.

737
00:35:25,846 --> 00:35:28,788
We had to learn how to guide the player to an AR desktop

738
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:32,531
at a specific time in a specific part of the level.

739
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,238
because otherwise they would just miss all the stuff.

740
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:39,780
So here is an image of one of the early era

741
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,402
desktop button iterations in our editor.

742
00:35:44,063 --> 00:35:46,184
And because the first approach we took to this

743
00:35:46,224 --> 00:35:48,445
was just like by relying on the buttons visuals.

744
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:50,966
And we were like, maybe if we make it eye catching enough,

745
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:53,187
like people will just see it easier,

746
00:35:53,207 --> 00:35:56,429
which is like kind of funny that that was our first approach

747
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:57,089
now that I think about it.

748
00:35:57,649 --> 00:36:00,952
because it didn't work because the whole problem was like sometimes people would just be in a

749
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:05,516
different part of the area or like not looking at it at all. So no matter how eye-catching it was,

750
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,979
they still weren't going to see it because they needed to be in a specific place

751
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,923
at a specific time. It wasn't an issue with the button being not obvious. It was an issue with

752
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:22,551
place and time. So we realized this and it was a key realization because

753
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:28,570
We looked at the AR desktop timeline, which I have like,

754
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,811
this is actually our first sketch of this idea,

755
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:32,091
which is funny, from our whiteboard.

756
00:36:32,472 --> 00:36:34,292
And that playing bar is like a rough sketch

757
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:36,033
of our AR scene timeline that appears

758
00:36:36,073 --> 00:36:37,714
at the bottom of the screen that you're using

759
00:36:37,774 --> 00:36:39,254
to fast forward and rewind.

760
00:36:40,195 --> 00:36:43,656
And we realized that had a lot of free space on it

761
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:45,897
that wasn't being used to convey any information.

762
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:50,407
And we were like, oh wait, we could give the player

763
00:36:50,448 --> 00:36:52,248
like some kind of hint on the timeline

764
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:54,949
as to when the desktops are appearing.

765
00:36:57,109 --> 00:37:02,790
So we are gonna switch to the next slide.

766
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,671
Here I've circled the AR desktop again.

767
00:37:08,112 --> 00:37:09,852
And I've circled this time the pips,

768
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:11,993
which are what sort of came from that realization

769
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,793
that the AR scene timeline could be used

770
00:37:13,813 --> 00:37:14,833
to convey this information.

771
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:18,904
So we tutorialized this early on and stuff,

772
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:20,826
but it actually worked out really naturally.

773
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:22,467
Most players pick up on it right away,

774
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:25,650
where it's like when you're scrubbing through the timeline,

775
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,033
those little bubbles will like inflate

776
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:31,595
and turn to their associated character's color

777
00:37:31,976 --> 00:37:33,797
when the desktop is active in the world,

778
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:36,800
and then they'll like deflate when the desktop is closed.

779
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:39,182
So players can kind of use that to be like.

780
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:42,605
okay how long is it open for, what character should I be looking for,

781
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:46,708
we didn't just rely on color, we have the characters

782
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:51,332
job icon on each one also to like double up on that information.

783
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,375
And so yeah that was a really great solution to be like

784
00:37:55,595 --> 00:37:58,898
here's a way to give the player a hint but not actually like

785
00:37:59,158 --> 00:38:02,241
give them like an in-world like quest marker or whatever where they're like

786
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,382
looking for it in the level like

787
00:38:03,728 --> 00:38:05,689
they just have the information of the timing

788
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:08,850
and then they do the exploration themselves to find it.

789
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,430
So that worked really well.

790
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:18,492
Another challenge we faced early on in Tacoma's development

791
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:20,432
that's related to the AR scenes

792
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:23,833
is that we wanted AR scenes and desktops

793
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:25,653
to be tied to progression in some way,

794
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:27,734
but we didn't know what that would be at first.

795
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,164
So we wanted to do, we tried some like traditional,

796
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:34,746
ah, no, I hate it.

797
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:36,548
Sorry.

798
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:39,312
We wanted to do some traditional progression at first

799
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:40,514
involving keys and locks,

800
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:43,017
because that's kind of what we were used to.

801
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:45,420
So we tried that first, and then through playtests,

802
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,361
we quickly learned that.

803
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:49,378
people would find keys in desktops.

804
00:38:49,398 --> 00:38:51,579
We put them in a lot of desktops early on.

805
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,541
And once players learned about that,

806
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:56,543
their whole goal was just to look for desktops.

807
00:38:56,863 --> 00:38:59,044
And they would just fast forward through the whole scene,

808
00:38:59,124 --> 00:39:01,946
not listen to anything, and just look for desktops,

809
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:03,488
because they were like, the keys are all here.

810
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:04,608
If I just find all the keys,

811
00:39:04,688 --> 00:39:06,089
I can progress through the video game,

812
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,530
and that makes me feel good.

813
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:09,252
And we were like, that's great,

814
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:12,774
but we want you to pay attention to our AR scenes,

815
00:39:13,194 --> 00:39:15,416
so we have to change how we think about progression.

816
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:21,920
to help the player actually want to engage with AR scenes in the story while also feeling

817
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,782
like they're making forward progress by doing that.

818
00:39:26,843 --> 00:39:35,169
So basically I pitched this thing called the Sync Device, which is, this is what it actually

819
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,009
looks like in the game.

820
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,290
And I was like...

821
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,205
So these AR scenes, narratively, are this data that's been left over on the station,

822
00:39:43,265 --> 00:39:46,289
like this kind of security camera-esque footage of what...

823
00:39:47,226 --> 00:39:48,667
these people were doing there.

824
00:39:49,508 --> 00:39:53,310
And we also have this concept of going to retrieve this AI,

825
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,692
which would probably involve some sort of download.

826
00:39:56,372 --> 00:40:00,095
So I was like, what if in each wing of the station,

827
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:02,637
you basically have a USB drive type thing

828
00:40:03,117 --> 00:40:04,558
that you're plugging into that wing

829
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:06,159
and syncing with the data there

830
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:08,681
as part of your mission to retrieve the AI?

831
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:10,122
You have to sync with each wing

832
00:40:10,162 --> 00:40:12,223
in order to access the AI in the end.

833
00:40:14,274 --> 00:40:16,874
And this I pitched as sort of like a.

834
00:40:18,097 --> 00:40:21,458
a progression system based on something that we understand from our real lives.

835
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:26,500
So like people playing video games are probably familiar with downloading stuff or using a

836
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:31,402
USB drive so they know when they see this plug into the wall and it starts ticking away

837
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:36,484
with its little percentage meter, players actually, we thought this wasn't going to

838
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:37,265
work but then it did.

839
00:40:37,325 --> 00:40:41,927
Players mostly are like, yeah, I see that download going, I'm going to go do other stuff

840
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:43,207
because downloads are slow.

841
00:40:44,488 --> 00:40:46,130
and we make it go slow on purpose

842
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,094
and don't give the player a clear understanding

843
00:40:49,154 --> 00:40:51,296
of what exactly is making it tick.

844
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:53,339
And they just assume it's gonna go

845
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:55,682
and they can come back later and it'll all be fine.

846
00:40:56,142 --> 00:40:57,043
And this actually works.

847
00:40:57,644 --> 00:40:59,446
And we're really.

848
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:04,788
surprised and happy about that because this sort of gave players the room and

849
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:12,815
time to move through space and counter the story while they're sort of like, okay that downloads going so like I guess I'll just chill and

850
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:14,937
learn what's going on with these characters.

851
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:20,062
So the sync device in Tacoma creates this illusion for the player

852
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:22,044
that the data is

853
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:24,371
is being synced.

854
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:26,953
And we don't have the sync device actually,

855
00:41:26,993 --> 00:41:29,035
like if you stand in front of it and look at it,

856
00:41:29,135 --> 00:41:31,297
it looks like it's ticking away steadily,

857
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:33,440
but it's actually under the hood not.

858
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,903
So the device's completion percentage,

859
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:37,944
which goes from zero to 100,

860
00:41:39,465 --> 00:41:42,488
is boosted every time you recover

861
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:44,290
or completely finish an AR scene.

862
00:41:44,743 --> 00:41:46,304
whenever you walk into a new room.

863
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:49,426
And there are a couple of other smaller factors

864
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:52,687
that make the percentage go up a certain amount.

865
00:41:53,988 --> 00:41:56,089
But we don't, there's nothing pinging the player about this.

866
00:41:56,129 --> 00:41:57,889
This is just happening purely under the hood.

867
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,771
So the boost based on player actions

868
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:03,592
helps those who explore it,

869
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:05,473
because they're exploring and then they come back

870
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:07,854
and they're like, oh, it's at 50% now.

871
00:42:08,574 --> 00:42:10,475
That's cool, I guess I'll go check out this other area

872
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,456
and it'll probably be done by the time I'm back,

873
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:13,856
because that seemed to go pretty fast.

874
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:22,360
It was also really important to us for the sync device to be located in a physical space

875
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,601
that was outside of the wing.

876
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,403
We talked about having a tracker.

877
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:31,306
So like the characters in the story, Amy, who you're playing as, also has her own AR

878
00:42:31,326 --> 00:42:34,068
desktop that you can pull up at any time and you get messages on it and stuff.

879
00:42:34,748 --> 00:42:39,491
And we talked about having a tracker that you could check on your desktop and we did

880
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:42,633
not do that because we knew that at that point...

881
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,941
It's interesting to make a progression system

882
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:51,061
that is explicitly about being opaque

883
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:53,422
and not knowable to the player.

884
00:42:54,222 --> 00:42:56,803
And so if you could be like, oh, it's at 10%,

885
00:42:57,403 --> 00:42:59,924
and then I recovered this scene, and now it's at 20%,

886
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,845
oh, I see, so I should just go game this

887
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:05,705
and find all the stuff to, then, again,

888
00:43:06,085 --> 00:43:08,186
it would be like when people were just going

889
00:43:08,246 --> 00:43:10,287
into desktops to try to find key codes.

890
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:13,208
you would say, oh, okay, so now how do I touch everything

891
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:15,169
to get this filled up as fast as possible?

892
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:18,510
Whereas when you actually have to walk down a hall

893
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,231
to a space and start exploring it

894
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:22,952
and then disengage from that to go back

895
00:43:23,032 --> 00:43:24,412
and check on what the progress is,

896
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:28,974
it both makes it less clear how to game it at all

897
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:31,075
and it puts it out of your head until you're like,

898
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:34,117
I think I'm done here, maybe I should go check that thing.

899
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:36,918
And then it gives you something to do

900
00:43:37,058 --> 00:43:38,758
to progress of your own volition

901
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:39,959
without there being like.

902
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:41,540
achievement unlocked, achievement unlocked,

903
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,843
just like popping up on your desktop as you play.

904
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:44,283
Right.

905
00:43:44,764 --> 00:43:47,086
And our sync device isn't very strict about this stuff,

906
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:50,809
so for most players, just by like going to each area,

907
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:53,892
like it'll just go to 100% without too much effort.

908
00:43:54,373 --> 00:43:57,215
So we wanted to make it sort of also easy to do,

909
00:43:57,536 --> 00:44:00,058
while still requiring some amount of like exploration

910
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:02,020
and engagement with AR scenes.

911
00:44:04,582 --> 00:44:08,870
So yeah it it was sort of designed to support these non-linear levels cause the sync device

912
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:13,138
doesn't really care what order you're encountering things in it just says engage with the

913
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:16,805
environment I'll take care of the rest. So that worked out really well for us.

914
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,340
There's the sync device again.

915
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,122
And now we have some hilarious, horrible art from me

916
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:24,503
that I drew of it when I was pitching it.

917
00:44:24,523 --> 00:44:27,004
So just some fun stuff to show you

918
00:44:27,504 --> 00:44:29,025
sort of where we started with this.

919
00:44:29,485 --> 00:44:31,366
We wanted to like, we like did think about

920
00:44:31,406 --> 00:44:33,007
how would Amy carry this around?

921
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:34,208
That was kind of fun.

922
00:44:34,348 --> 00:44:36,529
And then Kate, our environment artist,

923
00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:39,750
drew lovely concept art of it, which is great.

924
00:44:40,551 --> 00:44:41,271
So that's kind of what.

925
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:47,334
our initial design was for it. So yeah, that's sort of my end of things. And I'm

926
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:53,698
gonna pass it back to Steve and he's gonna talk more about stuff. Thanks.

927
00:44:53,738 --> 00:45:01,603
So you're doing a pair talk is great. You get so much more

928
00:45:01,643 --> 00:45:08,408
applause. So, you know, I think what Nina was talking about is, you know, from

929
00:45:08,588 --> 00:45:08,688
our

930
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:12,863
perspective, all of the elements of what we were doing

931
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:16,065
were really in conversation with each other.

932
00:45:16,085 --> 00:45:18,426
You know, the spaces are connected

933
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,567
to the fictional function of the station.

934
00:45:20,947 --> 00:45:23,408
The AR scenes are connected to the shape of the spaces.

935
00:45:23,808 --> 00:45:25,909
The player's HUD markers and the design

936
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:27,410
of the progression mechanic are connected

937
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,891
to how the player engages with the AR scenes

938
00:45:30,671 --> 00:45:33,052
and how they direct themselves through each area.

939
00:45:33,112 --> 00:45:34,933
And all of these elements support each other

940
00:45:34,953 --> 00:45:37,134
and they loop back into each other, right?

941
00:45:37,194 --> 00:45:37,854
Like the.

942
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:43,148
space determines the progression and the progression tells you something about the

943
00:45:43,168 --> 00:45:47,071
setting and the fiction and what your job is and that, anyway. So you know, this is,

944
00:45:47,271 --> 00:45:51,813
none of them stand on their own and they're all reinforcing each other. So from a

945
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:55,956
creative direction and player experience standpoint, that's really good. You know,

946
00:45:55,976 --> 00:45:59,918
we're talking about unifying all of these disparate elements and making them feel

947
00:45:59,938 --> 00:46:05,201
like they are a cohesive whole. And you know, this level of deep integration

948
00:46:05,241 --> 00:46:07,403
between all the parts of the story and the environment and the mechanics,

949
00:46:08,256 --> 00:46:11,940
it also presents a lot of its own production challenges.

950
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:15,863
So let's talk about the writing and recording

951
00:46:16,224 --> 00:46:18,906
and the implementation of an AR scene.

952
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:24,351
Something that was interesting, I think unique,

953
00:46:24,671 --> 00:46:30,437
about how we worked is we had to have our gray block layouts

954
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:31,998
of the station locked down.

955
00:46:32,513 --> 00:46:34,153
before I could write the story.

956
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:37,435
Because the playable spaces in the station

957
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:41,476
determined what would happen in each scene.

958
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:43,477
The scenes are about these characters

959
00:46:43,557 --> 00:46:44,677
moving through these spaces.

960
00:46:44,777 --> 00:46:47,518
So I needed to know the kitchen's over here,

961
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:49,859
and the conference room is over here, and the dining table

962
00:46:49,919 --> 00:46:51,660
is here, and the pool table is there before I even

963
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,361
wrote a scene about how Nat was going to call down

964
00:46:54,401 --> 00:46:56,582
to Sarah at the pool table at this point in the story.

965
00:46:56,602 --> 00:46:58,683
Pardon me.

966
00:46:59,465 --> 00:47:01,707
And I don't think that there are a lot of games

967
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,509
where the level layout being locked

968
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:08,893
is a dependency on starting to write the story of the game.

969
00:47:09,673 --> 00:47:11,174
But that meant that we had to iterate early

970
00:47:11,294 --> 00:47:14,797
and feel confident in, okay, these spaces make sense

971
00:47:15,257 --> 00:47:16,458
for the function of the space

972
00:47:16,518 --> 00:47:18,340
and for an explorable space,

973
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,642
fictionally and from the player's perspective,

974
00:47:22,123 --> 00:47:24,885
and feel confident in that.

975
00:47:24,985 --> 00:47:27,447
Because like Nina was saying about the animations,

976
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,482
having a dependency on just a prop being placed somewhere,

977
00:47:31,783 --> 00:47:33,524
the story had a dependency on the level design

978
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:34,986
not changing very much.

979
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:43,654
So up on screen is the paper map that Nina showed earlier,

980
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,556
the kind of final paper map of this section

981
00:47:45,576 --> 00:47:47,158
of the admin wing, and then.

982
00:47:47,688 --> 00:47:50,531
Next to that is a couple of pages from my notebook,

983
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:51,472
writing the game.

984
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:57,078
I always write all my stuff longhand in notebooks

985
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,381
and it can be really useful to, you know,

986
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:02,583
see revisions and see how things are connected.

987
00:48:02,623 --> 00:48:04,805
You can see a little bit of highlighter here.

988
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:06,447
Writing this game was...

989
00:48:08,693 --> 00:48:10,915
There's a lot of stuff that we did on this game

990
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:14,077
that we really didn't have any examples to look at,

991
00:48:14,418 --> 00:48:16,599
for the most part, so we just kind of had to figure it out.

992
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:21,243
So in Tacoma, the game is about there being

993
00:48:21,263 --> 00:48:24,706
these sections of scenes that branch off

994
00:48:24,746 --> 00:48:26,388
and happen in parallel and then come back together.

995
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:29,150
So there were parts where I would be writing a scene

996
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,592
and then highlight like.

997
00:48:30,938 --> 00:48:32,860
the blue part is this sub scene,

998
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,961
the green part is this sub scene,

999
00:48:33,981 --> 00:48:34,982
they're happening at the same time

1000
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:36,563
and then they come back together.

1001
00:48:37,343 --> 00:48:40,646
So the level design and the writing were really of a piece.

1002
00:48:43,048 --> 00:48:44,889
And you know, at that point,

1003
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,492
yeah, we kind of had to just like stick with it.

1004
00:48:48,612 --> 00:48:49,953
We had to go from there.

1005
00:48:50,573 --> 00:48:51,014
Five minutes?

1006
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:53,455
Well, I'll be goddamned.

1007
00:48:53,656 --> 00:48:53,976
All right.

1008
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:55,237
So because...

1009
00:48:59,966 --> 00:49:02,647
As noted, we had to lay out the space, write the stuff,

1010
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:04,028
and then we had to go record it.

1011
00:49:04,148 --> 00:49:07,209
And we recorded Tacoma ensemble style.

1012
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,290
There's Mike Suricks.

1013
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,611
I see him right there, our voice director.

1014
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:12,332
Mike Suricks is here.

1015
00:49:13,312 --> 00:49:14,493
We felt it was really important

1016
00:49:14,613 --> 00:49:16,434
because all of these scenes were about

1017
00:49:17,634 --> 00:49:18,955
characters being in a room together

1018
00:49:18,995 --> 00:49:21,316
and having discussions and being face-to-face

1019
00:49:21,356 --> 00:49:22,797
and having these intense moments.

1020
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,466
for us to record the game on a sound stage

1021
00:49:25,486 --> 00:49:28,028
with all the actors present performing the scenes together,

1022
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:30,489
which was fantastic.

1023
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:33,670
The actors were really excited about it

1024
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,151
because in games mostly it's one person in a booth

1025
00:49:36,211 --> 00:49:37,191
and another person in a booth

1026
00:49:37,212 --> 00:49:38,412
and them being able to perform this

1027
00:49:38,452 --> 00:49:41,213
basically as a stage play,

1028
00:49:42,154 --> 00:49:43,894
them being able to react to each other's energy

1029
00:49:44,455 --> 00:49:45,915
in the scene and everything was really exciting.

1030
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,558
But it also meant that we laid out the levels,

1031
00:49:48,598 --> 00:49:50,299
wrote the story, flew down to LA,

1032
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:52,139
got six actors together for two days

1033
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:54,099
and recorded the entire game.

1034
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:55,460
And we weren't gonna do that twice,

1035
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,160
so that had to stick as well.

1036
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,601
So we had, for people who have shipped larger games,

1037
00:50:01,141 --> 00:50:03,161
voice recording on Tacoma was locked

1038
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:05,301
14 months before we shipped.

1039
00:50:06,482 --> 00:50:10,002
Because our animator Noel had to animate

1040
00:50:10,662 --> 00:50:12,523
the fucking game based on those.

1041
00:50:13,183 --> 00:50:16,505
reads, so like, we could've done pickups,

1042
00:50:16,605 --> 00:50:18,726
you know, like small pickups, but we couldn't be like,

1043
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,427
you know what, this scene should, we should do,

1044
00:50:20,527 --> 00:50:21,828
this should be something different here,

1045
00:50:22,128 --> 00:50:23,909
because then, you know, Noelle had to wait

1046
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:27,312
until we had the final recordings to even really start,

1047
00:50:27,332 --> 00:50:28,612
you know, she could block out these scenes,

1048
00:50:28,652 --> 00:50:31,674
but to actually animate them, again, another dependency

1049
00:50:32,054 --> 00:50:35,376
on this whole stack of everything

1050
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:37,778
being related to each other, which is, you know,

1051
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:39,319
part of what Nina pointed out, but.

1052
00:50:40,779 --> 00:50:44,142
Something that we were really happy to be able to have is that

1053
00:50:45,424 --> 00:50:46,065
because

1054
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,969
Like Nina was saying that we're basically in cutscene mode all the time

1055
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:56,296
It meant it meant that the the animations could be very conversant with the environment. So we did a lot of

1056
00:50:56,978 --> 00:50:58,498
the characters touching the world.

1057
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,459
So in all of these screenshots,

1058
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:02,280
you can see Andrew's leaning on a rail

1059
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,420
and Evie runs her hand along this railing

1060
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,321
as she goes up the ramp

1061
00:51:05,401 --> 00:51:07,061
and Nat is sitting on the edge of a thing.

1062
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:10,002
And that's, at that point, another place

1063
00:51:10,123 --> 00:51:13,904
where the gray block influenced the story

1064
00:51:14,064 --> 00:51:15,825
and then the story influenced the animations

1065
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:18,165
and then the animations were touching a railing.

1066
00:51:18,506 --> 00:51:20,046
So if that railing was, for instance,

1067
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:21,747
gray blocked in when the animation was made

1068
00:51:21,827 --> 00:51:23,067
and then we put the mesh in,

1069
00:51:23,087 --> 00:51:24,928
the mesh had to match the gray block

1070
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:26,548
down to the centimeter.

1071
00:51:26,934 --> 00:51:29,456
or else the hand would now be floating or clipping

1072
00:51:29,576 --> 00:51:30,296
or blah, blah, blah.

1073
00:51:30,977 --> 00:51:32,698
And that went all the way down to things

1074
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,019
like placing this mug.

1075
00:51:34,179 --> 00:51:35,600
So at some point, we were like, we're

1076
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,881
going to have a jazz mug in the game

1077
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:39,783
because we had a jazz mug in Gone Home,

1078
00:51:39,803 --> 00:51:40,623
and that's important to us.

1079
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:45,827
So Noelle, our animator, was like, oh, OK,

1080
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:47,408
so this mug is here.

1081
00:51:48,419 --> 00:51:52,783
So how about Clive is carrying this mug and drinking from it

1082
00:51:53,003 --> 00:51:53,924
during the first part of the scene,

1083
00:51:53,984 --> 00:51:55,125
and he puts it there during the scene.

1084
00:51:55,165 --> 00:51:56,406
And so we were like, cool, that makes sense.

1085
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:57,867
And then at some point, we were play testing,

1086
00:51:57,927 --> 00:52:01,550
and we noticed that Clive puts the mug, like, he like.

1087
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:05,188
puts the mug down and his hand just goes through it.

1088
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:08,829
And it's like, there's no way for us to move the object

1089
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:12,570
in such a way that he wouldn't just do that,

1090
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,890
just knock that mug over.

1091
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,031
And so that was one of those points where it's like,

1092
00:52:17,371 --> 00:52:19,151
we do need to update that animation

1093
00:52:19,171 --> 00:52:20,552
because it's no way that it makes sense

1094
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:21,572
for this mug to be here.

1095
00:52:22,212 --> 00:52:22,893
But, you know, like,

1096
00:52:25,335 --> 00:52:27,717
so, you know, it's something like this where,

1097
00:52:27,737 --> 00:52:29,439
I guess the screenshot's a little dark,

1098
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,021
but we had a bunch of angled walls in the game,

1099
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:33,582
and, you know, those were gray-blocked in,

1100
00:52:33,622 --> 00:52:36,325
and then it was animated for Eevee to be leaning on this wall,

1101
00:52:36,345 --> 00:52:37,726
but when the wall mesh came in,

1102
00:52:38,126 --> 00:52:40,488
if the angle was a few degrees different.

1103
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:44,392
So those are these, like, little things where...

1104
00:52:44,964 --> 00:52:46,725
we intended to build an experience

1105
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:48,327
where everything was talking to everything else,

1106
00:52:48,647 --> 00:52:50,368
but that meant that everything was talking

1107
00:52:50,448 --> 00:52:51,209
to everything else.

1108
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,569
The geo talked to the writing,

1109
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,430
talked to the recording,

1110
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,251
talked to the animation,

1111
00:52:54,311 --> 00:52:55,472
which then once the animation was in,

1112
00:52:55,492 --> 00:52:56,392
it talked back to the geo

1113
00:52:56,432 --> 00:52:59,354
because the geo had to make sure

1114
00:52:59,374 --> 00:53:00,755
that it was consistent with the animation

1115
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:01,936
once it existed.

1116
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:07,917
So when you're starting out, you should try to fully consider all of the dependencies

1117
00:53:07,957 --> 00:53:11,418
that are involved in creating a unified design as early as you can.

1118
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:15,239
Not because you shouldn't do it, but because you should know what you're signing up for.

1119
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:21,540
And as I noted, we didn't have a lot of precedence for what we were doing, so we discovered a

1120
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:26,841
lot of this along the way, but I think there is valuable space for people to work in that

1121
00:53:26,861 --> 00:53:28,941
I think is easy not to do, which is the...

1122
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,350
mental projection of if I do this,

1123
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,430
what are the five steps later,

1124
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:36,890
and what's this gonna touch?

1125
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:39,851
It's easy to be like, if we do this, it'll be cool.

1126
00:53:39,971 --> 00:53:41,631
Or if we do this, it'll touch this one thing.

1127
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,252
But really kind of trying to do the visualization exercise

1128
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:47,833
of like, what is this going to lead all the way to?

1129
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:51,533
I think it'd be valuable even just so that you can

1130
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:53,454
expect those things before they happen

1131
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:55,914
instead of stumbling upon them when they do.

1132
00:53:55,934 --> 00:54:00,275
So, one minute.

1133
00:54:00,588 --> 00:54:04,971
That's good. Because I'm on my last idea. So we're talking about doing a lot of stuff that

1134
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:10,054
hasn't been done before. We're talking about doing, you know, getting away from a

1135
00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:16,458
traditional lock and key progression. But that said, we also did rely on those

1136
00:54:16,578 --> 00:54:24,163
traditional hierarchy of information or hierarchy of value approaches in

1137
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:27,125
supplemental information. So the central space is very interconnected.

1138
00:54:27,943 --> 00:54:29,384
They're based on these AR scenes,

1139
00:54:29,644 --> 00:54:32,325
but we also wanted to encourage and reward players

1140
00:54:32,365 --> 00:54:35,087
to fully explore all of our spaces,

1141
00:54:35,127 --> 00:54:37,328
including the side spaces that Nina was talking about.

1142
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:40,570
And that totally goes back to stuff that we've done before.

1143
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:43,311
We have keypad doors that lock off optional areas,

1144
00:54:43,772 --> 00:54:44,972
and it encourages the player to say,

1145
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:46,293
how am I going to find this keypad?

1146
00:54:47,305 --> 00:54:51,348
and when you get in there we have to reward the player. In a more traditional game that might be

1147
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:55,933
like some rare ammo or upgrade points or something in our case it was just extra

1148
00:54:55,973 --> 00:55:00,156
information that tells you more about the story because you did the work.

1149
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:04,171
to find it, but that isn't central to the player's experience,

1150
00:55:04,591 --> 00:55:07,912
but that uses a very traditional approach to hiding keys,

1151
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:14,454
making blocks be clear, rewarding you for doing the traditional level stuff

1152
00:55:15,174 --> 00:55:18,555
to get in there, but we have to think of it in terms of, again,

1153
00:55:19,036 --> 00:55:22,937
the writing goes back to, like, what part of the story are we going to put in here

1154
00:55:23,117 --> 00:55:26,258
that it's okay for the player to miss, but that they'll actually be excited about finding.

1155
00:55:27,478 --> 00:55:28,138
So, you know.

1156
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:32,764
For whatever you're working on, stuff that is traditional,

1157
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:37,467
I think, is worth relying on as appropriate,

1158
00:55:37,927 --> 00:55:40,509
even if it's not the new, fresh, exciting thing.

1159
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:42,790
Thank you very much.

1160
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,232
Vernina, Steve, Tacoma's gonna be in the IGF pavilion

1161
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:46,913
if you wanna play it.
