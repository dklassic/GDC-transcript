1
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:11,121
Everybody surviving GDC so far?

2
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:14,902
That's about how I feel.

3
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:21,383
The post-party day talks are always the interesting talks.

4
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:25,664
First a couple of housekeeping reminders.

5
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:33,906
Please remind attendees to fill out the session evaluation email they received from surveys.it and international.com after each session they attend.

6
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:38,147
Also, if we want to just continue this afterwards,

7
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:39,869
there is a wrap-up room afterwards,

8
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:43,091
although this, I believe, is the last audio session.

9
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,071
This is the wrap-up room.

10
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:45,112
Headlining.

11
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:48,254
Yeah, definitely.

12
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:49,915
Obviously, turn your phones to vibrate.

13
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:52,677
It's always embarrassing when an audio person

14
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:57,420
has their phone ring in a talk and whatnot.

15
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:58,421
I'm very excited.

16
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:00,963
I was asked to moderate this panel set up

17
00:01:01,023 --> 00:01:03,685
by some of the folks at Smule.

18
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:09,013
And we kind of were trying to figure out what really made sense in terms of interactivity

19
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,974
and the kinds of stuff that goes on.

20
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:15,736
And we ended up with this notion of where does the game end and the instrument begin, right?

21
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:21,558
There's a whole lot of interesting things that, you know, device, you know, massive amounts

22
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:26,640
of compute power, you know, from historical standpoint right here can give you as well

23
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,362
as the kind of cool things that are, you know, happen whether it's Morpheus or HoloLens or.

24
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:36,787
Magic Leap or Connect or all of these sorts of other kinds of things or plastic guitars.

25
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:43,591
And so it really essentially has opened up a whole big genre of categories of...

26
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:45,333
I don't even know what to call them.

27
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:49,375
You know, Mew applications or something like that.

28
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:53,498
Cool ways to make music and have compute power really help you do it.

29
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:55,820
So I would like...

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,003
We have an incredible set of expertise on the panel in terms of this goes.

31
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:01,023
Matt Bosch, John Moldover.

32
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:02,737
Nick and David.

33
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:04,938
And I'd like you to go down and introduce yourselves

34
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,918
and just say a little bit about who you are

35
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,159
and what you've been working on.

36
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,960
Yeah, my name's Matt Bach.

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,680
I work at Harmonix Music Systems.

38
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:16,541
I got my start working in rock band hardware,

39
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,542
designing drums and guitars and making sure that they worked,

40
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:22,283
and then worked on all the rock band pro stuff.

41
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,544
And then from there, I started prototyping for Dance Central.

42
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:32,158
I worked on all three of the Dance Central games, and most recently I creative-directed Fantasia Music Evolved,

43
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:35,983
a collaboration between Harmonix and Disney Interactive.

44
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:39,246
It's a reimagining of the classic 1940s film Fantasia.

45
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:53,839
I'm David Young, I'm at Smule. I am on our content team, which is the team responsible for all of the music or really any other content that comes out in all of our different music apps.

46
00:02:55,339 --> 00:03:02,481
I currently handle all of our pre-production, scheduling, licensing, which is a whole fun thing if you want to ask me about.

47
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:10,942
And all of that for our music releases, and before that I was a content producer for Smule for over a year.

48
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:15,182
There are a lot of variables to consider when you're making effects in a web application.

49
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:28,879
I love those instead, but that's okay.

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,243
Yeah, so I work at Ubisoft San Francisco.

51
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,247
Ubisoft San Francisco is a newer studio.

52
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:36,729
It's actually right down the street,

53
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,834
3rd and Brandon, but we're mostly known for Rocksmith.

54
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:42,857
And as far as my involvement with Rocksmith...

55
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:47,756
I was working on it from the beginning, before it actually even was at Ubisoft.

56
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:52,237
So I was one of the original people working on it, designed a lot of the game along with

57
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:55,497
Paul Cross and now Hiko, the producer on the project.

58
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:57,598
Three of us kind of built up the studio from there.

59
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:02,579
Amazing experience coming out with Rocksmith 1 and then Rocksmith 2014, the most recent

60
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:02,799
one.

61
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,019
And that's what I'm still currently doing.

62
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,680
Rocksmith is still alive and we're releasing DLC 3-5 songs every week.

63
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:13,656
Yeah, we'll get into more of that later.

64
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:18,858
Hi, John Mulliver from Smule, senior programmer over there.

65
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:22,360
And we're neighbors with this guy, so we're in town.

66
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:26,102
And hello to you guys in the front on the left.

67
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:28,663
You can feel free to come forward.

68
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,940
Let's see, so I work on Magic Piano at Smule.

69
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,242
I do a lot of that and sing karaoke.

70
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:41,965
And before that, I've been at a bunch of game studios around the Bay Area.

71
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:44,447
I worked on DJ Hero for Activision for a bit.

72
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:51,291
And nowadays I'm working on music videos at Smule, which is kind of cool.

73
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:54,773
And, yeah, that's good for now.

74
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:59,596
So how have people who have been working directly on technology that...

75
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,752
You know, sort of empowers people to learn music or make music in ways that we don't think, you know.

76
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:11,633
Normally music is you take piano lessons and you, or you study the violin or you, you know, do marching band or whatever.

77
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:18,895
But it seems like devices and some of the early Smule and current Smule products are very, you know,

78
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:21,736
let's make it easy for somebody to get up and sound something cool.

79
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:28,258
So how, what kind of, you know, thought or empowerment goes into making these kinds of things such they, they're...

80
00:05:28,648 --> 00:05:33,572
cool instrument musically, but at the same time, not just something where it does so

81
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:38,697
much of the work for you that you're really just kind of pressing a bunch of presets.

82
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:45,483
I think whatever application you're using, whatever input devices, whether you're just

83
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:50,748
touching the iPad or whether you have a controller or an actual instrument or even just your

84
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,269
voice, whatever your input device is.

85
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:57,696
The point of it, like you said, is to get somebody participating with the music as quickly as possible.

86
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:03,161
At least coming from learning guitar, this is like a classic problem with guitar.

87
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:07,424
You go out, you buy a guitar, for some reason you're inspired, maybe you're in college or something,

88
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,807
and you bring it home, and you have a really hard time making the chords,

89
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,449
and you don't know what you're doing, and you go and look at tablature, and that doesn't...

90
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,492
help you. It's harder to read it. And maybe you do know exactly what you're supposed to

91
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:22,815
do with Tablature and you take the time to put into it, but you're really disconnected

92
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,937
from the goal. And the goal is just like, I want to play along with a Bon Jovi song

93
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,459
right now. I don't want to wait months and months and months.

94
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:36,039
And sure enough, you pour months and months and months into the guitar, and you're still not really getting to what you want.

95
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,061
Like, as far as our goal, and I believe that this was the same for you guys,

96
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:47,145
it's about what is the least amount of effort that I need to be instantly be able to play with the music and connect to the music,

97
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:48,165
because that's what I want to do.

98
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:52,287
And then once you get that, you've actually inspired somebody, you're motivating them,

99
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:55,188
and then you can take them to do whatever else you wanted.

100
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:04,125
So, I'm going to go ahead and pick it up.

101
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:13,212
I agree mostly. I think our battle is on that front end where

102
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:19,197
you wanted to make it super easy for somebody, but, and you mentioned in your original question

103
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:19,958
is, do you make it...

104
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:28,199
it's so easy that you're like oh I'm just pressing buttons, or I'm interfacing it exactly when it's telling me to interface

105
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,361
and then at that point I'm just, I have a set of commands and I have to follow them

106
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:35,363
I'm thinking about more about following the commands than I'm actually expressing

107
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,826
the idea of music and the expressivity, which was a...

108
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:44,728
You guys' presentation yesterday kind of touched on a little bit which was cool

109
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:48,970
and so, yeah that's like, with Magic Piano and John can talk more about that but its like

110
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,812
the, you know, as the little fireflies drop down, they'll wait for the player and, you

111
00:07:55,833 --> 00:08:01,475
know, there's the ebb and flow of actually having some control over tempo and dynamics

112
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:02,616
and stuff of that nature.

113
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:08,018
Yeah, I think we found, like Nick said, like getting there quickly is super critical. For

114
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:13,641
the majority of our users, at least, who are not like, I want to learn guitar, they're

115
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:14,521
like, you know,

116
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:22,525
mobile app users, maybe gamers, music lovers, it does not take very much for them to feel,

117
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:26,886
like get some ownership over it. It really was enough for them just to be like, oh I

118
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:31,307
can change this. Like I have some amount of control. Yeah it's not intimidating at all.

119
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:35,587
Right, right. Definitely don't want to intimidate them for sure. But it, it didn't, it doesn't

120
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:42,209
take a whole lot to give them that, that feeling. Um, of course like, um, exactly how you do

121
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:43,529
that, um, is actually.

122
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:48,168
you know, a lot of work, the presentation, and like teaching people what seems like it should be

123
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:53,730
super simple interface, like tapping a glowing thing on the screen.

124
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,651
Actually, it doesn't always elicit that from everyone.

125
00:08:56,771 --> 00:09:01,113
That's probably the bigger challenge, I think, actually, is how do you like educate people

126
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:05,814
like from nothing, with as little friction as possible.

127
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:09,375
Spent a lot of time on that, actually.

128
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:13,963
In Fantasia we're building a lot of new gestural instruments

129
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:18,607
kind of based on some vague concepts of things like chaos paths, the like,

130
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:22,250
looking at accessible tools that people already use for these types of purposes.

131
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,193
And one of the things that we found that really helps people understand that

132
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:28,694
they've put in some arbitrary gestures that's super duper accessible,

133
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,695
they're just moving their body.

134
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:33,138
But the thing that changes that from just being some arbitrary movement

135
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:34,899
to making them feel like they have some authorship

136
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,961
is really just sort of abusing repetition.

137
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:40,563
We will record the thing that you do and just keep playing it back to you.

138
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,313
And you hear something once or twice in a row,

139
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:45,896
you start to recognize what its melodic contours are,

140
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,899
and then you start to feel a little bit of ownership of it.

141
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:50,362
And so we really used the joy of repetition

142
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:52,905
to give people a sense of ownership and authorship

143
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:53,846
over the thing that they were doing.

144
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,307
And that's cool, too.

145
00:09:55,327 --> 00:10:00,173
I think all of our applications are going to a point where

146
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,608
You want to do the thing where you're getting somebody participating right away, right?

147
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:05,529
Because you want them to connect with the music and have fun.

148
00:10:05,609 --> 00:10:13,093
And it's especially important for Rocksmith because these are people who have probably given up guitar once before, right?

149
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:18,576
I mean, a lot of our user base were people who had guitars in their closet and they just couldn't connect to it before.

150
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:23,040
But after you get them actually playing, connecting, and playing their favorite songs and relating to it somehow,

151
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:28,564
you want to go that other step. You want to say, you're not just repeating music that's coming at you,

152
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:33,388
you're feeling like the notes you're playing are your own. You're feeling agency over what you're doing,

153
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:37,811
and you actually are putting in more. You're starting to actually make your own stuff.

154
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:43,956
Like a decision we made early on with the first Rocksmith is we don't, like, knock your...

155
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:06,028
They're giving you places to start putting in more and start putting in more of you into

156
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:06,148
it.

157
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:10,889
And in fact, a lot of your apps where you're actually sharing things and sending them back

158
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:14,270
and forth between friends, it's implied, right?

159
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,470
You're supposed to be doing that.

160
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,710
It's like, I've sent this to you.

161
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,232
I didn't just copy someone else's homework and send it to you.

162
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:23,452
I actually sang on this thing.

163
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:23,892
It's me.

164
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:24,592
It's my voice.

165
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:26,513
I put in my own little, like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

166
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:27,973
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

167
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:29,453
Now it's your turn to do something with it.

168
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:34,976
That stuff is implied and actually makes the experience so much better.

169
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:45,061
Well, and it also goes to the fact that music, yes, it can be a personal, secluded thing if you want it to be,

170
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:52,884
but in the grand history of humanity and culture, music is a very collective experience that you want to share

171
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:56,186
and interact with people even across cultural and language boundaries.

172
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,401
That's a big reason why we push that share stuff besides the fact that you have more engagement.

173
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:06,283
And it's totally an important thing to get to that point because I definitely remember when I started playing music,

174
00:12:06,823 --> 00:12:12,885
it was not about playing with other people. It was about hair in my face, in my bedroom, lights off.

175
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:21,289
Not playing in front of anybody, like I definitely had stage fright and didn't really want to communicate with anybody.

176
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:25,711
Branching through that as a musician is really, really important because that's the point, right?

177
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:29,111
Like you said, it is a social event. You're supposed to be playing with people.

178
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:37,153
You think that's one of the reasons that some of the social music games, like rock bands specifically,

179
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:43,155
there was a phenomenon where all of a sudden there were lots of soccer mom rock band groups.

180
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:49,193
And I think back a little bit to, you know, if you watch Amadeus, what do people do at parties?

181
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:53,175
They play piano and sing, or play harpsichord and sing.

182
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:59,178
So do you think this, you know, talking about the sort of solo experience versus the group experience,

183
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,800
is that something that's made much easier with the devices we have now?

184
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,602
Or is that, is it almost sort of, in the way Facebook is sort of isolating it,

185
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:08,403
are we going the other way on that a little bit?

186
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,225
Right, is being social, making music, doing something on your own and sharing it?

187
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,006
Or is it more of a...

188
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:21,769
collaborative thing in art. Do you see that being reflected in products or the way things

189
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:26,912
would go in the future in terms of digital music making, digital personal music making?

190
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:33,795
Right out the gate I guess I'll say that our mission statement is connecting people through

191
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:43,580
music. So we are completely on that. So yes. Yes and yes. Absolutely. I'll let you guys

192
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:51,138
I think in general there's something that has kind of like a little bit happened with

193
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:57,544
our society where we don't connect with music as well as we maybe used to.

194
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,427
Like you said, like, oh, people used to have fancy parties where they got around and played

195
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,868
piano and everyone sang, right?

196
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:06,677
Like, nowadays, or at least especially when I was growing up,

197
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:10,138
like, I was really insecure about singing and didn't, like, openly do it.

198
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,259
And, like, there wasn't, there wasn't, like, a lot of musically coming together

199
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:16,100
and things besides, like, the required, like, singing classes

200
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,800
in, like, elementary school or something like that.

201
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,501
Um, I think in general, like, for some reason, we've kind of, like,

202
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,381
branched away from that.

203
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,722
Not necessarily with just singing or playing instruments,

204
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,923
but even, like, connecting over music in general.

205
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:27,543
Like, um...

206
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:32,883
Like, America used to be the central location for swing dancing.

207
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,468
You know, like, that's a way of connecting with music.

208
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:38,871
Like literally, you're dancing on the beat, right?

209
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:41,135
We used to be the hub for that.

210
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:42,777
Now we're not.

211
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:43,799
Sweden is.

212
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:48,525
All the other countries across the world have been like,

213
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:49,766
swing dancing's so great.

214
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:51,046
You guys came up with this.

215
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:53,907
It's like, yes, we don't do it anymore.

216
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:58,009
I mean, we do, which is in a very, very niche group

217
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,170
of what it used to be.

218
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:05,332
So I really like seeing types of mediums and types

219
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:08,673
of applications that actually connect people back together

220
00:15:10,554 --> 00:15:11,334
musically like this.

221
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:13,375
Oh, go ahead.

222
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:16,319
I think rock band is certainly a communal experience.

223
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,460
I think to a degree that the fear of singing in front of people

224
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,103
is part of the reason why rock band is a great product and a great experience, right?

225
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:28,285
You get one person doing karaoke and three other people also get to participate

226
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,427
in what rock band is without having to take the risk of singing.

227
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:33,288
I think that's certainly a big part of it.

228
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:37,650
As we've continued to build all of our games, multiplayer is a thing that we

229
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:43,012
kind of insist on having and we want to create shared musical experiences in your living room.

230
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:50,635
And people do a lot of sharing of their sort of skilled performances in rock band or the like on YouTube.

231
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:55,257
I tend not to think about that necessarily as musical sharing so much as proficiency sharing,

232
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:56,598
kind of bragging to a degree.

233
00:15:57,273 --> 00:16:02,197
But with Fantasia, because every single performance that you're doing is generative in some way,

234
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:05,079
we have opened up YouTube sharing for that.

235
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:08,962
And you do hear very, very different interpretations of all these different songs.

236
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,783
People feel a bit of ownership over them,

237
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:13,645
kind of looking at the YouTube comments and responding to each one.

238
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:17,188
And I think they're connecting with people

239
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:22,692
through the kind of unique spin that they've taken on a given song

240
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:25,074
and spreading that out across the Internet.

241
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:29,006
It's possible for them to do that in their own living room

242
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,206
with their own friend as well.

243
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:33,248
And all of the sort of different compositional elements in Fantasia

244
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:35,130
we've also built for multiplayer.

245
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,211
So you can do it in a sort of trading force kind of way

246
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:39,232
where you're creating half the phrase

247
00:16:39,252 --> 00:16:40,553
and the person creates the other half of the phrase.

248
00:16:41,074 --> 00:16:44,076
And those moments, we always see people look together,

249
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:45,777
smile after they've done that,

250
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:47,258
and then go back to playing the song

251
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,059
because they built something together.

252
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,921
And, you know, the best feeling, I think,

253
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:53,702
like of ever being in a band is just...

254
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:58,044
The drummer starts, bass player comes in, guitar player comes in, and someone starts singing.

255
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:00,826
And when you're a part of that, it just feels amazing.

256
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,307
Even if your band is absolutely terrible, even if the drummer's not playing in time at all,

257
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:10,170
that sort of feeling of all coming together towards the same ends is just ineffable.

258
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:10,731
It's amazing.

259
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:13,412
I was about to say that's exactly like...

260
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:18,055
You know, all of us up here are musically inclined,

261
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:20,436
so we've all played music with a lot of people,

262
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:21,776
but there's a moment where...

263
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,308
Everyone in the band looks at each other.

264
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:27,349
It's like, that moment that just happened, and is happening right now.

265
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:28,609
That, like, we all just clicked.

266
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:31,910
It was the most awesome music thing that we all just innately did together.

267
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,291
It was this crazy, connective thing.

268
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:35,131
And good luck recording that moment, too.

269
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:35,811
Yeah, I know.

270
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:37,992
It was definitely awkward, or, yeah.

271
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:43,454
I sort of think of those bursts of SoundCloud comments as the internet doing this, right?

272
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:47,215
Like, the producer is, and has everyone kind of looking at them at this moment,

273
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:47,755
because, you know...

274
00:17:48,397 --> 00:17:50,919
They've picked out some particular part of the song that they like,

275
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,181
and you see a million comments pop up at the same time.

276
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:56,144
You know, if it's a dubstep song, that's definitively where the drop is.

277
00:17:56,184 --> 00:18:00,708
But in other types of music, it tends to be where interesting quality changes have happened.

278
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:04,852
And I think you get that almost same feeling of eye contact, of validation.

279
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:09,716
And you kind of are getting to do it in a larger and larger group, which is kind of amazing.

280
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:14,549
That's a funny thing. I haven't thought about looking at dubstep songs on SoundCloud and being like,

281
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:17,870
there's just one location where all of the comments are going to be.

282
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,230
For sure.

283
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,390
Oh, the beat dropped here.

284
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,310
There's some analytics here, for sure.

285
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:25,992
Yeah, right. Back to Brian's original point, I wanted to say, in the simulator,

286
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:30,413
like, the Magic Piano app, I think, is a more solitary experience.

287
00:18:30,673 --> 00:18:33,693
But I don't think it's, like, further, I don't know, isolating people.

288
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:42,779
I think that there's those people that want to play in their bedroom and they just want to get into a song and do it in a, you know, personal way and just get something out.

289
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,542
But yeah, I think that phone app technology can indeed be like putting people in their own virtual world and taking them away from the moment.

290
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:56,443
We've all experienced that. There's probably some of you out there checking your Facebook right now, and that's cool.

291
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:58,664
I was doing that during the talks earlier.

292
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:01,532
and that's cool.

293
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:08,236
It's alright, if you want to do it, that's fine, I guess.

294
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:11,559
And you could levy that criticism on our apps,

295
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,261
but I thought the interesting thing about Sing, actually,

296
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,122
and like these guys were saying,

297
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,024
the coolest musical social experience, I think,

298
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:20,986
is being with people in the same space,

299
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,367
that shared moment, is the magicalness of it.

300
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:26,209
So, what can you do with mobile?

301
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:27,210
What can you do with an app?

302
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,333
Well, there's some other spaces you can still be social with in a different way.

303
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:34,215
And I think with the sing karaoke,

304
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:38,878
we get people to sing who like maybe aren't quite outgoing enough

305
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:41,740
to actually go to a karaoke bar or they don't have time to.

306
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,662
They don't want to get in front of a room with other people, strangers they don't know,

307
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:46,823
but they really like singing those songs

308
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:49,205
and they'll sing them when they're comfortable in their own room

309
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,306
and then they'll share that recording.

310
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:51,807
And so...

311
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:52,727
In the bathroom where they sound good.

312
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:55,892
Yeah, you gotta get the, you know, gotta get it dialed.

313
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:58,075
You gotta get the side reflections of the bathroom, that's ideal.

314
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:03,904
Yeah, but they'll share it and, you know, I listen to these people singing the songs a lot.

315
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:06,651
And they're terrible sometimes, or average,

316
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:08,052
because that's what people are.

317
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,113
But they really just enjoy the music.

318
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:12,815
And it is a genuine social connection.

319
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:15,057
And they'll share them, and their girlfriend or whatever

320
00:20:15,077 --> 00:20:16,138
will sing the duet part.

321
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:17,319
And it's pretty cool.

322
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,742
It's really exciting to me to see just ordinary people

323
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:23,623
making music, doing their own thing,

324
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:27,787
not worrying about, am I as good as my favorite musician?

325
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:28,847
No, it's not about that.

326
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:30,789
We're just making music.

327
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:38,059
So before Brian hits us up with another question and departs us from this, you said something about recording, which was really interesting.

328
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:43,347
Or you were talking about that moment when you're all playing together and you look and you're like, yeah, this is the moment.

329
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,831
And then I said something actually about recording.

330
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:47,952
If you try to record that moment, it's gone.

331
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,075
If you guys are musicians and you've ever jammed with people,

332
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:54,416
you'll know this thing where you try to record your jams,

333
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:54,877
because you're like,

334
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:56,758
they're so brilliant, we come up with the coolest stuff.

335
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:59,640
When you put down a tape recorder or anything,

336
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,741
it's nothing. You've got no ideas.

337
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:02,802
It's only garbage.

338
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,643
And you will never capture that moment.

339
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:07,705
And I think it's really interesting.

340
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:09,846
We had this same kind of thing with...

341
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:12,659
It's just kind of capturing these moments in general.

342
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,820
And like, when you are impromptu just doing something with someone else

343
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,741
and you don't have a lot of expectation, you don't think about it that much,

344
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:21,461
those are when those moments happen.

345
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,542
It's almost like they happen outside of the recording.

346
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:24,502
It has nothing to do with it.

347
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:29,283
It's the fact that it is just like a spontaneously kind of combined thing

348
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:33,044
that makes those magic moments actually come to the front

349
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,604
and makes you actually experience them.

350
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:37,799
Yeah, recording.

351
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,520
And recording in general is just more of like a solitary experience.

352
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,682
Like to a degree. I mean, okay, so I've been playing guitar for like 17 years, 18 years at this point.

353
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:51,302
But I also took a long detour into electronic music.

354
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,383
And that is solitary recording experience.

355
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:59,384
That is like, I am up all night because I had like a triple shot latte.

356
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:03,445
And it's four in the morning and I'm tweaking knobs on this synth for way too long.

357
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:05,806
Like, I really like...

358
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:13,370
The idea of this doing it on the fly, of even the stuff that happened with the later games

359
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,852
where you could just drop in in the middle of playing, like, oh, I want to play with

360
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:17,732
my friends, just add them now.

361
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:22,755
It's that really informalness makes these moments kind of happen instead of pushing

362
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:25,817
it to a more structured experience like recording would be.

363
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:31,239
I think it is nice that recording does enable folks who might have a lot of performance

364
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,042
anxiety to be able to do their performance on their own terms, in their own time.

365
00:22:35,502 --> 00:22:37,063
and then share that with the rest of the world.

366
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:42,347
And I think that's a really nice aspect of app-based karaoke, right?

367
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:47,730
There's so much about the karaoke experience that is just in being you,

368
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,311
being the person singing that song.

369
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:53,334
But, you know, if you are paralyzed with fear at the point in time

370
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:54,775
when you have to sing in front of other people,

371
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:58,157
it's not really a thing you can do anymore, certainly.

372
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:02,578
I think there's plenty of singers out there who kick everyone else out of the studio when

373
00:23:02,618 --> 00:23:04,359
it's time to do their vocal takes.

374
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:06,580
It's a thing where you want to be alone with yourself.

375
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,963
But it's nice that those alone moments can be shared and that you don't have to have

376
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,385
a microphone set up and preamps and whatever else.

377
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:17,886
You're just giving people that.

378
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:21,988
It's a thing that I'm sure we've all done, recorded and shared music, but enabling other

379
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:22,789
people to do that is amazing.

380
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:25,830
We saw a really interesting, I guess...

381
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:31,073
representation of this when our, so we have a sing,

382
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:34,356
sing is our karaoke app and karaoke can kind

383
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:38,579
of be a bad word and a divisive word.

384
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:41,040
And so, you know, we're trying to do everything

385
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,522
we can in the app to make it not the

386
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,884
side of karaoke that people hate, which is the

387
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,345
drunk person in a bar slaughtering a song and

388
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,227
everyone like wincing and listening to it.

389
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:51,628
These are the times I like karaoke.

390
00:23:53,437 --> 00:23:59,704
It has its moments, but I don't know if I need to sit down and hear that as a musician.

391
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:10,274
But we didn't have video up until October, and once the video switch happened, you don't have to perform on video.

392
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:19,162
The entire element of, well, at least I can still hide behind my, you know, my profile image and just record this.

393
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:24,644
Now it's like, oh, now you're going to see me in my bedroom, like, performing, and it's messy, and I...

394
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:28,486
A lot of people, like, do their makeup and do their hair and get everything ready, and...

395
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:40,687
Just the interesting seeing the ways that people got more engaged because they're on video and then the other people that got less engaged and just stuck to still doing audio only because they were intimidated by being on video.

396
00:24:41,027 --> 00:24:48,990
It's different personality types. Some people like to perform more and like that aspect and are artists in that realm and will put a lot more energy in there.

397
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:58,353
Whereas other people are just more of that don't like performing but still like music so you get the like in the closet recording musicians like myself.

398
00:25:00,714 --> 00:25:03,995
You know, the people who say, like, okay, the rest of the band, I'm kicking you out of the studio.

399
00:25:04,056 --> 00:25:06,477
Or, I'm recording my vocal tracks at home to get this done.

400
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:11,499
Yeah, different personality types interfacing with music in different ways.

401
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:19,222
And the cool thing that I see in our apps is that we have inroads for all of those different types.

402
00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:23,283
So there is, like, an inroad for the person who wants to record by themselves.

403
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:28,085
While there is also a way for everyone to just play together and not worry about recording and stuff like that.

404
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:30,128
More roads.

405
00:25:30,768 --> 00:25:31,528
More roads.

406
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,630
There's a way in which just proposing that this thing is a game

407
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,150
takes the stakes down.

408
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,451
Like if you're telling someone, OK, you

409
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:44,273
need to perform a musical phrase, write some music, versus, hey,

410
00:25:44,313 --> 00:25:45,473
just like, we're playing this game.

411
00:25:45,513 --> 00:25:46,133
It's all cool.

412
00:25:46,173 --> 00:25:46,814
Don't worry about it.

413
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:50,535
There's a way in which it just gives you an excuse to be expressive.

414
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:53,296
And that kind of framing of that musical experience, I think,

415
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:56,497
just makes the whole thing less intimidating simply

416
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:58,858
by framing it in a different way for the player.

417
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:03,157
Also, too, when you say it's a game, people don't mind being told what to do at first.

418
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:11,739
You know, whereas if you're doing an artistic endeavor of whatever sort, like, I don't know

419
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:17,220
if you, how many of you took a lot of art in high school, but it seems like even the

420
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,101
people in high school are like, oh, you should be drawing this.

421
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:19,861
This is our project.

422
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:20,741
Oh, no, I want to draw that.

423
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:21,841
I want to draw this other thing.

424
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:26,202
You know, it's like suddenly, oh, this is who I'm supposed to be, so I'm going to do

425
00:26:26,222 --> 00:26:26,883
whatever I want.

426
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:30,844
Gamers are very used to saying, hold X to run.

427
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:33,425
Okay, thanks for telling me that. I'll hold X to run.

428
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:35,486
This doesn't have anything to do about me being artistic.

429
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:36,687
I just need to know the tools.

430
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:40,528
Which is ironically what they were trying to teach you in art class in the first place.

431
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:45,070
You mentioned making an artistic expression.

432
00:26:45,551 --> 00:26:48,072
Is that the ultimate goal of your products?

433
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:53,134
Is there a continuum between artistic expression and have a really good time?

434
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:55,395
Or is that just play around with stuff?

435
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:57,036
Different personalities, different goals.

436
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,452
Or is this something you're, is one of the challenges sort of trying to morph people

437
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:06,435
somewhere along that continuum and have them start as fun and before they know it they're

438
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:07,936
doing something kind of artistic?

439
00:27:08,116 --> 00:27:14,440
So something that we definitely did with the, with Rocksmith 2014, with the second Rocksmith,

440
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,762
is that we didn't try to assume where people wanted to go or what they wanted to do.

441
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:22,103
or how they wanted to learn, or what they should be, or anything.

442
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:24,144
We opened it up so that...

443
00:27:24,604 --> 00:27:27,766
and we made the UI very much kind of follow this flow,

444
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:30,487
where if you just want to learn a song, let's say you're a guitar player,

445
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:32,527
or you want to learn how to play guitar, you just want to learn a song.

446
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,468
Great. Let's say you want to go do lessons first.

447
00:27:34,508 --> 00:27:35,189
You can do that first.

448
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:36,669
Let's say you don't even care about any of that,

449
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:37,970
you just want to play mini-games.

450
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,610
We let you go wherever.

451
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:44,134
And then the system adapted around that to say, okay, they chose this song, they're doing

452
00:27:44,154 --> 00:27:46,576
this, they're doing this, this means that they kind of want these things, they kind

453
00:27:46,596 --> 00:27:50,859
of want to go this direction, let me start teaching them this way, let me start suggesting

454
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:54,462
things to them this way and tell them about other places in the game that they can go.

455
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:59,366
To answer your question, it's like different personality types are after different things,

456
00:27:59,506 --> 00:27:59,946
right?

457
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:00,787
And it's like the...

458
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:17,277
I guess the person who would just want to get every note correct and play it with exactly the right tone and exactly the right way and reproduce this thing as accurately as possible would be in our terms somewhere along the lines of the completest, right?

459
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:24,641
Where in a normal game they would be the person who's like, I beat every mission, I beat every side mission, everything is perfect, I've done everything I possibly can.

460
00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:30,359
Whereas there are other people who will play a song, maybe not learn all of it, like maybe

461
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:34,162
kind of improvise or screw around on top of it, maybe afterwards turn off the game and

462
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:36,805
like take that little bit and turn it to a song of their own.

463
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:38,947
Different goals for different people.

464
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:44,311
And we didn't really, with Rocksmith 2014 we left it open so we didn't make any assumptions

465
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:46,393
about who you were and what you wanted to do.

466
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:50,717
We let you kind of go with it and guided you along the way to your goals.

467
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:57,394
The mission statement of Harmonix is to offer non-musicians the experience of making music.

468
00:28:57,654 --> 00:29:00,196
I think over the continuum of the various Harmonix products,

469
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:06,100
we started with a joystick-based jazz freestyle product called The Axe.

470
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,181
It was really, really early on in Harmonix days.

471
00:29:08,862 --> 00:29:12,664
And then from there, we really focused on performance simulation.

472
00:29:13,705 --> 00:29:20,470
I think Fantasia was the moment when we got back to the aspect of sharing the process of making music.

473
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:21,978
with a broad population.

474
00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:25,742
That certainly has been, I think, an overarching goal, an overarching agenda for the entirety

475
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:26,242
of the company.

476
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:30,166
We think we were hugely successful with things like Rock Band of sharing the feeling of performing

477
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:33,971
music but it's a quite different thing to share the feeling of ownership and pride that

478
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:39,877
you might get when you have done a particular unique thing that only you could have done.

479
00:29:39,897 --> 00:29:43,120
And so certainly as we're going through the process of building Fantasia.

480
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:51,204
We're trying to figure out what types of interactions would net sufficient complexity such that the outcomes would be unique every single time.

481
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:53,125
There are millions upon millions of outcomes.

482
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:58,232
It was really hard to paint outside of the lines.

483
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:01,795
Essentially, what we did is take a lot of what we understand,

484
00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:04,818
the rules that bind western music,

485
00:30:05,438 --> 00:30:07,440
make the system know those rules,

486
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:11,023
and not ever let people do things that are outside of those rules.

487
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:13,986
So we do allow people to make this sort of artistic expression.

488
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:16,728
It's certainly a thing that we think is core to that game,

489
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:17,949
core to the promise of that game.

490
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,413
But we lower the stakes by making it very difficult.

491
00:30:22,673 --> 00:30:26,835
and it's not impossible to make what sounds like a mistake, what is traditionally a mistake.

492
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,215
Make it hard for them to sound bad.

493
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:32,838
Put any of yourself into this and we're going to make it sound good to some degree.

494
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:38,480
That is something that I feel music games are going in the direction of

495
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,861
and can do more and more and more of.

496
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:43,122
Because right now you see there's a lot, especially on your phone,

497
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,364
if you download a lot of music making apps for the phone,

498
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:50,246
there's very few of them that are actually geared towards games.

499
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,787
and make music and have fun?

500
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:54,448
There are a couple, don't let me say that there's not.

501
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:57,429
But you'll very quickly run into the area where you're like,

502
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:01,131
whoa, I downloaded a DAW, a digital audio workstation,

503
00:31:01,171 --> 00:31:03,092
like Pro Tools or Logic basically is on my phone.

504
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:04,132
All the buttons are super small.

505
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:06,153
Okay, I've gone over the deep end.

506
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:08,974
That's why I like stuff.

507
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:13,657
I was talking to David before this about Smule's rap app,

508
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,099
where you just record your voice saying anything,

509
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,361
and then it takes a little bit of processing time

510
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:19,482
and then turns it into a rap.

511
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:20,883
And they have a video online.

512
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:24,725
where I don't know the guy's name, but he was doing a

513
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:31,993
Beavis and Butthead Cornholio and just like reporter just reciting Cornholio almost like Shakespearean, you know

514
00:31:32,994 --> 00:31:35,336
And then it just turned it into a rap and I'm like, oh, that's great

515
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:38,980
It's doing a lot of stuff you put in whatever input whatever piece of yourself

516
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:42,324
Right that you want to put in doesn't have to be Beavis and Butthead can be whatever

517
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,877
And then it takes that and actually turns it into a song afterwards.

518
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:47,278
And you can see all of the...

519
00:31:47,318 --> 00:31:49,340
You can start to hear all of the intelligent, like,

520
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,321
oh, yeah, we're grabbing this.

521
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:51,382
That's clearly the same as that.

522
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:52,243
We're going to make a phrase out of this.

523
00:31:52,263 --> 00:31:53,284
We're going to make a phrase out of this.

524
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:55,846
They don't know what we did, but we made a song out of it.

525
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:57,808
You know, like that type of,

526
00:31:58,148 --> 00:32:03,233
you can't screw this up ways of making music is great

527
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:04,594
because I feel like there's a lot of...

528
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:10,538
In general, I mean, we've faced a lot of this with Rocksmith, but there's a lot of intimidation

529
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:13,501
to playing an instrument or making a song.

530
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:17,244
If you just put a guitar in somebody's hands and say, play your own song immediately, and

531
00:32:17,264 --> 00:32:18,606
they've never played before, like, that's it.

532
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,367
They're never going to play guitar again.

533
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:22,930
You have to approach it very carefully.

534
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:26,558
I think there are lessons that are coming from not only from games,

535
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:30,839
but also from DAW and hardware manufacturers and the like.

536
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:32,720
You look at things like Ableton Push

537
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,201
or the most recent set of complete keyboards.

538
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,962
A lot of these features are just to get rid of any of those exact same types of mistakes.

539
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:42,663
You sort of set your push grid to exactly the scale that you want.

540
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:46,284
Now you're dealing with what kind of was a piano,

541
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:49,825
but now is a subset of the keys that you would want to play.

542
00:32:50,757 --> 00:32:55,739
It's a thing that's useful for people that are musicians and could ignore those notes,

543
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,681
but they know they aren't going to need them because their song is in one key, it's hanging out there.

544
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:06,345
I think those types of accessible interfaces are happening both on the instrument manufacturing side.

545
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:07,646
and from the game side.

546
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,306
There's interesting places where they meet in the middle.

547
00:33:09,366 --> 00:33:10,727
I think we've seen a lot of cool products,

548
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:13,567
things like Cosmic DJs, a game I really love.

549
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:15,148
It's a game where you sequence little things

550
00:33:15,168 --> 00:33:17,109
and they'll build a song for you.

551
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:19,709
Fract has these similar types of creative elements.

552
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,471
And I think seeing music technology move in that direction

553
00:33:25,691 --> 00:33:27,692
as music games move in that direction,

554
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:29,513
it seems like there's a really generative

555
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:31,973
and interesting space forming in between those two things.

556
00:33:32,934 --> 00:33:33,714
It's not something I...

557
00:33:35,002 --> 00:33:49,999
We have anything that solves that in any way, but I worry a little bit that going too far in this direction eliminates the possibility for a casual music person that's using any one of our products to experience music either for the first time or on the side, and that's not their main thing.

558
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:55,285
The happy accidents that happen when you don't have those restrictions.

559
00:33:56,154 --> 00:34:00,359
Sitting down at a piano and accidentally plunking that wrong note, but then being like,

560
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:04,703
wow, hold on, that was actually really cool if I just like change this thing.

561
00:34:04,803 --> 00:34:08,808
And all of a sudden you're in this totally new area and it was all because of a happy accident.

562
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:13,633
I think a lot of great moments in music happen out of happy accidents.

563
00:34:13,853 --> 00:34:14,493
It's too different.

564
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:16,094
Yeah, you're right.

565
00:34:16,274 --> 00:34:17,814
We've, uh...

566
00:34:17,894 --> 00:34:21,756
Back to your initial question, like, that continuum, we're on the continuum, we start

567
00:34:21,816 --> 00:34:25,937
at having a good time, we need to make sure everyone's there, and that seems to be kind

568
00:34:25,957 --> 00:34:28,678
of like the bottom line, literally the bottom line.

569
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:30,239
And then where does it get to?

570
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,699
Artistic expression?

571
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,281
Well, we've kind of capped it by making sure everything sounds good and there's happy accidents

572
00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:36,801
don't happen.

573
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,302
So we've, like, limited that universe of what you can do.

574
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,322
artistic is a pretty strong word. I don't think we ever use that, right?

575
00:34:43,442 --> 00:34:46,204
It's kind of scary. I regretted saying it when I said it.

576
00:34:46,704 --> 00:34:50,447
No, it's good though. I appreciate it. But yeah, it is...

577
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:54,549
I think you're absolutely right and that's a problem.

578
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,830
Are there people who are like losing?

579
00:34:58,067 --> 00:35:01,730
yeah I can take negative feedback. I don't need my stuff to always sound good.

580
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,573
You know? I can deal. Like are we just losing all those people?

581
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:08,795
Some people can take negative feedback, some people can't take negative feedback very well.

582
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:13,499
There's kind of two philosophies on this. This isn't just in music,

583
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,682
and I'm so glad I have a segue to talk about this, but like,

584
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:21,205
there's a lot of suggestive media out there now, right? Or suggesting media.

585
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:24,628
Like Netflix, like your Facebook timeline.

586
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:30,416
like Hulu, there's plenty of other things that suggest to you what you want.

587
00:35:30,436 --> 00:35:33,840
And the more and more stuff you go in that direction,

588
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,022
and the more and more stuff you buy,

589
00:35:35,062 --> 00:35:37,725
the more and more radicalized you end up getting.

590
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:41,310
And it really kind of narrows your focus on the world.

591
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:49,125
So this is kind of like becomes a problem because like I think a general philosophy is you want to be a well-rounded person.

592
00:35:49,165 --> 00:35:52,967
The more ways you have to enjoy life, the more of a well-rounded person you are,

593
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:56,609
the more chances are that you're going to enjoy life or enjoy the thing that you're doing.

594
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:02,112
Destiny just gave a talk where they were talking about this and I'm obsessed with the game, sorry.

595
00:36:03,553 --> 00:36:06,156
But they were talking about this and they talked about their goal.

596
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:08,298
They were doing all of this data mining on their users,

597
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:11,060
and their goal was to make people well-rounded players.

598
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,923
Because then if one of their venues kind of dropped off,

599
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,885
if it's like, oh, my friend stopped playing,

600
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:17,867
now they don't stop playing.

601
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:19,729
They have so many other ways of doing this, right?

602
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:21,430
And it's kind of like the same thing with music.

603
00:36:23,072 --> 00:36:26,976
In this talk of like, where do you let the happy accident happen?

604
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:30,044
and where do you guide the person to the happy accident, right?

605
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:35,286
I think in general, music has been, like music and music games have been a little bit behind

606
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,386
the curve of getting there.

607
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:42,789
I think like, I don't know, I think we have a little bit more of a way to go until we

608
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:48,151
get to the Facebook newsfeed point where it's like, wow, we have radicalized people to an

609
00:36:48,191 --> 00:36:48,991
insane degree.

610
00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:51,572
They don't know what notes sound like out of the major scale.

611
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:53,513
We need to just throw in some Locrian.

612
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:55,154
We need to just shake them up, you know?

613
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:59,857
I don't think we're there yet, although I am totally behind what you're saying.

614
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,079
Why do we need to do that? Why do we need to shake them up?

615
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:04,620
What if they're happy just listening to major chords?

616
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,423
Oh sure, and most people will be, and that's totally fine.

617
00:37:08,463 --> 00:37:12,106
But in general, like, and you know, that was the complaint people had with Destiny.

618
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:14,027
I don't want to play as a titan, I'm a warlock.

619
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:16,149
I'm like, why did you give me a titan helmet, damn it?

620
00:37:18,712 --> 00:37:25,642
In general, I really have a philosophy that it's a goal to be a more well-rounded person, just in general.

621
00:37:25,802 --> 00:37:30,309
It will give you more of a way to enjoy life, enjoy music, right?

622
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:32,753
Like something that I did when I was in music school.

623
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:39,476
If I found a genre of music I didn't like, I'd just put it on and listen to it and try to figure it out.

624
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:43,718
I really wasn't into reggae when I was in high school, just really not.

625
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:47,139
It took me a long time to figure out how to get into reggae.

626
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:51,761
I wouldn't say it's my favorite thing, but the thing is I understand now.

627
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:56,703
I feel like, especially with music in general, it's so polarizing.

628
00:37:56,763 --> 00:38:00,024
Metal fans are metal fans. Blues fans are blues fans.

629
00:38:01,568 --> 00:38:09,896
There's things to enjoy on both sides, and the merging of that only makes your users more robust to the stuff you have to offer them in the first place.

630
00:38:11,237 --> 00:38:16,822
What is better in us projecting musical experiences and giving people interfaces?

631
00:38:18,236 --> 00:38:22,698
blitz, and I don't like, I can't do that wrong, I don't even know that wrong node exists because

632
00:38:22,738 --> 00:38:28,860
I don't know that that's a scale. Uh, versus people who, oh no, I want to know all of the

633
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:35,082
dark secrets of music, and like I want all 12 node, no I want, you know, there's the,

634
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:35,462
there's the.

635
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:37,645
There's different kinds of people.

636
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:39,907
You can have these three notes right now.

637
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:42,090
Later on, we'll give you some more notes.

638
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,632
It's like the Oreo experiment.

639
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:48,917
DLC. You can pay for those extra notes in the scale.

640
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:53,282
The piano as an instrument has internalized just as much of Western music logic as anything else.

641
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,733
Like, we're saying, oh, here's all this open possibility, right?

642
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,716
But there's plenty of frequencies that exist in between the notes and the piano.

643
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:03,360
A piano dictates to you what kind of music you're going to make,

644
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,803
like any sort of app or any sort of thing we're designing.

645
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:08,306
And I think, far be it for me, personally,

646
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:11,770
to be able to say what the bounds of artistic expression are and...

647
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:16,498
to suggest that some particular type of musical complexity

648
00:39:16,598 --> 00:39:18,779
makes for more valid or more well-rounded work.

649
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,004
From my perspective, I love a lot of weird and strange novel genres of music

650
00:39:24,044 --> 00:39:29,628
that exist, sort of gamelan, but there's contemporary music like, say, Jersey Club.

651
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:31,510
Electronic classical noise music.

652
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,570
Built contemporary.

653
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:34,392
For 12 minutes, and you're like...

654
00:39:36,702 --> 00:39:38,743
In a 15.4 setup, yeah.

655
00:39:38,863 --> 00:39:42,005
Right, in a 15.4.

656
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:47,507
There was a performance space down here a while ago that was so awesome, so awesome,

657
00:39:47,527 --> 00:39:48,788
but it was the most niche thing ever.

658
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:51,629
I forget, I think it was, I forget the name of the studio,

659
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:55,251
but it was a performance space for really, really specific artists,

660
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:59,192
and it was this room about this size, and there were projectors all along the side,

661
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:02,074
so it was like a full 360 view, and it was, yeah, 15.4.

662
00:40:03,447 --> 00:40:03,527
a

663
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:06,909
radios turned up and he was just mixing five different radios and it has nothing to do

664
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:08,030
with what we're talking about.

665
00:40:28,664 --> 00:40:33,907
John Stuart Mills, the founder of utilitarianism, was a really interesting thinker.

666
00:40:33,947 --> 00:40:36,609
And at some point in time in his life, he decided he was going to commit suicide.

667
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:39,611
And the reason he wanted to commit suicide was because he'd done some math.

668
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:42,532
He looked at the notes that existed that we could hear,

669
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,894
and the bounds that he thought music had,

670
00:40:46,355 --> 00:40:48,516
the types of instruments that could be played, etc., etc.

671
00:40:48,736 --> 00:40:51,738
And he realized that there was a mathematical formula he could build

672
00:40:51,758 --> 00:40:53,579
that would create all the music that would ever exist.

673
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,540
And he was like, it's not worth it, I'm getting out of here.

674
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,862
And I think what he misses is that music is bigger than that, right?

675
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:02,462
We certainly have the option to have all sorts of timbre,

676
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:04,103
we have vocal performances,

677
00:41:04,143 --> 00:41:06,724
we have a lot of opportunities for specific...

678
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:10,945
or for specificity that exist outside of musical complexity.

679
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:13,286
And I think when, you know, you read a lot of the things of like,

680
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:15,967
oh, music is narrowing and all music sounds the same now,

681
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:18,728
and you can see New York Times articles about this like maybe once a year.

682
00:41:19,232 --> 00:41:25,181
I think we don't give enough attention to what timbre means, and what sampling means,

683
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:28,386
and what calling back to previous types of music means.

684
00:41:28,706 --> 00:41:32,672
I think there's no way we can ever run out of musical possibility, and I think that

685
00:41:35,381 --> 00:41:39,624
The same notion that underpins the idea that we could run out of musical possibility

686
00:41:39,985 --> 00:41:42,367
is the same kind of strange notion of saying,

687
00:41:42,607 --> 00:41:46,670
oh, we need to give people this much space to express themselves.

688
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,493
One cannot run out of musical possibility within their lifetime.

689
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:54,236
So, quick thing on that is that,

690
00:41:54,256 --> 00:41:57,499
all right, let's look at where music is heading in the,

691
00:41:57,579 --> 00:41:59,641
that's a loaded topic, absolutely, but...

692
00:42:01,207 --> 00:42:04,109
It, tambour is a huge, huge part of that.

693
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:08,711
To the point that, we've talked a lot so far on this panel about just pitch.

694
00:42:09,412 --> 00:42:14,815
But if we're talking about guiding users and allowing experience back and forth, I think

695
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:22,019
tambour and especially in like the upping of the limit of people's, you know, the general

696
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:27,902
public's acceptance of like harsh sounds, and then you get into the whole semantics

697
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,823
of what do you describe.

698
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:36,047
as and all that stuff. But, how do we incorporate the idea of musical expression through

699
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:40,269
timbre more than just simplistic pitch and rhythmic constructs?

700
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:46,473
We got, does everybody know what timbre is? Yes? This seems, it's a,a small audience who

701
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:49,995
really knows what they're talking about as far as music goes, so we're not going to

702
00:42:50,055 --> 00:42:55,458
explain timbre. But, um, yeah no it's, it's the difference between uh, uh, uh, something

703
00:42:56,128 --> 00:42:59,950
It's the difference between one style of music and another, like all of the different timbres of instruments.

704
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:04,694
A lot of the times the notes are the same, the rhythms are the same, the content is the same.

705
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:09,437
You can even have the production be the same, but the overall sounds of what the instruments are making

706
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:14,960
connect to people in different ways to an incredibly polarizing point, which is silly.

707
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,623
Because it's a harmonic spectrum that you're not even identifying notes in.

708
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:28,896
That was something where there was this visceral connection between a human gesture and the

709
00:43:28,976 --> 00:43:31,078
timbre that comes out of it.

710
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:36,762
So in a sense it would seem like you have the ability, sitting here in your chairs at

711
00:43:36,802 --> 00:43:39,384
work, to sort of have influence on these things.

712
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:42,867
Is that something you directly think about?

713
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:47,831
Or are you more heavily pitch-focused in figuring out how to make happy mistakes, because most

714
00:43:48,051 --> 00:43:50,273
musical mistakes are very unhappy mistakes?

715
00:43:51,620 --> 00:44:02,107
I'll say we've been very much pitch-centric with all of our recent stuff, and I can't really talk to the future of stuff, but I don't know. John?

716
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:16,616
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting to put it in those terms, but we are very pitch-centric. I mean, we... I've been pushing for the drums app for a while, man. I want the DJ Drums Producer app, but it's not coming this year.

717
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:29,274
But yes, I think Timbers is not quite, I don't know, it's not in the consciousness yet in that way, you know, for better or for worse.

718
00:44:30,475 --> 00:44:33,798
It is to the degree of like, I mean, the instrument that you're...

719
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:36,965
like you have an interest for example.

720
00:44:37,265 --> 00:44:40,106
Like it like in session mode in Rocksmith you get to choose between the

721
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:43,448
different guitars and some of them actually share riffs, some of them are

722
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:47,390
literally playing the same thing. So the difference between, not all of them, we have a ton of riffs

723
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:50,652
but, the difference between one instrument and another instrument could

724
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:54,214
just literally be the tone that we put on the chain, basically the amp that they're going through.

725
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:57,534
But that's enough to make you go, yeah, that's my metal guitar.

726
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:58,795
That's the one I'm playing with.

727
00:44:58,835 --> 00:44:59,836
That's what I relate to.

728
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:03,017
I just wanted to say I absolutely

729
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:04,338
love the Ocarina app.

730
00:45:04,378 --> 00:45:06,319
I remember the first iPhone that I got,

731
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,540
I don't know if it came out on the original

732
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,621
or how early it came out.

733
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:11,502
I don't exactly remember.

734
00:45:12,602 --> 00:45:18,426
I was playing with it for so long, for hours, and I flipped over to the other view and realized

735
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:22,509
that there was the world and I could listen to other people and immediately got freaked

736
00:45:22,669 --> 00:45:28,833
out that someone could have been listening to my horrible, horrible, happy accidents.

737
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:36,795
But it was also another moment of being really like, that was when I saw like, oh man, this is such a cool thing.

738
00:45:36,815 --> 00:45:38,656
I'm actually like connected to all these other people.

739
00:45:39,016 --> 00:45:42,777
I can listen to this random girl in Japan play the Zelda theme perfectly.

740
00:45:42,797 --> 00:45:45,777
Which drove me crazy because I couldn't do it.

741
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:51,278
But I, I, just that was like a moment of seeing like, wow, this is where, this is where music is going.

742
00:45:51,298 --> 00:45:53,659
Like actually being able to connect with people again in this way.

743
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:54,479
Yeah.

744
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:57,940
The Ocarina, by the way, it's like a flute basically.

745
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,380
It is that flute in The Legend of Zelda.

746
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:00,480
Yeah.

747
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:02,788
I can't reproduce the sound.

748
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:04,151
I'm not going to try, but...

749
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,707
So, like, with AutoRap and with, say, like,

750
00:46:07,827 --> 00:46:10,548
effects loadouts that you're doing in Rocksmith,

751
00:46:10,688 --> 00:46:12,589
I think there's an aspect that you are,

752
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:14,970
to which you're taking genre conventions

753
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,831
and kind of formalizing them

754
00:46:17,051 --> 00:46:19,531
and then letting people sort of reflect those back at them.

755
00:46:20,312 --> 00:46:23,993
How much do you, like, put into trying to understand

756
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:25,854
the kinds of guitar sounds that you want to have

757
00:46:25,914 --> 00:46:27,494
and how those are sort of related to genre?

758
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:30,755
And how much does sort of genre convention impact

759
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,296
the kind of stuff that Shmuel's making?

760
00:46:32,867 --> 00:46:37,533
So, uh, at least at Rocksmith we have a guy, Brendan West, who is like the gear...

761
00:46:39,225 --> 00:46:44,828
He's got any band that you bring up with him, he knows what piece of gear they used, how

762
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,448
they used it, how they wired it together.

763
00:46:46,729 --> 00:46:50,110
And that's super important for Rocksmith because we have all the individual pieces of it, right?

764
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:52,191
And we call them authentic tones.

765
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:56,073
We call them authentic cones because we do an incredible amount of research to make sure

766
00:46:56,133 --> 00:47:01,236
that what you're putting in there, whether it's licensed gear or something that, you

767
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,617
know, it represents gear that they used.

768
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:32,427
is as accurate as possible. So we know like, oh, this distortion pedal literally did come before that wah, literally did do this, and like we actually look at video evidence and stuff, so it's very important. We don't really make any assumptions like, metal guitarists use this, or, you know, these type of classic rock guitarists use these. We go to the source and say, this is how it was. They were using this amp. And like for the licensed gear that we do have in game, we hook them up with those. You know, it's like they were using that 1969 Marshall with the

769
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,501
with a slanted cab in this configuration with the microphone position like that.

770
00:47:39,762 --> 00:47:44,704
It's, that is a great question because in AutoRap we had something where

771
00:47:45,984 --> 00:47:51,166
the app was very like the project managers were very protective.

772
00:47:51,206 --> 00:47:56,308
Like no it's only gonna be hip hop and like R&B and content and stuff that is very

773
00:47:56,328 --> 00:48:00,210
you can quantize rap to really easily and then there's a hook that you

774
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,630
that auto tunes to in the choruses.

775
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:07,536
And then just recently we started flipping it. We put all about that bass in auto-rap.

776
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:14,260
We have country tunes in auto-rap. And taking stuff that never had rapping associated with

777
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:20,084
it in any way and allowing the algorithm that's exactly the same to chop up someone's vocals

778
00:48:20,884 --> 00:48:25,307
and now that Florida Georgia Line song is totally a rap song.

779
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:30,286
and we didn't change anything to the structure of the song except for adding the vocal element.

780
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:33,388
And it was super cool to see that and they've actually been super popular,

781
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:35,830
though it's impossible to gauge really is that just because

782
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:39,412
All About That Bass was the number one song for three months.

783
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:40,412
Yeah, enough.

784
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:44,955
In general, music allows you a lot of awesome

785
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:47,757
oh my god WTF moments, right?

786
00:48:48,097 --> 00:48:51,739
Like, one of my favorite bands a couple years ago,

787
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:53,460
it's not a band, it's a guy, Girl Talk.

788
00:48:54,260 --> 00:49:02,866
And he just, he went and using Ableton, Ableton Live, the empowering a generation to make a style of music that would have never existed otherwise,

789
00:49:03,906 --> 00:49:11,131
hacked up all of these songs and just put them together and blended all between them and made incredibly intelligent, like, quick blends between stuff.

790
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:17,795
And if you ever listen to it, it's like an album, like, it's like an hour and a half of just straight nothing but constant, like...

791
00:49:18,635 --> 00:49:22,438
only the hits dance music that is just blending to it. So it's mashup stuff.

792
00:49:22,478 --> 00:49:26,982
But like, yeah, I mean, it's an hour and a half and then you're like, done.

793
00:49:28,563 --> 00:49:36,568
But having those, being able to combine things in hilarious or like ways that you wouldn't have expected is like a huge part about music.

794
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:39,030
Like that's why with Rocksmith with session mode.

795
00:49:39,613 --> 00:49:41,335
It's a mode where you get to play with an AI band.

796
00:49:41,435 --> 00:49:44,278
You can hook it up however you want and play with it, and they actually listen and adapt to you.

797
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:45,299
This is the short of it.

798
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,823
But you have 76 instruments to kind of choose between and hook them up however you want.

799
00:49:50,164 --> 00:49:57,371
So it's like, yeah, we organized them into genres that were, again, genres we derived from the gear that we know that people use.

800
00:49:57,691 --> 00:50:01,195
But at the same time, you can put the metal guitar with the upright bass and the...

801
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:05,581
and the world percussion drums and then with a click if you want to play with a click for

802
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:09,304
some reason or with a kazoo or with wind you know like you can combine this however you

803
00:50:09,364 --> 00:50:14,227
want and then set it in harmonic minor and make the weirdest most epic kind of emo thing

804
00:50:14,548 --> 00:50:18,490
possible and it's it's hilarious like giving people the ability to do that it's like it's

805
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:23,794
another way of connecting to music I mean you guys know the the hilarity of the musician

806
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:24,435
joke right?

807
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:26,262
that the average person doesn't get.

808
00:50:26,282 --> 00:50:27,683
The punchline is,

809
00:50:27,783 --> 00:50:29,564
and then he was using the Pentatonic minor.

810
00:50:29,604 --> 00:50:34,766
It's like, oh my God.

811
00:50:34,786 --> 00:50:36,707
To get back to that question,

812
00:50:36,727 --> 00:50:38,087
David, could you answer maybe

813
00:50:38,548 --> 00:50:40,749
how much does the genre drive...

814
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,510
Probably at least you could tell about the content releases, right?

815
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,571
We must think about that a lot.

816
00:50:48,229 --> 00:50:49,629
It's kind of crazy to think about...

817
00:50:49,649 --> 00:50:51,490
It's popular. Is pop actually the most popular genre?

818
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,931
Because like when you have 20 million active users at any one time,

819
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:59,312
thinking about what the whole broad spectrum of them are going to be interested in

820
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:03,733
and the niches and applying to them and all that is tough.

821
00:51:03,873 --> 00:51:07,034
And so, yes, you have to get the pop, the hot 100 content and all that,

822
00:51:07,054 --> 00:51:10,235
and the stuff that resonates with the pop culture and is even number one in Brazil.

823
00:51:12,181 --> 00:51:18,447
But, you know, we're putting in, we're coordinating with the Icelandic Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

824
00:51:18,467 --> 00:51:23,052
and putting in this really awesome flamboyant Paul Oscar.

825
00:51:23,092 --> 00:51:27,897
You know, we're putting his music in because you have, when you have such a niche thing,

826
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:33,082
like you were talking about that awesome 18.10 system that created noise music.

827
00:51:33,943 --> 00:51:36,085
You know, if that was...

828
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,533
Everyone that was there, I'm guessing, was super into it.

829
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:42,434
No one was like, eh, yeah, like, I guess.

830
00:51:42,454 --> 00:51:44,516
Only in San Francisco, but something like that exists.

831
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:47,859
So, like, the people that are going to go sing that Icelandic music,

832
00:51:47,919 --> 00:51:50,120
even though the country only has 300,000 people,

833
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,802
like, they're going to be so into it.

834
00:51:53,063 --> 00:51:54,644
And that's, like, that's awesome.

835
00:51:57,366 --> 00:52:00,288
Cool. One last final thing before we take a few questions.

836
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,350
I'm just having a fun time listening to this.

837
00:52:03,431 --> 00:52:05,272
Um, you know, obviously, you know,

838
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:10,719
Technology has changed music making fundamentally, you know, probably since people were banging bones together from

839
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,964
when the piano forte was inventioned and you could suddenly play both soft piano and loud forte.

840
00:52:18,104 --> 00:52:23,769
Or the engineers said, well, Mr. Guitar Player, you can plug it into this app,

841
00:52:23,789 --> 00:52:29,433
but just don't turn the volume past about 8 because then you won't get an accurate representation of your guitar sound

842
00:52:29,493 --> 00:52:31,335
and it will distort, which of course is bad.

843
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:37,770
Technology has changed fundamentally the kind of music that is made.

844
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:42,637
How do you see, just sort of in a quick wrap-up thought, what you are doing

845
00:52:43,217 --> 00:52:46,221
as fundamentally changing the nature of humanity through music?

846
00:52:48,235 --> 00:52:55,699
I think there's a lot of pieces of music technology that have created genres, right?

847
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:59,201
I think we wouldn't have what we think of as contemporary electronic music without the

848
00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:01,562
TV-303 and the 808, right?

849
00:53:01,622 --> 00:53:05,324
These are things that have enabled particular types of expression.

850
00:53:05,344 --> 00:53:10,427
And I think, you know, if there's like a lofty aim that I could possibly have for a thing

851
00:53:10,447 --> 00:53:14,929
that I would build, you know, it's a thing that is expressive within a limited set of

852
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:16,690
means that can, you know, sort of...

853
00:53:17,088 --> 00:53:19,809
be generative of its own type of genre work.

854
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,409
Because I think genre is a powerful way of limiting a palette

855
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:27,010
and allowing someone to sort of identify with the thing that they've made

856
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,231
as part of that genre.

857
00:53:28,491 --> 00:53:32,492
And I think that's sort of a big part of what we're doing.

858
00:53:32,732 --> 00:53:34,913
We're playing around with remixing Fantasia.

859
00:53:35,573 --> 00:53:38,113
But a thing that, from a long-term perspective,

860
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:40,734
I sort of aspire to be able to create.

861
00:53:41,202 --> 00:53:47,606
kind of an environment that has its own sound and its own feel that is generative of a particular

862
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:48,966
type of genre of music.

863
00:53:51,568 --> 00:53:58,211
For us, we view music as the original social network, which is kind of a buzz phrase, but

864
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:01,993
I think it encapsulates what we're going to try and do going forward.

865
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:03,794
And that is completely...

866
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:09,356
to take this community that has kind of built itself and that we've nursed along of people

867
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:15,338
that are all casual or closet singers that are all collaborating together and 700 people

868
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:19,920
sing a group duet of happy and all the stuff that's happening without us even pushing it.

869
00:54:20,921 --> 00:54:26,063
We're going to keep massaging and pushing that further and pushing this collaborative

870
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:30,644
environment to a point where people don't need to worry so much about sounding bad because

871
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:34,246
you have a positive community behind them and just the idea that music

872
00:54:34,932 --> 00:54:39,296
can be good, it can be bad, but it can be expressive no matter what it is in there, and it can

873
00:54:39,336 --> 00:54:44,559
be incredibly personal and incredibly connecting to a huge number of people across cultural

874
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,883
boundaries, across a whole bunch of different boundaries, and I think going towards the

875
00:54:48,923 --> 00:54:52,946
future, yes, it's more about connecting all those people amongst all the different instruments

876
00:54:52,986 --> 00:54:57,509
and the different personalities and everything, and using music as a conduit for that.

877
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,331
I got three points.

878
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:02,433
Let me see if I remember them all when going through this, because I thought of it while

879
00:55:02,493 --> 00:55:03,234
you started speaking.

880
00:55:03,274 --> 00:55:03,894
Now that might be gone.

881
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:06,430
Uh, first one is...

882
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:11,074
I just screwed myself, I knew it a second ago.

883
00:55:13,255 --> 00:55:17,337
First thing is the, I think we're actually coming up to,

884
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:20,078
like I feel like we're behind where music used to be.

885
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:22,079
And this is maybe just an idea I just started thinking about now

886
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:24,019
when you were talking about like, oh, you know,

887
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:26,240
people used to get around the piano and play songs and sing together.

888
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,002
I really feel like what we're doing now with the music applications

889
00:55:30,102 --> 00:55:32,063
is kind of getting people back together,

890
00:55:32,143 --> 00:55:33,823
connecting people back to music again,

891
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,585
which is something that is actually, I feel in a lot of ways,

892
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,205
actually departed from our culture.

893
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:45,690
and we're not departed but definitely gone to an individual basis instead of kind of connecting as a community.

894
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:52,014
So in one way I see that that's where we're going, but that's just to get us back to ground zero, which is nice.

895
00:55:53,575 --> 00:56:02,662
Second thing is that, second and third thing at the same time, I feel that new instruments or new ways of connecting with music are...

896
00:56:04,423 --> 00:56:08,686
new windows into creating music. This is why a lot of musicians, and I'm sure you guys

897
00:56:08,726 --> 00:56:12,208
know, you maybe started with guitar or you started with piano, but then there was some

898
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,610
point where you were like, I want to learn how to play drums, I want to learn how to

899
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:18,572
play bass, I want to learn how to play this. This natural incantation came out and you

900
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:21,714
started to play with those other instruments and it made you play different. It made you

901
00:56:21,734 --> 00:56:25,516
play different things. You thought up different ideas. You started making music in a different

902
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:30,720
way. That's incredibly important. So all of these new things that we come up with, whether

903
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,541
it's controlling it on an iPad or.

904
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:38,265
a controller or DJ thing or maybe just even clicking around with a mouse and a DAW.

905
00:56:38,845 --> 00:56:42,427
All those different ways are actually influencing how music sounds.

906
00:56:42,447 --> 00:56:44,889
Like you were talking about with the 808 or with Live or things like that.

907
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:51,433
The last thing I'm going to say is where we, all of us, are actually pushing music technology,

908
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:53,095
specifically in the field of games.

909
00:56:53,809 --> 00:57:02,674
pushing this music technology gives the kind of like, gives the pro audio user more technology

910
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:06,617
to make things, to make different tools and different things that actually didn't exist

911
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:14,001
before to get to kind of experiences that are new, right? Like a lot of the, a lot of

912
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:18,383
the tech that I know you've made with going through and actually analyzing the raps and

913
00:57:18,403 --> 00:57:20,304
stuff like that or the stuff we've done with session mode.

914
00:57:23,709 --> 00:57:25,731
in the way you're going to make a product.

915
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:27,132
And then when you're done making that product,

916
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,434
you're like, huh, we had to make a lot of tools to get here.

917
00:57:29,815 --> 00:57:31,697
And you can actually wire them together this way.

918
00:57:31,797 --> 00:57:34,099
And it's like a way of growing on where you're at

919
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,482
to actually make more tools to then go to the second point

920
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:40,185
to make music in a different way and actually bring it further.

921
00:57:43,027 --> 00:57:54,662
This probably overlaps a lot with those guys, but definitely filling in the gaps between traditional instruments and what Nick was describing as a solitary EDM producer in his bedroom.

922
00:57:55,103 --> 00:58:01,771
Hopefully, you know, a lot more different ways for people to make music at different levels of commitment from the like, I just want to tap.

923
00:58:02,576 --> 00:58:07,879
the phone in time, versus like, I actually am going to dedicate years of my life to learning

924
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:11,742
an instrument, right? There's a huge range of people in between there, the guys who have

925
00:58:11,762 --> 00:58:18,366
given up on guitar twice. So we can make tools for those people and let them keep making

926
00:58:18,406 --> 00:58:22,368
music instead of like, have you ever had that conversation? Like, oh, I really wish I still

927
00:58:22,388 --> 00:58:24,790
played guitar. Like, oh, we got you, bro.

928
00:58:26,896 --> 00:58:28,297
Here, use this, you know.

929
00:58:28,497 --> 00:58:30,217
We're making that kind of stuff to fill in the gaps.

930
00:58:31,238 --> 00:58:33,299
And hopefully it'll be at all ranges,

931
00:58:33,339 --> 00:58:34,739
from the amateur up to the professional,

932
00:58:34,759 --> 00:58:37,640
and making those tools a little more usable

933
00:58:37,701 --> 00:58:41,582
so you don't have to dig through a synthesizer manual

934
00:58:41,622 --> 00:58:44,363
to learn, what the hell does this one knob do,

935
00:58:44,423 --> 00:58:46,224
and why can't I hear any differences?

936
00:58:46,464 --> 00:58:48,305
Actually, we don't really need to show you that,

937
00:58:48,345 --> 00:58:49,185
so we're not going to.

938
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,947
Also, I think Adult Contemporary is

939
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:54,007
going to make a big comeback.

940
00:58:54,788 --> 00:58:54,968
Brian?

941
00:58:57,347 --> 00:58:59,371
Build contemporary to make a big comeback.

942
00:58:59,832 --> 00:59:00,653
Gotta write that one down.

943
00:59:01,314 --> 00:59:03,178
I think we've got time for a question or two.

944
00:59:03,538 --> 00:59:06,524
Anybody's got something, then we're gonna have to wrap up or go to the wrap-up room.

945
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,340
Hi there. First of all, I just want to say...

946
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,720
Hmm? Finger?

947
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:14,161
No, sorry, I was communicating with the background.

948
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:16,162
First of all, I just want to say thank you to everybody

949
00:59:16,182 --> 00:59:20,342
because I started off doing music with these rhythm games.

950
00:59:20,402 --> 00:59:22,223
I started off with music games. That's my bread and butter.

951
00:59:22,243 --> 00:59:23,743
That's what I just love to do.

952
00:59:23,803 --> 00:59:25,884
If it weren't for those, if it weren't for Amplitude

953
00:59:25,944 --> 00:59:28,504
or Rocksmith or Rockband or Sing or Guitar

954
00:59:28,544 --> 00:59:30,705
or anybody else just keeping up this genre of game

955
00:59:30,725 --> 00:59:32,185
that seems to be dying, I think.

956
00:59:32,305 --> 00:59:35,666
I mean, I just want to thank you guys so much

957
00:59:36,066 --> 00:59:37,866
because this is just such a big part of my life.

958
00:59:39,808 --> 00:59:50,755
The question, like, since I'm such a big part of the community, of the music game community, I know that a huge part of it is of the fan bases to have like original, like user-created content.

959
00:59:51,116 --> 00:59:54,658
Whether it's like creating your own songs and implementing them in the game, which is a little bit rare.

960
00:59:55,259 --> 01:00:00,523
or if you just like take MP3s off of the internet and just like throw them into TapTap or Vendor something.

961
01:00:00,883 --> 01:00:05,967
Because I know that that's such a huge part of just like the grassroots community,

962
01:00:06,488 --> 01:00:12,593
but in my conversations that I've had with developers, it seems like it's difficult to acknowledge that that's even happening.

963
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:17,477
Because like you can't just say, hey, look at this cool dude who took a thrift shop MP3 and just put it in our game,

964
01:00:17,517 --> 01:00:20,199
because then you get, because then you're condoning piracy,

965
01:00:20,299 --> 01:00:22,501
and then you have a whole bunch of copyright issues to deal with because...

966
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:25,722
You're not licensing their music.

967
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:34,046
So my question is, do you really see this user-generated content as more of a boon to the game or more like a hindrance?

968
01:00:34,246 --> 01:00:40,129
And is there a way to promote this user-generated content without overstepping copyright boundaries?

969
01:00:40,629 --> 01:00:45,952
That's a super good question. It lends itself to a whole panel discussion.

970
01:00:46,604 --> 01:00:51,426
We have enough time for quick answers, and then we need to take it up into the hallway.

971
01:00:51,466 --> 01:00:56,508
I'll absolutely talk to you outside of this, except to say that we can't say much except

972
01:00:56,648 --> 01:01:00,589
you're absolutely right, and you may be happy in the future.

973
01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:05,411
I don't know what any of his questions mean.

974
01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:10,193
I'm going to say that you don't ask the easiest questions on a panel.

975
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:16,222
We tried really hard to absorb that energy with Rockband Network in the height of the

976
01:01:16,242 --> 01:01:19,084
Rockband days, let people off of their own content, offer it up for sale.

977
01:01:19,264 --> 01:01:24,527
It's a thing we knew was happening and we wanted to have happen and we ideally in the

978
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:25,548
future will continue to support.

979
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:28,590
We love the community's input.

980
01:01:29,331 --> 01:01:34,314
It makes Rocksmith so much, so much better to have a really strong community and we've

981
01:01:34,354 --> 01:01:36,736
actually been fortunate to have people who care so much.

982
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:42,686
And we like that community input and we like having people actually help each other and do that.

983
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:44,647
Great. It was great to hear. Thank you.

984
01:01:44,847 --> 01:01:49,691
So yeah, I'd like to thank Matt, John, Nick, and David. Thanks for spending your time here.

985
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,815
And I think this is the end of the GDC audio track for 2015.
