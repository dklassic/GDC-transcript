00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:16,736
Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for having me here at GDC and thanks for coming to my talk

2
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:21,980
on kindness coin design. I wish I was there with you. But thinking of you all. So my name

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,441
is Michelle Clough. I'm a oops.

4
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:32,550
My name is Nichelle Clough. I'm a game writer, editor, narrative designer, and partner in the narrative co-op TaleSpinners.

5
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:43,300
I've worked on a variety of titles, including some romantic interactive fiction, which is very relevant because I'm really, really into romance, sex appeal, and sexual content in games.

6
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:47,945
I co-founded and chair the IGDA Special Interest Group for Romance and Sexuality.

7
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:52,248
as well as our Discord-based community, which is being relaunched as Farum,

8
00:00:52,388 --> 00:00:55,070
the forum for erotic and romantic interactive media.

9
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:58,193
I've also talked about sex and sexapheal at GDC before.

10
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,855
Like, a lot. A lot, a lot.

11
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:04,678
In fact, somehow I've talked about it so much I talked my way into writing a book on the subject.

12
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,560
It's called Passion in Play, it's due out April 14th,

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,422
you can check it out at the bookstore with a discount for pre-order.

14
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:13,044
But, you can also get a preview here,

15
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:17,467
because one of the chapters inspired this talk about kindness coins.

16
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:22,890
Many of you have probably heard of them, and even if not, chances are you've encountered them in some of your favourite games.

17
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:28,033
It's an extremely popular design for romantic and sexual content, both in indie and AAA,

18
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:31,255
but it brings a lot of, um, baggage.

19
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:36,999
And while kindness coin romances are compelling and emotional and sexy,

20
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:43,303
this can often be due to the writers being awesome in spite of kindness coins, not because of them.

21
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:49,627
Now, many games reject kindness coin design entirely and embrace completely different

22
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:55,193
gameplay and narrative systems to explore love and sex, and that's great. But this talk is about

23
00:01:55,253 --> 00:02:00,538
how we can create systems and structures that are like kindness coins but with more organic chemistry,

24
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:03,781
nuanced relationship dynamics, and less potential for ick.

25
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:07,924
So this talk is going to cover kindness coins, what they are, why they're bad,

26
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:12,527
why they're sometimes good. Next, we'll discuss the narrative benefits and possibilities of

27
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:18,551
moving away from generic kindness and into character-specific chemistry. And finally,

28
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:23,415
we'll explore two models that reimagine the old kindness coin approach through that chemistry.

29
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:27,998
One reframes the format to reliably build romantic and sexual tension.

30
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:32,181
The other subverts the format in favor of unpredictability and chance.

31
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:38,162
Now, quick disclaimer, this is not a talk about how to write good romance, sex, or chemistry.

32
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:43,684
There are other great talks on the vault about that, including some of mine, but this talk is

33
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:49,585
more focused on designing narrative systems to tell romantic and sexual stories and to serve as

34
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:54,906
the foundation for what we write. So, with that said, let's start with kindness coins.

35
00:02:56,081 --> 00:03:11,507
Kindness coins are a nickname given to a particular narrative system, which you tend to see in visual novels and RPGs, in which the player does nice, kind things for an NPC, like giving gifts, which then earns romantic and sexual affection from the NPC as a reward.

36
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:16,989
Hence, kindness coins, the implication that you're earning or paying for love with kindness.

37
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:18,670
So this is a.

38
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:21,659
visual of how this dynamic tends to work in games.

39
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:25,462
The player chooses nice or kind actions for the NPC,

40
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:28,724
usually as part of a dialogue tree or choice menu.

41
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:32,547
These actions are often clearly signaled through UI by heart icons,

42
00:03:32,627 --> 00:03:33,668
pop-ups, and so on.

43
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:37,691
Examples of these actions could be compliments, agreement, favors,

44
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,893
gifts, loyalty quests, or just spending time together.

45
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:45,883
Every time the player character does one of these, it adds to an internal value for the NPC,

46
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:50,824
and we'll call this value affection. Sometimes it's tracked, sometimes it's a temporary pop-up,

47
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:54,166
and sometimes it's hidden under the hood. From a narrative perspective,

48
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:59,368
this variable measures how much the NPC likes the player, either romantically or sexually.

49
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:13,367
So the NPC's affection keeps increasing until it hits a specific threshold, which then triggers a response that evolves the relationship, either by unlocking more gameplay or more commonly showing a major relationship beat in a cutscene.

50
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:19,652
Things like communicating interest, first kisses, confessions of love, and of course, sex.

51
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:27,038
then it usually either transitions into a more linear traditional story, or the loop will repeat

52
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:32,123
with new thresholds where the player keeps making nice choices and the NPC rewards them with more

53
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:39,190
love or sex. So at this point you're probably seeing some, well, issues with this system.

54
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:42,778
And I think that slide sums them up pretty well.

55
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:46,141
There is a lot to criticize about kindness coins,

56
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:50,806
and most people focus on the larger negative cultural implications about

57
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:56,828
transactional relationship models, entitlement to sex, and gender relations, and all worth their

58
00:04:56,888 --> 00:05:01,993
own talks. But for this talk, I want to focus on the narrative and writing issues that make it

59
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:07,999
harder for us to write good romance and sex stories. For one, kindness coins rarely develop

60
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,621
or reflect the player character versus the rest of the game.

61
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:16,707
You can roleplay wildly different personas in a game, but kindness coins are often completely disconnected from those.

62
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:22,913
You could be playing a puppy-killing monster or a literal saint, but either way, when you talk to your love interest, it's all,

63
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:27,097
Hey babe, I got you a flower, I hope you like it, and none of the rest of that matters.

64
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:34,181
Very often kindness coins have to be written that way in order to work for whatever personality type the player is playing.

65
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:39,286
So we as writers have to write more generic stuff that can fit any character.

66
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:44,290
Not too good, not too bad, just nice. So that's an issue.

67
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:49,186
Another issue is that kindness coins flatten out your cast of NPCs.

68
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:53,009
So you might have a very varied cast of NPC love interest

69
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,571
with different romantic arcs, and that's great.

70
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:58,453
But you still end up engaging them all in the same way

71
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,575
and they still all respond positively.

72
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,977
Again, it's kind of the vending machine model.

73
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:06,560
They may all dispense different cut scenes and content,

74
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,502
but you're still putting the same currency of niceness into them,

75
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,105
which drains them of nuance and difference.

76
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:17,495
Kindness coins can deny your NPC's agency over their own desires.

77
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,457
This isn't a mutual romance.

78
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:23,641
The player is romancing at the NPC, bombarding them with niceness

79
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:26,003
until the NPC responds positively.

80
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:28,325
They're a passenger in the player's car

81
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:30,227
while they are driving towards a relationship.

82
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:32,429
And yeah, they might be a willing passenger,

83
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,931
but you know, they could be driving themselves

84
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:35,972
in that direction.

85
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:45,454
But without a strong sense of the NPC's drive and desires, we kind of don't know why they'd be driving in that direction or want to get with a player other than, oh, they were nice to me.

86
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:48,256
Which brings me to another big issue.

87
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:52,400
Kindness coins conflate platonic feelings with romantic and sexual attraction.

88
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:57,827
If someone of your preferred gender is kind to you, apparently the only natural reaction

89
00:06:57,927 --> 00:07:00,371
is to fall madly in love with them and sex them up.

90
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:04,576
If that were true, I would be having torrid affairs with every nice person I've ever

91
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:04,837
met.

92
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:08,261
And I'm already fully booked with work, so I don't have time for that.

93
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:14,712
Kindness is great, but making love and desire the default reaction doesn't reflect what makes those

94
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:19,997
feelings different from just platonic respect. So at best, the writer still has to do the extra

95
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:25,543
work of fleshing that out anyway, and at worst, you have a platonic dynamic stuffed into a romantic

96
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:28,025
or sexual one with no chemistry behind it.

97
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:34,247
And also to be blunt, this is where kindness coins can trigger bad memories of real-life experiences.

98
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:40,170
Many women have had encounters with guys who weaponize this logic and expect sex for their kindness.

99
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,292
People on the ace spectrum or with platonic friends of their preferred gender have also

100
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:50,074
often had bad experiences with this. And that's not to say that kindness coins are to blame for

101
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:53,996
these cultural attitudes, but they can certainly bring them to mind if they're not handled well.

102
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:56,957
And if your players are frustrated with experiencing this stuff in reality,

103
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,198
they're not going to want to experience it in your game.

104
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,340
So yeah, there are lots of problems with kindness coins.

105
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,922
Now let's talk about some of the good things.

106
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:07,363
Because yes, they do actually exist.

107
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:09,124
And by identifying their strengths,

108
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:11,606
we can work towards improving or replacing them

109
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:13,187
with structures that keep those strengths,

110
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:14,628
but ditch the weaknesses.

111
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:18,170
So for one thing, it's ridiculously easy to do.

112
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,971
The code and logic for the sloop

113
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:22,753
is a super basic programming structure anyone can learn.

114
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:25,155
I know because I did that little twine thing there.

115
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,938
It's also very simple and straightforward from a design perspective.

116
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:32,379
It's robust enough for an entire game by itself,

117
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:35,601
but it's also simple enough to add to a larger project.

118
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:38,964
That's why you see it in everything from Baby's first visual novel

119
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:40,945
to a full AAA game.

120
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,867
And to be fair, this can also make it easy for us

121
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:47,349
to outline and plot out major and minor beats.

122
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:50,911
It's a flexible framework to work out not just the big cut scenes,

123
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,393
but the minor interactions along the way,

124
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:56,055
and it can easily be expanded or shrunk as needed.

125
00:08:57,442 --> 00:09:03,850
And for your players, Kindness Coins provide a simple, easily accessible way to engage with the romantic and sexual narratives they like.

126
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:12,081
The story might have twists and challenges and unhappy endings, but the system for experiencing it is dependable and straightforward.

127
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:17,025
pick the right options, and the relationship story will progress. The options are usually obvious,

128
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:22,710
and if they're not, that's what walkthroughs are for. And many of your players really appreciate

129
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,894
that aspect of kindness coins, and that's not because they're lazy, or because they need spoon

130
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:33,879
feeding, or because they're entitled themselves wanting boobs. Many of those players are players

131
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:36,021
of marginalized genders and sexualities.

132
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:42,688
who just want simplified safe spaces to enjoy a fantasy. Many players are busy and stressed and

133
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:47,193
don't want to strain their brain just to kiss their favorite character. They're not there for

134
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:51,778
the transactional element of the relationship, they're there for romantic and sexual stories

135
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:54,741
that they can navigate in an easy, stress-free way.

136
00:09:55,522 --> 00:10:00,288
And, you know, look, some people like Dark Souls, some people like Kirby, some people like both,

137
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,536
but at different times and contexts. So while we need games that explore love and sex in deep,

138
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:10,302
complex, realistic ways, we also need games that embrace good old simple wish fulfillment.

139
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:17,209
just, you know, maybe not kindness coins specifically. Okay, so how do we make better

140
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:22,053
wish fulfillment? How do we ditch the coin metaphor, reframe this thing that increases for

141
00:10:22,073 --> 00:10:28,379
the NPC? How do we reframe their response? And how do we give players choice beyond bland niceness?

142
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,242
Now let me think. Oh, oh yeah, yeah, that'll do it.

143
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:36,550
I posit that one of the best ways to improve this system

144
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,932
is to ground the relationship and the storytelling

145
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:41,893
in chemistry and attraction, which I'm defining here

146
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,035
as anything that inspires non-platonic interest,

147
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:47,697
be it romantic, sexual, long-term, short-term,

148
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:48,217
whatever.

149
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:50,899
And this approach has many benefits.

150
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:54,781
For one, when I say anything, I mean anything.

151
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,903
By defining chemistry in a holistic way,

152
00:10:57,963 --> 00:11:00,244
you can have the most profound connection.

153
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,884
to the most deliciously shallow appreciation of a person imaginable.

154
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:08,609
And sometimes, of course, you'll luck out and get the entire package in one relationship.

155
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,932
But sometimes it'll be skewed more to one end or the other.

156
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,754
And that's interesting, too.

157
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:18,219
Broadening how we view attraction frees us up to tell more kinds of love

158
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,382
and sex stories and more ways people can be drawn to one another.

159
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:28,087
Also, when I say it can be anything, I also mean in terms of player actions and more importantly,

160
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:34,372
gameplay. Because chemistry can be baked into every gameplay system, not just dialogue. And

161
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:38,916
that's not to crap on dialogue, love it. But physical and emotional attraction don't just

162
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:42,138
happen when you're talking to someone, they're happening all the time.

163
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,240
So there's no reason why NPCs couldn't be attracted to the way your character fights,

164
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,941
or their look, or how they move, or how they chop wood, pet cats, conquer kingdoms.

165
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:54,481
You get the idea.

166
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:59,102
If narrative design is considering how systems can tell stories, then for God's sake,

167
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:03,043
let's use these systems to tell romantic and erotic stories.

168
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:09,023
And if you do, it offers more interesting possibilities for player role-playing and character development.

169
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:12,206
Because now it's not just giving gifts and saying nice things,

170
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:16,029
it's choosing options to define who you are and what your traits are.

171
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,053
And those sparking attraction because the NPC digs those things.

172
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:25,088
For example, if you're romancing an NPC who finds adorkable people irresistible,

173
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:29,451
yeah, you could game the system by saying and doing adorkable things.

174
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:34,254
And that's totally fine because, well, now you're roleplaying an adorkable person

175
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,355
and someone this NPC could be attracted to.

176
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:40,938
Speaking of, this approach gives a lot more room to flesh out

177
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:42,900
and differentiate your romanceable NPCs.

178
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,922
Different people are attracted to many, many different things.

179
00:12:46,368 --> 00:12:51,329
So instead of blanket blend niceness making every character swoon, you can go into what

180
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:56,490
each NPC wants and what differentiates them. Mind you, this means actually figuring out

181
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,111
things like your character's turn ons, relationship goals, what attracts them, how they act on it.

182
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:06,232
So add that info to your character bios. And a friendly reminder, this includes your ace

183
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:11,033
characters as well, where some or even all of the answers might be nothing.

184
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:15,974
But that's still an answer, rather than I got nothing. So you'll need to think about this.

185
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:22,283
Lastly, it's a lot easier to write romances where the NPC is active versus reactive.

186
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:26,567
Because the player dynamic is no longer, I will wear them down with favors,

187
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,290
it's I'm acting in a way that this person finds attractive.

188
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,453
And then, the ball is in the NPC's court.

189
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:37,636
They might have this internal feeling that's inspired by player action,

190
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:41,940
but they decide how to act on it in a way that works with who they are.

191
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:47,457
Now, I could talk forever about the systemic and narrative possibilities of chemistry,

192
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:51,238
and I know this because the first draft of this talk had 30 minutes on it,

193
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:57,239
but that talk will have to be next year. This year, let's get back to the kindness coin system

194
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:01,040
and see what it becomes when you swap out the kindness and coins for chemistry.

195
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:05,962
I call it the chemistry card tower. In the chemistry card tower,

196
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:10,103
the player chooses character actions that attract a specific NPC.

197
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:13,452
This causes a value, attraction, to count up.

198
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:16,555
And when it reaches a threshold, it triggers a major relationship

199
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,258
beat, usually the NPC acting on their attraction.

200
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,821
Now, you might be thinking that it's

201
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:23,844
the exact same thing as kindness coins

202
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,405
with the exact same problems.

203
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:27,468
But I'd argue the subtle differences,

204
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:30,431
even in how we as writers frame it in our heads,

205
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:32,173
have huge impact on our writing.

206
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,303
Even shifting from coins to a card tower

207
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:37,625
is a better metaphor to apply, because now it's

208
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:40,048
about building something, not earning something.

209
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:43,533
With card towers, each card builds the tower higher,

210
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:46,296
and the tension with it bigger and higher,

211
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:49,100
until inevitably, the tower ends up falling.

212
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:53,388
With chemistry card towers, the cards are every interaction

213
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,109
that piques the NPC's interest.

214
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:57,972
You're building the chemistry and the attraction

215
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,014
and the tension higher and higher

216
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:03,217
until your characters fall into each other's arms.

217
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:06,100
Or, you know, they ask each other out for drinks.

218
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,121
That also totally works.

219
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:11,546
There's a fantastic example of this in a TTRPG called Starcrossed,

220
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,108
which uses this at its core gameplay and story mechanic,

221
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:16,009
albeit with Jenga instead of cards.

222
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:18,991
The players role-play characters who are mutually attracted

223
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,752
but have to resist for some reason.

224
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,853
But every time they do something attractive,

225
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:24,574
they have to remove a piece from the tower.

226
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:28,136
When it tumbles, they surrender and act on their desires.

227
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:31,518
It's a great way to conceptualize certain relationship dynamics

228
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:35,541
and can be good inspiration for actually writing dramatic arcs of love and lust.

229
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:40,535
So let's take a look at the new loop to see more of the differences from kindness coins.

230
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:45,057
Firstly, there is already a big difference in the nature of the player choices and actions.

231
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,919
Rather than generic niceness, they're interesting, varied, and specific to the NPC.

232
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:54,561
They can be super shallow, deeply meaningful, they can be dialogue, they can be gameplay.

233
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:57,362
And of course, if you're romancing a different NPC,

234
00:15:57,762 --> 00:16:00,583
those will all be entirely different actions and attractions.

235
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:03,454
They are probably still clearly signposted, though,

236
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:05,475
because this model is still aiming

237
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:07,937
for simplicity and liability.

238
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:11,659
And next, there's the impact of framing this

239
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,100
as attraction, not affection.

240
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,962
For one, it avoids that conflating platonic warmth

241
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:18,243
with sexy romantic warmth, but it's

242
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:21,925
holistic to allow to that broad range of types of interest.

243
00:16:22,306 --> 00:16:24,247
And most importantly, framing it as attraction

244
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:27,649
better connects it to the NPC's specific active desires,

245
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:29,070
not reactive gratitude.

246
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:32,267
As such, the threshold has more weight and meaning.

247
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:36,430
It means the NPC's attraction has built to a point where they have to act

248
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,451
because their feelings were too strong to ignore.

249
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,393
They choose to act because they embrace their feelings,

250
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:45,976
or they're compelled to act because they've just been overwhelmed by their feelings.

251
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:51,459
In terms of a hypothetical example, let's look at how this could work in a game like Dragon Age 2.

252
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,783
In the actual game, the dialogue system lets you shape Hawk's personality outside of romance

253
00:16:57,123 --> 00:16:58,624
towards three personality types.

254
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,499
If you go one step further, though, those personalities

255
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,080
could slot in nicely with certain love interests

256
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,301
and what they might be drawn to in a partner.

257
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:09,602
And then their romance scenes take on more context.

258
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,923
They visit you that evening because they're

259
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:15,104
moved, amused, or inflamed by who you are,

260
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,545
not just when you're with them, but all the time.

261
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:21,807
A model like this can be easily converted to a chemistry card

262
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:24,488
tower that runs in every moment in dialogue choice,

263
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:26,149
not only romance set pieces.

264
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:30,456
So same loop, subtle differences, big impact.

265
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:32,217
Most of the strengths of kindness coins,

266
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:33,958
arguably not the weaknesses.

267
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:37,199
And yes, you are still choosing the right options

268
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,599
to get with a digital hottie,

269
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,200
but the options are more interesting,

270
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,761
the getting with is more organic,

271
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,181
and the story has more depth.

272
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:45,422
If kindness coins are about saying

273
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:46,663
and doing the right thing

274
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:48,624
until you're rewarded with love and sex,

275
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:51,245
then Chemistry Card Tower is about being

276
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:54,366
the right kind of person to make the NPC feel that way.

277
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:59,637
That's what I mean by better wish fulfillment, giving the players a clear, easy path to romantic

278
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:03,459
and sexual arcs they want, but making that path more meaningful and more interesting,

279
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:08,901
both to take and to write. In terms of good places to use the chemistry card tower,

280
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:14,144
one is obviously game genres like RPGs and visual novels that already use kindness coins heavily.

281
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:18,526
There's no need to design entirely new systems and reinvent the wheel. You can iterate on the

282
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:22,508
one that's already there, which makes your producers and the people with money very, very happy.

283
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:27,772
Romantic and sexual narratives with themes of matching, compatibility, and certainty,

284
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:33,056
because part of the appeal is that you know where things are going to end up when you pick that option.

285
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:37,040
And for players that are seeking more idealized experiences and stories,

286
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,502
or at least ones that are easy to engage with.

287
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:41,044
Okay, great.

288
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:43,469
What if none of those apply?

289
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:49,671
What if your target player base wants the complication and weirdness and pain of real-world sex and romance?

290
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:51,831
What if they want it to be hard?

291
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:53,312
Or maybe you want that.

292
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:57,773
Maybe you're making a game where the tone or themes don't lend themselves to stories

293
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,593
where love always wins or where you always know what to do.

294
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:04,394
You may want to tell more realistic stories about confusion, uncertainty.

295
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,471
the random chance that love punches your players in the face.

296
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:10,892
Because, you know, let's face it, at least when they start,

297
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:14,712
like, love and sex can involve uncertainty and luck.

298
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:19,133
Some of it is just the situational luck of meeting the right person at the right time

299
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:23,134
or experiencing a random moment together that you can't plan for.

300
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:27,635
And to be honest, in reality, you can't really plan for attraction either.

301
00:19:28,058 --> 00:19:29,998
The spark is tough to predict.

302
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:32,599
Even when you have a type, it's no guarantee

303
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:34,780
if you meet that type that you'll actually dig them.

304
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,801
Plus, people don't come with walkthroughs in UI.

305
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,402
You don't know what's going on in their head.

306
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:41,702
If you're like me, you barely know

307
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,823
what's going on in your head.

308
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,703
None of us know what the hell we're doing.

309
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:47,644
Luck, it's a goddamn miracle anybody ever manages

310
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:48,644
to hook up with anyone.

311
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:51,385
And yet, we risk it anyway.

312
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:53,686
We take the plunge into mysterious waters

313
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,467
because the love or booty we're looking for is worth it.

314
00:19:57,007 --> 00:19:57,527
And you know what?

315
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:00,659
That all sounds like great fodder for storytelling.

316
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,880
And it just so happens we're telling stories

317
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,062
in a medium where luck and random chance

318
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,383
are baked into the foundation.

319
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,086
Hence, the second model, the chemistry casino.

320
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:13,669
As the name suggests, this model incorporates chemistry

321
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:16,051
and attraction, but adds unpredictability

322
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:18,873
through game systems like RNG, through the writing,

323
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,695
and through hiding information and feedback.

324
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:27,008
In the Chemistry Card Tower, you know what the NPC finds attractive.

325
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:28,569
You know they'll become attracted.

326
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,690
You know they're going to act on it eventually.

327
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,653
In Chemistry Casino, you might not know any of these things for sure

328
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:38,936
because they're hidden from you or because they're genuinely random.

329
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:42,818
Now, this still encourages role playing and exploring attraction,

330
00:20:42,998 --> 00:20:46,661
but from a different angle, one that doesn't offer guarantees.

331
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:54,553
So for example, the NPC's type might not be clearly communicated, meaning you can't just pick an obvious trait that they dig.

332
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,797
You have to feel things out in the moment based on what you think you know about them.

333
00:20:59,217 --> 00:20:59,818
Are you right?

334
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:03,061
You might never know for sure, but all you can do is try.

335
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:08,246
And also, being someone's type doesn't always translate into automatic attraction.

336
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:12,578
It helps and is makes more likely, but it may not be guaranteed.

337
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:17,001
A good way to look at it, using dice from something other than the casino,

338
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:23,145
is your character's attractive traits in this may be more like modifiers on a dice roll in D&D,

339
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:27,727
not a seduction roll, but a roll to see if there's a spark there.

340
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:31,509
If you have a lot of traits they're drawn to, it's more likely,

341
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,891
but it still might not turn out that way in the end.

342
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:36,419
And of course, this works in reverse, too.

343
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,741
You might be the opposite of who they usually like,

344
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:40,802
but boy, for some reason, they're

345
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:42,043
just feeling it with you.

346
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:46,514
So actual randomization in chemistry casino design,

347
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:49,417
so using things like randomized characters, events, RNG,

348
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:52,820
this is great for games with that game design

349
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,541
and narrative design already in place.

350
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,403
For example, Crusader Kings III,

351
00:21:56,923 --> 00:21:58,644
basically a soap opera generator,

352
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:01,026
thanks to its random characters and events,

353
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,548
marriages, adultery, pregnancies, you name it.

354
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:06,491
This makes for great emergent storytelling

355
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:07,512
around love and sex.

356
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:11,851
But for more traditional game stories, it can be a bit trickier.

357
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:16,715
So for one thing, for players, most do not want to be blocked from romantic and sexual content

358
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:21,420
by one stroke of bad luck, particularly if they've been playing for hundreds of hours.

359
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,761
And for writers...

360
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:28,383
Let's face it, effective romantic and sexual storytelling can often depend on very non-random

361
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:34,905
things like characterization, pacing, logic. So having random things just happen out of nowhere

362
00:22:34,945 --> 00:22:38,566
with no narrative connecting tissue is going to wreck the whole story, potentially.

363
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:44,088
If you want randomization and traditional narrative, try a hybrid model. Either have

364
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:50,010
the narrative be modular and easy to shift around, or have the randomization be light

365
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,970
and subordinate to the narrative.

366
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:57,633
A good example of this can be found in Monster Prom, where the goal is to ask a monster out to prom.

367
00:22:58,013 --> 00:23:02,454
There is a chemistry system where their attraction is based on whether you have high stats in the

368
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:08,255
traits they like, but the scenes and challenges where you build those stats and traits are

369
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:13,676
largely randomized every time. So if you end up in the wrong encounters, you might be going stag.

370
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:19,457
So that's one approach to the chemistry casino. The other is to fake randomization,

371
00:23:19,637 --> 00:23:21,118
a rigged casino, if you will.

372
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,673
And this is where narrative really comes in.

373
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,495
Because even if the player can just

374
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:28,816
keep picking the right option and lock

375
00:23:28,856 --> 00:23:31,818
in a guaranteed romance, the narrative and other systems

376
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:34,000
can make the relationship feel like luck.

377
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,082
And yes, some people will filter it out and post a walkthrough.

378
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:39,884
But you can ensure that those that go in blind still

379
00:23:39,944 --> 00:23:41,566
experience that feeling of gambling

380
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:42,987
with their heart or loins.

381
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:44,428
So how do you do that?

382
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:47,990
Well, one of the easiest things to do is to hide everything.

383
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,971
More specifically.

384
00:23:49,357 --> 00:23:55,519
Hide immediate feedback for romance actions. Don't indicate the right choices of what the NPCs think

385
00:23:55,699 --> 00:24:01,441
or like or think. Keep players in the dark the way real people are in the dark when they first

386
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:07,063
start dating someone. Let them guess, let them stumble, let them experiment. The uncertainty

387
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:12,605
drives tension and that tension is what you can tap into to power your romantic and sexual tension.

388
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:13,525
Now

389
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:18,010
The most obvious way to hide things, obviously, is the UI, making sure that there's no hearts,

390
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:24,973
no pop-ups, no, you know, anything like that. But there is also feedback like that to hide

391
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:30,536
and avoid in writing. In many romances, dialogue gives explicitly clear feedback whether the

392
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:35,978
player's romantic interest is reciprocated or not. But what if your player flirted and instead

393
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:40,620
of that, the NPC just raised an eyebrow, smiled a little bit, and changed the subject?

394
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:44,081
cue your players going, oh my God, what does it mean?

395
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:47,964
Which, you know, is kind of like real dating feels sometimes.

396
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:51,006
So where format and scope allow,

397
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:52,787
lean on things like body language

398
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,609
that can be ambiguous and subtle.

399
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,692
Other ways to make non-random romance systems feel random,

400
00:24:58,952 --> 00:25:02,015
there's the always the old, will they, won't they dynamic,

401
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:04,537
but writing it in a way that makes they won't

402
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,159
feel like equally likely outcome.

403
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,088
you could try approaching it like a sexy romantic whodunit, only in this case the

404
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:16,316
mystery isn't the identity of the killer, but the nature of the feelings involved.

405
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:19,060
and write the eventual connection not as inevitable,

406
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,981
even if it secretly is, but as a lucky win or a little miracle.

407
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,142
And that can mean themes of motifs of happy chance

408
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:28,283
and sexy coincidence, or it could just

409
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:30,424
mean writing to capture that feeling of jumping out

410
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:33,044
of a plane and finding out that, yes, oh my god,

411
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:34,945
your parachute does, in fact, work.

412
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:39,286
In other words, taking a chance, making the leap of faith,

413
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:41,267
and it all working out in the end.

414
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,601
Remember, love and lust can sometimes be uncertain and confusing and possibly even terrifying,

415
00:25:47,102 --> 00:25:49,242
but that makes the successes all the sweeter.

416
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:54,463
To see this in action, I highly recommend checking out the visual novel First Bite,

417
00:25:54,523 --> 00:25:59,285
because it's a great example of random-feeling narrative hiding a non-random chemistry card

418
00:25:59,305 --> 00:25:59,585
tower.

419
00:26:00,165 --> 00:26:04,346
It's an erotic gothic horror dating sim about vampires, where you impress and attract them,

420
00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:09,307
and they will have very hot vampire sex with you, and if you fail to impress them, they're

421
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:10,127
going to eat you.

422
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,051
It's the Dark Souls of dating sims.

423
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:12,832
It's tense.

424
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:14,692
And part of what makes it tense is that

425
00:26:14,712 --> 00:26:16,112
although there are right choices,

426
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:18,853
you can't really guess what they are

427
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:21,794
and you can't always trust what the vampire's responses are.

428
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:23,274
Are they smiling because they like you

429
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,755
or because they're toying with you?

430
00:26:25,175 --> 00:26:26,915
The danger and tension make the sex hotter

431
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:29,616
and the happy ending feels like you just won the lottery.

432
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:35,812
So friends, writers, narrative designers, I came to bury kindness coins not to praise them,

433
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:41,078
but new things can sprout from that soil or, you know, emerge like a zombie, whatever.

434
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:47,184
These two models are in no way the only options for romantic and erotic narrative design,

435
00:26:47,724 --> 00:26:52,109
and there you can probably point out to games that are already using them at least to some degree.

436
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,960
But I hope they'll still be useful frameworks for you all.

437
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,901
I feel like they're great ways to take this tarnished kindness

438
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:02,182
coin dynamic and reforge it with writing and narrative design

439
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:03,183
into something better.

440
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:05,744
And I also feel like they're great ways

441
00:27:05,844 --> 00:27:08,464
to tell different stories about love and desire,

442
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:11,165
whether it's those forces as unstoppable

443
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:14,346
or whether it's just little impossible daily miracles.

444
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:16,887
Both visions can be beautiful and compelling.

445
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:18,568
It just falls on you and your team

446
00:27:18,608 --> 00:27:20,248
to decide which works best for your game.

447
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:21,889
So to sum up.

448
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:24,383
Go for chemistry, not bland niceness.

449
00:27:24,963 --> 00:27:26,424
Give your NPCs agency.

450
00:27:27,164 --> 00:27:29,825
Use every game system to tell love and sex stories.

451
00:27:30,545 --> 00:27:32,425
Explore the design and narrative differences

452
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:34,706
between randomness and predictable outcomes.

453
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:38,327
Keep creating and supporting gleefully simple shallow wish

454
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:38,967
fulfillment.

455
00:27:39,587 --> 00:27:41,947
And create and support content with more complicated

456
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:43,008
realistic visions.

457
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:45,728
Design systems to make heart race.

458
00:27:46,488 --> 00:27:48,369
Write moments that launch 1,000 ships.

459
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:51,810
And create stories about sex and love that take flight.

460
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:57,531
Thank you very much. If you're interested in the talk, Faram, the book, or anything else,

461
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:02,494
I'd love to chat, or you can reach me by email, Twitter DMs, LinkedIn, or friend me on Discord.

462
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:07,577
Check out my book at the store, and have a wonderful and a safe GDC. Thank you very much.
