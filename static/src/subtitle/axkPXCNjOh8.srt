1
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:06,284
First of all, thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:07,825
It's great to see you guys here.

3
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:10,426
My name is Derek Sakamoto.

4
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:13,068
I'm a senior user interface designer on Hearthstone.

5
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:16,590
And I'm here to talk to you about how we went about

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,151
creating an immersive user experience.

7
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:20,192
Really quick bio.

8
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:22,513
I've been at Blizzard for a little over 12 years now.

9
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:25,575
My first job was on World of Warcraft,

10
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:26,716
designing the UI for that.

11
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:30,078
I worked on Vanilla to Wrath of the Lich King.

12
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:33,736
After six plus years of that,

13
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:35,936
it was time for a change for me,

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,617
so I was fortunate enough to be able to move on

15
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:41,277
to Team Pegasus, which in turn became Hearthstone.

16
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:42,497
Yay, right?

17
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:46,958
So for the next 30 minutes, I'm gonna talk to you

18
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:49,419
about some of the high level ideas and principles

19
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,999
that guided us to get Hearthstone where it is today

20
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,140
in terms of UI and game.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,880
So number one is finding your seed.

22
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:57,881
Let's get physical.

23
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,161
And UI gets to sit at the big kids table.

24
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:04,841
Finding your seed, what am I talking about?

25
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:08,083
To me the seed is like a muse, or like a,

26
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:09,965
it's like an image, or a movie, or a song,

27
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:12,587
something for your team that they can all look at

28
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,808
and understand the direction that your game's gonna go in.

29
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:18,231
So before I show you our seed,

30
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:20,492
I'll show you what Hearthstone was like

31
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,534
before we had a core idea to work from.

32
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:26,537
And as a warning, people outside of Team 5

33
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:27,498
have not seen these images,

34
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:29,059
and maybe a lot of people on Team 5

35
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:29,920
have not seen these images,

36
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,641
just because the team is growing.

37
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:34,582
So I introduced to you Warcraft Legends.

38
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,785
This is a build called Fire and Ice,

39
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,406
and this was the build that got us greenlit.

40
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:42,808
And I think at this time we had maybe the Rogue and the Mage,

41
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:44,810
and then Warlock was still a work in progress.

42
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,873
But clearly this is not what we wanted for Hearthstone.

43
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:54,044
Another idea we had was having a world map

44
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:56,766
where you travel across Azeroth,

45
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:58,288
unlocking regions and zones,

46
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,651
doing single-player quests and content to unlock them.

47
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:05,333
And this is actually a screenshot of our Flash prototype.

48
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:08,236
We created the whole game in Flash first,

49
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:10,157
and this was all working.

50
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,979
We had adventures that worked single-player,

51
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:14,141
and those were all done by Ben Broad, I think.

52
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:16,486
And here we go.

53
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:20,230
This is a pre-alpha visual target for our game.

54
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:22,892
And I think everyone's pretty happy that we

55
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:23,733
didn't hit this target.

56
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:26,776
It just has no life.

57
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:27,917
It looks like Tron.

58
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:29,879
And it's super complicated.

59
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,280
This is not what we wanted for our stuff.

60
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,183
And there's a bunch of other stuff that we did,

61
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:35,123
you know, for single player.

62
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:37,725
There's books, there's crazy weird 3D cards,

63
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:38,886
there's hologram cards.

64
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:41,548
I'm just glad I have a job after this stinker.

65
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:43,989
Hearthstone in the Forest, you know,

66
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,370
this mock-up had me stumped.

67
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,692
Eh?

68
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,314
And this was matchmaking, and then,

69
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:53,216
this is a real gem.

70
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:56,558
We knew that when we were doing our matchmaking,

71
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:58,880
we didn't want to have a screen with a counter going up,

72
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,702
you know, just counting, searching for players or whatever.

73
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,002
So we kind of went too far the other way and this is what we

74
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:06,083
ended up with.

75
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,004
Hero.

76
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:07,864
Match.

77
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:12,267
You go and do battle.

78
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:12,968
Right?

79
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:14,749
Pretty awesome, right?

80
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,872
So let the record show that the path to Hearthstone as it is

81
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:23,375
today was not obvious or clear to us.

82
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:27,344
So this is why you need a seed,

83
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:29,266
otherwise you're just running around in the bushes, right?

84
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:30,787
You're just out in the weeds doing whatever.

85
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:34,310
And this video was created by one of our 3D artists,

86
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,732
and it was a result of a super long meeting

87
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:37,893
between me and the artist,

88
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:40,415
just trying to figure out what could we do, you know?

89
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:41,496
What would be our vision?

90
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:50,083
And so, here's this box, you know, you zoom into it, there's a world map, there's zones to choose

91
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:55,328
from, you choose your hero, and it rips open the map and you zoom down into this crazy world where

92
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:59,272
people are battling, right, it makes it feel like it's alive, there's other people there with you,

93
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:06,180
until you find your match, bam, like that, and then you zoom out, and then you're on the game

94
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,380
board.

95
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:08,962
And that's not really Hearthstone,

96
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:10,383
it's kind of Hearthstone today,

97
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:13,704
but I think this really gave us something to latch onto.

98
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:14,924
Like, this could be something, you know,

99
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:15,585
this is pretty neat.

100
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:19,246
And so that's why you need to find your seed.

101
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:23,507
And once this box idea was established,

102
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:25,508
it kind of grew roots into the team,

103
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:27,429
into the team's minds and hearts,

104
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:30,070
and it grew strength and was able to grow up

105
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,431
into this tree, and it branched out

106
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:33,611
and created all kinds of different fruits,

107
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:34,712
which I'm about to show you.

108
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:37,705
So this is our box if you haven't seen it,

109
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:38,506
if you haven't played our game.

110
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,827
And once we had that, we had a framework

111
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:44,788
for what we wanted to do with our UI.

112
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:47,449
You know, it feels like maybe a jewelry box

113
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,189
or a music box or something.

114
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,510
And it became more obvious about how this stuff

115
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:51,970
was gonna work.

116
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,531
We wanted little trays and little things like keys

117
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,212
that would kind of fit in that environment.

118
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,333
And came up with the making,

119
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:02,014
an idea for making lame loading screens,

120
00:05:02,054 --> 00:05:03,335
like tightening hinges and that kind of stuff.

121
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,224
And then once we had this box, it was always sitting on the table.

122
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:11,008
And we were kind of, one day we got to thinking, where is this table?

123
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:11,409
You know?

124
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,468
And we decided, well, maybe it's in an inn or a tavern,

125
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:16,408
or something like that.

126
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,269
And once we had that idea, it kind of just

127
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,310
created another burst of creativity.

128
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,312
So this is our splash screen for mobile.

129
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:24,173
This is a loading screen.

130
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:25,893
It's like you're walking into the tavern,

131
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,734
pushing open the doors, and there's

132
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:29,475
a really warm, inviting glow coming in.

133
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,377
Except for when the servers are full,

134
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:33,357
and there's a sign outside.

135
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:34,658
It's like, table's full.

136
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,660
But that was pretty cool.

137
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:39,524
And then here's the key art.

138
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:42,125
And we informed the key art, you know,

139
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:44,787
but in turn, the artists who did this

140
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:47,229
really fleshed out the world in the context

141
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:49,571
of playing Hearthstone in the world of Warcraft.

142
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:51,252
And it really got us excited,

143
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:52,253
because that's cool, right?

144
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:57,156
And this is something that was really awesome.

145
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:58,417
Like, this seed was strong enough

146
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:00,298
that we were able to give it to a third party,

147
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,140
and they were able to fully realize that tavern

148
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:04,601
as the BlizzCon final stage.

149
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:05,542
And that thing is incredible.

150
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:07,734
and we're still trying to figure out how we can chop

151
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:09,115
into little pieces and get in the office,

152
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:12,016
but so far, so far no dice.

153
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,097
This doesn't really have anything to do with anything,

154
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,798
except that a lot of us either worked on WoW

155
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:21,840
or are big WoW fans, and our game was inspired by WoW,

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,540
and then it kind of went full circle,

157
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,061
and now it's inside of WoW, which is really cool to us.

158
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:29,683
So the obvious question.

159
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:31,945
Having a CD, that's awesome, right?

160
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:32,346
That's great.

161
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:33,826
But how do you find one, you know?

162
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,768
That's the real question.

163
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:39,289
And having done so, I have no idea.

164
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,751
But I can tell you kind of how we went about

165
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:43,592
searching for this.

166
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,515
In the beginning, we started out with this

167
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,096
really awful, flat, parchment garbage.

168
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:54,438
And then we decided, well, this game should probably be 3D.

169
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,480
And we wanted to be more physical.

170
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:01,356
As a side note, this mockup was called Simon Says, I think.

171
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:02,997
I don't know.

172
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:05,059
And then we knew we wanted more magic as well.

173
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,922
And then on top of that, we wanted to layer some charm,

174
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:10,443
which is kind of one of our things.

175
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,244
And then finally, we kind of said,

176
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:13,925
well, let's really make it feel valuable

177
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:14,746
and feel constructed,

178
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:15,927
and this is kind of where we ended up.

179
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:18,929
So, finding your seed.

180
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,891
The path to your seed is never direct,

181
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:23,673
unless you're super lucky or a super genius or something,

182
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:24,894
which we're neither.

183
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:28,559
you should actively look for it early in your project,

184
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,922
just because it'll make the rest of things

185
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:31,782
go so much smoother.

186
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:33,864
Because it just makes everything better.

187
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:36,687
It makes everything fit and feel like it's one thing.

188
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:39,630
And I think you must find it.

189
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,172
If you want to have a shot in having your game

190
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,554
be something special and have a true vision,

191
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:45,595
I think you need to find it.

192
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,419
Okay, section two, let's get physical.

193
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,120
What the heck does this mean?

194
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:58,338
into development we had been doing 3D UI and I took a step back and was thinking about

195
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:03,102
what the trends were in UI development at the time. It looks like everything is moving

196
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:08,806
to flat UI design. Everything is really slick, really smooth and just completely 2D. I mean

197
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:15,452
it's completely maybe two-tone or something like that. And once we really started thinking

198
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:19,095
about it and thinking about what was right for our project, we kind of just embraced

199
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,757
it. We're like, dude, let's get physical, you know?

200
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:24,556
Physicality can be big for us.

201
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:32,543
I have no idea if this age range is right or not.

202
00:08:33,464 --> 00:08:35,486
This idea of physicality really started to

203
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:38,248
trace roots through all of our project

204
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:41,431
and influence things in expected ways

205
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,893
and some unexpected ways.

206
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,314
It makes things feel valuable.

207
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,876
These are objects people can relate to,

208
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:49,098
the materials people can know whether they're

209
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:52,283
worth something or not because of the gold and gems and these kind of things.

210
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:56,726
And it's important for us because as a free to play game we really want to

211
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:57,207
respect

212
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:00,789
you know players time and money that they spend and give them things that

213
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,370
feel really good.

214
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:07,914
And being a card collecting game, the core experience is opening a pack.

215
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:24,981
So a lot of us, we collected cards as kids, and there's something about opening a pack of

216
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:29,844
cards. There's the crinkle, the foil, there's the smell when you open it. And we kind of used

217
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:35,067
the tools we had, which are visuals and sound, to try to replicate that joyous experience,

218
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:42,332
you know, something that cool. Another thing is that this physicality unifies the

219
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:44,013
experience. I'm going to show you a couple of screens.

220
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,251
This is like our announcement screen for next Rammus.

221
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,612
This is just our matchmaking spinner.

222
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:57,873
And then this is our store.

223
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:00,294
So you're selecting cards and the store moves around.

224
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:03,715
And these are all different UIs, and they

225
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:04,636
live in different planes.

226
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,197
But I think having them all be physical and move

227
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:10,318
in the same similar ways, like there's a lot of bounce going

228
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,138
on, there's a lot of over rotation kind of things,

229
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,280
makes them feel cohesive whether the player realizes it or not.

230
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:19,952
Here is a semi-unexpected one.

231
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:21,173
It's a happy accident with touch.

232
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:24,676
And that Hearthstone was supposed to be,

233
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:26,659
the main platform was desktop.

234
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,441
And it would be nice if we got into tablets,

235
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:31,183
but it was not a sure thing by any means.

236
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,800
And so when we designed things like the cards,

237
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:36,162
they would tilt as you drag them around, and they swoosh.

238
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:38,204
And when you tap the board, dust flies up,

239
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:38,984
all this kind of stuff.

240
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:40,986
Once we translated it to touch, it

241
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:43,427
was a little bit magical to me anyways.

242
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:45,689
And for me, that's the best way to play the game,

243
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:48,391
is with your finger actually moving around these pieces,

244
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:49,852
and it feels like you're part of that world.

245
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:56,713
this is kind of a selfish one. It's fun to work on this stuff. A couple of us like to make

246
00:10:56,753 --> 00:11:01,094
things. One guy whittles. I like to do woodworking on the side. Another guy is into

247
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:06,335
World War II stuff where it's old and you can feel the construction of it. For us to be the

248
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:12,397
geek out on that while we're building stuff is really fun. This is kind of a big one. As a

249
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:12,637
card

250
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:17,970
collectible card game, you really need to have this over the shoulder appeal, which is that

251
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:22,632
someone is walking by and they see your game being played, they need to be interested and be

252
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:28,915
like, oh, maybe that's cool, maybe that's something I should try. As opposed to, you know,

253
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:34,978
it's like this Tom and Jerry stuff. But as opposed to seeing all these words and numbers and

254
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:38,079
just being kind of turned off by the whole thing up front without really giving it a chance.

255
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:46,341
this one is also in for selfish reasons. These are board clickable. These are things to fidget

256
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:53,886
with while you're playing the game. Our 3D guys do a crazy job on these things. And I included

257
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:58,989
this particular one because my two-year-old almost every night asked me to play Hearthstone.

258
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,974
And what he means by that is load up this board and launch that rocket ship. So that's why

259
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:06,434
that's in there.

260
00:12:08,957 --> 00:12:12,580
So another cool unexpected thing is that fans have embraced it.

261
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,384
You know, once, if you design these things to be physical, it's kind of not a big leap

262
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:18,586
to see that they could be brought into the real world.

263
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:21,389
And I think fans are really starting to connect with it.

264
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:26,334
And once they build these things, it really jazzes us up and, you know, gives us, makes

265
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:30,297
us excited because these are things we designed, but people are actually realizing these things

266
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:30,878
for themselves.

267
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:37,326
So we have cakes, you know, we have wooden boxes, we have this thing, which, I mean, it's a

268
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:43,269
play piece, but it's cool that he was excited to make it. Let's just say that. Wallets. And

269
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:47,831
then this cake really takes the cake, if you know what I mean. Like, I want one of these at

270
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:53,193
my birthday. And then this is the holy grail, right? This is the box. And I think everybody

271
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:54,693
wants one of these things. These things are awesome.

272
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:03,514
So this image is terrible, terrifying. I included it because Ben Brode hates it. Makes him

273
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:10,316
feel really geeky. So taking the stance on physical UI, doing this, it's not all roses.

274
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:16,457
There's definite downsides to doing it. But I think if you are aware of the downsides and

275
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:23,880
you have answers and reasons for why they're okay, I think it's good to do these things. So

276
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,200
number one, it's hard to expand.

277
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:28,694
On the left side of that screen, there's our nine heroes.

278
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,317
And it's like, what happens if we add another one?

279
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:33,378
I don't know, right?

280
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,383
But our stance on this is that it's finally crafted.

281
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:40,364
Everything has its place.

282
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:42,086
And we tend to design for now.

283
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:45,528
And what that means is we have tight deadlines.

284
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:48,551
We can't try to foresee everything in the future

285
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:50,433
and make it expandable in all different ways that

286
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:51,413
may or may not happen.

287
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:57,816
So we design for now. And that's why we try to make things have their own little homes. And

288
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:04,821
we do have this tradition on the team of screwing over our future selves. We say, oh, what

289
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:09,244
about this thing? Future Derek will figure it out. He'll be smarter by then, right? And

290
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:14,908
obviously, time comes around and we go, dang, you past Derek, you're such a jerk. And that

291
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:17,450
happens all the time. Just always cursing our past selves.

292
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,810
Another downside is that it's very resource intensive to

293
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,133
create. This is just our collection manager. This is like

294
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:31,177
two years of my life, which is awesome. But these are all the

295
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:33,579
things that we go through to try to get to where we are, you know.

296
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,242
And it may not seem obvious when you look at it, but it's a tough

297
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:42,125
road to get there. And the argument to this is that our game

298
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:42,606
is UI.

299
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:45,930
We don't have huge virtual worlds and monsters running

300
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,290
around.

301
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,272
All we have is our board, and we have the box.

302
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:52,994
So it makes sense for us to invest our resources

303
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:53,475
in doing this.

304
00:14:55,956 --> 00:14:57,537
This is a big knock against us.

305
00:14:57,718 --> 00:14:59,299
This screenshot is from Reddit.

306
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,661
We look at Reddit a lot and are sad sometimes.

307
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:07,324
But this issue is not the most efficient navigation.

308
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:10,086
And so for this example, it takes a ton of clicks

309
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,147
to do something that maybe should

310
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:11,967
be a lot more straightforward.

311
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,422
And our answer to this is that we generally design for flavor over efficiency. We design this box

312
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:23,543
to fold open, the drawers to slide around, all for you to have a sense of place of where you are

313
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:27,384
in this box. You can't instantly jump from place to place because we feel that that kind of

314
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:32,886
disconnects you from the experience. However, when things are this bad, um,

315
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,961
This is going to even get worse when we go to phone,

316
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,083
because some of these screens need to be moved

317
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,724
into two separate screens.

318
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,226
We realize this is a real problem we need to solve.

319
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:43,487
So it's something we're looking at.

320
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,289
And so it's nice to have a point of view.

321
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:49,111
But once things start affecting the player,

322
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:52,554
I mean, we have this in the middle of our campus engraved

323
00:15:52,674 --> 00:15:54,376
in bronze, gameplay first.

324
00:15:54,936 --> 00:15:58,399
So there's definitely times when you need to make compromises.

325
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,968
This is a future issue, maintaining across multiple

326
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:06,971
platforms. We have desktop, tablet and phone in the future.

327
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:10,614
And I mean, desktop and tablet are pretty similar, which is

328
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:14,957
good. But phone is a complete overhaul. So moving forward is

329
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:18,220
going to be challenging, I think. But from a company

330
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,762
perspective, it's worth it. Take a step back if we can get

331
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:23,003
traction in the mobile space because it's someplace we

332
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:27,347
should probably be going. So let's get physical. Physical UI

333
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,768
is awesome in the right context.

334
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:31,128
There are significant costs of doing it.

335
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,110
It's great for touch devices.

336
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:37,255
And if physicality is not the thing for you,

337
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:39,758
you should find that trait that most informs your games

338
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:41,480
and really run with it to its full potential,

339
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,723
because you'll get a lot of good results out of it.

340
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:48,329
My final point, which is UI gets to sit at the big kids table.

341
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:52,877
And what I mean by this is that,

342
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:55,038
this is not true of every project,

343
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:58,080
but I've seen it where designers come up with a game,

344
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,201
they come up with mechanics,

345
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,423
and then they're like, let's slap a UI on top of this thing.

346
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:04,665
And the other aspect of that is,

347
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:07,087
I've seen UI be kind of a second class citizen

348
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,468
in terms of production.

349
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,689
Maybe they get a dedicated programmer, maybe not,

350
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,251
or maybe a dedicated artist.

351
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:15,213
And so, these are some issues that

352
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:17,715
I think we tried to address.

353
00:17:18,595 --> 00:17:19,376
So we didn't wanna be,

354
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:22,210
off in the corner eating chicken fingers and hot dogs

355
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,293
and spilling milk on ourselves and crying or whatever.

356
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,415
We wanted to be at the big kids table.

357
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:30,199
And so it's a testament to our leadership,

358
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:33,262
I think, that UI design was given a fair shake

359
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:36,145
and was given a parody with game design.

360
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:39,008
And one way this works is that.

361
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,988
Sometimes design would give us very loose design,

362
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:45,930
maybe a couple sentences, and we'd start doing mockups,

363
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:49,272
and then design would come and be informed by those mockups.

364
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:52,575
And it was kind of like a canary in the coal mine situation

365
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:55,036
where if the UI was super complicated looking,

366
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:57,918
then maybe design needed to take a step back

367
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,420
and see what design was causing those complications,

368
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:03,942
and maybe removing those or mitigating those problems.

369
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,804
So here's just an example, here's our play screen.

370
00:18:08,732 --> 00:18:11,413
We used to have a ton of text on this describing the play mode,

371
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:13,754
describing the hero class, and their power,

372
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:15,075
and all these numbers.

373
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:19,597
And we just got rid of it all because nobody reads, right?

374
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:20,318
We know this.

375
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:23,219
And also, we didn't want the screen

376
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:25,180
to be too scary to just frighten people off

377
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,381
before they actually play the game.

378
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:30,263
And they would learn all these details through playing

379
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,923
the game, which is what we want.

380
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:39,030
In this case, we had designed a board and we had the menus that we liked, but only seven fit.

381
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,071
So we're like, well, maybe we'll just shrink them down as you start adding them.

382
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:48,673
And I think we all decided that this was not a good idea because it would mess with the physicality of our stuff.

383
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:55,196
When you see things zooming bigger and smaller, it's subtle, but it affects your perception of the value of these things, I think.

384
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:58,937
And having just a seven-menu limit is an interesting play mechanic, I think.

385
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:03,197
Our decks used to be 60 cards,

386
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:05,160
and that would mean that the area on the right

387
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,862
would scroll three whole pages worth,

388
00:19:07,222 --> 00:19:09,164
and that's really hard to keep in your mind

389
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:09,865
at any given time,

390
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:12,168
and it was a deal breaker for new players for sure.

391
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:15,392
And so we reduced the deck size to 30,

392
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:18,776
and even that is quite formidable to new players,

393
00:19:18,816 --> 00:19:21,278
so we're working on trying to ease that transition as well.

394
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:23,900
This is a pretty old mechanic.

395
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,142
The priest's hero power used to give the next minion you play

396
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:28,543
plus one attack and plus one health.

397
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,785
And so we need to show that on the board.

398
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:34,288
And clearly, it clutters up the board with more numbers,

399
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:37,150
and it encroaches into the minion space.

400
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,611
So the hero power was changed.

401
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:40,052
Then that's an example of pushback.

402
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:42,974
And so the priest just heals two from anything.

403
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:47,798
And this is very old, but this is a concept of the chain.

404
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:51,115
where an idea where in card games you play a card,

405
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:53,736
your opponent can play a card in response to that card,

406
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,876
and then you can say, no, no, no, I wanna play a card

407
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:56,697
in response to that card.

408
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:59,137
And you can see this gets really complicated visually.

409
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,578
And so it was on the chopping block,

410
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:03,158
and then from a design standpoint,

411
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:05,219
it really just bogged the game down,

412
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,839
and wasn't cool, so it was gone.

413
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,280
That was the design aspect of it,

414
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,520
and here's the game pipeline version of it,

415
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,341
where we have access to the same resources

416
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:18,382
as the full game, because we kind of are the game.

417
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:20,646
So here I am, the singular genius, right?

418
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:22,687
This is our team around 2012.

419
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:26,169
I'm just toiling away in obscurity, obviously.

420
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,210
But that's not the case.

421
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,271
It's a real team effort.

422
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,972
I mean, a third of our team, we have a design director,

423
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:35,314
art director, 3D guy, designer, and tech artist,

424
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:37,255
all kind of working together on UI.

425
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:42,557
And as we expanded recently, we're a lot bigger now,

426
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:44,939
we doubled our UI design department,

427
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,039
which is, we got another guy.

428
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:53,489
And that's Max Maul over there and he's doing the phone transition for us.

429
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:56,653
And then so now we have even more firepower.

430
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,436
It's crazy what we can do with this team like this.

431
00:21:01,318 --> 00:21:06,884
And so getting to see the players, I wanted to show you what it looks like to take a feature

432
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:09,606
from beginning to end and who's involved with each step.

433
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,901
So here's UI design.

434
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:14,781
This is a version of our wireframing.

435
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,422
This is about as wireframing as we get.

436
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:18,102
We don't use Vizio or anything like that.

437
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:19,483
It's all back of the napkin stuff.

438
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:24,184
So this is UI design and then programming

439
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:26,404
if we think there's some issue that might come up

440
00:21:26,424 --> 00:21:27,805
with our initial sketches.

441
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,205
And now we're just iterating with UI design and 2D.

442
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:33,766
And then at this point, once design feels like

443
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,687
we have the requirements in our mockup,

444
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:37,987
like they may not look good, but at least they're there.

445
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:40,923
then they usually drop out of the discussion

446
00:21:41,004 --> 00:21:42,245
and we just kind of wheedle away,

447
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:44,047
trying to figure things out.

448
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,493
Once we get to a point where we think we have a good idea,

449
00:21:49,513 --> 00:21:51,335
we bring it 3D to look at it and say,

450
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:52,356
is this reasonable?

451
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:55,239
Will these things actually work being modeled out

452
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:56,521
and will they be able to slide under each other

453
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,161
and all this kind of stuff?

454
00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:00,769
And then here, you'll notice there's a big change

455
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:01,429
between these two.

456
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,290
And this is part of our design process

457
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,171
where in the middle of mock-ups, design will find out,

458
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,892
oh wait, we need to show rewards,

459
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:10,053
or we need to have keys that open and close these things,

460
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:10,693
or something like that.

461
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:15,095
So that's why that mock-up changed so drastically.

462
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:17,215
And this is when 3D and programming

463
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,156
are coming in to really start doing production on it.

464
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,457
And then here's the final deal.

465
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,238
This is what it looks like modeled.

466
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,999
And then we bring on tech art to do effects and programming.

467
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,399
So this is it in motion.

468
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:44,258
Yeah, so that's everybody all working in concert. I think the results are kind of cool. So

469
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:55,201
that's how the sausage is made. To recap. Yeah? So find your seed. You know, it will make

470
00:22:55,241 --> 00:23:00,362
your project better and it will save you a lot of work in the long run. Physical UIs are

471
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:06,283
awesome in the right context. And good things will happen if UIs appear to the rest of

472
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:07,323
development. I guarantee it.

473
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:21,227
So that's all I have to say. I'd like to leave you with a little bit of our culture. So thank

474
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:26,292
you all for coming. I hope you have a great GDC. And I don't know if we have time for questions

475
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:26,693
or comments.

476
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:44,639
I was just kind of curious, does Blizzard plan on releasing any tools to the Unity community,

477
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,121
trying to get back to the community, because of obviously their success with Hurston?

478
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,742
Do I need to repeat the question on this?

479
00:23:53,203 --> 00:23:58,765
There are currently no plans to allow modability or anything like that, like kind of what we

480
00:23:58,785 --> 00:23:59,726
did on WoW.

481
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:05,869
Just because of our audience and hopefully we're trying to make a really tight experience

482
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:07,650
for players that's really highly designed.

483
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,520
Go for it. How long did it take to find the seed and how many

484
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,162
people were working on the project up until that time?

485
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:24,705
It's hard to say but I think it was definitely less than ten.

486
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:28,988
And it probably took, it's hard to say because we were also

487
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:31,990
bringing people on but maybe a year or so, something like that.

488
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:38,835
Along the lines of how UI design was influencing game design, I'm wondering if there's been

489
00:24:38,855 --> 00:24:44,818
hearthstone UI design influencing wow UI design, like perhaps with the garrisons or something

490
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:50,640
along those lines? Are you cross pollinating? We have a UI group that meets together, but

491
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,542
there's no explicit cross pollination, but I think people in the company are starting

492
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:59,623
to look at this style and saying that maybe there's something there that we can bring

493
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,224
into other games.

494
00:25:00,484 --> 00:25:00,964
That's for sure.

495
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,122
You mentioned with the Naxxramas where

496
00:25:04,162 --> 00:25:05,844
you had to change your mockups to add

497
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:07,205
like the keys and the rewards.

498
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,566
Were there any other points where things really

499
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,688
changed the way that you had to approach it because

500
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:13,509
of some element?

501
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,531
Or was it more in the direction of where

502
00:25:15,571 --> 00:25:18,873
you could change the priest hero power because the UI needed

503
00:25:18,913 --> 00:25:19,474
it to change?

504
00:25:22,456 --> 00:25:23,437
There's examples of both.

505
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:25,278
I can't think of any off the top of my head.

506
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:26,499
But definitely there's situations

507
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,741
where we just had, this was the mechanic,

508
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:29,801
so we have to deal with that.

509
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:35,670
I can't think of any up the top of my head, but definitely there are sides where we have

510
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,596
to compromise or design has to compromise.

511
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,543
So we all know that Hearthstone have a lot of the brilliant

512
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:44,224
visual effects during the games.

513
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:47,747
But I feel that when we move that to the mobile platform,

514
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:52,171
so constrained by the power of the mobile device,

515
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:54,032
there is a great decrease on the frame rate.

516
00:25:54,313 --> 00:25:56,734
So how do you make the decisions between the trade-off

517
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,196
of a great, brilliant, awesome effect

518
00:25:59,317 --> 00:26:03,620
with a very smooth frame rate to guarantee the experience?

519
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:03,880
Thank you.

520
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,884
This is more of a question for engineers, but...

521
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:10,889
I mean, do you sacrifice some of the effects there?

522
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,473
No, we don't intentionally sacrifice any effect.

523
00:26:13,493 --> 00:26:16,116
We design the coolest effects that we can make,

524
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:18,599
and then smart guys figure out how to optimize it.

525
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,741
Okay.

526
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:21,623
Thank you.

527
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:28,283
So a successful card game usually create a lot of

528
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:31,363
opportunities for illustrators for doing all these card

529
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:32,064
illustrations.

530
00:26:32,484 --> 00:26:36,705
And I want to know where Hearthstone team find all the

531
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:38,445
illustrations for their card?

532
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:41,606
Do they use existing art resource from the Blizzard

533
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:45,907
library, or are they actually hiring and giving commissions

534
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:47,668
to other illustrator create a new card?

535
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:49,149
It's actually all of those things.

536
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:52,591
We have a pool of existing art which we use,

537
00:26:52,751 --> 00:26:54,052
and then if there's things not there,

538
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,034
then we'll commission either external artists

539
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:59,576
or we have internal artists who will handle those things.

540
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:03,519
So there's our art director right there.

541
00:27:06,941 --> 00:27:08,282
Yeah, so it's all those things.

542
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,205
So I'm another UI designer, so it's cool to hear.

543
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:15,175
The big table comment.

544
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:22,100
When you guys were early on in the process,

545
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:26,143
did you make any argument about the validity of the UI design

546
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:29,346
and that, hey, this is as important as the game design?

547
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:34,329
You had mentioned you guys don't have a big world.

548
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,670
It's all UI stuff.

549
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:38,152
So did you make that argument, or did you

550
00:27:38,172 --> 00:27:40,054
show data analytics or anything?

551
00:27:41,715 --> 00:27:46,580
I was very fortunate in that I had worked with a design director for a number of years on World of Warcraft.

552
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,065
And that experience made us really think hard about UI's role in game design.

553
00:27:52,645 --> 00:27:55,468
And so I think we came to an agreement together on that.

554
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:59,652
I did not have to sell somebody on this idea that that's the case.

555
00:28:01,885 --> 00:28:04,567
I think you can look at any kind of board game type

556
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:05,788
translation of that.

557
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:06,949
You can make that argument.

558
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,890
This game is UI.

559
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:08,791
It's important.

560
00:28:08,951 --> 00:28:11,193
And maybe, hopefully, maybe Hearthstone

561
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:12,033
could be an example of that.

562
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:12,774
I don't know.

563
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:15,076
I would like to think that could be the case.

564
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:22,522
During the creation and designing the UI,

565
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:25,424
how much were you locked down with the overall gameplay

566
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:26,285
design?

567
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:27,676
Pardon me? How much?

568
00:28:28,037 --> 00:28:31,559
How much were you locked down already with the gameplay design?

569
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,802
We were locked down in the fact that it was going to be a card game.

570
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:39,924
Okay, nothing else. But the game design was progressing the same way?

571
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:42,846
Yes, they were progressing at the same time.

572
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:46,509
And like I said, they were informing each other of what this could be.

573
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,511
Once we started getting into this physical space,

574
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:53,413
then the design started to think differently about how things work.

575
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:56,255
One more question?

576
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:04,488
How much time do you expect the creation of the Hearthstone UI for phones to take and do you

577
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:07,690
have any planned release date, this quarter, next one?

578
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:17,675
Um, soon? Next couple months is what I can say. It's pretty far along and it's looking pretty

579
00:29:17,735 --> 00:29:25,398
awesome. So. Okay. Thanks. Okay. I think that one more? Okay.

580
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:29,665
Yeah, I noticed that you, in Hearthstone,

581
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,549
you can't really make anything during the other player turn.

582
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,070
Yes.

583
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:37,594
I wonder if this was like an early game design decision,

584
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,436
or if it was like you explained before,

585
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:41,718
also something that was driven by the UI design.

586
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:42,979
This is not.

587
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,342
It was semi-UI, but it was really

588
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:49,346
the designers who didn't like that flow of play, because.

589
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:52,845
you have to pay attention a lot.

590
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:58,027
So it just felt like it wasn't a good flow for us, I think.

591
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,468
And once we switched to the idea of these maybe secrets that

592
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,948
could trigger another play, something like that,

593
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:05,869
it just made it like when it's my turn, it's my turn.

594
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:07,569
I'm trying to solve a single player puzzle.

595
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:09,570
And I think that is kind of the appeal of the game.

596
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,450
And will we get more deck slots?

597
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,711
It took you this long to get this question?

598
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,212
I had to ask it.

599
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:29,048
We know it's an issue and we are looking at it. Yes. That's not like a hand wavy answer. It's

600
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:34,834
really something that's on our radar. Okay. That about does it. Thank you so much.
