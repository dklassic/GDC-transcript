1
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:03,342
so

2
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:18,262
So little primer, I was given half hour initially to do this talk and now I have a full hour.

3
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:21,803
So we're gonna just go through this and then we'll have a lot of time for Q and A after.

4
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:29,244
So hopefully we can just kind of glide through this and have some interesting discussions on what we're talking about today.

5
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:31,285
So what are we talking about today?

6
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:39,606
I'm gonna guide you through a framework I've been really enjoying thinking about design with, which is treating the player as a performer.

7
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:41,867
So what does this mean?

8
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,171
When we talk about performers, this is a pretty wide range of skills and styles and behaviors.

9
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:53,013
But the unifying thing is that it is something that requires rehearsal.

10
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:54,873
It requires understanding.

11
00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:55,914
It requires communication.

12
00:00:56,414 --> 00:01:03,996
And most importantly, I think this lens brings us an approach that treats the player as fundamentally adding something to our design.

13
00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:04,776
we

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,941
fundamentally

15
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,559
generated something special.

16
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,921
But before we go too far into that, who the heck am I?

17
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:51,702
My name is Evan Hill.

18
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:55,445
I've had about 10 years experience in the game industry as a designer.

19
00:01:55,585 --> 00:01:58,247
Currently, I'm at Obsidian working on Outer Worlds 2.

20
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,610
And before that, I was at Naughty Dog making The Last of Us Part 2.

21
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:16,555
I've also worked on a few other titles like Torment Tides of Numenera, Solar Ash, Palea, and I've even done a couple talks here before on some of my work on the museum of Last of Us 2 and how we used improv to make a bunch of the weird moments.

22
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:22,837
So, how do we understand gameplay as performance?

23
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:30,019
The best way I've been able to sum it up is no matter what type of game you're making, be it a rhythm game, a fighting game, or

24
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:37,089
cinematic third person action game, you've cast the player as the lead actor, and they haven't read the script.

25
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:46,698
This takes us to the first layer, where I think a lot of level design focuses its understanding, which is this demonstration and communication of what and where.

26
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:48,039
Where does the player stand?

27
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,800
What are they trying to do?

28
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,846
We construct space, craft lighting, and otherwise sculpt the experience to guide the player through the stage,

29
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:03,215
you know, as if we're just gesturing off to stage left, trying to get them to stand where we want them to stand and do what we want them to do.

30
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:08,899
And this is excellent and helpful and essential to all good level design.

31
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,362
But the thing I want to talk about today is a layer beyond that.

32
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:24,791
Not just the layer of telling the player where to go, what to do, but giving them space to discover how to feel while they're doing it.

33
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:26,307
as well.

34
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:49,678
in theater and film.

35
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:52,198
She's basically known as the director whisperer.

36
00:03:52,459 --> 00:04:07,584
She comes in and essentially teaches people who manage actors, performers, and the whole range of a production to be better at collaboration, to provide more consistent, positive relationships between all the collaborators on a project.

37
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:13,026
And I think some of her ideas are massively applicable to our relationship with our players.

38
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:24,098
Also, thanks to the work of renowned dog haver and game liker, Tim Rogers, who I think in a lot of his videos has summed this up very elegantly.

39
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:32,061
He talks at length about playing games multiple times just to, on the second or third time, get it right.

40
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:37,924
To do Cloud Strife justice by performing him the best way possible.

41
00:04:38,484 --> 00:04:39,945
And this goes beyond just

42
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:54,526
beating the boss as quickly as possible, but literally walking around the right way, noticing the right things, being there for Eris or Tifa, depending on the situation, just with his controller and minor interactions.

43
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:58,928
So again, you've cast the player as lead actor.

44
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:00,248
They haven't read the script.

45
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:03,990
It's our job to be an effective director to the player.

46
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:05,951
But how do we actually do this?

47
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:10,033
So the first thing we need to consider is the dramatic persona.

48
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,126
What is the player to this production?

49
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:14,267
What are they trying to do?

50
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,228
Who are they?

51
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:19,391
A lot of games, it's a pretty clear and simple answer.

52
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:26,256
And the result is the often you feel like X. We've all seen it.

53
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:27,017
We've all played it.

54
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:27,757
We all like it.

55
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:30,319
But what are the things that take us there?

56
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:40,047
What takes us to what I call a critical moment where it goes from, oh, I'm role-playing as Batman to I am Batman.

57
00:05:41,286 --> 00:05:52,363
and elevates a performance, even on stage, from just a recitation or a rote rehearsal of a set of gestures into a transformative performance.

58
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,060
That's the whole goal of this talk.

59
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,961
How do we build towards these critical moments?

60
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:02,542
It doesn't matter what we really call it, whether it's a flow, climax, alignment, or vicarity.

61
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,163
We all know what I'm talking about here.

62
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:06,363
We've all kind of experienced it.

63
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:11,765
It's that moment where you feel like you have lived a powerful fictional moment as a character.

64
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:16,346
And it doesn't matter that there was a controller involved.

65
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:21,050
It's that gliding on stage, nailing a performance type feeling.

66
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:29,278
It's when you are playing Batman or Spider-Man where you were just in it, when you're kicking ass or saving the day.

67
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:34,523
And again, we're gonna be using Judith Weston to help get us there.

68
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:41,957
Her core philosophy is one of connection and vulnerability, and letting go of control.

69
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:55,425
One of the number one things that I think as designers we can relate to is something that directors also feel, is this idea of dictating or micromanaging the experience or just the moment-to-moment delivery of what we've crafted.

70
00:06:56,186 --> 00:07:00,949
And I think if you read anything from her book, one of the best takeaways is just letting go of that.

71
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:05,889
kind of synthesize that into like a six step process.

72
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,631
The first is pretty much the easiest.

73
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:10,312
It's going to be communication.

74
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:14,994
That's the clarity and the type of what and where we've talked about earlier.

75
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:28,063
The next, though, is this idea of cultivation, not only just providing the player with space to navigate, but space to rehearse, space to express and experiment and kind of

76
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:39,159
do the dry run of, say, the boss fight, do the dry run of that big, intense story moment so that when they finally get there, they feel prepared, they feel aligned.

77
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:55,426
And then we take that alignment and we push on it and push on it and push on it with pressure that takes the player from just doing rote rehearsals to actively being the thing, doing the thing without having to consider or plan

78
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:56,976
They're just in it.

79
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:00,980
And that all comes together through our composition to create that critical moment.

80
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,481
Let's get started.

81
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:05,603
What do we mean by communication?

82
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:10,767
For me, the best way we can describe it is facts and motivation.

83
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:13,309
Facts are just the stuff on the ground.

84
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,191
What is happening?

85
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,652
What are the obstacles?

86
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:25,579
But motivation is the much more difficult element of that, which is how do I actually convince the player that they should do the thing that I built the level for?

87
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:31,655
like to want to save the day, to want to get to the end, to want to mess with the gardener.

88
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,677
And I think the first step to that is clarity.

89
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:39,081
Again, going back to like this essential core of most level design.

90
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:42,423
This clarity is the fundamental.

91
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,645
If you do not have this, you're going to be lost.

92
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,967
Players will not be able to navigate.

93
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:49,088
They will not be able to advance the story, advance the game.

94
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:52,231
It's critical, essential.

95
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:57,678
But beyond that, I think we need to focus on the clarity about the facts of the world.

96
00:08:57,858 --> 00:08:59,879
What are the stakes, the characters, the obstacles?

97
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,341
And how we convey that is vital.

98
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:06,302
So a good example of this to me is Pathologic 2.

99
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:13,125
It's excellent at directing the player on where to go, but it's even better at directing them on how to feel.

100
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:20,909
And instead of saying, you should feel desperate and afraid, alone, isolated, constantly on the brink of death,

101
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,153
doesn't need to say that to you.

102
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:24,858
Instead it communicates something very simple.

103
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:30,453
As emphatically as humanly possible.

104
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:37,643
And then the next step is not only just communicating what's going on in the world, but what are the limits of the world?

105
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,384
Where are the boundaries?

106
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:45,207
We all hate it when we deal with invisible walls, but there's more to invisible walls than geometry.

107
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:52,151
There are the gaps in expression, the things that we can't do because we didn't have the scope or the mechanics don't allow for it.

108
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:53,512
And that's

109
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:54,552
of the game.

110
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,696
Cultivate this sense of communication between us and the player where even if in Legend of Zelda I can't say destroy buildings.

111
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:21,699
It doesn't matter because I understand that it's not about destruction.

112
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,322
It's not about Cultivating or building a settlement like in Minecraft.

113
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:39,094
It's about exploration and the game conveys this it establishes the facts of this world and then Critically it lets the player find their motivation it doesn't grab you by the wrist and say explore and

114
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:42,816
It doesn't tell you, oh man, puzzles are great.

115
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:43,937
You should do them.

116
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:47,899
It just puts them in front of you and leaves you alone.

117
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:56,024
And then maybe kind of glances backwards as you mess with your Sheikah slate and start moving magnets around and just kind of nods happily to itself because it's done well.

118
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:58,826
And I think a really good example of this is Goose Game.

119
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:05,570
There is nothing intrinsically in this game that is telling you to be a chaos gremlin.

120
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,053
And yet we all really, really just gravitate towards it.

121
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:16,621
Really the only piece of guidance and signposting this game provides is just the psychotic notebook of this goose.

122
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:19,322
We could ignore it.

123
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:24,424
But instead of telling us to, the game just leaves it there.

124
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:26,765
Just as an option.

125
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:33,088
And then knows that the player, being a human being who likes fun, will take them up on it.

126
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:38,522
So there's no need to try and force or tell the player how to feel.

127
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,083
It's all about cultivation.

128
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:56,069
So when we've established these facts, when we've let go of this idea of demanding the player to feel a certain way and let them feel it themselves, we have that first bit of the engine, about this momentum.

129
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:00,271
They're not only engaged, but they're actively adding to our design.

130
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:03,672
So the next step is channeling that motivation

131
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:06,645
into the character's dramatic persona.

132
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,055
There is a process of rehearsal.

133
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:25,955
There are multiple steps to rehearsal.

134
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:31,857
There's isolating certain elements, certain deliveries, character perspectives, rhythm between actors.

135
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:42,281
All of these things are this long list of checks, like, honestly, like a technical check on an airplane often, that all are required to produce the intended outlook.

136
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:45,562
And games really aren't that different.

137
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:48,343
What is core combat except a rehearsal for a boss fight?

138
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:59,548
What is a low-stakes entry area other than an invitation to experiment and evolve how you view your toolkit and your character?

139
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:04,431
When you're playing Metal Gear Solid, it's not a matter of, oh, what would Snake do in this situation?

140
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:07,132
It's the player deciding who Snake is.

141
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:14,475
Is he the type to constantly fuck with people, leave dirty magazines around, and then shoot people in the back of the head, or sneak in without anybody knowing?

142
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:16,847
and core combat

143
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:34,812
how disagreeable does he come off?

144
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:37,093
Or is he much more of a quiet threatening presence?

145
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:45,195
Like you only just need to look at how many different variations of Shakespeare characters there are to understand the depth and the breadth that this perspective can lend us.

146
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:58,200
And you see it a lot in games too, like really what is a skill tree and a perk tree, but providing the player with ways to validate their choices for the dramatic persona in the context of our systems.

147
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:03,904
what is crafting, if not preparing and customizing for what's to come.

148
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:13,009
Like there's this pre-engagement, this idea of like, oh, we're gonna have a fight scene later apparently, I'm gonna have 18 explosive arrows and it's gonna get messy.

149
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,331
And it all leads to this idea of playable choices.

150
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:23,835
And this is actually Judith Weston's terminology, not something I'm synthesizing for games.

151
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,777
It's the idea that you are presenting your actor or your player with

152
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:33,959
this open space, a blank page to help render out what they feel is valid for this character.

153
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:39,121
This does not necessarily mean dialogue choices or any kind of branching narrative at all.

154
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:51,508
This is the thing that I was talking about earlier, the expressions, the gestures, the rhythm of how a person's delivery goes because fundamentally most theater is linear.

155
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:55,170
Most theater is not some kind of branching dialogue and yet

156
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:57,013
People love acting.

157
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,755
People like all the variations of the performance.

158
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:04,479
And I think games can better utilize this framework for interactivity.

159
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,461
Great example of this is seen all over Naughty Dog.

160
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:10,083
Take, for example, Last of Us 2.

161
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:13,365
We just have this seemingly small throwaway moment with Bear.

162
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,227
He brings you a ball.

163
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:16,788
You're able to interact with him.

164
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,432
And there is nothing stopping you from playing with him for 20 solid minutes.

165
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:25,073
There's nothing stopping you from ignoring him entirely.

166
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:30,076
There's nothing stopping you from taking the ball and throwing it over the fence and listening to him whine.

167
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:36,540
And all of these things help you, as a player, define to yourself who Abby is.

168
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,702
It's not to say, like, oh, Abby's evil or all these other things.

169
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:41,924
Like, this is right after you get control over her.

170
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:47,847
Like, there's a strong argument that all of those options are valid for Abby.

171
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,010
Like, she's having such a bad day or she doesn't want this dog to have a good day, throw.

172
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:54,367
She needs to pick me up.

173
00:15:54,847 --> 00:16:00,069
She's going to play with him for 20 solid minutes while everybody else around her is waiting for her to get the mission started.

174
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,191
Or just ignoring the little guy because she's a little too busy.

175
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:07,032
But notice, the player is the one designing that.

176
00:16:07,252 --> 00:16:08,692
That is not the narrative team.

177
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:09,893
That is not the level design team.

178
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:12,974
They simply provided the stage for them to act this out.

179
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:18,336
So we've channeled the player's motivation.

180
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,636
We've given them tools to express themselves.

181
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:22,177
What's the next step?

182
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:31,188
It'd be one thing to just let the player go off in any direction and kind of scribble all over the screenplay and make edits and additions wherever they want.

183
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:35,110
But fundamentally, we're still putting on a show.

184
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,091
We're still putting on a game.

185
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:38,653
We're still trying to build on our vision.

186
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:41,634
So the next step is one of alignment.

187
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:49,099
Alignment is when the player's dramatic persona adds to the designer's vision.

188
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,440
And I think this is a really

189
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:53,963
Really important way to look at it.

190
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:59,564
A lot of us, even myself included, early on in my career, it was much more about, oh, how do I get the player to do what I want?

191
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:14,027
How do I get the player to just do the thing so that they feel the way I want them to feel and do the things that I want them to do because they're my, you know, little dollhouse toy and I am the master of this world versus, holy crap, they did what?

192
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:22,109
I never even, that to me is way more interesting and way more vital and way more,

193
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:24,030
a lot.

194
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,173
live streamers are as big as they are, even for linear games, for any type of thing.

195
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:46,577
There's this performance quality just intrinsic to any genre, any style that is compelling in and of itself.

196
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:59,626
Even if you don't have an audience, even if you're just playing by yourself at home, I think all of us can relate to Tim Rogers' expression that wanting to play a game the right way, to be the character the right way

197
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:02,285
authentic to them, authentic to the story.

198
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:09,293
And this goes way further than just your standard, you know, premium narrative games.

199
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:11,135
I think the best example is Doom.

200
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:19,325
The original Doom did not need a story and yet many people came away from it with this deranged vibe.

201
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:32,593
and it just fed back into itself into the modern era where it just owns it and provides every tool in the kit to make sure that you like to rip and tear.

202
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:35,155
And the way it does that is with good feedback.

203
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,261
Different games have different styles of feedback, too.

204
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:49,183
Some games can be pretty harsh, intense even, where there's this almost clawing quality to it where it's just going to grab you by the heartstrings and rattle you.

205
00:18:49,643 --> 00:18:51,004
Some games are kind of like Hitchcock.

206
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:53,244
Toby Fox, I'm looking at you.

207
00:18:55,925 --> 00:19:00,166
I don't know if I still forgive him for making me cry that much and the way that he did it.

208
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:03,870
Pathologic is also a very good example of this.

209
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:10,391
But other games can be more like Naoko Yamada or Jodorowsky, where they're much more hands-off.

210
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:19,154
They're much more about letting the player just write their own story, just giving a concise sandbox to build the mood and the character that they want.

211
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:20,975
Legend of Zelda is perfect for that.

212
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:29,237
Think about the choice that you can either beeline to Ganon's castle or spend 600 hours collecting every single Korok Seed while Zelda just waits in the dungeon.

213
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:34,100
What is good feedback?

214
00:19:52,998 --> 00:20:11,488
Like, it's very hands-off, it doesn't punish you in any way for not doing all the gremlin stuff, but the positive feedback, the immediate joy of watching somebody scramble around dealing with your shenanigans is just so enticing that you eventually just opt in to this mental framework that the game asks you to.

215
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:14,650
The Last of Us, also an excellent example of this.

216
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,693
Again, not this deeply punishing sense where if you do something wrong, we're just gonna

217
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:22,394
blow an air horn in your face and say, do it again.

218
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:31,256
We let you rehearse and linger and meander about, get to know the characters, approach combat in the best way that you think.

219
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:32,937
Same with Resident Evil and Dune.

220
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:40,639
They just throw you into an environment and let you deal with what emotions come.

221
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:43,119
Metal Gear, Souls, Hitman.

222
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,341
But another example that we can dig into is what kind of constitutes bad feedback.

223
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:54,867
And to me, that's when it's really just too narrow, or too general, or worse, contradictory and confusing.

224
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:59,188
I could go on for a bit too long, so I'm just gonna cut through this.

225
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:04,970
I don't like Red Dead Redemption 2 because the feedback is so strict and so narrow.

226
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:11,751
If I linger too long in a train heist, air horn, do it again.

227
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:18,313
If I'm circumnavigating around an enemy encampment and wanna go the opposite direction or cut through guns blazing,

228
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:20,034
air horn, do it again.

229
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:25,097
There's a very specific, narrow way to do every one of the story missions.

230
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:39,205
And it honestly just takes me out of it because like, I want to maybe play my cool slick cowboy as this meandering kind of Smith and Weston style character who just does not give a shit

231
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:45,140
But I need to, as Arthur Morgan, give a sufficient amount of shit so that this timer doesn't run out.

232
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,162
And I've always not really gelled with it.

233
00:21:48,103 --> 00:21:50,645
I think Bioshock Infinite's an example of something being too broad.

234
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:56,410
You don't really have any feedback that's guiding you towards a general mindset in that game.

235
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,132
It's just make it through, get to the end of the level.

236
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:03,156
There's not much about the combat system or any environment that

237
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:11,907
gets you thinking about who Booker is as a guy, what his combat choices reflect about his perspective or his ideology, or just even a vibe.

238
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:12,628
Like, is he angry?

239
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,832
Is he melancholic?

240
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:18,517
Or is he just kind of put upon or, uh,

241
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:23,013
Yeah, you contrast it with something like Gordon Freeman.

242
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:25,755
This guy feels still like a scientist.

243
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:33,261
These solving puzzles, coming up with unique solutions, taking a gravity gun into a zombie-infested hellhole and coming out the other side coated in blood.

244
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:34,662
That's interesting.

245
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:36,243
That conveys character.

246
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:41,467
That lets you feel like this kind of mad scientist energy that I think Infinite unfortunately doesn't.

247
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,229
Another example is contradiction.

248
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:47,179
you know, standard ludonarrative dissonance.

249
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,940
Like, who is Nathan Drake?

250
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:56,825
Oh, he's the chipper, good guy, Indiana Jones type character who will also pull off a guy off a cliff and then joke about him as he careens to his death.

251
00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:00,227
That's mixed signals.

252
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:04,850
But that then kind of drifts us to pressure.

253
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,551
So we've given the player feedback.

254
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:09,013
We've gotten them to align with our vision.

255
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:10,754
We've gotten them to express motivation.

256
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,956
We've given them clear sets of what to do, what the boundaries of the game are.

257
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,600
And then we push them.

258
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,521
We throw them into intense situations.

259
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,302
We limit their choices.

260
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,083
We limit their time to react.

261
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,644
And this is where things get interesting.

262
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:36,588
Because, just like with Judith Weston's framework, this type of pressured, risky situation leads to extreme or unconscious actions.

263
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:43,431
And that's where the most interesting performances come from, where the player

264
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,854
has to just scramble.

265
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,574
They're not overthinking it.

266
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:48,415
They're not underthinking it.

267
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:49,896
They're just existing.

268
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:51,396
So how do we do this?

269
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,437
It's pretty simple, honestly.

270
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:56,059
It's intensity, surprise, it's uncertainty.

271
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:02,282
It's anything that destabilizes this rigorous set of rehearsal that we've given them.

272
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:06,904
We've created a safe space for them, and then we break it in some way.

273
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:09,345
We ask them to perform when they're not expecting to.

274
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:11,166
We change the game up on them.

275
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:12,087
We push

276
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:15,249
three times as much as we said we were on top of them.

277
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:20,833
And it leads them to these unique experiences where you're not going to perform perfectly.

278
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:27,138
You're going to maybe use too much ammo or get hit or run away or figure out a new technique just by flailing at the buttons.

279
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:37,766
But a really important thing to understand about this dynamic is what we're essentially forcing the player to do and asking them to do is be vulnerable in these situations.

280
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:39,648
And when we don't

281
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:40,936
at all.

282
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:01,637
But I think Resident Evil is a perfect example of doing this right.

283
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:14,845
Resident Evil, the remake especially with Mr. X, is this constant shifting guide of pressure where you were thinking that you understand the assignment, you understand the layout, you understand the environment, I've got all of my resources, so God, footsteps.

284
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:20,855
Scrambling, running into zombies, turning the corner and seeing him hanging out with a licker.

285
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:21,856
Great.

286
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:23,497
That's what I'm going to remember.

287
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:24,798
That's what I'm going to feel.

288
00:25:24,838 --> 00:25:27,801
That's when I'm not myself playing a game.

289
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:30,103
That's when I'm Leon, scared for his life.

290
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:33,045
And so the important thing is kind of mentioned with

291
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,843
The player is fundamentally being vulnerable in these moments.

292
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:39,105
I'm kind of raw at this point.

293
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:46,851
So we as designers need to understand how to reward these risks, to reward this moment of vulnerability.

294
00:25:46,911 --> 00:26:01,522
And this isn't necessarily to say like, oh, give them resources, oh, give them flashy things, but just cultivate ways to give good feedback, to acknowledge that risk, to acknowledge, to make it feel that like, oh yeah, you got murdered by a licker and Mr. X,

295
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:03,751
but it's fine.

296
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:46,005
But I think this is really critical because this understanding not of just of, oh, the player's cognition, but their emotional cycle through your game is what can then lead us to this holy grail that I've been talking about, this critical moment where we put pressure, we've aligned them, all of these things are in there.

297
00:26:46,025 --> 00:26:47,846
They understand this character now.

298
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,409
And then the next step,

299
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:52,085
on

300
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:13,135
Moments are allowed to do one thing.

301
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:15,276
You can have downbeats.

302
00:27:15,316 --> 00:27:18,696
You can have spaces to build rehearsal, teach the player new skills.

303
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:20,857
You can have moments where you're just dedicated to pressure.

304
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:31,579
You can have moments that are dedicated to alignment, where you're testing to see if the player is understanding some core element of the combat loop or some core element of the character, cut scenes or the variations.

305
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:37,860
Just look at what you're doing, keep it simple, and ask, what is it doing?

306
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,500
And is it doing it well?

307
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:46,875
because as I've kind of been talking through this entire thing, like when we're talking about theater production, it's not a simple, straightforward process.

308
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,876
There are different facets.

309
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:52,659
There's table reads, there's live dress rehearsals, there's one-on-one sessions with the director.

310
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:56,142
All of these things are key steps in building that final production.

311
00:27:57,503 --> 00:28:03,767
But I think also importantly of like this doing one thing at a time thing is we're able to present the player new facets to explore.

312
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:15,193
It's when we do things like increase complexity, demonstrate diverse content, we're able to allow the player to sink further and further in to the breadth of a dramatic persona or style of play.

313
00:28:15,213 --> 00:28:22,358
You know, we give them places to rehearse and prepare to kind of, again, cultivate this character.

314
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:29,513
And for like some really in-depth process on this, I recommend my two other talks on Last of Us 2 Museum.

315
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:34,114
There's basically a lot of what we're talking about just straight there.

316
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:43,756
That style of composition, that rhythm of storytelling that then leads us from who am I, what am I doing to I am Ellie or I am Joel, I'm living in this moment.

317
00:28:44,796 --> 00:28:47,797
And that's where we finally get the critical moment itself.

318
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:49,623
because I've talked about.

319
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:53,806
This is that space where you feel like you're living a fictional moment.

320
00:28:54,747 --> 00:28:59,512
It's more than maximum pressure or the climax of a sequence.

321
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:06,258
It's a substantial act that changes or radically defines this persona that the player has been cultivating for this entire time.

322
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,461
Really key examples of this, it's like the end of The Last of Us.

323
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,705
This is you, being Joel,

324
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:18,826
demonstrating to yourself, to him, and the world what that means.

325
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:24,531
And I think most critically is what's not in this screen.

326
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:27,854
There is no Cress-X to kill the surgeon.

327
00:29:29,295 --> 00:29:30,596
There is no direction.

328
00:29:31,457 --> 00:29:32,418
The player can do it without it.

329
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:39,084
Because they've built trust with us as designers and them as performers that they got this.

330
00:29:40,105 --> 00:29:41,165
They understand what's going on.

331
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:50,641
and that authenticity that that style, that format of moment brings is some of the stuff that stuck with me the most in my entire gaming career.

332
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:57,263
Like, I'm still not over the end of Metal Gear Solid 3, where you're just lingering and the game waits for you to pull the trigger on the boss.

333
00:29:58,403 --> 00:29:59,043
Of course I did it.

334
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:04,045
Or dealing with Old King Alant in the first Demon's Souls game.

335
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:08,286
Like, everything up to that point felt like a dress rehearsal for that motherfucker.

336
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:12,319
The fact that he teleports still is not okay to me.

337
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,261
Or dealing with the Rachni in Mass Effect.

338
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:22,986
For me personally, I did an entire second Renegade playthrough and broke at this moment.

339
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:25,588
I could not bring myself to do it.

340
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:32,152
Even though I had intentionally tried to be this hard, evil character.

341
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,014
At that moment I realized I was lying.

342
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:38,917
that my character was just an asshole with a heart of gold.

343
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:49,142
And then I played through the other two games with this new deepened understanding of a pseudo renegade character that always broke into the right thing at the last moment.

344
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:54,785
And that was because this game provided all of this lead up.

345
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:58,767
It provided space to explore and attempt and experiment and tweak.

346
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,248
And the result was electric.

347
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:09,766
You know, the director doesn't need to be off stage whispering certain notes on the final night of release.

348
00:31:09,886 --> 00:31:14,289
They get to be in the audience because the actors know what they're doing.

349
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,570
They've done a good job.

350
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,031
They've directed them.

351
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,674
And I hope this helps you develop that in your own games.

352
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:27,999
And I kind of want to close out just giving a second, like very big thank you to Judith Weston.

353
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:29,179
I can't recommend this book enough.

354
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:34,332
Special thanks to Tim Rogers and all of his amazing work on YouTube.

355
00:31:34,652 --> 00:31:39,113
If you like anything I've ever talked about, he does this but more for hours.

356
00:31:39,974 --> 00:31:41,795
And it's kind of messed up that he's so good at it.

357
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:43,995
But thanks for listening.

358
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:51,638
We're going to shift to Q&A so we can just kind of use this next half hour to kind of discuss or poke at any questions in this framework and stuff.

359
00:31:51,658 --> 00:31:53,719
Like I said, the original plan for this was a half hour talk.

360
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:55,120
I thought it'd be good to just kind of

361
00:31:56,325 --> 00:31:59,226
do some discussion on this framework, see what you guys think about it.

362
00:31:59,706 --> 00:32:05,948
But before we do that, though, I have one last little thing, a bit of a teaser on something I'm working on soon.

363
00:32:06,128 --> 00:32:17,972
We're gonna be announcing this project tomorrow, but it's not a video game, but it's an experimental thing with audio drama that me and some close friends are doing, so keep an eye out for it.

364
00:32:18,072 --> 00:32:22,933
We're gonna be doing a story-focused studio in addition to a lot of our game work.

365
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:25,374
But yeah, Q&A time.

366
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:40,489
Thank you for the talk, it was very good, thank you.

367
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:46,671
So I wanted to ask about the idea of building up the dramatic persona as the main character.

368
00:32:47,451 --> 00:33:00,033
An example, like Last of Us, most of the game is played with a companion, and throughout that time, the companion is kind of building its own persona, but there are moments where you get to personify that companion.

369
00:33:00,473 --> 00:33:03,374
What's your take on how to handle that situation?

370
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:15,302
So how do we deal with situations where you have a key companion character, an NPC, that you have for most of the game, but then suddenly are presented with control of this character?

371
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:21,625
I think there are a few good ways to do it, but I don't think there's many wrong ways to go about it.

372
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:24,047
I think all of the same ideas apply.

373
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:25,430
what

374
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:42,657
in

375
00:33:57,534 --> 00:33:57,974
for the game.

376
00:34:23,749 --> 00:34:32,517
Hi, thank you so much for the talk, especially as a user researcher, like seeing the player become the actor just like was words for the soul.

377
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:45,508
And I was wondering actually how like play testing or concept testing and like speaking to players kind of led you to this, you know, players as an actor.

378
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:50,721
Yeah, so I think you did actually hit on what really did lead me to this framework.

379
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:55,964
So the question was, how does talking to playtesters and players kind of inform this perspective?

380
00:34:56,284 --> 00:35:12,492
And I think fundamentally, it was seeing how similar the conversations I was having with not only my colleagues who were playing things, but players of work that I've built and contributed and hearing it over the years or just in the cycle of playtests, where it started clicking that, oh, hey, I've

381
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:13,987
read about

382
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:31,542
you

383
00:35:49,437 --> 00:35:58,081
relationship, that feedback loop to somebody to help them not just perform well, but also articulate the emotions that are embodied with that character well.

384
00:35:58,521 --> 00:36:04,724
And that's the other thing that maybe like if I were to expand this talk about that importance for the player themselves to perform a character.

385
00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:11,447
It's not just a matter of like, oh, I'm doing something on stage, but there's something cathartic and deeply therapeutic about

386
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:19,953
performance and that we get to provide that to players with this vulnerable consistent relationship through game design.

387
00:36:24,897 --> 00:36:25,438
Thank you so much.

388
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:31,142
I was wondering if you had any thoughts in terms of

389
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:59,880
allowing the player to feel comfortable being vulnerable with the emotions that they may feel or that you may want them to feel however you want to think about it when playing games especially maybe ones that are not that actually do require more vulnerability for you to feel just as a person you need to feel more comfortable to feel sorrow or melancholy or whatever it is than the joy over killing monsters in doom or whatever

390
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:14,880
How do you apply the ideas in your framework to like priming players to get there the time that you want them to rather than just kind of dumping this request upon them?

391
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:17,319
I think that's a great question.

392
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:29,384
So for the audio's sake, the question is, how do you compensate or build towards environments or situations that are fundamentally more emotionally taxing or vulnerable?

393
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:36,647
It's one thing to get the player aligned with having the joy of killing a cool monster, and another to deal with the loss of a loved one.

394
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:53,077
And I think the question itself I think kind of leads us to where I think doing it right is achieved, which is being very considerate of that fact, realizing that certain emotions need more lead up than others, and that if you don't do that sometimes you do risk

395
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:57,280
alienating or losing people through the shock or intensity of it.

396
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:05,928
I think we took that risk, specifically on The Last of Us 2, and a lot of the negative feedback and intensity around it really resulted from that.

397
00:38:06,008 --> 00:38:18,318
Not to say that I regret or don't think we should have done it the way that we did, but it's more a demonstration of what happens when we do just slam the big red button and let those intense emotions flow.

398
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:34,131
And for those that have played the game and enjoyed it, I think the aftermath, the grieving scene where Ellie cuts to Ellie at the grave and exploring the house is what we tried to do to provide that space to feel very vulnerable.

399
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:40,095
It'd be one thing if we just cut directly midday to Seattle to Ellie slicing and dicing up people.

400
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:41,677
That would not have worked.

401
00:38:42,357 --> 00:38:44,379
Instead, we let you grieve.

402
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,821
But for some people, the lack of a lead up

403
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:51,164
was going to be fundamentally alienating, and that was a risk that we deliberately took.

404
00:38:52,185 --> 00:38:52,445
Thank you.

405
00:38:54,927 --> 00:39:12,883
Hi, I was curious about your thoughts on games that sort of start with that pressure moment before you give the actor a chance to rehearse the role, so like games that start with you fighting a boss you're supposed to lose to or like Dead Space, where almost the first scene is when everything goes wrong and you don't really have a chance to get into the character first.

406
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:18,248
So the question is, what do you think about games where it just starts with pressure?

407
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:27,993
Like an example of being classic Demon's Souls, classic Dark Souls, where here's a big bad monster, you're going to lose to it immediately, or Dead Space where it just starts with the alarm on.

408
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:31,595
I think it really varies on genre.

409
00:39:31,795 --> 00:39:35,497
In both of those cases, I think you can see that it's fairly successful in that, like,

410
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:37,558
disruptive tone.

411
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:42,561
Like Dead Space, I think is very well suited to that because you are never meant to feel comfortable.

412
00:39:43,122 --> 00:39:45,143
It is not a game about the violation of your comfort.

413
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:50,166
It is the constant destabilization of identity and self and your abilities do not get eaten.

414
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,288
And it just starts there.

415
00:39:52,728 --> 00:40:00,413
And it provides the same thing within this framework, which is it's helping align the player with the tone and the direction and the style of the genre.

416
00:40:00,874 --> 00:40:02,335
And then the same thing with Demon's Souls where

417
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:04,457
Yeah, you can't win this boss fight.

418
00:40:04,477 --> 00:40:09,320
And even if you do, we're going to kill you with a chest afterwards because we are not playing the game that you think we're playing.

419
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,461
This is a game about failure.

420
00:40:12,902 --> 00:40:17,665
And so cutting to that, getting that as quickly as possible, I think is vital.

421
00:40:18,146 --> 00:40:28,753
If it was the same setup, but an hour into the game after drip feeding and being only positively reinforcing to the player, I don't think the franchise would have kicked off.

422
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,775
It would have just been, well, it was fun for the first bit and then,

423
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:35,071
derailed the entire thing with the giant demon.

424
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:38,214
So I think there's a time and a place for that.

425
00:40:38,254 --> 00:40:47,902
And it really is just why I think approaching it as a framework is important because depending on the genre, depending on your goals, starting with pressure works or doesn't.

426
00:40:48,262 --> 00:40:49,083
It's very contextual.

427
00:40:50,724 --> 00:40:50,925
Awesome.

428
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:51,225
Thank you.

429
00:40:54,306 --> 00:40:57,972
So when it comes to, first of all, great talk, just phenomenal.

430
00:40:58,132 --> 00:41:07,527
But when it comes to perfect or true endings, do you feel like that hinders player like improvisation or their ability to kind of co-contribute to this work?

431
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:18,233
So the question is for linear or like perfect endings or good endings, do we feel like that limits the player's ability to express in this framework?

432
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:20,673
I would argue mostly no, honestly.

433
00:41:21,614 --> 00:41:34,637
Kind of expanding on what I was talking about, like with the end of Last of Us 2, and like with any good performance, it's often less about the branch or the final state of the world versus what is the actor actually contributing?

434
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:37,578
They're contributing timing, tone,

435
00:41:39,002 --> 00:41:44,845
approach, and it cannot be in, I think, games that have a perfect ending or a linear ending.

436
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:53,490
It's important that that critical moment is not, do I choose to end this race or blow up this building or save these people?

437
00:41:54,071 --> 00:42:01,895
And more like Metal Gear Solid 3, which is all about how long does it take you to pull that trigger?

438
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:07,879
How many times do the gears spin in Snake's head before the game ends?

439
00:42:09,045 --> 00:42:13,329
And that's the type of thing that I find most compelling to me as a player.

440
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:19,053
You know, the ending of Mass Effect 3 was not the part that hooked me the most.

441
00:42:19,113 --> 00:42:33,625
The most interesting thing was a lot of the preamble, a lot of the moments where I'm in the thick of it, performing Commander Shepard, even in combat, where I'm deciding how he's navigating through a situation.

442
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:34,226
What's the timing?

443
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:34,826
What's the tone?

444
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:35,847
What's the approach?

445
00:42:37,145 --> 00:42:41,506
And I think, yeah, servicing that is the way to go when you have a perfect or linear ending.

446
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:59,111
How do you think this framework applies to games without an explicit dramatic persona?

447
00:42:59,732 --> 00:43:09,618
Games where you are creating or projecting into the character and there really isn't a whole backstory or character that's provided.

448
00:43:10,138 --> 00:43:15,382
Do you think this framework works for that or does it not?

449
00:43:16,537 --> 00:43:21,941
So the question is, what about games without an explicit dramatic persona, where there is no Spider-Man for you to be?

450
00:43:22,822 --> 00:43:26,184
I think from hearing your question, you can add to this.

451
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:32,409
A good example of this might be things like a rhythm game or a fighting game, where there's less a explicit character for you to inhabit.

452
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,633
Another example might be Civilization or Rimworld, where you are more this overseeing manager.

453
00:43:38,194 --> 00:43:43,678
But I think even in discussing that, we can start outlining that even in the case of something like a rhythm game,

454
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:47,900
One of the most popular rhythm games of all time is Guitar Hero.

455
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:57,188
There is still this intrinsic property by the fact that you have a human playing your game that they're going to play as somebody.

456
00:43:57,988 --> 00:44:09,578
Be it as the superstar version of themselves or the maestro on the DJ Maxx panel, there's this quality of it where they're cultivating and trying to perform as somebody.

457
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:10,439
Thank you.

458
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:56,210
Yeah, so my question is kind of building off of a couple other ones that I think just got asked, but in terms, actually almost sort of an opposite case from the last one, and just that in the case of strongly linear games, right, often ones that have really strong themes or messages, like, for example, The Last of Us Part Two, I think there's a lot, there's a big camp of people that sometimes feel like

459
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:56,890
Well,

460
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:37,522
to use kind of the techniques you were talking about too, rather than letting the player sort of express that character in their own way, sort of putting them in the shoes of that character and getting them ready to think like that character and feel like, oh, I did do that thing, even if they didn't really actually have a choice to do it.

461
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:38,770
Yeah.

462
00:45:53,937 --> 00:45:54,037
and

463
00:46:12,952 --> 00:46:21,215
create a situation like the beginning of Last of Us 1 where, yeah, sure, you could stand around holding Sarah, but everything is on fire and zombies are running at you.

464
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:22,915
Those are facts of the matter.

465
00:46:23,456 --> 00:46:25,296
So you run to the place that's not on fire.

466
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,377
You don't need any kind of prompting or alignment with that.

467
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:36,860
But as with the previous question, that's also a much more immediate, easy to ramp into emotion than I'm going to kill every person I see in Seattle.

468
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:41,642
And I think fundamentally, there's also something that

469
00:46:42,742 --> 00:46:48,539
I think like applies to theater casting as well, which is kind of being okay with that

470
00:46:49,505 --> 00:46:52,967
a lot of people are going to have different needs and timelines for that.

471
00:46:53,047 --> 00:47:09,636
And it's essentially impossible to cover everybody in the same way that like certain actors might not be good for certain roles, not because they're bad actors, but because the range or the style of the character just doesn't align with their personality or their style of performance or their range.

472
00:47:10,156 --> 00:47:15,419
And I think last of us two kind of presents something that reached a scale where

473
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:25,777
enough people play it where we couldn't ever produce a wide enough bucket to get everybody totally aligned with it 100% of the time.

474
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:30,439
And I think, not to say that I think the process of doing that was perfect.

475
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:42,386
I feel that, yeah, there are some valid critiques on how quickly we try to get you to shift into Ellie's mindset because I think there was, I think, fundamentally an interesting disconnect between the way

476
00:47:43,266 --> 00:47:52,409
the designers of the first game were writing Ellie and understood Ellie and how people playing as Joel perceived Ellie, which is kind of an interesting dichotomy there.

477
00:47:52,489 --> 00:47:55,149
Like Ellie was always this like violent, intense type of person.

478
00:47:55,169 --> 00:47:57,090
That's why she mauled David the way that she did.

479
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:05,112
Like she was always this on edge, kind of vindictive individual who by interacting with Joel was raised to become better.

480
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:10,054
But a lot of people's perception of Ellie was in that myopic view that Joel had for her too.

481
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:22,245
and I think there was a little bit of a disconnect there that yeah some people maybe needed more of a ramp because they weren't just reckoning with Ellie as herself but Ellie as them as Joel remembering her.

482
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:24,127
Cool, thank you so much.

483
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:34,678
Hi, so I wanted to ask something that might not be following a similar train of thought but how do you feel about

484
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:48,205
Things that bring single player experiences, players experiences kind of together without having to directly interact with one another.

485
00:48:48,785 --> 00:48:59,789
The example I'm thinking of is like the end credit scene of Nier Automata where you're asked to wipe your save in order to help players actually finish the bullet hell to complete the game.

486
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:01,450
Are these sorts of things gimmicks?

487
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,251
Are there like meaningful ways to connect players together?

488
00:49:04,703 --> 00:49:11,185
So the question is, are pseudo-multiplayer experiences like the end of Nier Automata interesting ways to connect people together?

489
00:49:11,745 --> 00:49:14,046
I would say most often, more often than not, yes.

490
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:24,809
But I think it's worth kind of emphasizing how interesting and poignant of an ending that was to Nier Automata, because I think it fits really well into this critical moment framework.

491
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:31,051
The game presents you with a choice that the entire game feels like a rehearsal towards making.

492
00:49:32,022 --> 00:49:40,824
Like this idea of sacrificing yourself to help somebody else, giving instead of just going through, after especially being helped.

493
00:49:41,744 --> 00:49:45,144
You do the end credits first with all this help from all these other people.

494
00:49:45,504 --> 00:49:54,886
And I think the fact that it's multiplayer or not is almost immaterial to the alignment and the delivery of the central message to it.

495
00:49:54,926 --> 00:49:58,967
I think it is a brilliant piece of design to do something so outside of the box.

496
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:03,790
because the game up until that point was in no way multiplayer, was in no way linked.

497
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:09,875
So it creates this extra layer of grandiosity, of surprise where it's like, Oh, this is network.

498
00:50:10,015 --> 00:50:13,338
This has been, you know, you've all been living in the same world this entire time.

499
00:50:13,818 --> 00:50:14,259
Oh my God.

500
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:16,420
It's almost like we've been talking about that this whole time.

501
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:17,942
But, uh,

502
00:50:18,939 --> 00:50:23,823
I think yeah, multiplayer connectivity, I think a good example of that is like the entire Souls series.

503
00:50:24,163 --> 00:50:26,285
Like it has that kind of pseudo single player quality.

504
00:50:26,746 --> 00:50:28,027
Death Stranding I think does it well.

505
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:37,315
I think basically as a tool it can be utilized for almost every piece of this framework, giving players space to rehearse, giving players feedback and alignment, letting them perform to others.

506
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:39,777
Like I think it's a really good tool overall.

507
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:41,978
I don't see any negatives in approaching it like that.

508
00:50:42,279 --> 00:50:42,519
Thank you.

509
00:50:45,114 --> 00:50:55,959
One of the more, with Last of Us in that example, one of the big things about that game, at least for me, was that the motivation for Joel and the dramatic persona that the player inhabits changes throughout the game.

510
00:50:55,979 --> 00:50:59,780
I mean, it goes from like, this is a job that you have to do to, oh, here's like a daughter figure.

511
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:08,424
How do you cultivate a change in motivation and a change in the dramatic persona of the player without just kind of forcing it on them?

512
00:51:09,384 --> 00:51:15,407
So the question is, how do you kind of guide the player towards a change in persona without forcing it on them?

513
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:19,809
I think it's really just using the same exact tools to build the persona in the first place.

514
00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:29,653
Like the player is coming from a point of not being one way and then becoming one way, and then as the hours tick by and the game develops and the story turns,

515
00:51:30,413 --> 00:51:55,563
you keep providing those same tools to take Joel from dramatic persona A to B, from Joel the hardened smuggler to Joel the very protective loving dad, because not only are you living through those moments of change with him, because you're fundamentally already aligned, you're already being guided through these things, but then we're just using the same tools over again to not just affect you, but affect Joel.

516
00:51:56,263 --> 00:51:57,424
He's given feedback from the world.

517
00:51:57,484 --> 00:52:01,147
He takes risks and is receiving like punishment and reward for it.

518
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:07,532
He is interacting with Ellie and it is inviting how he sees the world and how he changes.

519
00:52:07,552 --> 00:52:15,279
He's basically going through this exact same framework at the same time as we are and in a way of building a new persona out of it.

520
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:16,440
Cool.

521
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:16,740
Thank you.

522
00:52:23,471 --> 00:52:30,818
I was curious what you think about the designer as a director in a multiplayer experience.

523
00:52:31,038 --> 00:52:34,962
Is there anything that you would do to effectively model this for a multiplayer game?

524
00:52:36,364 --> 00:52:36,584
Yes.

525
00:52:36,704 --> 00:52:42,227
So the question is, how do we look at this framework specifically as the designer's director for multiplayer games?

526
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:44,749
And I think there's a lot that can be applied.

527
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:52,314
It's really just a matter of how the community and the extra material around it gets structured.

528
00:52:53,255 --> 00:53:05,363
Personally, as a fan of Valorant, I think Riot has done an excellent job kind of cultivating and building what it means to play Valorant, what it means to be an agent, what it means to operate inside of this sport.

529
00:53:06,244 --> 00:53:25,998
by a lot of its marketing material, a lot of its design choices, its aesthetics, and then also just how it runs its esports, how it cultivates and builds certain types of character stories and player stories so that when you sit down to play Valorant, you have that sense of like, all right, we are going to be this intense tactical team.

530
00:53:26,058 --> 00:53:29,380
Nobody's going into Valorant to be like, we're gonna goof off like it's Among Us.

531
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,981
We're gonna throw grenades all at once.

532
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:32,983
A lot of people just kind of buy in

533
00:53:33,703 --> 00:53:38,665
and align to this way of playing the sport well.

534
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:57,794
And I think, yeah, the best way to think about that is as a multiplayer game, I think fundamentally, you have to consider a lot of the stuff outside of the core experience itself and really deal with things like community management, marketing, extra material, and that can provide a lot of these same things.

535
00:53:57,935 --> 00:54:02,977
But you have place to rehearse, you have training modes, all these same types of things, and I think it's all relevant.

536
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,567
Hi there.

537
00:54:09,108 --> 00:54:10,951
I want to thank you for your talk.

538
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:12,033
I really enjoyed it.

539
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:38,981
I wanted to ask you if you feel like there might be some inherent risk by playing so hard into all of these different methodologies to get the player aligned with the character, especially in instances like Prototype 2 with Alex Mercer or Last of Us Part 2, where then it feels like a different actor is playing a similar character because it's a computer-controlled character at that point, and it feels like there's that dissonance of what you felt like when playing that character in a new story.

540
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:50,726
So the question is, do you feel any risk of trying to align the player to this character, giving them ownership over something that then you rip away from?

541
00:54:50,806 --> 00:54:57,267
So an example is you play Alex Mercer in Prototype 1, you define who he is, but he's a very different character potentially in Prototype 2.

542
00:54:57,948 --> 00:55:04,289
In Last of Us 2, you play as Ellie and then perceive Ellie outside of your control,

543
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:08,011
and what happens when there's a misalignment there.

544
00:55:08,451 --> 00:55:11,994
I think, yeah, fundamentally there's a lot of risk in that.

545
00:55:12,174 --> 00:55:18,358
Anytime that you're, like I said, it's the same amount of risk I'd feel that you recast a main character with a different actor.

546
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:28,965
I think there are ways to approach doing it, which is, again, being really tight and concise with the alignment, with the style, with the focus of what's happening.

547
00:55:30,996 --> 00:55:31,357
so far?

548
00:55:45,535 --> 00:55:57,862
Showcase how your actions were perceived more than like oh Ellie's doing three more days in Seattle and she's getting even more murdery than you wanted to be murdery with her instead It's feeling more of like the consequences for your actions.

549
00:55:58,062 --> 00:56:12,050
So I think that's a very fine line and an interesting consideration because it's fairly uncommon, but Definitely pretty relevant and I felt that in a lot of other games like Metal Gear Solid 2 is kind of a good example where snakes kind of a dick Yeah

550
00:56:12,529 --> 00:56:15,510
like Devil May Cry 4, you got Dante who's just super silent all of a sudden.

551
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:17,010
Thank you.

552
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:23,692
So I think we're running out of time and it doesn't look like we have any more questions, so I can let you guys out a bit early.

553
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:25,292
Thank you again so much for listening.

554
00:56:25,692 --> 00:56:31,614
If you found this format and this talk really helpful, I hope you guys rate it pretty well and I'll see you around the convention soon.

555
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:39,979
you
