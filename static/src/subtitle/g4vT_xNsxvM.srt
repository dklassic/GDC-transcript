00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,922
Welcome to the party, thanks for coming through.

2
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:17,204
My name is Dave Yonaguden, I'm the creative director over at Studios of Year, and today

3
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:21,787
we're going to talk about how my newbie solo self somehow landed on Xbox Game Pass.

4
00:00:22,627 --> 00:00:26,509
Still not really sure how that happened, but I have a few very educated guesses.

5
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,650
So that's what we're going to talk about today.

6
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:33,492
First off, as a little brief disclaimer, I'm just speaking from my own personal experiences,

7
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:37,695
yours might be very different, and I'm still figuring out this whole thing because video

8
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:38,235
games are weird.

9
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,091
I'll also be talking a lot about Xbox Game Pass, but all the advice I'm giving still

10
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:49,253
applies to any type of platform holder talks or just any company negotiation or relationship

11
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:49,694
in general.

12
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:53,715
So with that out of the way, a little context about myself.

13
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,096
I'm a 22-year-old Cleveland-based developer.

14
00:00:58,257 --> 00:01:01,758
I've been making games for about 10 years now, but She Dreams Elsewhere is my first

15
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,639
commercial big boy title, so to speak.

16
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:09,141
I've also worked in film, directing, screenwriting, photography, and just all types of weird,

17
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:11,162
creative, DIY stuff in general.

18
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:15,726
As for She Dreams Elsewhere itself, it's a surreal adventure RPG.

19
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,348
You're playing as a woman named Dahlia, and you're in a coma.

20
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:22,552
And you gotta figure out how you got into a coma, find a way to wake up, confront your

21
00:01:22,592 --> 00:01:25,875
own inner nightmares, and have a horrible trip you experienced throughout the entire

22
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:26,075
way.

23
00:01:27,596 --> 00:01:28,417
So I'm a little bit biased.

24
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:32,260
I think it looks pretty cool, sounds pretty cool, but I definitely didn't start out like

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,820
that at first.

26
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:37,110
So flashback to four and a half years ago when I first started development.

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,651
I was a wee young lad in my senior year of high school

28
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:45,632
and I was like, hey, I want to make this big game

29
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:49,794
and I think I can finish it in five months while also being a senior and

30
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:53,975
making a feature film for my senior project, so needless to say

31
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:57,176
that didn't work out, but hey, you know, we'll get there.

32
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,814
But still, I knew that if I wanted some metric of success, I had to get the word out there

33
00:02:02,894 --> 00:02:07,377
somehow while having no money or resources of my own, as one does while being a broke

34
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:07,918
high schooler.

35
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,222
So, as you can see, when the game first started out in development, it was a lot more colorful

36
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:18,506
and cartoony, but also a bit rough on polish and a little bit generic, if I'm being totally

37
00:02:18,546 --> 00:02:18,846
honest.

38
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:23,530
But still, I was like, gotta get the word out there somehow, and I gotta get on Steam.

39
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:27,657
so i posted the game on steam greenlight when it was still active back in the day

40
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:29,338
and the results were uh...

41
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:30,759
not too hot

42
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:31,899
uh...

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,680
there's some good comments here and there but

44
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,381
a lot of it was pretty negative

45
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:38,722
a lot of it justifiably so

46
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:44,162
And it was a real shocker to me because I had never, I had never like posted any of

47
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:47,723
my games on such a big mainstream site with such a wide audience.

48
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:53,946
So yeah, it was rough at first, but still in my eyes, feedback is still feedback, so

49
00:02:53,986 --> 00:02:54,366
I took it.

50
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:59,728
And what I really ended up realizing is that the game really didn't have its own unique

51
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:00,468
personality yet.

52
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:06,408
And the audience reacted to that and they realized that I really had to do a lot better

53
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:10,769
with the game itself, but I also had to do a lot better when it came to game as marketing

54
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,190
and doing a better job of communicating my vision to potential players.

55
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,331
So I kept at the game, kept developing it throughout the next few years, get the cool

56
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:25,272
black and white aesthetic purely by accident one day, so that was fun.

57
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,253
So yeah, as the game...

58
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:32,891
development progressed, and I grew as a person, the game grew too, and eventually it found

59
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:36,593
its own unique voice and became something that was actually worth paying attention to.

60
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:42,416
So if I had any one big piece of advice throughout this entire talk, it's that if you want to

61
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:45,557
get attention, the game itself has to deserve it first.

62
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:51,440
I think the big thing why Sheenus Elsword had that really negative reaction at first

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,482
was because it really came across as a low-effort RPG-maker game.

64
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:01,348
So yeah, it took me a while to find that unique voice, but eventually I got there.

65
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,050
So definitely be patient, but it is key to actually find that unique voice first.

66
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,012
Because nothing is worse than spending all these years on your precious little child,

67
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:13,693
only for them to get bullied and ignored on their first day of school.

68
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,995
So yeah, that's uh, that was fun.

69
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:19,376
Also, stay hydrated, y'all.

70
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:23,718
It's a rough year out here.

71
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:26,699
You gotta stay safe, stay healthy, all that fun stuff.

72
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:34,760
So yeah, I had to get the word out there somehow still, even with finding my own unique voice.

73
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:39,884
And I still had no money, no resources, and also no clue what I was doing.

74
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:44,507
But still, I had to do something about it, so I went to social media.

75
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:51,232
And that's kind of ironic because I hate social media, still do to this day, but hey, what

76
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:51,572
can you do?

77
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,985
So I mainly posted on social media sites like Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, all that stuff.

78
00:04:58,225 --> 00:04:59,606
And I utilized hashtags a lot.

79
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:05,549
Stuff like hashtag Screenshot Saturday, IndieDev, GameDev, anything that could really just take

80
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:10,951
the game out into a wider audience so I wasn't just, you know, yelling to the two people

81
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:13,472
who followed me at the time.

82
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:15,853
I kept it pretty low-key.

83
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:19,595
There was no big press feeds or big review or any...

84
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:26,269
Any type of hype building, it was just more of me slowly posting bits and pieces of progress

85
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,910
and slowly getting traction as the month progressed.

86
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:34,212
I also leaned on my RPG Maker community a lot too, because the game is also built in

87
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:34,872
RPG Maker.

88
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:41,914
They were great both for support and advice and tips, but also for just having that small

89
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:46,315
initial group of first adopters who will really champion the game in the years to come.

90
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,003
So yeah, after I found my, again, unique voice so to speak,

91
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:54,865
I officially announced it in summer 2018

92
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:57,046
with the nice little teaser trailer

93
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:59,267
and the launch of the Steam page,

94
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:01,649
which another pro tip if you're using Steam,

95
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:04,050
get your page up as soon as possible.

96
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,752
Definitely get that sweet wishlist action going.

97
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,333
I'm really glad I had that huge head start now

98
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:12,855
because if I put that page up like a month before launch,

99
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:15,077
it would just be a pretty bad time.

100
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:19,203
So yeah, it was a much better reaction this time around.

101
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:22,806
But still, even though it looked and sounded good, so to speak,

102
00:06:24,307 --> 00:06:27,149
it still had to play good, since, you know, it's a video game.

103
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,132
And at that point, I hadn't really done a lot of external play tests.

104
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,748
So I went off to my local game dev group, the Cleveland Game Dev.

105
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:36,689
Shout out to them.

106
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,770
And I found out through them that they were going to be splitting up booth costs in an

107
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,610
upcoming convention.

108
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,391
And I was like, oh, that's pretty cool.

109
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:47,573
You know, never really been to a convention before, so might as well give it a shot, see

110
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:48,113
what's happening.

111
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:54,855
So a few months later, I went off to GDEX 2018, my very first convention, and it was

112
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,657
a rough, rough shitshow.

113
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:00,085
But it was very necessary.

114
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:03,047
Like I had absolutely no clue what I was doing,

115
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,608
no clue what to do before showing up.

116
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,109
I came with just only the bare essentials,

117
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:09,090
the monitor, the game, a controller,

118
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,051
a few business cards, and that was really it.

119
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,893
And also candy too, because that works every time.

120
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:17,795
And yeah, it was also first come, first serve,

121
00:07:17,975 --> 00:07:21,797
so I only had the small end of a table,

122
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:23,598
because I arrived like really late.

123
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:26,280
So yeah, that was pretty rough.

124
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:32,210
But still, even in that little dinky state, it accomplished my goal of getting players

125
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,711
hands-on with the game and directly getting their feedback.

126
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:38,172
It also helped that it was still pretty cheap to attend to.

127
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:44,255
The cost overall was about $300 for the weekend, mainly because it was a two-hour bus ride

128
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:47,577
down the road, and I stayed with a college friend while I was there, split the booth

129
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:50,178
costs, and just basically kept things pretty low.

130
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:54,660
But either way, it confirmed to me that there was actually an audience for this game, and

131
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,240
that somehow...

132
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:59,642
they actually liked it, which is pretty cool. I'm not used to compliments, so

133
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:01,744
it was pretty new to me.

134
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:08,551
So the next convention will be DreamHack Atlanta, two months later.

135
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,114
And here are the organizers. They actually reached out to me first,

136
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,619
because they had found my game through some weird channel that they had been

137
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:20,663
doing their thing on. And that was kind of a shocker too, because...

138
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,081
I'm not really used to attention, I'm still not.

139
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:26,342
It was just crazy to see like

140
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,804
who's watching you from afar even when you don't know it.

141
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:33,626
So yeah, I went down to Atlanta, got a carpool from a friend.

142
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:37,028
And this one was a much bigger convention.

143
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:42,161
And it was also a weird dynamic too, because it was like, heavily eSports focused.

144
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:48,105
So you had like these big names like Halo, Overwatch, CSGO, like on one side, and then

145
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:53,408
right across the aisle was just my tiny ass pixel art narrative based indie game, and

146
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:56,771
I'm just like, please just play my game, like I'm just, I don't know what I'm doing, just

147
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,491
give me something.

148
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,873
Um, so that was weird.

149
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:03,104
But even still, I got really great feedback.

150
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:04,705
I even won best art house that year.

151
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:08,169
And it was a great chance for me to just go outside my comfort zone.

152
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,813
Both in terms of event setting and also just socializing with players.

153
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:15,917
Because of G-Dex, I didn't really know what to do when people were playing the game.

154
00:09:15,937 --> 00:09:18,880
I would just kind of stand back and watch them from afar.

155
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,703
didn't really know what to do with my hands or like how to talk to people like that

156
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:26,747
um but here it was a lot more natural and i was just talking with players

157
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:31,111
getting their feedback making friends uh just had a pretty good time in general

158
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:35,836
um not sure if i would have done it again if it wasn't as close by or as

159
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,198
cheap because this one was a little bit more

160
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:40,020
expensive but still pretty cheap around like 600 bucks

161
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,100
um

162
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,550
But yeah, it was one of those neat little learning experiences.

163
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,733
And it was good practice for what was to come next, which would be the biggie, GDC 2019.

164
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:55,716
I got into the Indie Mega Booth here.

165
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:59,678
And this is also where I met Microsoft and the Xbox reps.

166
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:04,099
And this is a totally different rodeo compared to the past two events.

167
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,420
Like it had actual networking involved, it was like

168
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,983
all these developers, some big and large, I had no clue what I was doing, I was just some rando there.

169
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:16,524
So yeah, it was definitely a pretty interesting experience.

170
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:20,706
Definitely the most expensive trip up to this point too.

171
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:24,188
A lot of my costs were subsidized thanks to the Indian Megabooth.

172
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:27,229
They provided the actual TV, some audio, the headset.

173
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,771
I really just had to like just bring myself from the game.

174
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:33,478
And it was a much different atmosphere compared to the previous two.

175
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:39,242
Like it had a much more like triple A feel, if we're talking in gaming terms.

176
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:43,965
It was also a lot more precise feedback wise, because like it was other developers.

177
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:47,867
And it was great too, because I actually got to meet a ton of contacts there,

178
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:53,010
like publishers, porting houses, PR companies, just new friends in general.

179
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,531
So that was pretty cool.

180
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:57,462
So I showed off the game for the first two days there,

181
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,743
and the rest of the week was just free for me to just do

182
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:02,085
whatever I wanted to and just make as many connections

183
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:02,625
as possible.

184
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:06,828
And that's kind of a toughie because at that point,

185
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:08,248
I was cool and comfortable,

186
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,849
like just showing off the game itself.

187
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,531
But when it came to actually like networking separately,

188
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:16,473
I was like, I have no clue what I'm doing.

189
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:18,474
I have mad anxiety.

190
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,355
All these people seem to like know each other already.

191
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:22,337
And meanwhile, I'm just in the corner being like,

192
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,994
Hey, how do I talk to y'all? I don't know what I'm doing.

193
00:11:26,014 --> 00:11:27,355
Help.

194
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,476
But somehow, we made it happen.

195
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:36,379
But yeah, here's a very brief guide to networking, how I did it.

196
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,222
Well, first off, just remember that you're always networking, even when you don't realize it.

197
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:47,385
Like, the way you present yourself, the way you talk to other people, the words that gets around about you,

198
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:51,907
you're always pitching, and you're always networking, no matter what you're doing.

199
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:57,012
So yeah, other tip I would have is go out there and talk to people already.

200
00:11:57,452 --> 00:12:00,396
It's a networking event, people are there to meet other people.

201
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:03,359
And ask them questions.

202
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,723
Ask them about their favorite games, their own games.

203
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:08,925
People love talking about themselves.

204
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:13,630
And it was also great for me because I've always just been a listener in general.

205
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:18,782
So it was important to just be an active listener and actually engage with them and see what

206
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:20,663
they're actually saying and all that fun stuff.

207
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:25,086
It goes without saying, but treat people as people.

208
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:26,587
Don't be an asshole.

209
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:32,411
You think it would be pretty obvious, but you'd be very, very surprised.

210
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:38,115
But yeah, definitely go into any of these relationships, business or otherwise, just

211
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,197
try to make a friend first and foremost.

212
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:42,618
At least that's how I always do it.

213
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:48,842
And definitely don't be afraid to reach out to other friends or contacts to help you make those conventions.

214
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:52,064
Have them go out with you when it's safe to do so.

215
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:55,946
Have them introduce you to other people. All that fun stuff.

216
00:12:58,567 --> 00:12:59,628
Master the art of following up.

217
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:02,890
If you are looking for something, give them a way to contact you.

218
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:11,815
Don't waste your time. It's very clear when someone wants something and is just waiting for that time to just slip in and set that bomb off.

219
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:16,448
Yeah, this is a very, very brief guide.

220
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:21,870
If you want a much bigger and much better and much more fleshed out guide, definitely

221
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,191
check out Victoria Trant's Introvert's Guide to Networking article, because it's great

222
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:26,852
and she's great.

223
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:32,654
And yeah, so as you can see in the picture, it was my first time meeting Xbox and that

224
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:34,314
whole rep over there.

225
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:40,676
And yeah, when it came to actually getting onto Xbox and talking to them, I didn't really

226
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:45,801
know what I was doing. I didn't really know how the whole process went. So it was really good to

227
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:50,510
have like a rep there in person to kind of like walk me through step by step just to like see

228
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,832
how to get those initial steps started.

229
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,807
So we kept in contact throughout the coming months.

230
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,850
We met in person again during the Game Desert Color Expo,

231
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,953
another great expo because it was a very targeted,

232
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:02,034
very niche event.

233
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,696
So I was able to directly connect with my target audience.

234
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,999
And so Xbox was a sponsor there.

235
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,780
So we got there in person together

236
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,962
and I received word that they were gonna be

237
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:15,425
having a little open house before PAX West next month.

238
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:18,568
And I had never been to PAX West, never been to Seattle.

239
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,553
So I was like, hey, like, you know, you know, definitely consider me if you want to. Let's just keep in touch,

240
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:24,955
you know, keeping it pretty casual.

241
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:30,500
But eventually I was formally offered a spot at the show and I made my way off to Seattle.

242
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:36,215
The open house itself went really well, if not pretty overwhelming.

243
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:38,315
It was directly on their main campus.

244
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:42,517
And again, still having no clue what I was doing, which is to say, I was just there with

245
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:42,837
the game.

246
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:46,398
But again, at this point I was still pretty comfortable showing it off, having learned

247
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:48,339
those lessons in the past few events.

248
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:53,840
And one of the perks of showcasing there was I got a free entry to the first day of PAX,

249
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:58,522
but didn't have a pass for the rest of the weekend until another contact hooked me up.

250
00:14:59,022 --> 00:14:59,482
Shoutout Jen.

251
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:05,234
But even with that free pass, I had no permanent booth, no way to actually straw off my game

252
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:08,536
other than a few scattered events here and there.

253
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:13,399
But I was like, hey, I'm still at PAX, my audience is here, I still want to straw off

254
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,400
the game somehow.

255
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:19,203
So with that, my phone and Instagram became an absolute godsend.

256
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:23,146
My Instagram page is essentially a little mini-portfolio of the game itself.

257
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,741
So I'd walk around with that, show it to people, casually of course, like not just, you know,

258
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,881
having it out, you know, shilling my game everywhere.

259
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:35,302
And yeah, I just use it as an opportunity to casually connect with other devs and people

260
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:36,343
within the industry.

261
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:44,985
So after the idea of Xbox Open House, I received a few hints that I was going to get a Game

262
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:47,665
Pass deal, but I didn't really know what that meant.

263
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:50,018
and what that involved.

264
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:54,022
But it was formally offered in early October 2019.

265
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:56,904
And it was pretty huge.

266
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:00,787
It's still the biggest financial deal I've ever gotten, ever,

267
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,050
to the point where I had to ask them to repeat the numbers

268
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,171
that I got on our phone call.

269
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:12,088
And while I can't go into specifics, I was given upfront support in addition to the rest

270
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:13,650
of the actual licensing fee.

271
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:18,337
And it was really cool because up until that point, I had just been bootstrapping.

272
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:23,103
The game was just funded out of pocket just through videography gigs and other just random

273
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:23,844
one-off hustles.

274
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:31,918
And I was also doing publisher negotiations at the time too, and the Game Pass deal allowed me to fund the rest of the game,

275
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:38,243
make it profitable, and still do everything I wanted to do with a publisher without even having to get a publisher.

276
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:41,506
So yeah, it was a pretty big deal, but

277
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:50,072
if a big number like that comes certain challenges, and that's where we get into the fun, boring, complicated, legal fun time bit.

278
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,674
What joy, what joy.

279
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:01,456
So yeah, I actually had to really get deep in the biz dev around this time.

280
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:06,661
The very first thing I did was to get a lawyer, and I cannot stress that enough.

281
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:08,722
Please get a lawyer.

282
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:14,988
I can't read legalese at all, so it was really important that I didn't miss out on anything

283
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,110
that could have impacted the game negatively down the line.

284
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,153
So definitely get a lawyer, have them look over everything, have them tell you exactly

285
00:17:21,193 --> 00:17:24,276
what the contract is saying and what you have to do, and yada yada.

286
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:30,146
This also goes without saying, but definitely double check that your other company and business

287
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:31,427
elements are also in order.

288
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:36,030
Like have your company set up, your bank account, all the tax info, all that stuff.

289
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:44,032
So yeah, the entire process from the initial offer to the signed deal was actually pretty

290
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:44,872
short in my case.

291
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:45,933
It was about like three weeks.

292
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:50,114
From what I hear, that's actually pretty atypical.

293
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:56,217
For a lot of devs, it can be weeks if not months before anything really happens.

294
00:17:56,237 --> 00:18:00,339
So yeah, it really just depends on the situation and just luck too.

295
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,640
So be patient, be persistent.

296
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,981
Nothing's wrong with giving them a little poke if they haven't answered for a while.

297
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:09,063
and don't feel bad about it like at the end of the day like

298
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,365
it's your baby it's your game you gotta do what's best

299
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:16,287
for it and you gotta like have all as much info as you want to with it

300
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:20,630
uh so with that being said this did take up

301
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,373
all of my time at certain points um which really kind of sucks when you're

302
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:26,473
a solo dev because

303
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:33,614
when I'm like heavy in like biz dev tasks or even any tasks that's like not directly making the game

304
00:18:34,194 --> 00:18:38,596
my mind is like, hell hey here's a bunch of ideas and like other stuff for the game itself

305
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:42,058
that you can't work on because you're doing boring business stuff.

306
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:49,140
So if I had to do it all over again I honestly might have just hired someone to just take care

307
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,283
of all that stuff if not for just a few weeks just so I could like focus on what actually matters

308
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:56,283
which is like actually finishing the game.

309
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,840
And yeah, like I said earlier, I was also going through publishing negotiations too.

310
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:11,085
And it was weird because compared to that, the Game Pass offer was a lot more straightforward

311
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:12,946
and simple and so much less stressful.

312
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:14,898
like poster negotiations

313
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:17,399
all required so much extra materials like

314
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,400
demos

315
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,901
pitch decks timelines all this type of stuff

316
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:24,323
versus xbox they were just like hey

317
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,124
we want you on game pass

318
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:28,965
here's a contract you can go with the paperwork cool alright

319
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:30,406
feel free to sign it when you want to

320
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:32,167
yeah it was

321
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:33,607
pretty simple and straight forward

322
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:36,769
but yeah overall it was

323
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:43,315
a lot to handle in general and it came with some unforeseen downsides too.

324
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:49,098
Like one of the feelings that popped up is that there was a much more increased sense

325
00:19:49,138 --> 00:19:51,619
of pressure and depression regarding the actual development of the game.

326
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,021
Like I often felt like I wasn't even good enough to be a developer, let alone to be

327
00:19:56,222 --> 00:20:01,204
on Game Pass or even anywhere else and that I would let everyone down, I would get exposed

328
00:20:01,224 --> 00:20:03,425
for being a fake developer or all that stuff.

329
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,579
Yeah, imposter syndrome, it's not fun.

330
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,520
But that's a whole other separate talk where you get into.

331
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,081
I was also pretty burnt out at the time too,

332
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:17,222
because I was doing so much traveling and promo

333
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:20,103
and all this other stuff unrelated to the actual game.

334
00:20:20,123 --> 00:20:23,584
I didn't really have a good balance of actual development

335
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:26,825
and biz dev, PR, and actually taking care of myself,

336
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,925
which is like the most important part of anything.

337
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:37,205
And because of everything surrounding the deal, I didn't really have much time to actually decompress myself and just chill out for once.

338
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:43,068
Especially since X-19 was coming up in the next month that I had to prep for, separately.

339
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:47,170
So yeah, wasn't really having a very fun time.

340
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:57,795
But one day I chatted with a friend and mentor about it, and he reminded me that ultimately, they wanted me on the service, and that tons of people already seemed to love the game.

341
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:00,924
So, clearly I was doing something right?

342
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:02,085
I don't know.

343
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:06,229
I always just think negatively about just myself and everything that I'm going through.

344
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:07,670
But in any case,

345
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,432
he reminded me to just take breaks,

346
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:12,974
love yourself, love the game, and just

347
00:21:13,594 --> 00:21:15,516
take things one day at a time, because we're all human.

348
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,699
So yeah, definitely talk about these things with someone.

349
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,562
It's hard to keep these things close inside, especially when you're a solo dev,

350
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:24,603
and you don't really have...

351
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,379
really anybody on your team to talk to you about that.

352
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:31,300
So yeah, just let it all out.

353
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,400
Don't keep it in,

354
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,021
because eventually it'll just eat at you,

355
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:38,142
and it'll just negatively impact both just the biz dev side

356
00:21:38,402 --> 00:21:39,682
and just the development side too.

357
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:41,723
And remember that ultimately,

358
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:45,384
they want the best for you, the game, and the players.

359
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:50,025
So yeah, it can be hard advice to actually practice

360
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:50,946
if you're someone like me,

361
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:53,887
who is very bad to even take their own advice, but hey.

362
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:56,344
We're all trying our best out here, y'all.

363
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:01,048
So yeah, even with all that stress, a few weeks later,

364
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:04,231
the deal was actually officially signed, and it was a done-zo.

365
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:07,653
The actual inclusion was announced the very next month

366
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,495
at X19 a few weeks later.

367
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,738
And yeah, even with all that time and stress

368
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:15,100
to finalize the deal, it was still

369
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,822
pretty dope to actually have it announced at an actual Xbox

370
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:21,124
event and have it on stage in front of an audience.

371
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:22,486
It was really cool.

372
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:28,712
So yeah, ever since then I've done a few other deals with both big and small companies.

373
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:33,755
And it was really good to have all this knowledge acquired from that whole shenanigan.

374
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:39,660
So yeah, the actual results of Game Pass will be seen when the game actually releases, which

375
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,362
it's still a few months away, so stay tuned for that.

376
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:46,945
But yeah, what did we learn today?

377
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:52,373
So yeah, definitely have a project that's actually worth the attention first and foremost.

378
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:55,537
Remember that you're always pitching, even if you don't know it.

379
00:22:56,297 --> 00:23:00,022
You never know who's in the corner just watching you from afar, and you never know who actually

380
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:00,963
knows about your game.

381
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:03,706
Treat your contacts as people first.

382
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:05,728
Check in with them.

383
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:06,949
Not just to see, like...

384
00:23:07,976 --> 00:23:12,799
any progress on like an actual biz there front but like hey like how are you doing how are the

385
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:19,483
kids how's your mental health especially in uh the year of covid uh especially important just

386
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:25,607
remember that human element and just treat people as people first um and find and embrace those

387
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:30,990
champions of your game like i said earlier like having that small rpg maker community first that

388
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:36,033
could champion the game it's like this other uh to my target audience first and foremost was dope

389
00:23:36,826 --> 00:23:39,528
But it also applies to just platform holders in general.

390
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:42,730
There are a lot of people within the ID at Xbox team

391
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,712
that knew about the game and were just hustling about it,

392
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,813
talking about it within their internal meetings.

393
00:23:49,654 --> 00:23:50,754
So I think that was really important

394
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:54,557
to keep up that relationship and just really just embrace them.

395
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,319
Be proactive about any opportunities coming up.

396
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:06,888
You know, what I like to do on Twitter is to, like, search and submit your game and, like, see what's happening and see what's upcoming and just

397
00:24:07,448 --> 00:24:11,309
any way I can, like, get the game out there in front of, like, any new eyes was pretty important.

398
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:14,029
Because again, you never know what opportunities will come up.

399
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:15,730
You never know what's going to happen.

400
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,330
But with that being said, take care of yourself.

401
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,371
Don't burn out like I did and don't overextend yourself.

402
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:28,972
I did a lot of events, both in-person and virtual last year, and I was just pooped by the end of it.

403
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:32,527
Definitely look out for that unique money too.

404
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:39,529
And by unique money I mean the money that can only...that's very specific to your situation

405
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:43,231
rather than the standard publishing deals or crowdfunding or stuff like that.

406
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:46,432
And you never know where it'll come from so just be on the lookout for it.

407
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:49,933
If you have questions, ask them.

408
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:50,973
Ask for help.

409
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:52,114
Ask for tips and advice.

410
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:57,376
As my Nana once said, rest in peace, closed mouths don't get fed.

411
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,516
So open your mouth and speak up.

412
00:25:01,192 --> 00:25:06,494
And honestly, sometimes a lot of it was just luck and some of it was like unluckiness too.

413
00:25:06,514 --> 00:25:13,855
I would never, like I never would have even gotten this deal if, you know, the one Microsoft

414
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:17,176
rep actually came by my booth when I was at GDC last year.

415
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:19,097
So you never really know.

416
00:25:19,177 --> 00:25:21,017
It just, it takes weird stuff like that happening.

417
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:25,075
And again, be patient and persistent.

418
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:26,776
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

419
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:29,377
Take care of yourself, take things one day at a time.

420
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:32,659
And like these business deals and stuff like that,

421
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:33,680
they don't happen overnight.

422
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,861
So just keep it chill, be patient.

423
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:39,402
And again, and I can't stress this enough,

424
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:41,624
remember the human element of it all.

425
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:44,345
Cause again, we're all trying our best out here.

426
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:49,888
So yeah, that's my weird little story about Xbox Game Pass.

427
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:57,220
and how I somehow went from being a scrappy, dinky little one-man show to being a slightly

428
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,883
bigger but still one-man show and still having no clue what I'm really doing.

429
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,925
So yeah, game will be coming out pretty soon.

430
00:26:05,686 --> 00:26:06,687
I hope it does well.

431
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:10,569
But yeah, I guess we'll cross that bridge between Conewood.

432
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,972
But for right now, I got a game to get back to.

433
00:26:13,992 --> 00:26:17,254
So yeah, thanks for coming to my talk.

434
00:26:17,354 --> 00:26:18,135
Well, coming to my talk.

435
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:19,095
Watching my talk, really.

436
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:24,025
Have a good one. Stay safe out there. Wear your mask and be excellent to each other.
