1
00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:07,106
My name is Rich Wilson.

2
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:09,468
I'm the level design lead at Arcane Austin.

3
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,989
I'm here to talk about Mooncrash.

4
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:16,431
More specifically, the talk is about questioning dogma.

5
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:18,032
It's about sort of getting the opportunity

6
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:21,574
to take something that you love and break it into pieces

7
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:23,795
and then build something new with those pieces.

8
00:00:23,795 --> 00:00:31,700
And without further ado, there we go, all right.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,080
So the project,

10
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:36,063
And this was a DLC for our core game, Prey,

11
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:37,103
that we launched in 2017.

12
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,304
So the project was defined by the dynamic tension

13
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:43,244
between three major forces that we were dealing with.

14
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,725
The motivation to do something different

15
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,926
and a bit unorthodox to evolve our genre.

16
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:50,646
The preservation of the studio and design team's

17
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:54,147
core values, as well as testing ourselves

18
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:56,568
to see which of those were worth keeping.

19
00:00:56,568 --> 00:00:58,908
And then adaptation to the new problems

20
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:00,909
that we were going to get to solve

21
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:02,889
as we incorporated all of the new ideas.

22
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:06,557
given the direction change from Prey to Mooncrash.

23
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:09,858
So to speak to that, a bit of a sort of digression,

24
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:12,318
a quick summary of Prey and Mooncrash,

25
00:01:12,318 --> 00:01:13,999
just to make sure everyone's on the same page

26
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:16,120
and kind of build a foundation.

27
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,080
So Prey was an immersive simulation.

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,622
It was kind of a hybrid first-person shooter RPG

29
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:25,622
where you had basically alien abilities

30
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:28,283
and science gadgets and tools and things like that

31
00:01:28,283 --> 00:01:29,723
to solve problems that came your way.

32
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:31,442
So it wasn't just about shooting your way

33
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:32,563
from point A to point B.

34
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:33,904
There were guns, but they weren't

35
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:35,445
the only way to solve problems.

36
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:38,448
It was set in this confined,

37
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:41,751
but fully explorable space station orbiting the moon.

38
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:43,813
So you could travel anywhere within the station

39
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,415
as well as without through zero-G travel

40
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:47,756
and things like that.

41
00:01:47,756 --> 00:01:51,139
This design was inspired in part by games like System Shock

42
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,961
and the studio's own history with games like Arx Fatalis,

43
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,823
which was also inspired by Ultima Underworld.

44
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:59,835
We use the term space dungeon colloquially within the studio

45
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:01,776
to kind of express this idea.

46
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:04,977
The objective is to escape the station.

47
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:07,078
It's kind of a science fiction trope

48
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,039
complete with this alien infestation of creatures called the Typhon.

49
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,461
But we added wrinkles to that so it wasn't as tropey, I guess.

50
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:18,802
So there's a psychological element to the game

51
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:21,883
that makes the player kind of question their reality.

52
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:23,443
You start the game in this fake apartment.

53
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:27,169
And upon breaking your window to try to escape

54
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:30,351
the apartment, you discover you're in this simulation,

55
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,832
this sort of observational situation.

56
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:34,792
And for the rest of the game,

57
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:36,373
you're kind of unable to trust your eyes.

58
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:39,354
There's a sort of pervasive sense of unease, basically,

59
00:02:39,354 --> 00:02:41,375
that permeates the game.

60
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,916
There's also this looming moral framework to the game

61
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:48,277
where you have to weigh the fates of everyone on the station

62
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,798
against the people on Earth, against your own life.

63
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:52,819
So it's this sort of immersive trolley problem.

64
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:56,884
with the player's hand on the lever the whole game, basically.

65
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:57,664
So next up is Mooncrash.

66
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:02,066
This was a DLC, again, expansion for the main game.

67
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:05,607
It's a mechanical extension of Prey,

68
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:09,728
so it uses the same player mechanics as the core game.

69
00:03:09,728 --> 00:03:12,189
Weapons, abilities, things like that.

70
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:15,890
First person, we didn't diverge too far in that regard.

71
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,080
The story was adjacent to the main game.

72
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,440
It wasn't really a prequel or a sequel.

73
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,021
It happened kind of alongside.

74
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:24,421
And it was set primarily within a simulation

75
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,562
of a moon base owned by the same company

76
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:29,523
that owned the space station from the original.

77
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:31,704
But the simulation gave us a lot of wiggle room

78
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:33,684
to play with the sort of meta structure of the game.

79
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:37,085
And used a framing story for the narrative,

80
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:38,886
the main narrative delivery,

81
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,647
rather than moment to moment drama.

82
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,267
You're a hacker diving into the simulation,

83
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,528
so your story is separated

84
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,768
from the moment to moment game, basically.

85
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:50,915
One of the player's primary goals while in the simulation

86
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:52,975
is to escape the moon base.

87
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:55,036
And this is part of a list of player directed goals

88
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:57,096
that took the place of Prey's series

89
00:03:57,096 --> 00:03:58,036
of story based objectives.

90
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:00,417
And we'll talk more about this later as well.

91
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:03,758
The game uses a roguelike framework,

92
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:06,139
which means death is incorporated as part of the core loop.

93
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,899
And there's a lot of variability between sessions,

94
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:10,120
among other things.

95
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
I'm gonna use roguelike for simplicity's sake.

96
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,540
I know it's a very contested term,

97
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,321
so don't add me on Twitter or anything.

98
00:04:18,256 --> 00:04:20,497
And a quick rundown on immersive sims as well,

99
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:22,919
I know most of you are probably well versed,

100
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,980
but again, it's a wide ranging subgenre,

101
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,182
so kind of make sure everyone's on the same page.

102
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:30,083
So immersive sims, they're a particular flavor

103
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,504
of first person shooter, RPG hybrid,

104
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:34,945
where we inject an extra level of simulation fidelity

105
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:35,686
into the mix.

106
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:40,458
So it's somewhere between the depth of Dwarf Fortress,

107
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:44,501
and the immediacy and spatial inhabitation of Wolfenstein.

108
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:49,404
So instead of a God's eye view and turn-based progression

109
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:51,566
or whatever, you're actually inside the simulation,

110
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:52,586
touching it with your hands.

111
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:57,750
So this means there might be simulated fire propagation

112
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,771
instead of fire just being a damaged volume

113
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:01,072
with a particle effect attached.

114
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:04,223
AI may have an organic awareness of the player

115
00:05:04,223 --> 00:05:06,404
and their surroundings, instead of magic knowledge

116
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:08,847
of where the player is at all times.

117
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:10,768
And so that's sort of what separates these

118
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:19,816
from other first-person shooters.

119
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:22,638
All right, so first up is the motivation section.

120
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:26,041
This is our first step in the path to developing Mooncrash.

121
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,143
And it's kind of set the tone for everything that followed.

122
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:30,507
We took some creative risks,

123
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:32,108
given the smaller scope of the project.

124
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:33,148
We could have done something

125
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:35,949
that was a standard story DLC extension.

126
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,009
We could have followed the main antagonist

127
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:39,829
from the core game, Commander Dahl,

128
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:42,870
and did like we did with Knife of Dunwall and Dishonored.

129
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,910
We could have even taken the moon base

130
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,431
that we made the DLC out of

131
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:51,812
and did a more story-based A to B kind of adventure there.

132
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:53,892
So this section is about why we did not do that.

133
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:59,126
So one reason was to grow outside of our domain.

134
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,527
So when you go from project to project in AAA,

135
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,908
a lot of the times you're solving

136
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:05,809
the exact same problems every time

137
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:08,210
with very little in the way of innovation.

138
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,391
So are we gonna use lean this time?

139
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:10,672
What are we mapping jump to?

140
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,633
Are we using face buttons for the use?

141
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:13,773
Stuff like that, right?

142
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,155
This doesn't offer much in the way of creative growth.

143
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:18,576
You're solving problems in the same domain

144
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:19,937
and you're not getting to stretch your legs any.

145
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,330
Sometimes this can even cause people to jump ship

146
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,351
and go to other studios between projects

147
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,651
and you're not really learning anything new.

148
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,612
So with Mooncrash, this meant a kind of

149
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:30,572
a cross-genre exploration.

150
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:33,653
We explored some ideas for random level elements in Prey

151
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:35,574
that ended up getting cut for Scope.

152
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:38,055
So we took that and leaned more heavily into that

153
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:40,395
and brought some of that stuff back

154
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:42,056
and more roguelike elements on board

155
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:45,777
because it seemed like a natural extension of those ideas.

156
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:46,677
So once we made that decision,

157
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:48,698
then we could look into the roguelike space.

158
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:50,859
and look at their problems and their solutions

159
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:55,360
and things like that and learn from them basically.

160
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,020
Issues like respawning and persistence,

161
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,401
difficulty escalation, character variety.

162
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:03,041
So games like Spelunky, Rogue Legacy and Risk of Rain,

163
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,422
they were basically master classes

164
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:05,962
in these other spheres of thought

165
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:07,682
that we hadn't really explored yet.

166
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:12,443
And so why did we pick the roguelike genre specifically?

167
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:14,064
Part of it was design team bias.

168
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:16,104
A lot of us were playing some of these games at the time.

169
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:18,165
Risk of Rain, Darkest Dungeon, things like that.

170
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:21,717
A big part of it also is the kinship between the genres.

171
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:23,639
So roguelikes generally rely heavily

172
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,401
on a player's internalization of systems.

173
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,022
They don't rely on rote memorization

174
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:30,563
and they generally allow for expressive players

175
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,485
and emergent situations.

176
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,287
And a lot of those core values really speak

177
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,668
to what we do in Immersive Sims as well.

178
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,169
So there was a lot of overlap there.

179
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:42,311
So another thing we wanted to do

180
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:45,313
was sort of deconstruct our genre.

181
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:48,657
So searching for these new problems to solve,

182
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:51,119
it afforded us the opportunity to deconstruct our games

183
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:54,221
and basically take the constituent parts

184
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:56,583
and spread them all out and kind of evaluate them

185
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,303
individually, right?

186
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,845
You know, we take for granted that the player

187
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,947
can hack keypads or crawl through events

188
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,508
or things like that.

189
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:06,029
So isolating these parts and then recontextualizing them

190
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,531
and looking at them in a new light means

191
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,713
we could ask ourselves why we use them

192
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:12,774
and why we adopted them in the first place.

193
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:13,435
It's like moving,

194
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,453
between houses and then you have this dog clock

195
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:18,214
that your grandmother gave you and you can finally

196
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:20,755
ask yourself why are you holding onto this thing.

197
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:23,315
It's a win in either case because you either get rid

198
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:25,916
of baggage or you remind yourself why this thing

199
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,937
was important to you and you keep it and take it along.

200
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:32,038
Some examples from Mooncrash, character skill trees

201
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:34,459
for instance, this was something we had on the block

202
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:37,160
and we're looking at and we decided to keep it

203
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,001
and brought it over to Mooncrash.

204
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:41,302
A linear sort of beat by beat narrative.

205
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,474
That was something we examined and decided

206
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:47,017
did not belong in the DLC, so we set it aside.

207
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:54,683
Another motivating factor was DLC being

208
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:57,065
this sort of stable launch pad.

209
00:08:57,065 --> 00:08:59,848
One of the cool things about a DLC project

210
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:02,410
is that usually you're starting with this really extensive

211
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,052
and refined tool set from the previous project.

212
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:08,375
And you've got studio expertise, assets,

213
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,696
and the ability to prototype things

214
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:11,437
really rapidly and extensively.

215
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,110
Your metrics and mechanics are also in place.

216
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,333
This is something you can't really take for granted

217
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,634
because it's very valuable.

218
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:21,656
So even if you're planning to diverge a bit,

219
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:23,838
this starting point can really be immense

220
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:26,900
for prototyping and getting started.

221
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,762
These sort of pre-existing assets and engine

222
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:32,124
and things like that act like a force multiplier

223
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:34,866
for small teams, and DLC are usually small teams.

224
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,268
So as a motivating factor, again,

225
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:40,611
this kind of leverage encourages us to kind of flex a bit

226
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:41,552
and try something.

227
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:46,253
A good example of this as well is we had a game jam

228
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,494
in between the main game and the DLC.

229
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:52,855
One purpose of this was to help the team blow off steam

230
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:56,196
as people ramped off of the project and onto other things,

231
00:09:56,196 --> 00:10:00,557
or onto the next project, but another thing this served

232
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:03,178
was as an incubator for ideas for the DLC.

233
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:07,339
So we had things like VFX laden basketball games

234
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,860
complete with scoring mechanisms and jump pads.

235
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:14,427
We had this dance party involving the Typhon organisms.

236
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:17,608
We even had some things that made it into the DLC,

237
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:21,469
like the tentacle grenade here and the mimic companions.

238
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:24,230
Both of those things actually made it fully into the DLC.

239
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,251
A lot of the content wasn't ultimately used

240
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,011
for anything that shipped,

241
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:29,491
but the exercise was really valuable.

242
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:30,792
A lot of the team members,

243
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,112
they got to play with development tools

244
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:33,112
they wouldn't normally use.

245
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:36,453
They got to kind of step outside of their box for a bit.

246
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:39,877
And it also helped motivate the team to try new things.

247
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:44,401
It was sort of engendering this spirit of exploration.

248
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:52,908
All right, so preserving what we do best

249
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:54,490
and what we love about Immersive Sims

250
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,851
was a big part of this project.

251
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:57,913
It was a big deal because on other projects,

252
00:10:57,913 --> 00:11:00,535
these values generally just tag along as a matter of course.

253
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,897
They're just something we take for granted.

254
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:05,675
But in this project, we were explicitly calling

255
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:09,817
these things into question and sort of explicitly

256
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:12,619
bringing these values along,

257
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:14,460
the ones we thought worked and such.

258
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,621
We also didn't want to lose sight of what worked for us

259
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:18,702
in pursuit of something new,

260
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:19,623
but we didn't want to cling too tightly

261
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:20,343
to dogma out of blind habit.

262
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:23,645
So there wasn't like a clean deconstruction phase

263
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:25,826
that preceded actual development,

264
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:27,187
but as we pared things down in meetings,

265
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,567
we gradually got a more focused picture

266
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:31,509
of the values that we wanted to preserve as we move forward.

267
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:34,664
So one worry early on was,

268
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:37,005
especially from the design department,

269
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:38,486
was that moving to a roguelike model

270
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:41,588
would mean we were completely tossing Arkane's knack

271
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:43,789
for world building and environmental storytelling

272
00:11:43,789 --> 00:11:44,429
out the window.

273
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:48,251
But this was one of the dogmas that we wanted to hang on to

274
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,172
and because we explicitly sort of analyzed it

275
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:51,213
and decided we wanted it,

276
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:53,294
not just because it was something we always do.

277
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:56,336
So this survived the transition,

278
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:57,456
remarkably intact actually.

279
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:00,578
A large part of this is because Arkane's emphasis

280
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:01,678
is usually on player story.

281
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,350
So the bulk of our storytelling work also happens

282
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,912
in the environment, like a lot of our prescriptive stories,

283
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:08,433
environmental stuff.

284
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:10,934
And this worked really well with Mooncrash,

285
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:13,416
because the game takes place in a defined fictional location

286
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,337
and the main character's job was to find out

287
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:18,699
what happened there, and so that pairs very well

288
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,279
with environmental storytelling.

289
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:26,803
So speaking of values, quite a while back,

290
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:29,205
Chris Crawford, he coined the term process intensity.

291
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:32,376
in describing what computers are better suited for

292
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,377
versus what they aren't.

293
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,778
And you can see him here at GDC92,

294
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:39,140
brandishing a sword as you do.

295
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,302
And this is what he said on the subject of process intensity.

296
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:44,224
I'll drink water while people read.

297
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:48,827
So the short version is that processors are more useful

298
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:52,609
with game systems than they are with game content.

299
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:56,712
They're more useful with verbs than they are with nouns.

300
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:01,497
And this is what games can flaunt that other media can't, basically.

301
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:05,882
So immersive sims embody this concept pretty well, pretty heavily.

302
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:09,666
They pull content towards the process end of the spectrum, basically.

303
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:14,231
And we leveraged this more extensively in Mooncrash than we even did in Prey.

304
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:16,293
Part of this was a question of economics.

305
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,170
So if you look at more process intensive games,

306
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,771
they've got a much higher consumption time

307
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:21,632
to development time ratio.

308
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:24,753
If you look at something like Counter-Strike or Quake,

309
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:27,394
for instance, the footprint of one of those levels,

310
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:30,436
you get a lot more hours of gameplay out of one of those

311
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:34,878
than a more linear narrative kind of game.

312
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:38,320
Consumption time's not a be all, end all of games.

313
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,201
I'm not preaching that by any means.

314
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,263
But I'm mainly talking about development economics

315
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:43,803
and how

316
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:46,103
we were able to leverage that.

317
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:47,964
There's a whole spectrum of experiences

318
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:50,405
on the sort of process to content continuum,

319
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:50,925
and that's fine.

320
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:57,208
Now process-intense games also respond more dynamically

321
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,250
to player choice, which is a boon for agency,

322
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,971
you know, the player's sense of having an impact

323
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:02,451
on the game world.

324
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:05,432
There are multiple tiers of agency,

325
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:07,473
and again, this is kind of a recap of Design 101,

326
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:10,355
but low-level agency is stuff like footstep sounds,

327
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:11,635
bullet impact effects, you know,

328
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,236
the enemy's reacting to your presence.

329
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,750
sort of base level acknowledgement of your existence at all.

330
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,951
Then you've got high level agency,

331
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:22,672
which is more narrative impact kind of stuff.

332
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:25,393
Dialogue options based off of the fates of characters

333
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:26,734
or different endings to the game.

334
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:29,775
The lower level agency stuff is much more process intense,

335
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:32,075
while the higher level stuff gets simpler and simpler

336
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:35,196
on the process end, and more intense on the content end.

337
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:38,698
So the fate of the world can just be like a Boolean flag

338
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:41,679
or an integer index that's checked by one script node

339
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,479
at the end.

340
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:45,429
on the content and you're gonna have to author

341
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:47,530
four different cut scenes with voice acting

342
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,392
and things like that, right?

343
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:51,393
So in Mooncrash we didn't retain Prey's sense

344
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:52,634
of higher level player agency.

345
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:55,296
That was something we set aside.

346
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:56,937
You can't really affect the ending of the game.

347
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,299
There aren't any conditional blocks of dialogue

348
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,581
based on your actions or anything like that.

349
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,862
Because monolithic moment to moment story

350
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,204
doesn't play as big a role in that game.

351
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:08,306
It was all intentional.

352
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:09,687
What we did double down on, however,

353
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:11,248
was the lower level agency

354
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:12,869
and a sort of sense of intentionality.

355
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:14,148
in the player.

356
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:21,094
So, again, speaking of sort of core values, right?

357
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,496
As I mentioned earlier, one handy overlap

358
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:26,158
between roguelikes and immersive sims,

359
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,519
and one of our core values,

360
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,342
our core values are a bias towards systems.

361
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:33,064
So the drama and gameplay with both

362
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:35,286
generally relies on novel situations

363
00:15:35,286 --> 00:15:37,587
emerging from the interactions of systems,

364
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:39,169
rather than hand-scripted cinematic scenes.

365
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:41,931
You know, the player's story is paramount in these games.

366
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,113
So a quick example of systemic design,

367
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:46,114
and again this is kind of 101.

368
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:48,076
So let's say there's an ice wall in the game

369
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:50,359
blocking the player's path and the player has to get past it

370
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:53,142
to progress through the game, right?

371
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:56,466
The, there we go, the non-systemic approach

372
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,589
might be to have a variable that's tied to the player

373
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,291
picking up a specific item in the game.

374
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:02,544
and then there's a trigger in front of the wall,

375
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,146
and when the player enters that trigger,

376
00:16:05,146 --> 00:16:08,028
it checks that value, says yes or no or whatever,

377
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:11,872
plays some VFX, Steam, plays an animation

378
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:13,653
as the ice melts away, things like that, right?

379
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:16,896
This is really rigid, it's a rigid relationship,

380
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:19,078
there's a very lock and key kind of thing going on here,

381
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,540
they're not very flexible.

382
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,344
So in immersive sims, you start with the concept of heat.

383
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,842
This abstract concept, heat is a signal that can be

384
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:33,122
passed between objects.

385
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:36,144
And in that case, anything in the world can emit

386
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:37,985
and respond to heat, and so we say, okay,

387
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:39,545
the torch is a thing that emits heat.

388
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:43,507
The wall is something that can respond to heat.

389
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:45,488
And so now, when you get close to the ice wall

390
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:48,270
with the torch, you can say, okay,

391
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,411
the ice wall responds to that by melting.

392
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:51,911
You can do the same animation in VFX,

393
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,752
as in the non-systemic version.

394
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,162
But now you've got these systems that can more dynamically

395
00:16:57,162 --> 00:16:59,945
play off of one another and potentially produce novel

396
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:02,847
and player-driven results and provide plenty

397
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:07,090
of novel scenarios for the QA department in the process.

398
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:10,413
So when I say player-driven, this means the player's

399
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:12,674
conceiving of ways to solve the problem

400
00:17:12,674 --> 00:17:14,776
rather than reading the designer's mind.

401
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:16,937
And that's kind of key to our, again, our values,

402
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:18,979
the things we want to preserve between projects.

403
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:21,820
This also means that in most immersive sims,

404
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,221
the torch won't be the only way to bypass the blockage.

405
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:27,483
There's no real point in having a novel simulation-based

406
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:30,645
system if you're only gonna have one way to solve a problem.

407
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:33,247
But now that you've got heat,

408
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:36,589
now that anything in the world can generate heat,

409
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,190
you can have any kind of heat sources.

410
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,372
You can have a barrel explode next to the wall and melt it.

411
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:46,459
You can have a dragon that breathes fire at you and you dodge out of the way.

412
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:51,340
You can have Channing Tatum dance next to the wall and melt it.

413
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,581
So any kind of thing you want that generates heat.

414
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:59,743
Also this means the torch can also go and live a life of its own as a generic heat source

415
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:03,344
so it can cook food items, it can spread through grass, it can burn enemies, etc.

416
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,747
So systemic design ties back into agency

417
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:18,068
because a player with an expressive set of tools like this

418
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:19,669
in a consistently responsive world

419
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,149
can genuinely have an impact on that world.

420
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:23,230
The consistent rules give the player

421
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,290
a sense of intentionality,

422
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,411
and so that means they can make informed decisions.

423
00:18:27,411 --> 00:18:28,871
And the emergent nature of the game

424
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:32,272
can provide surprises and novel results

425
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:33,733
so things don't get too stale or predictable,

426
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,753
and it's kind of a balancing act, right?

427
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:38,154
Like making sure things are interesting enough

428
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:40,275
but also predictable enough,

429
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:42,315
and you have to have kind of found the sweet spot there.

430
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:48,266
So one example of systemic design in Mooncrash

431
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:51,428
is the player learns there are these devices

432
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,590
called Typhon gates, and they block your passage

433
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,611
if there are enemies nearby.

434
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,973
So you can see the gate there,

435
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:59,455
and it tracks how many enemies are close and all that stuff.

436
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,418
There's an enemy called the Moonshark

437
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:05,780
that patrols and levels underground.

438
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,402
It's blind, so it chases whatever vibrations

439
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:09,663
it can sense in the soil.

440
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:12,385
And it's also massive and really hard to kill,

441
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,087
so the player is disinclined.

442
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,748
from engaging with the thing.

443
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:18,189
So we wanna avoid confrontations,

444
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:21,450
especially in the beginning when the player's weak.

445
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,252
So you have a situation where the Moonshark

446
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:25,332
is near the Typhon Gate,

447
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,413
and how does the player get past the gate, right?

448
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:30,574
So the player can put all of these kind of elements together

449
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:33,516
and decide, okay, I'll throw a projectile really far away.

450
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:35,537
The Moonshark will sense that, it will go chase it.

451
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:39,378
The Typhon Gate will drop, I get to pass through.

452
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,999
And that was all the player's sort of,

453
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,190
generation of the idea, not us saying,

454
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,891
well this is exactly what you have to do.

455
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:47,253
We'll tutorialize it and we'll step you

456
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,334
through all the processes, right?

457
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:50,756
This was sort of a bottom-up kind of solution

458
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:51,517
on the player's part.

459
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:54,219
One metric we use for game objects at Arkane

460
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:56,201
is how many systems interact with them.

461
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:57,622
So the Typhon gates, for instance,

462
00:19:57,622 --> 00:20:01,466
interact with the AI ecosystem, like in the example here.

463
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,067
But they also interact with player progression.

464
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,269
So if you get too many alien upgrades,

465
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,392
the things will actually lock down when you're nearby.

466
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:10,086
They interact with the EMP system,

467
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:13,248
so much like the heat stimulus that I mentioned earlier,

468
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:14,729
EMP is also a stimulus in our game,

469
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:17,391
so you can use any kind of like stun guns

470
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:18,852
or exploding batteries or things like that

471
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,494
to take them down.

472
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:22,215
Player powers also interact with these things,

473
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:23,576
so the player can burrow beneath

474
00:20:23,576 --> 00:20:25,758
or use an EMP power as well.

475
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,500
And this is similar to the thought processes

476
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,601
behind things like the walls of light

477
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:30,982
and Dishonored and so forth.

478
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:35,207
But it may look at first like there are a thousand

479
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:37,147
different ways to get around these things.

480
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:38,688
But the truth is, in the beginning,

481
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:40,888
the player only has a handful of these tools,

482
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:42,949
like one, maybe two tops in the beginning.

483
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:46,130
And then as they gradually progress over the game,

484
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,610
they get more and more tools to get past the things.

485
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,791
So there's this sort of organic process

486
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,292
where by the time the player would be getting frustrated

487
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:54,652
and tired of dealing with Typhon gates,

488
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,172
they have all these expressive tools

489
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,913
to get past Typhon gates.

490
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:59,233
And so it's a problem that kind of actually

491
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,574
takes care of itself over time,

492
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:02,134
and it's this interesting relationship.

493
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:08,659
So why do we make these things?

494
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:11,760
Again, looking at our values, looking at moving forward,

495
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,401
why do we want to keep this stuff around?

496
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,222
Immersive sims can be a sea of chaos.

497
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:18,543
Systems interact in unpredictable ways.

498
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,824
Organic AI awareness means you can put a basket

499
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:23,125
over someone's head and then rob them blind.

500
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,065
If you get too close to a quest giver

501
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:26,286
and you have a torch and they have a broom,

502
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,707
maybe their broom catches on fire

503
00:21:27,707 --> 00:21:29,867
and then they freak out and attack you

504
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:30,808
or something like that, right?

505
00:21:31,242 --> 00:21:34,063
You go to pick up a key card and you kick it into a lake,

506
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:35,503
tons of things, right?

507
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,864
But when you have this terrarium of systems

508
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,284
that interact in these internally consistent ways,

509
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:42,625
these things begin to take on a life of their own.

510
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,266
Instead of depicting something that happened to a player,

511
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:47,766
you're actually building a microcosmic reality.

512
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,867
And the players that these games attract

513
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:51,987
end up falling in love with them

514
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:53,428
because of that sort of internally,

515
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:56,488
I don't know, the sort of small world you're building.

516
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,960
So a large part of Mooncrash was taking these new mechanics,

517
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,522
these sort of roguelike ideas and things like that,

518
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:14,224
and adapting everything to this hybrid

519
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:15,245
that we were creating.

520
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:17,286
A lot of things we took for granted,

521
00:22:17,286 --> 00:22:20,288
we now had to figure out how to work with new ideas.

522
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:24,510
So one of the big things were playable characters.

523
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,451
And this is one of the systems

524
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:28,132
we debated most on the project.

525
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:30,817
Some versions we had one playable character

526
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:34,519
we were gonna have that could be retooled in a lot of ways.

527
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,219
Some versions on the drawing board,

528
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:37,840
we had dozens of variants in the character

529
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,621
that were, there was no real narrative veneer to them.

530
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:43,162
They were just kind of buckets of mechanics.

531
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:45,243
And we settled on what I think ended up working best

532
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:46,484
for our game and our studio.

533
00:22:46,484 --> 00:22:48,145
The characters had names and faces,

534
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:50,666
they had personalities and backstories.

535
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:51,466
And this worked really well

536
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:52,687
with our traditional storytelling methods.

537
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:54,267
We could put a lot into the backstory

538
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:56,168
and then let the abilities kind of speak

539
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:57,189
for the characters, right?

540
00:22:57,189 --> 00:22:58,369
And let the player speak through that.

541
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:01,820
So we took the all-encompassing Morgan

542
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,940
and broke it into pieces.

543
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,981
And then we looked for themes and play styles

544
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:07,061
in those pieces.

545
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:09,002
And there were some that kind of naturally

546
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:10,562
clumped together in this process.

547
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:11,983
And there were many different configurations

548
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:16,724
that we ended up settling on the five that you see there.

549
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:19,125
So yeah, we looked for themes and play styles

550
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,985
in those clumps.

551
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:22,946
So you might have more of a tank character,

552
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:25,667
someone's more of a space wizard kind of guy,

553
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,107
someone's more tech-inclined.

554
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:30,170
And so from those templates, character traits emerged

555
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,732
and we wrote personalities to go with those.

556
00:23:32,732 --> 00:23:35,454
So the tank becomes VJ, the engineer becomes Joan, et cetera.

557
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:40,878
And this approach yielded some really cool results

558
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,239
that ended up solving some problems

559
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:43,980
that we deal with in immersive sims

560
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,403
without that being the intention going into it, right?

561
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:51,426
So first we lost the sort of choice paralysis you can get

562
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:53,607
when you get a massive skill tree presented to the player

563
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:54,428
like right off the bat.

564
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,727
Each character was focused so the player

565
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,647
could make informed decisions.

566
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,408
You know, this character's about dealing damage,

567
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:01,808
so here are my options to do that, right?

568
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:04,829
And all the smaller trees, they had enough wiggle room

569
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:08,349
within them for the player to choose their style,

570
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:09,590
but they were all heavily themed

571
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,930
so the player was making informed decisions.

572
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,691
And this is an example of the Morgan

573
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:16,431
overwhelming suite of powers, by the way.

574
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:20,292
So there was very little overlap in these skills as well

575
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,412
so they could compliment one another.

576
00:24:21,412 --> 00:24:23,493
So maybe one, you know, only Claire, for instance,

577
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:23,993
had hacking.

578
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:27,175
So she could go open doors and then other characters

579
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:32,296
could come in subsequent runs and go through those doors.

580
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:34,837
Vijay was combat centered so he could go clear an area

581
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:36,857
of enemies and you come back as another character

582
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:37,678
and have a bit of a reprieve.

583
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:41,658
So second, since all these characters are mandatory

584
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:42,999
at some point or another in the campaign,

585
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,899
we have the potential for pushing the player

586
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:46,800
outside of their comfort zones.

587
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,000
You know, through the sort of focus skill sets of each one.

588
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:54,417
One thing about RPGs and immersive sims is players tend to gravitate towards a style.

589
00:24:54,417 --> 00:25:00,863
Game after game after game, like I'm the sneaky person, I'm the gun haver, I'm the whatever,

590
00:25:00,863 --> 00:25:02,625
right?

591
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,701
But by pushing other templates in front of the player,

592
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,702
we can make them see the game from different angles.

593
00:25:07,702 --> 00:25:09,063
And I think that's very valuable.

594
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:10,584
It can be a double-edged sword,

595
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:11,985
because some players don't want to

596
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:13,546
step outside their comfort zone.

597
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,307
It's comfortable.

598
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:19,050
But I think everything was under a small enough umbrella

599
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,353
in our game that it worked out okay.

600
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:25,034
Yeah, we weren't making anyone do match three games

601
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:27,676
or cart race or something as part of their character's

602
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:28,017
skill sets.

603
00:25:30,672 --> 00:25:33,474
Third, so by playing characters with a set of affinities,

604
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:34,874
you get out of what I call guilt-driven gameplay.

605
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:37,415
This is the thing I really liked about Heat Signature

606
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:37,776
from Tom Francis.

607
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:40,117
You get these characters that are already

608
00:25:40,117 --> 00:25:42,738
leaning in a direction, so they have a temperament

609
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:44,719
and the associated tools.

610
00:25:45,495 --> 00:25:47,176
to go in a certain direction, right?

611
00:25:47,176 --> 00:25:48,137
So with Dishonored or Deus Ex,

612
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:49,678
you can end up playing the whole game

613
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,780
in a very narrow fashion because,

614
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,701
like in my head, Corvo doesn't kill people.

615
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:56,944
In my head, JC Ditton is never seen by anybody, right?

616
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:59,406
So you kind of self-impose these limitations

617
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:00,847
and that can be, that's fine, right?

618
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:01,828
But you can end up playing.

619
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,711
in a sort of self-flagellating way,

620
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:06,172
where you're like, okay, I was seen by somebody,

621
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:07,833
I'm gonna reload my save.

622
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,973
I accidentally killed somebody

623
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:11,634
because they slid down a hill into the river.

624
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:13,395
I'm gonna reload my save, right?

625
00:26:13,395 --> 00:26:16,716
Even if the game isn't technically saying you failed,

626
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:19,017
you're, again, you're imposing that on yourself,

627
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:21,478
and you end up hating the game in the process sometimes.

628
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,120
So when you're given a variety of characters,

629
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,240
you can break out of that prison for a bit,

630
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,841
because okay, this person is already kind of chaotic,

631
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:29,701
this person is already very violent,

632
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:31,521
and I can do that through them

633
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:33,862
without sullying Corvo's good name

634
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:35,302
or something like that, right?

635
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,403
Some of the best experiences in Dishonored

636
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:40,743
came when players would fail their sneaky approach

637
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:43,244
and then have to sort of improvise in the messy aftermath,

638
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:46,344
playing like a rat-infested jazz in the process.

639
00:26:46,344 --> 00:26:48,805
Those experiences were completely negated,

640
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:50,905
again, when the player would just stop and reload.

641
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,440
This also combats ambient anxiety built up

642
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,341
from fear of missing out.

643
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:58,923
If you're wondering, oh, well, that whole other

644
00:26:58,923 --> 00:27:01,145
skill tree over there, I'll never get to do,

645
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:01,926
I wonder what it's like.

646
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:04,408
Or some players are like, okay, I'll play that,

647
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:06,971
and I'll do my second playthrough with that tree

648
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:08,652
or something like that, and then they never get to it

649
00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:10,874
because they've got a Steam backlog of 500 games

650
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:11,255
or something.

651
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:16,495
So one of the first things we had to decide

652
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:18,956
after choosing to go roguelike with Mooncrush

653
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:21,057
was a model of persistence to use

654
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,118
in the characters specifically.

655
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,318
Traditionally, in our games,

656
00:27:24,318 --> 00:27:26,459
death means you have to go back to the last checkpoint

657
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:27,560
and try again.

658
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,281
Death is outside of the core loop.

659
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,482
It's outside, basically.

660
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:34,263
In roguelikes, however, death is an expected

661
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:35,583
and integrated part of the experience

662
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,144
instead of an interruption to that experience.

663
00:27:38,144 --> 00:27:39,865
Now there are loops, basically.

664
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:41,045
So to adapt to this new model.

665
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,811
We had to decide if we wanted the player

666
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:45,252
to retain some semblance of progress between runs

667
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:47,213
or if we wanted to completely wipe the slate clean.

668
00:27:47,213 --> 00:27:50,675
And then what kind of metastructure we wanted to use

669
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:52,396
to hold the whole thing together in the process.

670
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:54,837
So we looked at Spelunky and Rogue Legacy

671
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:57,118
as our sort of go-to examples of two different models,

672
00:27:57,118 --> 00:28:01,881
two different schools of thought.

673
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:06,043
So Spelunky is this kind of pure expression of replay.

674
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:07,784
You start on the same footing every single time

675
00:28:07,784 --> 00:28:10,745
with the exception of shortcuts, which don't really count.

676
00:28:11,845 --> 00:28:14,026
you get this sort of stateless, timeless feeling to the game.

677
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,007
It's like checkers or chess or something like that, right?

678
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:17,668
Other thing that changes over time

679
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:19,269
is the player's skill level

680
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:21,790
and the game itself is this immutable thing.

681
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,792
And also due to the random generation of the levels,

682
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:27,033
you're learning how the systems interlock

683
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:29,074
instead of memorizing a layout,

684
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,495
you're learning a language

685
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:32,055
rather than memorizing a piece of music.

686
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:33,656
Rogue Legacy, on the other hand,

687
00:28:33,656 --> 00:28:35,117
has a progression system that persists

688
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:35,957
between your trips to the castle.

689
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:37,998
So you're not mechanically expected

690
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:39,539
to be able to beat the game until many runs in.

691
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,580
Some people do it, but they're outliers.

692
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:45,694
But every death, you get to bring experience points

693
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:47,875
and gold and things back to give you

694
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,776
this sort of incremental advancement

695
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:51,397
to push you over slumps in progress.

696
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:55,659
It's a really effective negative feedback system

697
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:57,440
that also keeps you playing in light of defeat.

698
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,322
And so ultimately, we settled on the latter model,

699
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,244
the Rogue Legacy model, mainly because,

700
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:05,625
for one, the character progression in Rogue Legacy

701
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:07,306
mapped really well to what we were already doing

702
00:29:07,306 --> 00:29:09,487
with character skill trees in Prey.

703
00:29:09,938 --> 00:29:11,159
And character skill trees are something

704
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,219
that generally play best over multiple sessions.

705
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:15,260
We had this one model that we entertained

706
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,020
where you would have the skill tree

707
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,401
but it would reset every single time.

708
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:21,702
But that ended up being way too tedious in our heads

709
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:23,662
of having to spin those points every single time

710
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,182
you get killed or something.

711
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:28,143
And we also eventually decided we wanted

712
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,044
to have an overarching story to narratively tie

713
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:31,004
this game to the franchise.

714
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:33,385
And that worked best with a sense of progression

715
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:34,625
doled out over multiple sessions

716
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:38,526
rather than one sort of stateless experience like Spelunky.

717
00:29:41,596 --> 00:29:42,477
Oh, there we go.

718
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:44,978
So the next question is what do we want to persist

719
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:45,639
in the world?

720
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:48,981
So you've got character progression and world progression

721
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:50,703
and state, basically, you have to kind of keep track of.

722
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:54,025
So we wanted to keep a sense of agency in the game.

723
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,027
You know, the player having some kind of lasting impact

724
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,529
on the world, but we also kind of wanted to have our cake

725
00:29:58,529 --> 00:29:59,049
and eat it too.

726
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,631
We wanted, you know, the sort of fresh start of a roguelike

727
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:04,593
where you can try new things without the baggage

728
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:06,735
of previous mistakes.

729
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:09,219
And we knew we'd have to reset the world at some points

730
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:11,422
to make the escapes challenging and repopulate monsters

731
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:12,103
and things like that.

732
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:15,828
So we introduced the concept of resetting the simulation,

733
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:17,370
again, to sort of have both.

734
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,716
The conceit is that everything in the world persists

735
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:24,399
until all five of your, or however many characters you have,

736
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,921
until they're all dead or have escaped.

737
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:28,138
and then things are reset.

738
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:30,740
So each character gets one life, basically.

739
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,022
So for instance, Joan might make her way

740
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:35,603
into the shuttle and escapes,

741
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:36,764
and now she's no longer playable

742
00:30:36,764 --> 00:30:38,645
for the rest of that run of the simulation.

743
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:41,587
Then the player picks up Vijay and goes and dies

744
00:30:41,587 --> 00:30:44,449
in the middle of the crater to the moon shark,

745
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:45,590
and he's no longer available,

746
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,811
and now there's like a phantom with his name on it

747
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:48,612
carrying all of his stuff.

748
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:50,253
I'll talk more about that later.

749
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,648
So then the player comes back in as Claire,

750
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:56,230
and she can either go fight the VJ phantom,

751
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,772
or she can go try to make an escape, or whatever,

752
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:00,594
and so on until everyone's dead or has escaped.

753
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:04,477
So doing this meant we got the roguelike consequences

754
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:06,778
of permadeath, sort of, as well as the ability

755
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:08,379
to have interplay between the characters

756
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:11,222
and a meaningful player impact on the world.

757
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:13,423
That, and we'll talk about this in a second, actually.

758
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:15,024
Maybe the next slide.

759
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:18,367
Yeah, so this adaptation ended up as a happy compromise

760
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:20,248
between the new and the old.

761
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:25,351
So yeah, speaking to that, you get this concept

762
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:26,712
of an afterlife when you do this,

763
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:28,953
the sort of persistence in the world.

764
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,074
It's a legacy you're leaving for yourself.

765
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:33,015
We really like the idea of the player

766
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:35,496
sort of playing a co-op game with themselves in a way.

767
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:38,097
And this adds a layer to the emergent nature

768
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:39,858
of these kinds of games as well.

769
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,999
So if you get interesting combinations

770
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:44,221
based on the abilities and equipment of one player,

771
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:45,741
you can only imagine what you can string together

772
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:48,643
if that player can leave stuff for another player,

773
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:49,763
another character.

774
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:53,859
So one character might be on their way to an escape route,

775
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:56,020
but they've got a lot of cool weapons and gadgets

776
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,542
and things like that, so if they escape with it,

777
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,504
then it's all gone, but instead they can leave it

778
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:04,346
in a chest for the other character to come through and grab.

779
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:08,889
Or if you skirt around an enemy encounter as one character,

780
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:11,071
those enemies will still be there for the next character,

781
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:14,934
so you have to think a few moves ahead, basically.

782
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:16,655
And lastly, as I mentioned earlier,

783
00:32:16,655 --> 00:32:18,336
we added this wrinkle where characters that die

784
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,438
come back as phantoms for other characters to deal with.

785
00:32:21,996 --> 00:32:23,617
So if you die with a lot of cool stuff,

786
00:32:23,617 --> 00:32:25,979
you'll have to fight a monster with that cool stuff

787
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:27,360
to get it back.

788
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,302
It's much more interesting, or it was more interesting

789
00:32:29,302 --> 00:32:31,324
to us than just picking your crap up

790
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,265
off the ground, basically.

791
00:32:33,265 --> 00:32:35,807
It adds this sort of dynamic piece to the board

792
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:38,870
that you now have to deal with because of your ineptitude

793
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,490
in a previous run.

794
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:46,216
All right, so let's look at replay and game length.

795
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:51,620
So this is a diagram.

796
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:55,596
of a narrative-driven linear AAA game.

797
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:56,717
I guess it doesn't have to be AAA,

798
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:58,998
but a narrative-driven linear game.

799
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:01,239
The dollar bills here represent budget allocation

800
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:03,439
in an abstract sense.

801
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,180
So this can be cut scenes, character interactions,

802
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,861
weapon pickups, entire levels, whatever.

803
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,502
It's abstract, right?

804
00:33:09,502 --> 00:33:14,864
And this is the player's path through that game, right?

805
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:17,185
You can see most of the dollars over the 15 to 20 hours

806
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:18,846
have been hoovered up by the player.

807
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:21,345
because it's all kind of laid out

808
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:23,966
in a nice row in front of them.

809
00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:27,508
Then if you look at the budgets on Immersive Sims,

810
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:30,529
this is more like what you get with those games, right?

811
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:34,710
Those are the same number of dollars,

812
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,771
but it's all over the place.

813
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:39,072
And this represents things like branches and dialogue,

814
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,713
or mutually exclusive quests,

815
00:33:41,713 --> 00:33:43,694
or large levels that are non-linear

816
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:46,395
and the player can just beeline through and miss everything.

817
00:33:46,395 --> 00:33:47,955
Stuff like that, right?

818
00:33:50,702 --> 00:33:53,142
And so this is a single playthrough,

819
00:33:53,142 --> 00:33:54,042
a hypothetical single playthrough.

820
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:56,783
There are a lot of diehards that will eat

821
00:33:56,783 --> 00:33:59,364
all the content in these games,

822
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:00,444
but they're outliers.

823
00:34:00,444 --> 00:34:03,525
This is more like the average kind of playthrough

824
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:04,905
in one of these spaces, right?

825
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:07,526
So you can see a lot of dollars are missed here.

826
00:34:07,526 --> 00:34:09,026
This is not a value judgment.

827
00:34:09,026 --> 00:34:12,507
Again, I wholeheartedly believe in this sort of model.

828
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:14,347
I think there's an intangible quality you get

829
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:15,968
from doing this kind of thing that you can't.

830
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,007
that you can't really quantify

831
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:20,949
that justifies the spread like that.

832
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:24,951
So here's an example of multiple paths

833
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:27,072
through our hypothetical immersive sim.

834
00:34:27,072 --> 00:34:29,273
So you can see different players,

835
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:32,295
they have vastly different experiences here.

836
00:34:32,295 --> 00:34:33,835
Some don't even finish it.

837
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:36,897
But if they only play through one time,

838
00:34:36,897 --> 00:34:38,418
then maybe they don't know there were choices.

839
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:40,479
They don't see the breadth of the whole thing

840
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,900
through their single play through.

841
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:46,416
So we looked at this phenomenon going into Mooncrash

842
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:49,437
and the effect it has on the player's sense of agency

843
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:50,857
and choice and outcomes.

844
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:53,357
So if you've got a game that's 15 hours long

845
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,558
and there are choices to be made in the beginning

846
00:34:55,558 --> 00:34:57,558
or the middle or wherever, actually,

847
00:34:57,558 --> 00:34:59,399
by the time the player finishes the game

848
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,939
and comes back to those choices,

849
00:35:00,939 --> 00:35:02,279
it's possible they won't even remember

850
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:04,100
what they did the first time around

851
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
or what the outcome was.

852
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,021
And this is assuming they even knew

853
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,401
there was a choice happening at all,

854
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:12,722
assumes that the player finished in the first place

855
00:35:12,722 --> 00:35:14,102
and didn't just move on to another game.

856
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,471
If you've got a shorter game,

857
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:18,173
players are more likely to remember those choices

858
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:19,774
in the short time it takes for them

859
00:35:19,774 --> 00:35:21,015
to get back to the choice.

860
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:25,079
And they're also more likely to play the game multiple times

861
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,220
to experiment with different outcomes.

862
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,923
Additionally, there's a phenomenon we discovered

863
00:35:28,923 --> 00:35:30,344
with player choice in games

864
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:34,268
when we were playtesting Dishonored with people

865
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:36,870
is that if the choice is too subtle and organic,

866
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,172
players don't know they even made one.

867
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:40,779
And this can be really great for immersion,

868
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:43,540
again, I'm not saying you shouldn't do this,

869
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,102
but it's a phenomenon that we noticed.

870
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,303
We did a play test with the first hour of the game

871
00:35:48,303 --> 00:35:50,925
with some people, and everyone at the end were like,

872
00:35:50,925 --> 00:35:53,426
yeah, we played this, and it's a pretty linear experience,

873
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:54,807
I went and killed this person,

874
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:56,468
or infiltrated this place, or whatever,

875
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:58,449
and then the person next to them would turn around

876
00:35:58,449 --> 00:35:59,170
and be like, you met who?

877
00:35:59,170 --> 00:35:59,610
You went where?

878
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,371
And then when they compared notes,

879
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:04,553
they could see the breadth of the space,

880
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:06,334
but only then, because everything was so organic.

881
00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:10,556
it was all based on their sort of moving through the space

882
00:36:10,556 --> 00:36:12,537
instead of a hard choice, like a big left or right,

883
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,657
or A or B, or something like that.

884
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:18,179
So to address all these kind of ideas in Mooncrash,

885
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:21,860
we adapted the more roguelike approach,

886
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,682
and so we wanted to shorten the replay loops for starters.

887
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:27,243
A single pass through the campaign

888
00:36:27,243 --> 00:36:31,104
would actually involve several passes through the content,

889
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,325
several loops through the content.

890
00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:38,128
And by a pass through the content I mean like traveling through a few different levels to do an escape

891
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:43,692
Or completing a story mission or maybe just dying as the result of a plan gone wrong

892
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:50,238
And this results in the player seeing a large percentage of the game and developing a familiarity with the world

893
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:54,093
One problem this model can cause, however,

894
00:36:54,093 --> 00:36:56,275
and you can probably guess from the diagram here,

895
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:57,837
is boredom from repetition.

896
00:36:57,837 --> 00:36:59,298
You see everything is kind of branching off

897
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:01,900
of that one root, so that one section of the game

898
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,822
is gonna get very stale very fast,

899
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,584
it's the alarm clock from Groundhog Day,

900
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:07,025
basically, over and over again.

901
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:11,689
So to address that, oh, this is the same diagram,

902
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:14,832
more accurate, with loops and dotted lines and stuff,

903
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:18,035
but this is a lot to swallow, so, yeah.

904
00:37:19,898 --> 00:37:22,700
So to counter this, we had multiple starting locations

905
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,680
in the game.

906
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,681
So when a new character started,

907
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:26,442
they would start in a different location

908
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:28,023
than the previous character.

909
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:29,504
But they would be in the same level

910
00:37:29,504 --> 00:37:31,406
that they had died in as that previous character,

911
00:37:31,406 --> 00:37:32,847
or escaped in.

912
00:37:32,847 --> 00:37:34,748
Part of this was purely logistics.

913
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:37,270
We wanted to negate load times as much as possible,

914
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,751
especially when you're doing loopy stuff.

915
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:41,433
Load times can really kill the game.

916
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,593
But also it had the side effect

917
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,934
of keeping the player moving forward

918
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:46,176
because they could basically start really close

919
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:48,377
to the kind of scattered remains of their last run

920
00:37:48,377 --> 00:37:48,978
if they had failed.

921
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:52,964
so they'd pick up and know exactly where they needed to go.

922
00:37:52,964 --> 00:37:55,145
It's worth noting that this concept

923
00:37:55,145 --> 00:37:56,806
can be taken too far as well.

924
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:57,786
Some of our earlier models,

925
00:37:57,786 --> 00:38:00,627
we had the player start in any level, in any location,

926
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:03,028
all these random spots basically,

927
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:05,329
but it got really disorienting really fast,

928
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:06,149
and the players wouldn't,

929
00:38:06,149 --> 00:38:09,371
it would take them a while to get back into the context

930
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,051
of what they needed to be doing and where to go and stuff.

931
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:13,952
So even with these varying spawns though,

932
00:38:13,952 --> 00:38:16,913
you're gonna have the potential for boredom

933
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:18,394
due to overexposure to the same content.

934
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:26,252
Let's talk about that.

935
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:28,474
So earlier I mentioned how systemic design

936
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,814
and focusing on process intensity

937
00:38:29,814 --> 00:38:32,296
helps lengthen the experience for the player.

938
00:38:32,296 --> 00:38:35,198
You get more output for your input as a developer.

939
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:40,953
The dark side of this can be a game that keeps the player playing even when the novel experiences have run dry.

940
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:46,216
We dipped our toes into random content shuffling in generations, so this topic became very relevant to us.

941
00:38:46,216 --> 00:38:49,998
The concept of infinite content, it can be a facade over an endless grind, basically.

942
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:53,300
You know, by the time your game stops having something new to show the player,

943
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,161
it should make a graceful exit instead of trying to compel them to stick around.

944
00:38:56,787 --> 00:39:00,168
This isn't always an obvious choice as a developer either.

945
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:01,528
There can be a lot of times where you're like,

946
00:39:01,528 --> 00:39:03,369
oh yeah, I can easily generate another three hours

947
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:04,889
of game here for the player

948
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,710
just by doing this one little thing, right?

949
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,791
The players want more game, right?

950
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:09,931
Have some more pancakes, player.

951
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,992
So there's not always malevolence behind this.

952
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:15,833
So instead of focusing on the amount of variability

953
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,114
we were offering, we started filtering

954
00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:20,374
for meaningful variability.

955
00:39:20,374 --> 00:39:23,335
So what could we offer that was different

956
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:26,597
from session to session in a tangibly meaningful way?

957
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:29,621
So in this straw man example above,

958
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:32,185
I could say TV static offers the viewer

959
00:39:32,185 --> 00:39:35,190
hundreds of unique images every minute.

960
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,313
It's ridiculously exaggerated, but.

961
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:41,346
It sort of speaks to this one exaggerated extension,

962
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,326
or this one approach.

963
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:44,687
It's very scalable, basically.

964
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:46,988
But the thing about TV static is not only

965
00:39:46,988 --> 00:39:50,089
are the images individually meaningless to the viewer,

966
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:52,010
they're also individual, or sorry,

967
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,450
they're meaninglessly different from one another,

968
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,531
from frame to frame, basically.

969
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:59,412
A more gamey example might be a dungeon that's randomized,

970
00:39:59,412 --> 00:40:01,053
but you're only changing the color of the tiles

971
00:40:01,053 --> 00:40:03,274
on the floor or something like that.

972
00:40:03,274 --> 00:40:04,734
The opposite of the spectrum.

973
00:40:05,212 --> 00:40:06,692
is to handcraft everything individually

974
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:07,873
and that doesn't scale very well at all.

975
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:11,574
So in Mooncrash, one of the ways we tackled this

976
00:40:11,574 --> 00:40:13,975
was through what we called hazard channels.

977
00:40:13,975 --> 00:40:16,236
So we took each of the four environments,

978
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:18,537
the four levels, and we layered on top of them

979
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:19,777
five different hazard states.

980
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:21,958
So you've got fire, radiation, flooding,

981
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,479
the power can be out, you can be oxygen deprived, right?

982
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:27,140
Some of these had to be offered.

983
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,981
You can see like the fire, for instance,

984
00:40:28,981 --> 00:40:31,762
requires VFX and mesh alterations and things like that.

985
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,583
Radiation and flooding also need custom geo,

986
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:34,923
but.

987
00:40:36,528 --> 00:40:38,030
We authored these all in chunks,

988
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,671
so then they could be mixed and matched.

989
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,232
So any one particular level that was on fire

990
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:44,294
could have five different versions of being on fire

991
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:47,036
with different rooms being affected and things like that.

992
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:51,460
Yeah, so these states could then be layered

993
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,421
on top of each other in different combinations as well.

994
00:40:53,421 --> 00:40:55,363
So you could have fire and radiation,

995
00:40:55,363 --> 00:40:58,745
you could have the power be out and it could be on fire,

996
00:40:58,745 --> 00:40:59,606
things like that.

997
00:40:59,606 --> 00:41:02,008
Some of these were mutually exclusive,

998
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,409
so if there was no oxygen in a level,

999
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:04,670
then it couldn't be on fire.

1000
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,111
And then some modified each other,

1001
00:41:06,111 --> 00:41:06,291
so.

1002
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:07,832
Normally if there's flooding,

1003
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:08,913
then you have electrical hazards,

1004
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:09,773
but if the power was out,

1005
00:41:09,773 --> 00:41:11,474
then you had flooding without the electrical hazards

1006
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:12,014
and things like that.

1007
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:14,036
So you had these interesting sort of combinations.

1008
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:16,397
What this gave us was really strong.

1009
00:41:16,397 --> 00:41:18,778
So the combination of channels gave us a lot of outputs

1010
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:19,479
over a few inputs.

1011
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:22,340
And that was especially given the fact

1012
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,481
that it was a DLC team, small, you know,

1013
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,862
small scrappy team.

1014
00:41:25,862 --> 00:41:28,223
The spaces could be recontextualized

1015
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:30,004
meaningfully for the player.

1016
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:32,366
So, you know, the staircase that you see here

1017
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:32,786
is normally

1018
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:37,426
perfectly fine, you can walk up it and there's no problem,

1019
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:38,987
but when it's on fire, now you have to decide

1020
00:41:38,987 --> 00:41:40,387
if you want to find another way around

1021
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:43,649
or use your player tools or things like that.

1022
00:41:43,649 --> 00:41:45,409
The spaces also look dramatically different

1023
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:49,351
in subsequent visits while remaining recognizable.

1024
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:52,632
So this means you get visual interest over time,

1025
00:41:52,632 --> 00:41:54,753
but since we're not randomizing the layout of the level,

1026
00:41:54,753 --> 00:41:56,754
you can actually learn these spaces.

1027
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:59,215
So the staircase will always be the staircase,

1028
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:02,356
but now it's different tactically and visually.

1029
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:09,356
Also, power outages cause, there's a tram that connects levels, and so power outages

1030
00:42:09,356 --> 00:42:10,858
can cause it to malfunction.

1031
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:15,141
So it overhauls the topography of the game every time, basically, so you have to decide

1032
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:17,823
which levels, or you have to learn which levels are connected to each other.

1033
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:23,328
So your approach from level A to B might be completely different in subsequent visits.

1034
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:32,075
And so this is the same staircase, without the fire, for instance.

1035
00:42:33,165 --> 00:42:34,986
You can see here, whoop, did I skip?

1036
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:37,168
Yeah, okay, here's some just brief examples

1037
00:42:37,168 --> 00:42:42,231
of flooded and electrical, normal, radiation, et cetera.

1038
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:52,477
Oh, and this is, yeah, without fire, with fire.

1039
00:42:52,477 --> 00:42:57,980
And so we worked a lot with the granularity

1040
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,041
and frequency of the random elements within the levels.

1041
00:43:00,886 --> 00:43:02,968
We found that if every level had a little bit

1042
00:43:02,968 --> 00:43:05,550
of everything in it, it was what I call

1043
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,711
the chopped salad effect.

1044
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:08,773
Basically, you've got a lot of ingredients in the salad,

1045
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:11,735
but every bite tastes the same as the last one.

1046
00:43:11,735 --> 00:43:13,056
The same thing with the levels.

1047
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:15,558
Your net sort of impression going from level one

1048
00:43:15,558 --> 00:43:17,840
to level two here is gonna be the same.

1049
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,202
These two levels are almost 100% different from one another,

1050
00:43:20,202 --> 00:43:23,484
but like the TV static, they're not meaningfully different

1051
00:43:23,484 --> 00:43:25,326
from one another.

1052
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:29,169
So what we ended up doing was sort of consolidating

1053
00:43:29,169 --> 00:43:29,770
and clumping.

1054
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,612
these random elements.

1055
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:33,996
So now you've got one that's primarily fire

1056
00:43:33,996 --> 00:43:35,659
and one that's primarily radiation.

1057
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:39,926
And so your net impression from going from one to the other

1058
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:41,087
is very palpable, basically.

1059
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:44,172
And then, let's see.

1060
00:43:45,053 --> 00:43:48,575
Yeah, this also works temporally as well as spatially.

1061
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:50,997
So when you revisit these levels subsequent times

1062
00:43:50,997 --> 00:43:54,439
and subsequent resets of the simulation,

1063
00:43:54,439 --> 00:43:56,280
you get again a very different impression

1064
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,421
each time you visit it,

1065
00:43:57,421 --> 00:44:00,282
instead of the sort of samey kind of chopped salad effect.

1066
00:44:00,282 --> 00:44:03,805
And this also was echoed in our enemy encounter design

1067
00:44:03,805 --> 00:44:07,307
and several other random elements that we did

1068
00:44:07,307 --> 00:44:09,809
over the course of the game.

1069
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:12,850
Here's an actual level layout with the same concept applied.

1070
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,771
Chopped up version and.

1071
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:17,452
the more consolidated version.

1072
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:27,138
Another way to add variety to the game

1073
00:44:27,138 --> 00:44:28,239
was the corruption meter.

1074
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:30,800
So this kept the player from just kind of hanging out

1075
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,022
in the game and pushed them to accomplish their goals.

1076
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:36,663
We ratcheted up the difficulty

1077
00:44:36,663 --> 00:44:38,965
during the time they spend in the simulation

1078
00:44:38,965 --> 00:44:40,606
and we culminate in a forced reset

1079
00:44:40,606 --> 00:44:43,067
after the sort of corruption meter hits level five.

1080
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:47,247
This was inspired partly by Risk of Rain's difficulty system,

1081
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:48,989
as well as the ghost in Spelunky.

1082
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:50,691
We liked how it makes the player choose

1083
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:53,674
between kind of taking their time to gather resources

1084
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:56,977
and sort of pushing them forward to accomplish their goals.

1085
00:44:56,977 --> 00:44:58,979
It also adds a layer of variability to the experience

1086
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:01,161
because further down the corruption meter

1087
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:02,522
you get different encounters with enemies

1088
00:45:02,522 --> 00:45:03,183
and things like that.

1089
00:45:03,183 --> 00:45:05,786
This was one of the more contentious adaptations

1090
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,387
we made, honestly.

1091
00:45:07,703 --> 00:45:09,044
A lot of people thought it kind of undercut

1092
00:45:09,044 --> 00:45:10,704
the exploratory nature of our games.

1093
00:45:10,704 --> 00:45:13,525
We mitigated it some with these items

1094
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:16,406
that you can get that reset the clock or wind it back some.

1095
00:45:16,406 --> 00:45:20,128
But at the end of the day, it was something

1096
00:45:20,128 --> 00:45:21,988
that some people didn't like.

1097
00:45:21,988 --> 00:45:24,229
It was an intentional design decision and yeah.

1098
00:45:24,229 --> 00:45:28,631
One of the larger departures from Prey

1099
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:31,752
was the concept of narrative progression in Mooncrash.

1100
00:45:31,752 --> 00:45:34,873
So the game primarily consists of a series of orders

1101
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:36,053
from the main character's employer.

1102
00:45:36,053 --> 00:45:37,093
The larger.

1103
00:45:37,437 --> 00:45:39,158
the percent of items checked off the list,

1104
00:45:39,158 --> 00:45:42,039
the farther along the framing story progresses, basically.

1105
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,299
But the player can take these things in any order.

1106
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:47,780
There are some that have a sort of dependency chain,

1107
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,941
but otherwise you can take them in whatever order you want.

1108
00:45:49,941 --> 00:45:52,562
The actual items are more than just fetch questy stuff

1109
00:45:52,562 --> 00:45:54,622
as well, some of them are entire story missions

1110
00:45:54,622 --> 00:45:56,983
or elaborate escape methods or things like that.

1111
00:45:56,983 --> 00:45:59,184
The point of it is to allow the player

1112
00:45:59,184 --> 00:46:00,344
to proceed at their own pace.

1113
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:02,129
and in the order that they choose.

1114
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:04,230
This opens the door for different strategies as well

1115
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,431
and caters to different play styles.

1116
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:08,412
So some players might want to save big stuff for last

1117
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:09,733
or focus on one character at a time

1118
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,514
or go on a collecting spree or things like that.

1119
00:46:11,514 --> 00:46:13,636
This is also a win for us

1120
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:16,217
because we could decouple the player's actions.

1121
00:46:16,705 --> 00:46:19,047
from the prescribed narrative thrust of the game.

1122
00:46:19,047 --> 00:46:20,789
We didn't have to deal with problems like,

1123
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:21,870
well, what if the player goes over here

1124
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:24,472
and gets this thing before they find this other thing?

1125
00:46:24,472 --> 00:46:28,035
Or once they've done X, what is their motivation

1126
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:28,935
to then proceed to Y?

1127
00:46:28,935 --> 00:46:32,138
That was a big deal on Prey because the entire game

1128
00:46:32,138 --> 00:46:36,581
was this sort of continuous string of cause and effect.

1129
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:38,743
But this sort of unasked those questions.

1130
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,646
And here you can see a brief example

1131
00:46:42,646 --> 00:46:44,147
of the elements that change over time

1132
00:46:44,147 --> 00:46:46,068
as the player finishes items from the list.

1133
00:46:46,068 --> 00:46:49,632
So you get more hazards introduced to the simulation,

1134
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:52,354
the corruption meter gets faster over time,

1135
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:54,055
the player's mastery of the space

1136
00:46:54,055 --> 00:46:55,757
is basically tested more and more

1137
00:46:55,757 --> 00:47:06,486
the further along they get to the end of the campaign.

1138
00:47:06,486 --> 00:47:08,408
Finally, the escapes.

1139
00:47:09,004 --> 00:47:10,765
So yeah, one of the first drafts of Mooncrash

1140
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:13,528
was basically reusing Talos from the core game

1141
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:15,549
and just adding, like opening the whole thing up

1142
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:17,431
and adding random escape methods to it.

1143
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:19,172
Partly inspired by this game called Monstrum

1144
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:21,394
where you're on this freight ship escaping an alien,

1145
00:47:21,394 --> 00:47:25,858
or sorry, a monster that's escaped and is with you.

1146
00:47:25,858 --> 00:47:29,060
So the Talos version was a much lighter weight version

1147
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,382
of what we ended up doing within Mooncrash,

1148
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:34,424
but the overarching concept of this sort of escape,

1149
00:47:34,424 --> 00:47:36,366
the randomized escape remained interesting to us.

1150
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:40,036
So the base in Mooncrash has five different ways to escape.

1151
00:47:40,036 --> 00:47:41,656
Each one is mechanically and thematically

1152
00:47:41,656 --> 00:47:42,616
different from the other.

1153
00:47:42,616 --> 00:47:45,757
So there are a few examples.

1154
00:47:45,757 --> 00:47:47,718
One is a shuttle that requires a character

1155
00:47:47,718 --> 00:47:48,618
to install a piloting skill,

1156
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:51,079
but you have to find the random location

1157
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:52,800
of the last person to install that skill

1158
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,481
using the personnel locating system, basically.

1159
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:57,341
And then that skill persists

1160
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,562
for whatever character installs it,

1161
00:47:58,562 --> 00:48:00,702
so that person can now use that escape method

1162
00:48:00,702 --> 00:48:02,203
once they've got that skill.

1163
00:48:04,175 --> 00:48:06,556
One of them is a cargo container you can stow away in

1164
00:48:06,556 --> 00:48:10,659
and get blasted by rail gun to Earth, basically.

1165
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:13,280
But first you've got a scavenge

1166
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,102
for a randomized list of supplies, basically,

1167
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,043
so you can survive the trip to Earth.

1168
00:48:18,043 --> 00:48:21,385
One of them is an experimental portal,

1169
00:48:21,385 --> 00:48:23,406
but you need hacking and repair,

1170
00:48:23,406 --> 00:48:25,547
which are separated into two different characters.

1171
00:48:25,547 --> 00:48:27,208
So those two characters have to work together

1172
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,590
to enable this escape method to even function.

1173
00:48:30,527 --> 00:48:32,128
So these differences kept the game interesting

1174
00:48:32,128 --> 00:48:34,630
by varying up the types of tasks between the escapes.

1175
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,811
In addition to all the other world variables

1176
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:38,992
that you have to deal with in a given session.

1177
00:48:38,992 --> 00:48:41,914
The differences also add very deliberate choices

1178
00:48:41,914 --> 00:48:44,115
for the player, so maybe Joan has the piloting skill

1179
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:46,276
installed from a previous escape,

1180
00:48:46,276 --> 00:48:48,138
but you need to use her for half of the portal

1181
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:50,759
before sending her off in the shuttle or something.

1182
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:52,920
Maybe you found some supplies for the crate as Riley,

1183
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,681
but the only way you can use the brain upload escape

1184
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,982
is with her.

1185
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:58,211
So you have to find somewhere to stash those supplies.

1186
00:48:58,211 --> 00:48:59,932
You know, there are lots of choices, basically,

1187
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:03,575
the player has to kind of think up or deal with.

1188
00:49:03,575 --> 00:49:05,356
And not only do you have to decide which escape route

1189
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:06,497
is the most opportune for the character

1190
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:07,218
you're currently playing,

1191
00:49:07,218 --> 00:49:10,700
but you have to consider characters down the line.

1192
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,921
And again, none of this is prescriptive.

1193
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:14,403
This is all up to the player to determine the best strategy.

1194
00:49:14,403 --> 00:49:16,765
We don't say you have to do this in this order or whatever.

1195
00:49:16,765 --> 00:49:21,609
So the most elaborate list item is the five-person escape.

1196
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:24,191
You have to escape in all five different escape routes

1197
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:25,692
with all five characters in one run.

1198
00:49:26,127 --> 00:49:29,188
without the simulation resetting.

1199
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:30,969
We wanted to incorporate this

1200
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,890
because it turns the game into this puzzle box, basically,

1201
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,030
where you have to consider things like

1202
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,971
the strengths of the characters,

1203
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:37,731
the complexity of the escapes,

1204
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:39,712
and the order that you want to perform them in,

1205
00:49:39,712 --> 00:49:41,352
and the corruption meter because, again,

1206
00:49:41,352 --> 00:49:44,453
the difficulty is ratcheting up over time.

1207
00:49:44,453 --> 00:49:46,734
So then the player has to weigh things like

1208
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:49,455
should I get an easy escape like the escape pods

1209
00:49:49,455 --> 00:49:50,835
out of the way early or save it for later

1210
00:49:50,835 --> 00:49:52,936
because I'll need an easy win,

1211
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:54,396
or I could escape with this character right now

1212
00:49:54,396 --> 00:49:55,217
but they could do things.

1213
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:57,252
in the world to help other characters

1214
00:49:57,252 --> 00:49:58,432
with other escapes down the line.

1215
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:01,193
Now the speedrunning community has

1216
00:50:01,193 --> 00:50:03,134
eliminated the optimal path by this point,

1217
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:06,915
but for regular players, for regular human beings,

1218
00:50:06,915 --> 00:50:12,437
there are a lot of interesting variables to sort out,

1219
00:50:12,437 --> 00:50:13,637
in combination with actually playing

1220
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:14,918
the moment-to-moment game.

1221
00:50:14,918 --> 00:50:18,059
So you've got the planning phase and the execution,

1222
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:20,020
strategy and tactics kind of playing with each other there.

1223
00:50:27,086 --> 00:50:29,368
All right, so in conclusion,

1224
00:50:29,368 --> 00:50:30,729
so in retooling Prey to make Mooncrash,

1225
00:50:30,729 --> 00:50:34,933
we were looking for what might be next for immersive sims.

1226
00:50:34,933 --> 00:50:36,855
Originally I wanted to have immersive simulations

1227
00:50:36,855 --> 00:50:38,056
are dead or something dramatic here,

1228
00:50:38,056 --> 00:50:39,117
but I don't think that's the case,

1229
00:50:39,117 --> 00:50:40,859
and it's kind of hyperbolic anyway.

1230
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:42,160
Immersive sims are not dead.

1231
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,983
I think the monolithic vent crawler we're all familiar with

1232
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:47,725
is no longer the only expression of immersive simulation.

1233
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:50,859
I think the regimented model is dead,

1234
00:50:50,859 --> 00:50:53,280
and in its wake are all these really amazing possibilities.

1235
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,002
You've got things like a lot of indie projects

1236
00:50:56,002 --> 00:50:57,102
experimenting with the form,

1237
00:50:57,102 --> 00:51:00,644
and adding their own systemic wrinkles to the mix.

1238
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:02,445
A lot of mainstream games are also adapting

1239
00:51:02,445 --> 00:51:05,367
more and more of the simulation-driven elements

1240
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:06,527
into their mechanics suites.

1241
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:08,629
Our big takeaway from this project

1242
00:51:08,629 --> 00:51:11,390
was that you should be willing to break from tradition

1243
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,891
if you're given the opportunity.

1244
00:51:12,891 --> 00:51:15,512
DLC is a really great, fertile ground for that.

1245
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:19,748
And even if you're not happy with the results,

1246
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:21,269
and your studio's still open,

1247
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:23,070
you can always bring some of those lessons

1248
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:25,192
back to your core projects the next time around.

1249
00:51:25,192 --> 00:51:27,975
Also, don't be timid looking at other genres

1250
00:51:27,975 --> 00:51:29,356
for inspiration.

1251
00:51:29,356 --> 00:51:31,097
We didn't quite go as wide as cart racing

1252
00:51:31,097 --> 00:51:32,458
or collectible card games or something,

1253
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,240
but there were enough different elements

1254
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,182
and problems and roguelikes that resulted

1255
00:51:37,182 --> 00:51:39,104
in this really unorthodox kind of hybrid

1256
00:51:39,104 --> 00:51:41,166
at the end of the day.

1257
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:42,547
It was one of the most engaging projects

1258
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:44,448
I think I've worked on, and I don't,

1259
00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:46,580
I think at the end of the day that Mooncrash

1260
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,862
is the future of immersive sims,

1261
00:51:47,862 --> 00:51:51,806
but I think it is a future of immersive sims.

1262
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:54,869
Special thanks to everyone on this big list.

1263
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:56,951
I didn't come up with all these cool design ideas.

1264
00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:59,433
There was a design team that we collaborated with

1265
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:02,437
at Arkane that came up with a lot of cool ideas.

1266
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:04,018
Special thanks to Clint for mentoring me

1267
00:52:04,018 --> 00:52:07,482
and everyone that sat through my talk.

1268
00:52:07,482 --> 00:52:08,523
And yeah, any questions?

1269
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:14,306
I think there are two microphones.

1270
00:52:14,306 --> 00:52:14,547
Hi there.

1271
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:21,493
I think I noticed you said one run takes about one to two hours.

1272
00:52:21,493 --> 00:52:28,740
Does that mean completing five runs in that kind of simulator,

1273
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:32,783
for each character to each escape is about five to ten hours?

1274
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:36,327
All total, I think the game ends up,

1275
00:52:36,327 --> 00:52:39,490
I think it ended up longer than Prey.

1276
00:52:40,072 --> 00:52:42,413
Honestly, any given run can take an hour or two,

1277
00:52:42,413 --> 00:52:43,193
a couple of hours.

1278
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,094
And also, that was like the branchy thing

1279
00:52:46,094 --> 00:52:48,375
was kind of a simplified example.

1280
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:49,976
So I think there were probably like 15 to 21

1281
00:52:49,976 --> 00:52:53,498
to two hour runs in the game, something like that.

1282
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:59,231
And the corruption meter, does it reset on a failure?

1283
00:52:59,231 --> 00:53:00,732
Or is it persistent across runs

1284
00:53:00,732 --> 00:53:02,353
and it kind of keeps on ratcheting it up?

1285
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:05,175
So when the simulation resets,

1286
00:53:05,175 --> 00:53:07,697
the corruption meter also resets.

1287
00:53:07,697 --> 00:53:10,218
So it's not like a positive feedback thing.

1288
00:53:10,218 --> 00:53:13,601
So you do get a reprieve basically, it starts over.

1289
00:53:13,601 --> 00:53:14,141
Okay, thank you.

1290
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:14,821
Yeah, yes.

1291
00:53:14,821 --> 00:53:17,083
First of all, I want to thank you for the talk

1292
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,984
and just working on this amazing,

1293
00:53:18,984 --> 00:53:22,046
some of my most favorite games of all time.

1294
00:53:23,305 --> 00:53:29,307
A few questions about both the time you took for the game jam itself and the time you spent

1295
00:53:29,307 --> 00:53:32,728
on the prototyping and just how big was the team working on the game?

1296
00:53:32,728 --> 00:53:39,631
The team, I don't know if I can actually technically speak to team size, but it was about half

1297
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:41,511
of what we had on Prey basically.

1298
00:53:41,511 --> 00:53:45,473
And the game jam was about a work week of time, maybe two, something like that.

1299
00:53:46,035 --> 00:53:48,877
And we managed to churn out some stuff really quickly,

1300
00:53:48,877 --> 00:53:53,982
like again, having that leverage of the existing platform

1301
00:53:53,982 --> 00:53:57,005
and the existing engine was really, yeah,

1302
00:53:57,005 --> 00:53:59,167
a lot of leverage there.

1303
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,508
Thanks.

1304
00:54:00,508 --> 00:54:01,268
Yes.

1305
00:54:01,268 --> 00:54:05,252
So when a player discovers some emergent gameplay

1306
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:08,055
that lets them solve a problem in an immersive sim

1307
00:54:08,055 --> 00:54:10,937
and makes it very easy for them to complete something,

1308
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:14,141
How do you make the decision between this is a glitch,

1309
00:54:14,141 --> 00:54:16,182
this is an exploit, let's get rid of it in our design,

1310
00:54:16,182 --> 00:54:18,522
and this is working as intended,

1311
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:21,724
they've discovered a wonderful novel solution to something.

1312
00:54:21,724 --> 00:54:23,504
Do you ever get that kind of decision to make,

1313
00:54:23,504 --> 00:54:24,185
and how do you make it?

1314
00:54:24,185 --> 00:54:24,785
Lots.

1315
00:54:24,785 --> 00:54:28,666
In general, we err on the side of saying yes to the player.

1316
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:31,787
Usually, if a bug crops up and it prohibits

1317
00:54:31,787 --> 00:54:34,408
a well-meaning player from finishing the game,

1318
00:54:34,408 --> 00:54:37,069
then we'll spend our time and focus on that.

1319
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:39,250
But if some clever player comes up with a way to subvert,

1320
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:41,733
things, then let them have it.

1321
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:43,875
You know, as long as it doesn't completely,

1322
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:47,438
like, break everything, we generally let them,

1323
00:54:47,438 --> 00:54:48,639
let them get away with whatever.

1324
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:48,900
Yeah, thanks.

1325
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:48,980
Yes?

1326
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:49,820
When doing the design for Mooncrash,

1327
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:53,804
was there anything you expected to be able to carry over

1328
00:54:53,804 --> 00:54:56,767
from the single player that wound up not quite working,

1329
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,948
besides the obvious?

1330
00:54:57,948 --> 00:55:03,393
Like anything you really wanted to get in,

1331
00:55:03,393 --> 00:55:04,995
but couldn't quite make work?

1332
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:11,873
I think if we had a bigger budget, each of the characters have their own story missions,

1333
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:16,997
and so if we had the budget I think it would have been cool to do a complete redecoration

1334
00:55:16,997 --> 00:55:22,461
of the moon base for each player's individual vignette, and have characters walking around

1335
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:24,163
and stuff like that.

1336
00:55:24,163 --> 00:55:28,326
That was the one thing that I would have liked to do if we had a bigger budget, I think.

1337
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:33,432
Yes, so you were talking about how low level agency,

1338
00:55:33,432 --> 00:55:36,273
or low level agency like kill or not kill,

1339
00:55:36,273 --> 00:55:39,055
seen or be seen, can vary with these new

1340
00:55:39,055 --> 00:55:43,077
and varying characters in their play styles they present.

1341
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:45,978
Is it possible that if you were to expand that

1342
00:55:45,978 --> 00:55:48,559
to more high level agency, like changing up narrative

1343
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,741
or dialogue choices based on these individual personalities

1344
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:54,923
like I'm the crazy guy, I'll pick the crazy dialogue option?

1345
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:59,068
more than just the more natural, neutral response.

1346
00:55:59,068 --> 00:56:01,910
That's definitely something you can do.

1347
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:03,551
It's, again, it's much more content intense

1348
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:05,292
and you need a much bigger team

1349
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:08,213
to support that kind of thing, I think.

1350
00:56:08,213 --> 00:56:10,834
But yeah, it's definitely something you could entertain.

1351
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:11,955
Thank you.

1352
00:56:11,955 --> 00:56:12,415
Yes.

1353
00:56:12,415 --> 00:56:14,916
I have two questions.

1354
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:17,778
Why did you, what was the idea behind

1355
00:56:17,778 --> 00:56:19,339
making the corruption meter happen

1356
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:20,279
at the very start of the game

1357
00:56:20,279 --> 00:56:23,401
rather than 25% of the way through with progression?

1358
00:56:23,907 --> 00:56:25,587
And also, did you guys have any mechanisms

1359
00:56:25,587 --> 00:56:26,748
for helping struggling players

1360
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:28,389
who were failing over and over again?

1361
00:56:28,389 --> 00:56:32,391
So the first question was about the corruption meter?

1362
00:56:32,391 --> 00:56:34,972
Yes, and like why it was at the very start of the game

1363
00:56:34,972 --> 00:56:36,453
when you first played in your first playthrough,

1364
00:56:36,453 --> 00:56:40,134
it existed rather than when you've done a few of the escapes?

1365
00:56:40,134 --> 00:56:41,575
It actually only kicks in, I think,

1366
00:56:41,575 --> 00:56:43,556
after the first escape, but it's very early on

1367
00:56:43,556 --> 00:56:46,878
because we wanted to get a lot of play with that system,

1368
00:56:46,878 --> 00:56:48,898
basically indoctrinate the players like right off the bat,

1369
00:56:48,898 --> 00:56:50,119
like this is what the game is about.

1370
00:56:50,675 --> 00:56:52,975
dealing with this sort of, among other things,

1371
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:55,296
dealing with this corruption meter and things like that.

1372
00:56:55,296 --> 00:56:56,796
And what was the other question again?

1373
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:57,177
Sorry.

1374
00:56:57,177 --> 00:56:58,517
The other question was about

1375
00:56:58,517 --> 00:57:00,438
if a player was failing over and over again,

1376
00:57:00,438 --> 00:57:03,618
did they have any, were there any mechanisms to help them?

1377
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:05,979
Yes, so we had this currency called simulation points,

1378
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:08,220
sort of like the experience points in Rogue Legacy

1379
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,081
or something, you accumulate those over time

1380
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:14,322
and you can spend them on gadgets and upgrades

1381
00:57:14,322 --> 00:57:16,342
and blueprints and things like that.

1382
00:57:16,342 --> 00:57:18,523
So you can give yourself more gear going in the next time

1383
00:57:18,523 --> 00:57:19,483
to sort of get over the hump.

1384
00:57:19,483 --> 00:57:20,423
Gotcha, cool, thank you.

1385
00:57:21,182 --> 00:57:23,744
Hi, another question about the corruption meter.

1386
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:25,926
Like when I was playing Mooncrash,

1387
00:57:25,926 --> 00:57:28,448
I feel like the corruption meter give me too much pressure

1388
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:32,192
and I have no time to read the notes and books in the game.

1389
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:36,110
And a lot of friends of me say the same thing.

1390
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,932
So I'm just wondering why there's no easier mode

1391
00:57:38,932 --> 00:57:41,974
in the Mooncrash to let player enjoy,

1392
00:57:41,974 --> 00:57:46,116
to explore the environment and to read books and like that.

1393
00:57:46,116 --> 00:57:47,697
Primarily about scope, honestly.

1394
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:51,439
If we had more time, there might have been a mode

1395
00:57:51,439 --> 00:57:52,940
where you could explore more.

1396
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,661
One thing we were kind of banking on

1397
00:57:54,661 --> 00:57:56,321
was the player will be through this area

1398
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:58,743
like half a dozen to a dozen times

1399
00:57:58,743 --> 00:57:59,803
so then they can read that book

1400
00:57:59,803 --> 00:58:01,304
the fifth time they come through.

1401
00:58:02,805 --> 00:58:05,346
But primarily a scope issue, honestly.

1402
00:58:05,346 --> 00:58:08,487
If you look at the book on Spelunky and stuff,

1403
00:58:08,487 --> 00:58:11,367
he talks about having a staunch difficulty model

1404
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,628
and don't diverge from that and stuff.

1405
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:15,349
But I think we would have probably,

1406
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:17,449
yeah, if we had more time, development time,

1407
00:58:17,449 --> 00:58:18,030
we would have.

1408
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,831
So if there's more time, it would be better to add such

1409
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,391
easier mode in Mooncrash, is that right?

1410
00:58:23,391 --> 00:58:24,032
Yeah, I think so.

1411
00:58:24,388 --> 00:58:28,390
I think if I recall correctly, like when the Mooncrash is updated,

1412
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:33,714
there's also a new update for the core game that is a relaxed mode or something like that.

1413
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:36,075
There was an easier mode for the core game for sure.

1414
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:40,578
Yeah, so that's why I'm wondering why there's no easier mode for the Mooncrash.

1415
00:58:40,578 --> 00:58:42,379
Yeah, it's primarily just development economics.

1416
00:58:42,379 --> 00:58:42,740
Okay, thank you.

1417
00:58:44,108 --> 00:58:44,429
Yes?

1418
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:45,849
Yeah, I guess I had a, oh, first of all,

1419
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:47,690
I want to say the Easter egg in the static

1420
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,291
was really, really cool.

1421
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:52,253
The other thing is, it kind of plays

1422
00:58:52,253 --> 00:58:53,173
on the previous question.

1423
00:58:53,173 --> 00:58:54,734
I'm wondering what you think the impact was

1424
00:58:54,734 --> 00:58:57,836
of losing, a lot of times in immersive sims,

1425
00:58:57,836 --> 00:59:00,157
I think particularly for perhaps less skilled players,

1426
00:59:00,157 --> 00:59:03,179
that kind of die, back to the quick save,

1427
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:05,980
try again loop helps people kind of figure out

1428
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,542
the possibility space and makes encounters

1429
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:09,282
quite a lot easier.

1430
00:59:09,282 --> 00:59:12,484
Did you find that you were cutting out

1431
00:59:12,484 --> 00:59:13,925
a chunk of potential player base?

1432
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,671
Cutting them out because it was too difficult?

1433
00:59:16,671 --> 00:59:18,232
Well, I'm not saying necessarily,

1434
00:59:18,232 --> 00:59:19,572
but I think there might have been some people

1435
00:59:19,572 --> 00:59:24,154
who might say played Dishonored or something

1436
00:59:24,154 --> 00:59:25,234
by exploiting that loop.

1437
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:27,915
Did you feel you were potentially cutting out people?

1438
00:59:27,915 --> 00:59:32,977
I think it was definitely a much more focused set of people

1439
00:59:32,977 --> 00:59:36,078
for that particular project.

1440
00:59:36,078 --> 00:59:39,219
Yeah, I mean, it was kind of a smaller subset for sure.

1441
00:59:39,219 --> 00:59:41,260
A more focused kind of experience.

1442
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:41,520
Yeah, cool.

1443
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,781
Yeah.

1444
00:59:42,781 --> 00:59:43,781
Thanks.

1445
00:59:44,315 --> 00:59:44,876
Last two questions.

1446
00:59:44,876 --> 00:59:45,236
All right.

1447
00:59:45,236 --> 00:59:45,436
Thanks.

1448
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:48,138
Hey, thanks for the talk.

1449
00:59:48,138 --> 00:59:48,698
Thanks for the games.

1450
00:59:48,698 --> 00:59:50,299
They're awesome.

1451
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:52,500
I was wondering over there at Arcane,

1452
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,942
when you guys are working on these immersive sim mechanics

1453
00:59:54,942 --> 00:59:56,302
themselves, what the sort of ratio

1454
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:59,784
is to when you're creating the individual sort of building

1455
00:59:59,784 --> 01:00:04,127
blocks, like intentional bespoke interactions versus ones

1456
01:00:04,127 --> 01:00:05,328
that you sort of discover.

1457
01:00:05,328 --> 01:00:07,509
Like the example of the torch and the ice ball, it's like.

1458
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:09,629
we are going to make heat because we want a means

1459
01:00:09,629 --> 01:00:10,489
of melting this ice wall, right?

1460
01:00:10,489 --> 01:00:12,730
Then you accidentally find out like,

1461
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,311
oh, but when you heat ice, it makes water,

1462
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:15,952
and then water does this electricity.

1463
01:00:15,952 --> 01:00:18,292
Like, what's the sort of ratio to like sort of pre-planning

1464
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:21,434
versus like, and what are design philosophies

1465
01:00:21,434 --> 01:00:23,694
to create components that sort of play nice with each other?

1466
01:00:23,694 --> 01:00:26,475
So in general, the mechanics,

1467
01:00:26,475 --> 01:00:29,917
often like the game objects that I mentioned,

1468
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,038
we look to see how many different systems

1469
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:34,438
that they can interact with themselves.

1470
01:00:35,324 --> 01:00:40,386
And then a lot of the times, things will just kind of bubble up over the course of production and iteration.

1471
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:44,687
So we'll have these systems out in the wild and some level designer comes up with a,

1472
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:49,910
like, oh hey, wouldn't it be cool if the electricity conducted from this thing powered a computer or something like that, right?

1473
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:54,231
And so then we have to evaluate that and say, okay, do we want this to be a one-off thing

1474
01:00:54,231 --> 01:00:59,213
or do we want to now sort of bring this up and elevate it to a system itself, right?

1475
01:00:59,213 --> 01:01:01,414
So a lot of this stuff happens organically over time.

1476
01:01:01,414 --> 01:01:04,115
And then there are some rare cases where it's like, okay, well this...

1477
01:01:04,515 --> 01:01:08,278
these two things interact in a way that we don't,

1478
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:11,941
we can't support because there are expectations

1479
01:01:11,941 --> 01:01:13,062
that then cascade out of this.

1480
01:01:13,062 --> 01:01:15,584
And then we have to cut something off,

1481
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:19,547
but in general it's like the more the merrier.

1482
01:01:19,547 --> 01:01:20,848
And again, QA loves that stuff.

1483
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:21,088
Yeah.

1484
01:01:21,088 --> 01:01:22,429
Thanks very much.

1485
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:23,130
Yes.

1486
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:23,691
Hello.

1487
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:28,274
So, Mooncrash is a pretty big departure from Prey.

1488
01:01:28,274 --> 01:01:31,637
Moving from the Prey style of game

1489
01:01:31,637 --> 01:01:33,298
to the Mooncrash style of game.

1490
01:01:33,601 --> 01:01:36,583
How did that affect your team?

1491
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:37,823
Assuming they were the same people

1492
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:38,644
who worked on the base game.

1493
01:01:38,644 --> 01:01:40,445
It was the same people, yeah.

1494
01:01:40,445 --> 01:01:42,486
But it was a smaller sort of subset

1495
01:01:42,486 --> 01:01:45,168
that weren't going on to other things and stuff.

1496
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,489
So there was definitely like a bit of a learning curve

1497
01:01:48,489 --> 01:01:50,330
and people were getting used to the sort of thing,

1498
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:53,772
but overall I think it was kind of a good exercise

1499
01:01:53,772 --> 01:01:56,894
to like rejuvenate people between big projects

1500
01:01:56,894 --> 01:01:58,855
and let them try something different

1501
01:01:58,855 --> 01:02:01,517
and sort of stretch their legs a bit.

1502
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,218
So it didn't like maybe.

1503
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,843
take a big morale hit to the team,

1504
01:02:04,843 --> 01:02:06,245
it was more reinvigorating instead.

1505
01:02:06,245 --> 01:02:10,492
There were definitely some people that were a little,

1506
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:13,437
like they were questioning it,

1507
01:02:13,437 --> 01:02:14,538
but it was kind of a mixed bag, honestly.

1508
01:02:14,538 --> 01:02:14,839
Cool, thanks.

1509
01:02:14,839 --> 01:02:15,981
Thank you.

1510
01:02:15,981 --> 01:02:16,542
All right, thanks.
