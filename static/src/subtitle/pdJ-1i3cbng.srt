1
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:11,266
Thanks everyone for showing up to the session with the longest title.

2
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:18,877
It's just that I had to take the font size down a tad to make it fit and extend it.

3
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:24,860
But anyway, we probably did not think through when we came up with that title in the first place.

4
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:31,523
So my name is Alex. I am the co-founder and former CEO of Showdown.

5
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:34,124
I'm saying former CEO because we got acquired last year.

6
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:37,506
So everything I'm going to show you today, you can't buy anymore.

7
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:39,527
At least I won't be selling it to you.

8
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:44,630
But on the upside, we learned a ton in the process.

9
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,613
And this talk is really about getting you guys to kind of

10
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:53,655
figure out how the role of a community manager is evolving

11
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:59,119
as games are evolving, and how a couple of really cool tricks

12
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:00,559
can help you a ton.

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,060
Quick question first.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,282
Who here is a community manager?

15
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:06,683
OK.

16
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:11,751
Who got hooked by the AI and machine learning thing for nerds?

17
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:13,452
Yes, me too.

18
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:16,315
OK, excellent.

19
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:21,239
So for you guys, I'll try to not go too deep into the tech.

20
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:23,000
We can have discussion afterwards.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,922
Because it's really about how we can

22
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:28,705
make it simple and useful for the purpose of creating

23
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:31,147
communities, which is kind of why we're here right now.

24
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:33,069
So this is Bia.

25
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:34,150
Hi, I'm Bia.

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,971
I'm the former head of marketing at Showdown.

27
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:38,988
And yeah, let's dive into it.

28
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:41,609
All right, and Alex will be talking about the techie stuff,

29
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,610
and I'll be talking about anything that doesn't involve code.

30
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,471
So let's get started.

31
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:48,272
Where are your players interacting with one another today?

32
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:50,513
We're not here to tell you that communities

33
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:52,654
are beneficial to products or games, we already know that.

34
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,155
But what we're here to talk about

35
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:57,356
is where these communities are shifting to,

36
00:01:57,956 --> 00:02:00,477
and where it's important to begin allocating resources to.

37
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,438
And what we're talking about specifically

38
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,699
is in-game communities.

39
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:07,647
There's a clear trend between long-running successful games

40
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,848
and games that have in-game communities.

41
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,651
So player engagement is critical today.

42
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:16,372
It's as important as the gameplay itself.

43
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:19,813
And how do you improve that organically?

44
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,421
by enabling in-game interactions.

45
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:25,644
In-game interactions have shown to keep players in the game

46
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:27,125
and make them more likely to spend.

47
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:31,169
Take in a basic in-game social feature such as chats.

48
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,853
Chats have been shown to double retention.

49
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:37,575
This is because players are staying in the game

50
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:39,297
to get their social fix, and not only that,

51
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:41,619
but they can also request help from players in the game

52
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:42,740
without ever leaving the game.

53
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:47,342
There was research published in 2014 that showed that

54
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:52,283
players that had invested time in online communities were more likely to stay through

55
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:55,944
the concept of social capital and interdependence.

56
00:02:56,084 --> 00:02:58,145
So people that invest more heavily in your communities

57
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,825
are going to be more likely to stay.

58
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:03,266
And throughout this talk, we'll be using Clash Royale as an example

59
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:06,127
because they've just crushed it in terms of building in-game communities

60
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,868
and they have every social feature in the book.

61
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:13,279
You know, unfortunately for most of us, most studios can't really deliver this kind of

62
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:13,819
experience.

63
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:21,706
So what's really interesting, if you look at basic social interactions like creating

64
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:26,129
forums, creating chats, those end up being quite personal.

65
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:30,270
Creating a connection with a player is really a one-on-one relationship.

66
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,990
The chats that Bea mentioned earlier,

67
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,652
basically it's about you guys, community managers,

68
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:39,755
talking with players and getting personal with them.

69
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:44,797
So how many of those players can one community manager know and interact with?

70
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:48,559
I don't know, maybe a thousand, ten thousand if you're super good in social skills.

71
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,601
Pretty standard for me.

72
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:53,982
And how do you even choose?

73
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,181
whom to spend time with, because if you have a million players,

74
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:01,322
10 million players, even 100,000 players,

75
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:05,344
how do you choose which one to focus on and make sure

76
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:06,725
that you keep in the game?

77
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:09,726
Is the player that's spending the most the most important

78
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:10,027
for you?

79
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,928
I think we have proof later on in this talk

80
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:14,149
that this is not the case.

81
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,391
So what I'm getting at here is that scaling in-game

82
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:21,592
interaction is hard, because interaction is inherently

83
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:22,233
one-to-one.

84
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:26,158
And well, I know Bia.

85
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:27,459
We've built a relationship.

86
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,680
I don't know any of you guys.

87
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,101
We may become friends or not.

88
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:31,001
It will take time.

89
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:35,585
So this thing, there's a trick, though.

90
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:42,090
Because you guys, through your games, are sitting on a ton of

91
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,111
data, literally.

92
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:47,794
So this is typically a simple screenshot from the Google

93
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49,696
Play Games Player Analytics.

94
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:50,397
It's one of the.

95
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:54,678
X analytics tool that you may or may not be using,

96
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:55,698
you probably have one.

97
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,999
If you have a game, you are probably

98
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,079
getting those events stored somewhere.

99
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,820
And if you look at it, that's super nice.

100
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,981
It's actually a drill down of some of the events in a game.

101
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:09,461
And well, if as a human being you

102
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:11,302
can actually take any conclusions from that,

103
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,802
you're my hero, because I can't.

104
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:15,763
You need technology to do that.

105
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:18,183
It's like a ton of data, very hard to.

106
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:20,535
find the patterns through that data.

107
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,276
Luckily, there's tech for that.

108
00:05:24,897 --> 00:05:27,618
The way we built Showdown as we did,

109
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:29,960
it was really not to create another analytic tool,

110
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,820
analytical tool.

111
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,861
There's a ton of them.

112
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:38,081
We really worked hard with a couple of community managers that we handpicked of top games,

113
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:44,188
trying to figure out what were the objectives that they were trying to achieve.

114
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:49,994
And we came up with like literally five of them that we focused on as we created the tool.

115
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,871
One was creating a community pulse.

116
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,834
Really figuring out what, how is the community doing?

117
00:05:57,554 --> 00:05:59,636
Is it getting closer together?

118
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:01,377
Is it getting personal?

119
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:03,339
Or are people actually falling apart?

120
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,700
Are they happy?

121
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,001
Are they helping?

122
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:07,742
Are they fighting?

123
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:09,404
What's going on in your community?

124
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:10,765
How is it performing?

125
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:12,866
Preventing churn.

126
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:15,649
Basically, everything you put in place,

127
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:16,489
you want it to be...

128
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,912
to kind of help preventing children.

129
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:21,054
You want people to stay, to feel that they belong,

130
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:24,358
that they have a space where they have friends

131
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,041
that they can go to to have fun and be in a cool place.

132
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,773
you want to push them into paying.

133
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:31,575
You don't want to push them into paying

134
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:35,859
and increase conversion by marketing them the new in-app.

135
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,302
You want that their friends help them discover

136
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:40,304
how they can beat a boss easily,

137
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:43,147
how they can use that item in a better way,

138
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:46,771
and really kind of get that knowledge from the crowd,

139
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:50,315
from their peers, and not from the marketing.

140
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:57,198
Then, one of the things that we realized is that you guys are spending way, well actually

141
00:06:57,238 --> 00:07:01,641
you community manager guys are spending way too much time making videos for ads.

142
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,903
We automated that because it was boring.

143
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:13,089
And we wanted that sense of community to really be a thing and we wanted to be able to measure

144
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,291
it and make sure that this is not.

145
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:22,249
a crowd, not a group, but really a community where there is kind of a love being created

146
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:26,914
between the players and they are feeling like they belong and that they want to be there.

147
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:35,003
So the way we really did approach the program was through the videos. Text is cool.

148
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,808
But like we discussed just earlier on, you have multiple languages.

149
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:44,012
There are a lot of barriers to text. Text is complicated.

150
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:48,295
But videos are so easy. It's the video game in the first place.

151
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:49,977
How do you describe what you're doing in the game?

152
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:53,960
Hey, I jumped here, I took this word, I slashed it through.

153
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,881
What did I do wrong?

154
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:58,723
I can't really tell you if I don't see how you do it.

155
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:00,044
So video is paramount.

156
00:08:00,944 --> 00:08:03,746
And we recreated the whole thing around the ability

157
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:05,766
to identify when something is going on in the game,

158
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:08,188
capturing that moment, creating video sequences,

159
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:10,169
and using that to fuel social loops.

160
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:12,770
That's pretty much what Bob does here.

161
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,531
He wins, he has a cool video, and he gets social rewards.

162
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,172
The same thing happens when he fails.

163
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,413
He can get help.

164
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:23,152
So social loops were really the core

165
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:25,393
of what we build the technology around.

166
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,535
And this is based on academic research.

167
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:29,856
There's a paper here at the bottom

168
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:31,257
that I really suggest you read

169
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:32,437
if you wanna have a good foundation

170
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:33,898
for building your own social loops.

171
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,420
But this paper basically outlines the components

172
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,841
required to build a sense of community.

173
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,962
And they are reinforcement of needs,

174
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,804
membership, influence, and shared emotional connection.

175
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,505
And here's an example here on the right

176
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,586
that I'm gonna go into more on the next slide.

177
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,749
So how many of you are familiar with Nair El's hook model?

178
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,251
One, good.

179
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:59,335
So for most of you, the 99 of you that don't know,

180
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:02,098
it's a really popular product design model,

181
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:03,539
especially here in Silicon Valley.

182
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,845
And what it's designed to do is create a habit,

183
00:09:09,285 --> 00:09:12,688
create habit forming actions at high frequency.

184
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:17,318
So to quickly go over it, a user starts with a trigger.

185
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:19,280
It can be either internal or external.

186
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,582
An example of an internal trigger is boredom.

187
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,644
External can be a notification.

188
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:27,407
An action, which should be really easy to complete,

189
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,449
otherwise people won't because people are lazy.

190
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,211
Then we have the variable reward,

191
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,693
which is the most important step.

192
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:36,656
People like being able to predict things

193
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,438
and variability drives them crazy.

194
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:41,501
So anticipation is mostly a stress response

195
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,083
to what you're about to receive.

196
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:46,847
So making sure that your reward's a variable is key here.

197
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:55,576
And then finally investment, you know, the action that you want the user to take that's going to, you know, enable him to invest more time or effort into the game.

198
00:09:55,996 --> 00:10:00,841
And this ideally should load the trigger by setting off a chain of events that enables the delivery of the next trigger.

199
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:05,472
So as you can see social books are really a social adaptation of Mary

200
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:10,233
also model and we've we have our favorite class rail here and we have

201
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:14,955
to to examples we have the game hook. So you know you you get a

202
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:18,936
notification that it just been unlocked you open the chest you receive for

203
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:22,737
new cards, you know what they're going to be and then you know play a

204
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:25,298
match and then that loads the next year is probably going to try to

205
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:25,998
unlock a new chest.

206
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,578
So on the social side, we have, you know,

207
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:32,146
you get a notification, you have a new clan message.

208
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:34,192
So you go and you scroll the clan chat.

209
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:37,593
And just a quick plug about news feeds here.

210
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:41,373
The reason that news feeds are so ubiquitous in products

211
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:43,294
is that they're kind of like a slot machine.

212
00:10:43,554 --> 00:10:45,114
You know, you go, you scroll,

213
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:46,734
and you don't know if you're gonna find a shit post

214
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:48,615
or if you're gonna find something really awesome.

215
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:51,375
So, you go to the clan chat,

216
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,896
and maybe you find an interesting new tactic.

217
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,676
And to thank the person for sharing that tactic,

218
00:10:56,696 --> 00:10:59,377
you might donate a card, and then you go to play a match,

219
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,397
and that really just kind of sets off the loop again.

220
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:09,359
So the way we built the system, and this is pretty much,

221
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,561
I think, very representative of what you guys will need

222
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,482
or are using, probably, if you're

223
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:15,383
doing that kind of thing.

224
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:16,643
You first need the telemetry.

225
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:17,904
You need access to the data.

226
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:19,045
Data is paramount.

227
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,266
It's what you build everything on.

228
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:24,208
So you need to be able to access not just the events,

229
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:26,509
but sometimes real-time data.

230
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:27,910
And that's what we actually built.

231
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,351
We were caching the events that you already

232
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,412
logged through your game as a service platform.

233
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:36,194
We were also hooking on variables in the game engine

234
00:11:36,214 --> 00:11:38,135
and looking at them in real time.

235
00:11:39,356 --> 00:11:43,358
So that's really like the cornerstone of everything.

236
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:46,660
No data, can't know if the user is doing well,

237
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,941
can't understand anything else.

238
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:49,641
Then we had the video production.

239
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:53,263
So that one, you can get away from if you can.

240
00:11:53,303 --> 00:11:54,783
You should get away from if you can.

241
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:58,124
Because in our case, we're building a platform

242
00:11:58,164 --> 00:11:59,945
to integrate into games, into third party games.

243
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:04,346
So we couldn't assume that you guys and that game developer

244
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:07,067
had cooked into his game the ability to do replays.

245
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:08,368
in a smart way.

246
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,349
And by smart way, I mean just replaying actions.

247
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:13,130
Clash Royale typically does replay you.

248
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,352
When you watch a TV Royale game, it's not a video.

249
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:19,814
They are playing the game over through the events

250
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:21,755
and just putting the cards on the deck

251
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:23,676
at the same speed, at the same pace.

252
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:25,436
Comes with a few caveats,

253
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:27,598
but it's definitely much lighter and easier to implement.

254
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:30,879
So if you can avoid doing that, it's cool.

255
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:33,941
If your game is highly physics-based, super complicated,

256
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:36,422
maybe it's not always possible.

257
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,550
Then the social is cool.

258
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,291
When you have users, you understand them,

259
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:43,632
you have content, you can push

260
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:45,473
and you can connect those users with content.

261
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:46,473
You need a place to do that.

262
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,975
So we built chats, forums, groups,

263
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:52,517
all kind of systems to allow interactions

264
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:55,319
between the users and the ability to publish

265
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:56,720
and promote the content to those guys.

266
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:59,659
And finally, the one most important thing

267
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,001
is for the community manager to actually understand

268
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:04,263
what's going on, who are those guys,

269
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:07,785
what are the various interactions that are happening

270
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:12,609
inside the game, and creating hooks and creating automation

271
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:15,652
so that you can see, hey, I feel like all those guys

272
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:19,014
that are doing the same action are having the same problem.

273
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:24,158
Maybe if I put a reward cycle or a reinforcement cycle here.

274
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:28,060
that will help out some of the game design problems,

275
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:28,921
and we actually built that.

276
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,343
So it's pretty cool because then you can use social

277
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:34,564
and you can use your community to help out

278
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:37,245
when maybe the game design has a few problems

279
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:38,906
that would take too long to solve.

280
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:43,689
You can make it a quick fix by giving the power to users.

281
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:44,509
That's pretty cool.

282
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,711
So a couple of things about telemetry.

283
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:52,665
So telemetry really is like in a Formula One.

284
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:57,389
If you ever looked, watched a Formula One competition,

285
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,971
you always see all those curves going up and down

286
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:00,892
in every direction.

287
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:01,573
It's super cool.

288
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:04,275
So basically, it's analyzing what's going on

289
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:08,239
in the system in real time, and as fast as you can.

290
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:11,602
So it's getting a lot of data, and by a lot, I mean a ton.

291
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,624
You can be as verbose as you want.

292
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,662
Does it matter to get all the data?

293
00:14:16,902 --> 00:14:21,427
Well, if you don't have something to analyze it does not, obviously.

294
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:25,973
If you are alone and you are going to be analyzing all the data about yourself

295
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:28,996
and you don't have the right tools to do it, it's pretty overwhelming

296
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,758
and it's going to be very hard to analyze.

297
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,962
But it's the...

298
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:38,251
it's like the step one to be able to train

299
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:41,016
an artificial intelligence model to learn stuff.

300
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:43,482
So one of the things that we found is that

301
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:45,085
in order to train.

302
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:51,018
an artificial intelligence system, basically what you need is data and information.

303
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:56,001
So that, like, classified information. I know that the user managed to pick this word.

304
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:00,844
I know that the user performed well. I know that the user hit the milestone.

305
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:06,567
I know that the user missed a turn or missed a quest or missed something.

306
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:10,969
And basically, all that data comes from your QA team.

307
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,691
As you are building the game, as they are playing the game,

308
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,392
they create a ton of data.

309
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:19,113
So they're actually creating your training set for you.

310
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:22,414
And this is really enough just to bootstrap the whole process.

311
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:24,275
You need a ton of data,

312
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:27,356
and the system really learns along the way.

313
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:30,317
It needs to be bootstrapped, and QA does that just fine.

314
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:35,239
And what's the ultimate result of data, of that much data?

315
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:37,420
It's really about figuring out whether it's a hot dog or not.

316
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:41,893
So if you have watched Silicon Valley history, what it does,

317
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:44,776
it tells you if that thing is there or not.

318
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:46,898
So in Silicon Valley, hot dog, not hot dog.

319
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:50,883
In our case, it's beat the boss, not beat the boss.

320
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,648
Lost many lives, not lost them before he got to the boss

321
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,991
and came to the boss in good shape.

322
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:04,477
he always drifts too much and ends up hitting the curve on the Formula 1 game,

323
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:08,520
it's all those information that you are able to identify through the data to

324
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,965
figure out what kind of a player you have in front of you and what was his

325
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:16,087
trajectory through the journey in the game.

326
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:22,328
Data is really about, it's basically probabilities.

327
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:26,369
The engine looks at the data that you give him,

328
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:29,130
and what's really cool is that once you've had all those data

329
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,130
pre-processed, you don't need them anymore.

330
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:35,432
Basically, you have your model, and you can just, in real time,

331
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:38,592
analyze the data of any player and tell, hey, OK,

332
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:40,413
so he's taking the turn just fine.

333
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:44,454
He is changing gears at the right time.

334
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:49,999
he is not speeding too much on that line because there is a turn coming up,

335
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:56,625
he is braking at the right, about the right, the right position, and you can analyze all this information and make it very holistic.

336
00:16:56,845 --> 00:17:04,652
And this is how the engine actually perceives your game. It's just statistics and looking whether you hit another threshold.

337
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:06,153
So, uh...

338
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:13,026
It's really raw, but at the end what you know is that you are able to characterize how your player is behaving.

339
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:20,412
And some things are really complex, but what I really want you to get away with is that you can do it in very simple ways.

340
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:24,755
Because every game, we looked at it in a very generic and holistic way.

341
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:29,780
If you start looking at your specific game, how your gameplay is made, and how everything has been built,

342
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,785
you can oversimplify a lot of the assumptions that we had to keep very generic, and make it much easier for you.

343
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:43,694
So another added benefit of using this technology and having in-game communities in your game is you have the potential for enhanced metrics.

344
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:48,837
So in the past we've looked at things you know such as referrals, growth, and engagement.

345
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:53,479
And then when you have in-game communities you can start looking at things like network density and social value.

346
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:01,884
As Alex was saying earlier, network density is basically measuring how many of your players are, or know one another, or are connected to one another.

347
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:04,598
And this is a good measure of the community's health.

348
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:08,079
Another really cool concept is social value,

349
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:10,240
which was coined by our friends at Ninja Metrics.

350
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,240
Check them out.

351
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,360
And what this identifies is basically the influence

352
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:16,981
of a particular player across the spend of the community.

353
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:20,882
So what they found was that your highest spending players

354
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:22,302
might not be the most important ones

355
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:24,483
because there are players called social whales

356
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:26,683
that actually influence a lot of the spend.

357
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:29,424
And through in-game communities in this application,

358
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:31,444
you can really measure that.

359
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:32,625
So that's really cool.

360
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:39,111
So to show you how this technology can be applied,

361
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:41,153
we worked with True Access last summer

362
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:43,656
to prototype a showdown implementation.

363
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:45,778
And this video should be playing.

364
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:48,100
Yeah, well, it's not going to be playing.

365
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,723
Well, they make True Skate, which

366
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,526
is a really cool mobile skate simulation game.

367
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:54,887
It's kind of like a tech deck.

368
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:56,048
You ride the board with your fingers.

369
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:56,949
How many of you guys have played it?

370
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:01,362
No, yeah, yeah, it's really fun, it's one of my favorites.

371
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:03,802
It's been in like the top 10 for over a year now,

372
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,743
it's like the number two game on the sports,

373
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:07,903
in the sports genre.

374
00:19:08,903 --> 00:19:11,204
So they already had a replay system,

375
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:13,244
and what they really wanted was to, you know,

376
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,984
automate it, make it a little better, cleaner,

377
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:17,285
because the runs were limitless.

378
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,365
So they wanted us to find the highlights

379
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:22,106
and quickly produce highlight reels

380
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,066
that then players could share.

381
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:26,327
And we also wanted to tack on that social loop,

382
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:30,129
that social component to build those in-game interactions.

383
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,850
And the thing that we were focused on here

384
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:36,093
was enabling players to receive help automatically

385
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:36,813
from their peers.

386
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:39,695
So to allow a video to surface, for example,

387
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:42,556
if a player couldn't nail a certain trick,

388
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:44,097
if he had failed X amount of times,

389
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:46,318
to be able to see a replay from a player

390
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:47,879
that had successfully completed the trick.

391
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:51,362
And here's an example of a specific social loop.

392
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:55,345
Again, our objective was to enable peer collaboration.

393
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,948
And here we have a case where, again,

394
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:01,671
these videos already exist because TruSkate

395
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:03,152
has a replay system.

396
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:07,474
So maybe you've been playing this this level and you're unable to beat the high

397
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:12,757
score challenge and you you know you quit and then a player you know happens

398
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:16,938
to do a certain combo within the realm of where you've been playing and you get

399
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,020
a notification that says a new video has been selected for you or something with

400
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,501
better copywriting and the action is to watch the short highlight reel.

401
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:28,527
And then your variable reward is maybe you discover a really unique combo that you hadn't

402
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:31,849
tried before that you're able to use to beat that high score challenge.

403
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:35,791
And the investment then goes to, you know, directly in the game, you can complete the

404
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:39,814
level and load the next trigger, depending on what kind of, if you have any social graphs

405
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:43,436
or, you know, other social features implemented in the game, you can also give that back to

406
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:44,836
that creator with a good old follow.

407
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:49,130
So the way we integrated that is actually pretty simple.

408
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,032
I'm going to go through the slide

409
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:52,913
because there are a few ideas that I really want to share.

410
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,435
So first, we integrated pretty deeply into the engine.

411
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,236
They had their own game engine,

412
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,959
so we had to hook pretty deeply into the rendering,

413
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,481
their analytics, their events,

414
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,643
grab a few extra events that were missing

415
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:07,845
that we needed to be able to really analyze properly

416
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:10,887
what's going on, and basically grab data.

417
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:15,828
What was really fun is when we started doing the edits, because we were giving the power

418
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:21,810
for the users to let us know whether one of the, what we thought was interesting, whether

419
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,870
it was interesting or not.

420
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,771
So we decided, hey, it looks like you were doing a trick, you were either attempting

421
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:29,572
it or succeeding at it, we think you did a good job.

422
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:32,555
But sometimes the user was just like, hey, no, this is bullshit.

423
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:33,696
This is not interesting.

424
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:34,437
I don't like that.

425
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:35,458
Let's remove those.

426
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:37,700
Or on the contrary, hey, you totally missed that trick.

427
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:45,067
So this is how you create a feedback loop into the model by letting the users can't let

428
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:45,268
you

429
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:50,501
tell you how you perform, how well the model really understood what they were doing,

430
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:53,843
if they understood everything, if they missed some pieces.

431
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:57,445
And every AI system needs those feedback loops,

432
00:21:57,505 --> 00:22:01,508
because it's not a thing that you build once

433
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:03,689
and hope it will live forever.

434
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:04,970
Unfortunately, everyone is different.

435
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,891
Some people have other expectations.

436
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:11,394
So we ended up actually tuning the engine for different people,

437
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:13,155
so that some would...

438
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:17,298
like, were more experiencing, were expecting, like, much

439
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:21,081
really epic tricks and only epic tricks, not the average tricks.

440
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:25,124
The others were really like, oh, give me everything I would like to share as much as I want,

441
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:27,686
and were less, wanted more quantity,

442
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,728
and not just the best ones.

443
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:32,090
And so it was really interesting to create, to understand how

444
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,513
every user actually had different expectations in terms of the content that they wanted to

445
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:39,075
see created for them and wanted to share.

446
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:44,339
And giving them that ability to give us feedback

447
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:46,561
and enhance the mode, it really allowed

448
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:49,784
us to tune it for some different type of users.

449
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,626
Finding the publishing is really easy.

450
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:55,809
It was like one click that goes either on social

451
00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:00,513
or in the inside feed, in the internal feed of the app.

452
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:03,656
And what's really interesting here is that.

453
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,882
We realized a few things along the way.

454
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:08,544
What we're doing here, it's cool for social,

455
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:12,627
but QA loves it because they're able to actually understand

456
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:14,629
what's going on in the game when something is going wrong.

457
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:16,550
Why are the users failing?

458
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:20,514
They can't judge when something is wrong from the telemetry.

459
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:22,075
They can't always reproduce.

460
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:23,856
But when you gave them video, they're super happy.

461
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,117
It's like double thumbs up.

462
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:28,700
And the other guy that loved that is the ad networks,

463
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,704
because you create a ton of content that can be turned

464
00:23:32,724 --> 00:23:34,105
into ads if you want to.

465
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,748
So we actually had a few interesting encounters based

466
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:39,569
on that that we did not expect at all.

467
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:41,571
So it's really like understanding,

468
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:43,552
being able to put together videos

469
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:48,036
and use them as basically the steam for social loops.

470
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,579
That's a pretty cool idea, and that's not hard to do.

471
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,525
What, since last summer when we stopped doing it,

472
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:57,326
a ton of people have tried,

473
00:23:57,346 --> 00:23:59,606
have started going into that direction.

474
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,027
Whether it's creating communities through chats,

475
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:06,788
whether it's analyzing better who are the key players,

476
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:08,528
whether it's cooking more tools.

477
00:24:08,568 --> 00:24:11,449
So those are, I literally randomly picked four of them

478
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:13,490
to put some stuff on this slide,

479
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,630
but there's like a ton of them.

480
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,350
Everybody's going to that direction.

481
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,831
And what we've seen from working with some of the top

482
00:24:20,411 --> 00:24:22,072
publisher and editors in the industry.

483
00:24:22,952 --> 00:24:27,933
is not only are they on par, but they are definitely cooking those things

484
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,394
from the inception of their games.

485
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:35,976
Now, every game that we've been, we've talked with some pretty big shots,

486
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:39,297
and, like, they were literally, including all those mechanics,

487
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:41,117
at the start of the game.

488
00:24:41,597 --> 00:24:46,719
And that's one of the few takeaways that I really want you guys to go home with.

489
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:51,793
A, as community managers, your role is changing.

490
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:53,894
It's not only about acquisition.

491
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,314
It's not only about social.

492
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:58,615
It's about building a game with social.

493
00:24:58,675 --> 00:25:01,336
So it's just as important as the game mechanics.

494
00:25:01,856 --> 00:25:04,217
It's just as important as the game design

495
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:06,257
and comes first in the game.

496
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:08,698
You players are your number one asset.

497
00:25:09,594 --> 00:25:16,857
It's about figuring out how to keep them here and how to invest on them so that they create a community and stay together.

498
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:21,839
You want them in your game. You don't want them on Facebook. You don't want them on Twitch. I love Facebook. I love Twitch.

499
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:23,859
If you guys are here.

500
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,820
Duh. Duh. Duh.

501
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:31,262
You want them in your game. Your game is your medium. Keep them there.

502
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:34,036
and you already have a ton of data.

503
00:25:34,397 --> 00:25:35,919
You are going to have a ton of data.

504
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:39,344
It's about building steps, step by step,

505
00:25:39,484 --> 00:25:42,388
and building on top of the data to understand your players

506
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:44,311
and be relevant and help them.

507
00:25:45,183 --> 00:25:46,424
find their place in your game.

508
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:49,185
Finally, social loops are really your responsibility

509
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:50,106
as community managers.

510
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:53,047
I've seen too many times in game studio that divide

511
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:57,149
where game design works on his side,

512
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:59,409
data analytics on another side,

513
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,771
and there's a social here that tries to get a few ideas

514
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:06,412
to create rooms, create tournaments, create stuff, events.

515
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,533
And there's really that disconnect.

516
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:11,635
And what we've seen is that games that really make it

517
00:26:12,275 --> 00:26:12,855
are games that

518
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:19,617
manage from the start of the process to put all those things in the same room at the same time and build the game

519
00:26:20,097 --> 00:26:21,777
from all those different perspectives.

520
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:27,418
And that's like paramount, and it's really your role as social, as community manager to

521
00:26:27,478 --> 00:26:32,479
be there and to put that idea that social loops are going to make the game.

522
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:37,620
Just like game mechanics. If you have bad game mechanics, it's not going to happen, but

523
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,401
provided that you can make proper games, you need social loops to make it really happen.

524
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:46,688
So a little shameless plug, now that we're not there anymore,

525
00:26:47,348 --> 00:26:49,910
I'm doing a blockchain network for cross-game inventory

526
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,350
trading.

527
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,291
We are needing community managers.

528
00:26:52,431 --> 00:26:53,652
Please come and see me.

529
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,414
And Bia.

530
00:26:56,494 --> 00:26:57,955
And I'm the marketing director of Blacknut,

531
00:26:57,975 --> 00:26:59,937
which is a new personalized game streaming service.

532
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:01,037
Think Netflix for games.

533
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:02,778
And we just launched in select countries in Europe.

534
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:03,879
And we'll be in the US soon.

535
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:04,520
So check us out.

536
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,382
And we managed to have a few more minutes for questions.

537
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:08,702
So please feel free to come.

538
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:11,244
Yay, thank you.

539
00:27:11,284 --> 00:27:12,885
Thank you.

540
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,231
Oh, and before I forget, you are not

541
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:19,873
allowed to leave trash under your seats and stuff.

542
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:20,854
And you have to clean up the room.

543
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:23,636
And you have to give us a super cool rating,

544
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:26,097
because they're printing those trading card games

545
00:27:26,117 --> 00:27:29,399
with the name of the speakers from last year, next year.

546
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,160
So your rating really matters.

547
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:32,501
Please rate us.

548
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:33,562
Thank you.

549
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:35,003
And questions, anyone?

550
00:27:37,284 --> 00:27:38,004
Come on, don't be shy.

551
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:38,925
I won't bite.

552
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:41,266
Yes, there's a mic right here.

553
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:41,426
Oh.

554
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:43,748
He does bite.

555
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,213
No, only on occasions.

556
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:49,517
So I work in analytics, so I really

557
00:27:49,557 --> 00:27:52,098
want to know how you measured effectiveness

558
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:53,799
of that social loop that you just

559
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,999
introduced to your community.

560
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:57,860
And two is, do you give, for example,

561
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,121
A-B experiments or at least different treatments

562
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:01,361
to your community members?

563
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:03,842
Because one thing my game experiences a lot

564
00:28:04,242 --> 00:28:08,304
is when players experience variable treatments,

565
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:11,565
they yell out and be like, hey, why are other members receiving

566
00:28:11,605 --> 00:28:12,145
different things?

567
00:28:13,245 --> 00:28:14,746
Have you encountered situations like that?

568
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:18,747
So in our case, it was a bit easier than that.

569
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:21,949
So we had the base model.

570
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:25,871
Basically, we had the baseline that was analyzing what is

571
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:26,572
going on in the game.

572
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:28,733
And that's pretty much the same for everyone.

573
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:30,474
That one was pretty standard.

574
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:32,676
We didn't find any need for variations there.

575
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:35,998
What we found a lot of need for variations is how we

576
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:39,680
assemble the video, how we identify what's interesting,

577
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:41,602
what's good, and what's bad for a user.

578
00:28:41,642 --> 00:28:43,863
From one user to another, some will want to.

579
00:28:44,524 --> 00:28:48,486
to fail more before they kind of get in touch with someone,

580
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:50,048
someone wants to fail less.

581
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:51,949
So there's a kind of variability.

582
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:55,572
And that, in our case, it's really

583
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:56,492
about social interaction.

584
00:28:56,512 --> 00:28:59,094
So people, it's not impacting the gameplay at all.

585
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:02,477
It's like you lost, and you end up in that chat.

586
00:29:02,897 --> 00:29:05,479
And you have that guy, hey, what happened?

587
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:06,359
Why did you lose?

588
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,822
Why did you not take the sword before going to the boss?

589
00:29:10,102 --> 00:29:10,843
You're like, which sword?

590
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:14,645
Well, you know, the one in the closet, two rooms back.

591
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:15,505
Wait, what?

592
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:16,226
There was a room?

593
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:17,446
And that's how you had them.

594
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:23,290
So we had the variability mostly for the social sharing.

595
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,051
Some people had different needs for social share.

596
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:28,513
When we came from reward loops and social loops inside the

597
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,634
game, not so much.

598
00:29:31,414 --> 00:29:32,355
The only thing we tried to.

599
00:29:33,255 --> 00:29:37,197
to do is to not push too many interactions.

600
00:29:37,537 --> 00:29:40,619
We really wanted not to disrupt the gameplay.

601
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:43,740
Gameplay had to stay as it was, because we're

602
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,581
coming on top of games that were already there.

603
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:48,322
And we didn't want the game designer

604
00:29:48,362 --> 00:29:50,883
to start blowing a fuse and say, oh, you

605
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:51,984
are changing everything in my game.

606
00:29:52,004 --> 00:29:52,904
It's never going to happen.

607
00:29:53,284 --> 00:29:55,785
So we had to recreate and wrap the game

608
00:29:55,945 --> 00:29:57,206
around with a social layer.

609
00:29:57,806 --> 00:29:59,047
So from that perspective, it was easier.

610
00:30:00,627 --> 00:30:03,930
Let's say, so we did not have that many issues,

611
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,831
aside from creating the content itself.

612
00:30:06,132 --> 00:30:06,812
Sorry to follow up.

613
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,614
How did you measure the effectiveness

614
00:30:08,754 --> 00:30:11,477
of the things that introduced to your game, for example,

615
00:30:11,657 --> 00:30:12,958
that interactive video?

616
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:13,519
That's going...

617
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,540
Those are the, uh, basically the metrics

618
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,441
that we introduced in, uh...

619
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:20,357
So we created a few metrics, the network density score

620
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:22,178
that we are measuring.

621
00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:25,699
We were also measuring the social value of the user.

622
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:27,640
We were also measuring a few other stuff

623
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,801
that I can come here up, right here.

624
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:33,182
We were measuring the community person,

625
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:35,943
that was kind of a metric that we put together

626
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:40,065
based on a number of different...

627
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,289
how many people are following each other,

628
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:46,030
how many are they connecting, are they talking,

629
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,431
how many people are interacting one with another.

630
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:49,912
So there were a bunch of variables

631
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,092
that we kind of put together

632
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,413
to create a community pulse,

633
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,314
and that was kind of a core KPI

634
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,335
that we're trying to optimize against.

635
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:59,756
The other were pretty standard, like the churn,

636
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,636
all the other were the basic KPIs.

637
00:31:01,996 --> 00:31:03,677
But when we were creating content,

638
00:31:03,717 --> 00:31:07,278
the idea was really to use content to create,

639
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,339
to spark interactions.

640
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,000
So we wanted to, I'm pushing that content to you guys,

641
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,441
to you because I believe that if you see that content,

642
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,081
you will react.

643
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:17,162
If you're not reacting, I did a bad job,

644
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:18,323
and we need to iterate my model.

645
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,564
But it is important to create specific KPIs

646
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:22,184
for each social loop and implement them

647
00:31:22,224 --> 00:31:23,805
into your analytics dashboard.

648
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:29,941
Anything else?

649
00:31:30,982 --> 00:31:31,422
Any jokes?

650
00:31:31,662 --> 00:31:32,262
You guys got jokes?

651
00:31:32,302 --> 00:31:32,562
We don't.

652
00:31:34,763 --> 00:31:37,324
Oh, I think at 3.30, we are good.

653
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:38,565
Thanks so much, guys, for coming.

654
00:31:38,585 --> 00:31:39,385
We appreciate it.

655
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:40,166
Don't forget to rate.

656
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:41,366
We want to be on the cast next year.

657
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:43,847
And thanks for coming.
