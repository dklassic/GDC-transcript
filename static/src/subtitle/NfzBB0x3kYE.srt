1
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:06,686
This is amazing!

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:07,887
Hi.

3
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:11,110
My name is John To.

4
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:12,912
I'm a writer at Bungie,

5
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,315
and that was the voice of Lord Shaxs,

6
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:17,097
one of our most popular characters

7
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:19,359
from our first-person shooter, Destiny 2.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,272
Shaxx is the announcer of Destiny's Crucible,

9
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:26,855
which is our arena-based player versus player mode.

10
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,698
Today, I'll be talking about how our team found

11
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:33,461
that a well-written, supportive character like Lord Shaxx

12
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:36,824
can enhance the player experience in competitive game modes

13
00:00:37,264 --> 00:00:39,886
while telling an important story, the players.

14
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:46,893
I've been working on Shaxx since Destiny the Taken King, our first big expansion, and I

15
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,978
brought the shoutcaster quality to Shaxx's dialogue.

16
00:00:50,178 --> 00:00:54,886
I've been the fictional creative behind Shaxx's backstory in Grimoire and background lore

17
00:00:55,286 --> 00:00:55,687
since then.

18
00:00:56,694 --> 00:01:00,197
I worked very closely with senior designer Andrew Weldon, who's sitting right there.

19
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:05,942
Andrew masterminds the triggers for Shaxs in nearly all of Destiny's Crucible modes.

20
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:12,327
He is an expert on the player's PvP experience in Destiny, and he uses that expertise to

21
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:15,810
decide the different contexts in which Shaxs speaks.

22
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:20,844
Before we go deeper, here is a quick overview of the talk.

23
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:23,145
I'll be covering the writing process

24
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:25,286
in the development of Lord Shaxx

25
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:28,468
as Destiny's first PvP announcer character.

26
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:31,009
As a part of that process,

27
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:33,530
I'll broadly cover Shaxx's development history

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,751
as far as his writing goes.

29
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:37,972
The character changed pretty dramatically

30
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:40,693
between Destiny 1 and 2, as you're going to see.

31
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,647
Then I'll go into how Shaxs helps tell the player's story

32
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:48,311
in the context of Destiny's PvP mode, The Crucible.

33
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:51,633
I'll also cover how we continue to iterate

34
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:53,915
on the techniques that we used in writing Shaxs

35
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,497
through a new character called the Drifter.

36
00:01:57,038 --> 00:01:59,000
And Drifter is Destiny's newest announcer

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,942
in a new competitive mode called Gambit.

38
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:05,545
And finally, I'll share the writing pillars

39
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,067
that I developed over the course of this process,

40
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:11,530
and will continue to use for future announcers in Destiny.

41
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:16,583
So first up for the uninitiated, who is Shaxx?

42
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:18,726
He is the voice of Destiny's Crucible,

43
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,409
and the Crucible is our collection

44
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:24,733
of arena-based player versus player modes in Destiny.

45
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:28,317
Shaxx is unique from most first-person shooter announcers

46
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:31,000
found in games like Unreal Tournament and Halo.

47
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,213
in that both of those games featured disembodied voices as announcers

48
00:02:36,654 --> 00:02:40,555
that reacted to the player and gave game-critical information

49
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,136
but were not in themselves characters.

50
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,318
Lord Shaxx is an announcer in that vein,

51
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:49,879
but he also exists in the Destiny universe with a history

52
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,781
and has a personal stake in the players, in all of you.

53
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:58,043
Here's an example of what Shaxx sounds like in Destiny gameplay

54
00:02:58,223 --> 00:02:59,843
from the Taken King expansion.

55
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,436
One final push and victory is yours. Triple down!

56
00:03:16,516 --> 00:03:19,117
This is amazing! Outstanding!

57
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:23,239
You're unstoppable! Seventh column!

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:38,504
Another battle won. On to the next fight.

59
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:42,939
So as we just heard, Shaxs is a little bloodthirsty,

60
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,159
but he loves our players.

61
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,680
In the fictional world of Destiny,

62
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,941
Shaxs is a super-powered defender

63
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,562
of the last city of humanity,

64
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:53,023
who no longer fights on the front lines.

65
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,864
He's given up that role to train new guardians

66
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,765
of the city, who are the players.

67
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,166
Shaxs didn't start out this way, though,

68
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:03,068
and it took a bit of work to get him to where he is today.

69
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,021
Lord Shaxs' original execution in Destiny 1

70
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:09,682
was a dystopian drill sergeant,

71
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:12,322
and the team identified several problems with that

72
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:15,243
at the beginning of Taken King's development.

73
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,625
While Shaxs delivered game-critical information,

74
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:21,006
he was an announcer who lacked character.

75
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:25,267
Many of Shaxs' lines focused on repeating player objectives

76
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,128
that were already fairly obvious.

77
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:29,904
Capture and defend, Guardians!

78
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:35,107
Very little dialogue was dedicated to who Shaxx was in Destiny's universe,

79
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:37,508
and he had a limited relationship with the player

80
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:41,109
that sometimes boiled down to berating them for mistakes.

81
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,590
Fight back!

82
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,711
Control the zones!

83
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:48,853
Shaxx cared about players' successes, but not as much as he could,

84
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:51,654
and this was about as pleased as he got.

85
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:55,776
Nice work, Guardians. Your efforts have been noted.

86
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:58,555
I'm about to play another clip for you.

87
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:03,238
This is what the early version of what Shaxs sounded like in D1.

88
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:06,160
Listen carefully to the clip and compare it to the one

89
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,100
that we just heard.

90
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:10,623
Think about how often Shaxs speaks, and it won't be much.

91
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,119
want.

92
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,181
All enemies have been

93
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:19,102
eliminated. Last guardian

94
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:21,802
All enemies have been eliminated. Last guardien

95
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:25,023
All enemies have been eliminated. Last guardien

96
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:30,024
All enemies have been eliminated. Last Guardian, revive your te

97
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:36,737
So for those unfamiliar, that was an example

98
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:39,897
of a pretty intense gameplay sequence in Destiny.

99
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:42,298
Our player was fighting one on three

100
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:45,658
and had to kill the entire opposing team multiple times

101
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:48,459
in order to win without dying themselves.

102
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:51,800
But notice that Shaxx lacked streak announcements.

103
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,580
He lacked general excitement for what was going on,

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,981
audible excitement being a big part of the earlier clip,

105
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,481
which was actually later in Destiny's development cycle.

106
00:07:01,302 --> 00:07:06,484
This golf announcer tone during Destiny 1 made Shaxs unique from other shooter announcers,

107
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:11,766
but as a result, Shaxs did not share the player's excitement during the climax of their gameplay.

108
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,708
We took a new direction during the Taken King expansion by doing a couple of things.

109
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:24,370
On the design side, we added features like streak announcements that built up on each other as the player gained momentum.

110
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,151
We shifted our direction in writing as well.

111
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:29,972
Lenny James, Shaxs' voice actor,

112
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:35,135
is a Shakespearean-trained stage performer with supreme powers of projection.

113
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:41,179
So we gave Shaxs a more vibrant personality with more lines while keeping instances of

114
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:43,841
that dialogue still relatively short.

115
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,563
The end result was something like this in Taken King's Crucible.

116
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:00,674
Triple Town.

117
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:04,295
Their crest belongs to you now.

118
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:07,676
Their glory lies shattered.

119
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,837
You're in the lead.

120
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:14,377
No one shares the glory of that one guy.

121
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:17,858
FIGHT FOREVER, CARDIAC!

122
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:25,553
So as a result of these deliberate writing and design additions,

123
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:28,494
Shaxx took steps to becoming what the team refers to

124
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,535
as the supportive space dad that he is today.

125
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:34,476
I don't think you know how to give up.

126
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:36,097
Good recoveries.

127
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,771
On top of streaks and a more boisterous personality,

128
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:43,052
we had Shaxs actually reference his backstory

129
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:44,553
from Destiny's Grimoire cards.

130
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:46,934
Shaxs' dialogue changed to reflect

131
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:48,975
that he is a decorated war hero

132
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:51,196
who loved his job on the front lines

133
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:54,337
and gave all that up to train new guardians of the city,

134
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:55,338
like the player.

135
00:08:56,558 --> 00:08:59,040
What I wouldn't give to fight again beyond the walls.

136
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,840
I would tear out a Vex heart with my teeth.

137
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,783
I would sear the Cabal with my burning light, challenge the Fallen Kells to personal combat

138
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:08,643
and scatter them.

139
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:09,143
I...

140
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:11,905
I've been watching too many Crucible matches.

141
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:16,419
Now, how much does this lore actually matter to the players?

142
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:18,960
I'd argue on its own, not much.

143
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,461
However, it gives us a background to anchor Shaxs with.

144
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:26,102
And it's something for the character to speak to

145
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:28,263
as a frame of reference to relate

146
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:29,703
to what the player is doing.

147
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,104
This is key as it's what allows us

148
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:33,785
to put the player on a pedestal

149
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:35,885
and make the Crucible all about them.

150
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,526
No matter what Shaxs starts off saying,

151
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,647
he'll always bring it back to our focus,

152
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:41,847
which is the players.

153
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,033
When I take the enemy vault, I look them in the eye,

154
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:50,215
and I tell them, this is mine now.

155
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:52,817
I see you do, too.

156
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:55,319
This new Shaxx worked out pretty well,

157
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:56,880
according to our audience.

158
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:01,875
There are a lot more Reddit threads about him

159
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:02,915
than pictured here.

160
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:05,396
Some players went so far as to claim

161
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,877
they engaged with PvP content in Destiny

162
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,318
simply to spend more time with Shaxx.

163
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:13,980
Two Reddit threads as a result of the team's work

164
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,660
stood out to me over the years.

165
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,941
The first was from a deaf player

166
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:20,923
who was disappointed that there were no captions

167
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:24,504
in the Taken King to capture Shaxx's dialogue for them.

168
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,026
And we finally got the tech to support it in Destiny 2.

169
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,307
This player was not disappointed.

170
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:33,909
Lenny James, Shax's voice actor, is phenomenal,

171
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:36,731
and he can turn a 50-cent line into a dollar.

172
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:38,992
But in this case, for this fan,

173
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,493
and apparently everyone in this thread,

174
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,935
the dialogue triggers and the writing for Shax

175
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:44,155
carried the experience.

176
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:45,756
This will be more important later.

177
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:52,712
The second thread was from a player suffering from multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.

178
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:58,878
He cites playing Destiny as an outlet that helps, and Shaxx Lines in particular as something

179
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,179
to help keep him motivated.

180
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,723
This meant a lot to me personally, because my mom passed away about six months before

181
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:06,665
I got my first job in the industry.

182
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:09,528
But what was my takeaway from all of this?

183
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:13,613
I realized that even without a traditional plot,

184
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,114
the team and I had succeeded in conveying a strong character

185
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:19,795
for Shaxs through his endless enthusiasm

186
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:21,976
for watching the players fight each other.

187
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:25,317
The player's story is at the center of every Shaxs line.

188
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:28,018
A vast majority of Shaxs's speech

189
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,199
is triggered by player actions.

190
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,639
And even when Shaxs is talking about himself,

191
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,520
it's in reference to the player.

192
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,103
As an example, players can choose between three classes in Destiny.

193
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:43,987
Titans are armored super soldiers, and when a Titan player goes on a streak,

194
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:46,089
Shaq says something like this.

195
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:55,476
With ten Titans like you, I could build all seven columns and shake the pillars to their core.

196
00:11:56,497 --> 00:12:01,861
Hunters are Han Solo scoundrel types, and when a Hunter goes on a streak, Shaq sounds like this.

197
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,882
With ten hunters like you, I could make the frontier safe again.

198
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:11,425
And finally, warlocks are mystical scholar warriors.

199
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:14,627
When a warlock goes on a streak, Shaxx reacts like this.

200
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:20,390
With ten warlocks like you, I could turn ideas into weapons.

201
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:26,132
In each of these lines, Shaxx is acknowledging the player's class, a little bit of what that

202
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:30,736
class archetype is like in the fiction of Destiny, in other words, the player fantasy,

203
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:34,078
and is also reacting to what the player just did.

204
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:39,262
The end result is that it feels like Shaxx is watching you, constructing a narrative

205
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:40,343
out of your gameplay.

206
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:44,965
Over time, players feel like they know Shaxx as a character

207
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:46,966
because he seems like he knows them.

208
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:50,086
Plus, the sheer amount of time that Shaxx spends

209
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:53,087
speaking to a player in PvP can be greater

210
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,888
than the time it takes to clear Destiny's campaign missions.

211
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:59,289
So therefore, pursuing storylines in competitive modes

212
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:02,550
where the presence of players alone encourages engagement

213
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,810
can be very valuable.

214
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:10,499
To help support the story of Shaxx as a former frontline fighter turned coach,

215
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:12,580
he has a presence in the tower.

216
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,422
And the tower is Destiny's social hub where all players congregate to manage gear,

217
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:23,244
speak to NPCs to advance quests, and hang out with each other in a non-combat space.

218
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:29,030
Shaxx has a ton of ambient lines in this state where he gives gear and bounties to the player,

219
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,033
but practically none of these lines have anything to do with that gear and those bounties,

220
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:37,918
and instead serve to support the idea that Shaxx is still watching Crucible matches

221
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:43,543
when you're not in the arena. He's always happy to see you and he acknowledges you as a fellow veteran.

222
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:47,987
You're doing good work in the Crucible. The recruits need to see it.

223
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,592
When you've finished your business with him,

224
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:53,033
he's jealous that you get to go out and shoot guns,

225
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:53,913
and he doesn't.

226
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:57,654
I'd be right there with you if these rookies could just

227
00:13:57,694 --> 00:13:59,134
learn to fight by themselves.

228
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:01,315
And as you walk off, you can hear

229
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,236
Shax continuing to train guardians in the Crucible.

230
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:07,336
You can't fight when you're that tense, guardian.

231
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:08,617
What's wrong with you?

232
00:14:09,377 --> 00:14:09,877
Relax.

233
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:11,377
Relax more.

234
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:12,798
I said relax!

235
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:18,045
This serves as an outside context for Shaxs

236
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,306
when he's not announcing Crucible matches.

237
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:22,287
It furthers the smoke and mirrors

238
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,328
that Shaxs is alive when the player doesn't see him.

239
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:27,829
So to recap real quick,

240
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,111
Shaxs' announcer lines built on a character

241
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,172
to serve as a point of reference

242
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:36,333
in order to help tell the player's story in the Crucible.

243
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,434
The Iron Lords, six fronts,

244
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:43,336
the Twilight Gap where Lord Shaxs earned his name.

245
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,741
None fell more guardians than you.

246
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:52,820
We further support this experience by allowing the players to visit Shaxx in the Tower to

247
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,062
continue to build a relationship with him outside of the Crucible.

248
00:14:56,422 --> 00:15:01,805
Both of these things, announcer and ambient dialogue together, encompass the Crucible

249
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,206
narrative experience.

250
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:06,028
Shaxx is a guy who's done what you've done.

251
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:11,791
He concedes that you do it better and he sings your praises, telling you your story to you

252
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,752
as you crush your enemies.

253
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:16,113
He's a window into the Destiny universe,

254
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:18,634
and he offers a way for you to make an impact

255
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,755
on that universe through his reactions.

256
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:22,735
I wanted you to win,

257
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:25,656
and you set the whole bloody world on fire.

258
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:26,877
Good.

259
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:29,458
Shaxs is your personal bard,

260
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:31,798
your advocate, and your hype man.

261
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:34,439
We felt so good about how we executed on Shaxs

262
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,540
that we repeated these narrative techniques

263
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,780
using a different character, the Drifter,

264
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:42,281
in a different mode called Gambit, to equal success.

265
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:47,695
Alright, alright, alright. Let's see what we've got.

266
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:50,436
Fallen on the horizon.

267
00:15:51,257 --> 00:15:57,100
If Shaxs is a supportive coach, the Drifter is a shady uncle who encourages cutthroat behavior.

268
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:02,275
Red Legion, these lowlifes took the tower from you, right?

269
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:03,857
Make them bleed.

270
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,840
The Drifter ships the players around the galaxy

271
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,743
in a sci-fi Winnebago called the Derelict.

272
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:13,767
He drops them into war zones across the solar system

273
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:15,509
where they compete against other teams

274
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,792
to see who can kill the most stuff.

275
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:22,474
and bring back the most stuff, which Drifter will gladly pay them for.

276
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:28,516
The PvP twist is that players can enter into each other's warzones as invaders to kill each other,

277
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:33,258
naturally for more stuff. And it looks and sounds like this.

278
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,223
This is what the Taken feel, revel in this.

279
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:55,224
One down.

280
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:58,410
That's two.

281
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,637
Ten seconds left.

282
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:03,979
You make this look easy.

283
00:17:13,814 --> 00:17:18,055
Drifter is an echo of Destiny 1's newest expansion, Forsaken,

284
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:20,596
which has the player questioning their morals

285
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:22,936
in an Old West-style story.

286
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,417
This necessitated a different dialogue style than Shaxx,

287
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:29,518
even though both characters are announcers.

288
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:33,259
Drifter is a grittier, less idealistic version of Shaxx,

289
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:35,179
but he shares the following qualities.

290
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,240
He never berates the player directly,

291
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,801
and he even encourages you when you lose, just like Shaxx.

292
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,167
Hey, not every hunt's a good hunt.

293
00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:45,668
Doesn't have to be.

294
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:49,229
So count your loot and come see me again, huh?

295
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,151
Drifter has a backstory, just like Shaxx,

296
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:54,091
that informs everything that he says.

297
00:17:54,311 --> 00:17:57,012
He's a person with a history and a reason for existing

298
00:17:57,212 --> 00:17:59,113
and for wanting the player to succeed.

299
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,074
What a haul!

300
00:18:01,854 --> 00:18:04,535
I promise you, I'll do something special

301
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:05,536
with all these moats.

302
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:07,877
Something that'll make you shiver.

303
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:14,993
We've talked before about how Shax's presence in the tower adds to the character's detail

304
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,376
and shows a side of him outside of the Crucible.

305
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:20,319
You can't fight when you're that tense, Guardian.

306
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,601
What's wrong with you?

307
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:22,842
Relax.

308
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:24,364
Relax more.

309
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:25,905
I said relax!

310
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:27,307
I just like that line.

311
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:33,515
We did one better for the Drifter, and we gave him a ship to haul the players around the galaxy in.

312
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:37,779
It allows him to give pep talks to both teams before a Gambit match begins,

313
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:42,262
and we use this to paint a portrait of the kind of person that the Drifter is

314
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,324
across the course of many matches.

315
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:56,814
All right Mavericks, ready to see what you're fighting today?

316
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,501
Fallen on the horizon

317
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:04,464
Six fronts Twilight

318
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,625
Fallen have bad

319
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:13,348
Hit them first. Yeah, I was at twilight. Yeah, my grandma too. Who was it? Shoot some fallen

320
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:26,090
It's time to bang knuckles.

321
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:28,852
The Fallen changed things for us.

322
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:30,614
Made Titans famous.

323
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:33,496
Go pay him back for it.

324
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:35,517
No one hated the Fallen more than Saint-14.

325
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,319
They say he's dead.

326
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,440
I don't buy it.

327
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:44,598
So to recap, though Shaxx and Drifter are vastly different,

328
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,999
both utilize similar narrative techniques

329
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:50,440
in order to tell the player's story in Crucible and in Gambit.

330
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,621
In the Crucible, players train to protect the last city

331
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,323
by fighting other guardians in combat drills.

332
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,684
In Gambit, players are airlifted into war zones

333
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:03,245
across the solar system to engage the enemies of humanity,

334
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:05,686
and the Drifter will pay them for the spoils.

335
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:10,051
So you've heard our thought process in writing for Shanks and the Drifter,

336
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:14,255
and why we think that it works to tell the player's story in competitive modes.

337
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:17,999
If your team is interested in telling the player's story in PvP,

338
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,262
consider these pillars in your writing.

339
00:20:21,683 --> 00:20:25,366
The first pillar is consider a character for your competitive mode,

340
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:28,449
not an announcer and not a disembodied voice.

341
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:33,133
An announcer gives game critical data to the player and leaves it at that.

342
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:34,934
That's functional and it's fine,

343
00:20:35,274 --> 00:20:37,556
but you're missing out on a powerful story channel.

344
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:43,039
A character has a relationship with the player that is grounded in the fiction of your universe.

345
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:48,101
You can convey this relationship in a couple of seconds of dialogue or less if you plan

346
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:48,681
carefully.

347
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:54,843
A character can facilitate both game-critical information like score and objectives while

348
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:56,284
being a real person.

349
00:20:56,744 --> 00:21:00,926
Drifter, for instance, would not update you on score in the same way that Shaxx would.

350
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,742
Writers need to be intimately familiar with the game

351
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:13,804
and its gameplay mechanics in order for this to work.

352
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:16,285
You must write from the player experience

353
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,006
in order to be effective.

354
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,767
Don't use your dialogue here as an opportunity

355
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:23,869
to publish your own unique brand of Sumerian poetry

356
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:26,950
while the player fights for their life against other humans.

357
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,033
You are not publishing on paperback here.

358
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:32,795
You are making metaphors out of game mechanics

359
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:34,217
through snappy dialogue.

360
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:36,018
So understand those mechanics

361
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,321
and understand those timing constraints.

362
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:43,022
Meanwhile, designers need to understand the character that you are both striving for.

363
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:48,767
Designing the triggers for where a character speaks says something about that character.

364
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:51,310
It's just as important as what the character says.

365
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,874
Both roles are absolutely vital in this and the more in sync you are with each other,

366
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:58,096
the more coherent your character will be.

367
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:04,006
The second pillar is know your character and their role in the fiction.

368
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:06,607
Ask yourself, who the hell is this person?

369
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:10,268
Because the better you know them, the stronger your dialogue will be.

370
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:13,329
Know your character's relationship to the player.

371
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:18,731
This way, when you're writing dialogue, a character is speaking and not a game mode.

372
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:25,473
In game writing, there is a natural desire to simply use dialogue to restate what you already see

373
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:29,095
in order to explain something better or to give something more context.

374
00:22:29,635 --> 00:22:31,976
This is especially true in competitive game modes

375
00:22:32,196 --> 00:22:34,857
against other players, where there is more at stake

376
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:36,297
than simply role-playing.

377
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:39,899
You'll be tempted to only give game-critical information

378
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,380
in these modes because dialogue is expensive

379
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,261
and the window to deliver it tends to be small.

380
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:46,201
And that's fine.

381
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:48,482
The player needs to know what's going on.

382
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:53,484
But design and UI should strive to be as clear as possible

383
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:56,045
without dialogue because you are sacrificing

384
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:58,206
a potential story channel every time.

385
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:01,543
Hearing a character acknowledge an exciting play

386
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:04,005
that you just made can be just as important

387
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:06,467
as updating you on score or on an objective

388
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:08,049
because in competitive modes,

389
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:11,091
those exciting plays, those are the story.

390
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:14,054
I could feel that in my bones.

391
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:16,716
Did you hear that?

392
00:23:17,357 --> 00:23:18,938
My soul just shivered.

393
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:20,880
Was that all of them?

394
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:23,061
That was all of them.

395
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:28,504
So here's an example of knowing who Shaxs' character is.

396
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:30,645
This is a picture of my father.

397
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:32,865
I have higher resolution photos, but he

398
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:34,105
didn't want those distributed.

399
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:37,046
When I wrote Taken King's Shaxs, I

400
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:39,906
looked back on who Shaxs was in Vanilla Destiny,

401
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:41,007
and I thought of him.

402
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:42,967
I thought of my father.

403
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,728
He would be deeply disappointed whenever I failed.

404
00:23:45,788 --> 00:23:46,608
And rightly so.

405
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:48,848
Show me a better way to rear a child.

406
00:23:48,908 --> 00:23:49,308
You can't.

407
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:52,591
But destiny isn't about child rearing,

408
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:56,075
so we figured our audience could use some compassion.

409
00:23:56,755 --> 00:23:58,557
In writing Shaxs for The Taken King,

410
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:01,420
I instead thought about the 12-minute window

411
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,224
on some days when my father was pleased by something

412
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:05,744
that I did.

413
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:09,828
And I thought, what if Shaxs was like that, but all the time?

414
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:17,281
I wrote from this perspective on my first batch of Shaq's lines.

415
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:22,045
The result was that it became clearer that Shaq's was someone who had gone through what

416
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:27,190
the player had, respected them for it, while giving advice and acknowledging their successes.

417
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,812
Something like a father figure or a coach.

418
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:32,455
Our audience understood it pretty quickly.

419
00:24:34,218 --> 00:24:37,783
The third pillar is write to your actor through iteration

420
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,266
and allow yourself multiple revisions,

421
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:42,188
if possible, before ship.

422
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:45,533
Don't let anyone tell you that it's just PVP dialogue.

423
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:49,691
Playing the game with the dialogue that you've recorded is vital.

424
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:53,452
Just because it's a competitive game mode without a plot

425
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:56,494
doesn't mean that the dialogue experience can't be improved.

426
00:24:56,894 --> 00:25:00,256
Players will notice the dialogue of Destiny's competitive modes

427
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:03,898
gets a lot more attention today than it did before The Taken King.

428
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:06,721
And make sure to write to your actors.

429
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:10,605
As I mentioned before, the second take on Shaxs

430
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:13,709
took full advantage of Lenny James' projection

431
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:16,352
as a Shakespearean-trained stage actor.

432
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,231
Casting Todd Haberkorn for the role of the drifter

433
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:23,412
also changed that character from what we internally

434
00:25:23,492 --> 00:25:26,053
had pictured as a deep-voiced McCree type

435
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:29,674
into more of a smoky Clint Eastwood who actually goes up

436
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:31,355
in pitch when he gets excited.

437
00:25:32,135 --> 00:25:34,036
So pay attention to your actors.

438
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,917
Watch other stuff that they're in,

439
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:38,297
because they'll change your writing in a good way

440
00:25:38,598 --> 00:25:39,338
if you use them well.

441
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:44,312
The fourth pillar, above all, appeal to the player.

442
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,715
Relate to the player, understand their experience.

443
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,277
Over time, we removed Shaxx lines

444
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:53,040
that were even remotely negative to players when they lost

445
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,041
because certain parts of our audience

446
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:57,884
did not appreciate being kicked while they were down.

447
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,806
On the other side of the spectrum,

448
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:02,148
one of the best ways to appeal to a player

449
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:04,230
is to speak to player actions.

450
00:26:05,351 --> 00:26:08,373
Oh yes, the battle lines have been drawn.

451
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:18,255
Call the Praxic Order, call the Thanatonots, the Jinsin Scribes, call everyone so they can witness you!

452
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,983
Make sure to congratulate the player when they congratulate themselves.

453
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:30,248
You want your streak and climax lines to fire at the same time that the player leaps off of the couch in real life.

454
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:33,330
But you can only find these when your experience is solid.

455
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:38,674
Try to have a good idea of what your climax moments are from the player's perspective as you're writing.

456
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,616
Now here's an example of all of this coming together.

457
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:45,058
I apologize for the audio, it's a raw feed, it's going to pop a little bit.

458
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:56,018
Enemy captured zone A.

459
00:26:57,098 --> 00:26:59,278
FIGHT FOREVER GUARDIAN!

460
00:26:59,298 --> 00:26:59,798
F*** YEAH!

461
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:04,019
Dude, did you just hear that?

462
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:07,300
FIGHT FOREVER GUARDIAN!

463
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,900
You neutralized home's C.

464
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,500
F*** yeah!

465
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:13,461
F*** yeah.

466
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:14,881
Dude.

467
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:16,421
Did you hear that?

468
00:27:17,842 --> 00:27:18,162
Chill.

469
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:20,342
Strong words.

470
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:26,684
And finally, above all, flatter the player.

471
00:27:27,085 --> 00:27:28,306
Put them on a pedestal.

472
00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:31,349
Flattery almost always works if it's genuine.

473
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,716
Oh my, this is, this is beautiful.

474
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:42,922
You continue to be my greatest success, guardian.

475
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:48,339
So in summary, one of the coolest things

476
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,781
about working on video games is getting

477
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:52,462
to make something out of nothing.

478
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:53,923
And we did that with Shaxs.

479
00:27:53,943 --> 00:27:55,944
We created a character that people cared about

480
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:57,886
because he seemed to care about them.

481
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:03,053
Shaxs does not take part in a single in-game Destiny cut

482
00:28:03,073 --> 00:28:03,253
scene.

483
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:06,054
Aside from one small cameo, he's not

484
00:28:06,094 --> 00:28:08,315
in a single campaign mission across the lifespan

485
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,816
of Destiny's first five years.

486
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:12,117
And yet, people like him.

487
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:15,359
It's because Shaxs' plot is the player's action

488
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:16,199
in the Crucible.

489
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,161
It's a story that never ends if your players stay engaged.

490
00:28:20,562 --> 00:28:22,783
Shaxs takes full advantage of video games

491
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,243
as an interactive medium.

492
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:28,564
The success of Shaxx in-game has led to things

493
00:28:28,604 --> 00:28:30,265
like a Todd McFarlane action figure,

494
00:28:30,906 --> 00:28:32,227
t-shirts, internet memes.

495
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:33,988
It's because our artists are awesome,

496
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,489
but Shaxx is pretty cool too.

497
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,511
Again, this is all despite the fact

498
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:39,512
that Shaxx has very little screen time

499
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:41,554
in the linear narrative of Destiny.

500
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:43,535
At the end of the day,

501
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:46,337
Lord Shaxx is just a series of dialogue lines

502
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:49,540
that listen for specific player actions before firing,

503
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,881
and it creates the illusion of a buddy

504
00:28:52,122 --> 00:28:53,302
sitting next to you on the couch

505
00:28:53,683 --> 00:28:56,165
who loses their shit at the same time that you do.

506
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:00,423
For your team, obviously, the flavor of your character

507
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:03,304
will change based on your game and your fiction.

508
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:05,204
But the intent should be the same.

509
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,065
Tell your story as player action.

510
00:29:08,545 --> 00:29:10,466
As we've shown, it can be pretty gratifying.

511
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:13,226
Executed properly, this kind of dialogue,

512
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:15,587
deployed in competitive modes, can

513
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:18,448
be used to connect with your players on a visceral level.

514
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:19,608
I hope you try it.

515
00:29:19,848 --> 00:29:21,229
Your players will thank you for it.

516
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:22,649
That's all.

517
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:23,369
Thank you very much.

518
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:25,310
Thank you.

519
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:30,734
Andrew Weldon, as I mentioned before, is here.

520
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:33,195
He is available to field design questions.

521
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:34,616
We'll be out in the hall after this.

522
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:37,137
If you guys are playing the Allegiance Quest in Destiny

523
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:39,619
right now, where we are asking you to choose your loyalty

524
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,080
between the Drifter and the Vanguard,

525
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,602
the lady who put that together, Mallory Schleife,

526
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:47,364
is right there, and she'll be outside, as well,

527
00:29:47,404 --> 00:29:49,285
to field questions about that if you guys are interested.

528
00:29:49,845 --> 00:29:53,367
Pierre Serret, who worked on Gambit as the primary designer,

529
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:53,868
is right there.

530
00:29:54,608 --> 00:29:55,329
We'll all be outside.

531
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:56,409
We don't have time for questions.

532
00:29:57,391 --> 00:29:58,199
Thank you very much for playing.
