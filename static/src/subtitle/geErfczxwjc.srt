00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:13,452
Hi GDC, thanks for coming out today.

2
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:15,694
We're going to get started on our talk.

3
00:00:16,354 --> 00:00:18,816
This is going to be about the lighting of Ratchet and Clank Ripped Apart.

4
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:23,599
This is a game very near and dear to our hearts, and we're really excited to share just how

5
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:24,319
it all came together.

6
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:32,394
So today we're going to run through a high-level overview of our artistic process and workflows,

7
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:36,155
as well as talking about our biggest challenges and successes on the project.

8
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:40,277
We'll start with a general overview of what lighters are responsible for, and then we'll

9
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:43,418
start talking about the role that lighting played in pre-production and the work that

10
00:00:43,438 --> 00:00:45,219
was done that laid the foundation for the game.

11
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,501
Then we'll dig into the really fun stuff of going through our artistic process and taking

12
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,241
everyone through

13
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:54,068
standing up one of the coolest levels in our game.

14
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:57,670
And then we'll wrap up some insight

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,332
on how we spent the final weeks of the game

16
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:01,653
really diving into the nittiest of nitpicks

17
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:03,274
to polish this product.

18
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:05,676
But before we do any of that,

19
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:07,197
let's do some quick introductions.

20
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:09,398
My name is Brian Mullen.

21
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:11,720
I have been with Insomniac for six and a half years.

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,822
I started way back on the early days of Marvel's Spider-Man

23
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:17,344
as a lighting artist for the project,

24
00:01:17,664 --> 00:01:20,286
and I was moved into a lead lighting artist role

25
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:21,346
for Ratchet & Clank.

26
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:25,895
Prior to working at Insomniac, I worked as a CG artist for TV and film,

27
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:28,856
and I worked for a few years as a professional photographer,

28
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:32,818
all of which laid the groundwork for a really cool job working on video games.

29
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,019
Hi, I'm Anna Roan.

30
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:39,841
I was a lighting intern at Insomniac and got hired after I graduated.

31
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:42,562
I've now been here for over two years,

32
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:46,364
and unfortunately, not all of our incredible lighting team could be here today,

33
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,885
but it's my honor to introduce...

34
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,320
Miki. Miki has also been an insomniac for over two years

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,161
and has done some incredible work on Rift Apart.

36
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:56,882
Also, she's just a delight.

37
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:00,984
And last but not least, we have Oz.

38
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:04,106
Oz's years of work in feature animation

39
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,847
helped round out our little lighting team

40
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:07,087
into something fantastic.

41
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:10,649
Now you may be thinking, what is lighting?

42
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:12,870
That question comes up all the time.

43
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:16,072
You know what it is, but what does it mean?

44
00:02:17,383 --> 00:02:18,885
Well, it's not just adding lights.

45
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:22,147
It's adding fog, weather, color correction,

46
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:24,328
and anything else that makes a picture feel finished

47
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:25,209
at the end of production.

48
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,471
In games, we have to wear a lot of hats,

49
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:32,074
compositor, color artist, sometimes even matte painter.

50
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:35,256
Because of all this, lighting plays a huge role

51
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:36,276
in the final look of the game.

52
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:39,877
As one of the final steps in production,

53
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:42,979
it's our job to add that last bit of life into a piece.

54
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,300
Whether that's in a level or cinematic,

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,201
we work on enhancing what's already there.

56
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:50,823
We make sure our characters are lit in flattering ways,

57
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:52,885
we add depth to an already rich world,

58
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:55,526
and we call attention to the best parts of a product.

59
00:02:58,068 --> 00:02:59,689
Now, a huge responsibility of our job

60
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:01,470
is to determine the mood of a space.

61
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,171
Not only do we need to make sure that the level is playable

62
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:05,372
and visually appealing,

63
00:03:05,472 --> 00:03:07,353
but we need to make sure that it tells a story.

64
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,062
So much of that comes down to atmosphere.

65
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:13,064
Brightness, contrast, fog, color,

66
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:16,067
all of these things make lighting nearly as vital

67
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,628
to storytelling as the dialogue,

68
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:22,231
which is why lighting can take an image from this to this.

69
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:26,675
Here we can see an approximation

70
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:30,558
of what ripped apart looks like before lighting and after.

71
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,059
It might not seem like much,

72
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,201
but all these individual tools I've been mentioning

73
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:38,083
come together to impact every pixel on the screen.

74
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,672
When lighting is done well, it's not something most people will ever notice.

75
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,635
I've always said that you can build the most amazing environments and fill it with the

76
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:51,078
most incredible characters, but if lighting's not strong, everyone's work suffers.

77
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:56,442
Like we said, it's our job to bring an image to the finish line, but let's start at the

78
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:56,782
beginning.

79
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:02,626
We knew going into this project that we were going to have a big task ahead of us.

80
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:07,049
But as anyone who's been through pre-production knows, the only thing we can be certain of

81
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,230
in the early days is that everything is going to change.

82
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,662
So this pre-production phase was focused on the things we knew we could control,

83
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:18,347
identifying our pillars, our areas of concern, and making a game plan.

84
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:20,749
Let's dive into a bit of what that looked like.

85
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,372
I am going to start with a bit of a cheat here.

86
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:27,876
Our biggest hurdle didn't actually happen in pre-production, but it's hard to talk about

87
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:30,879
anybody making a game in the past few years without addressing COVID.

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,080
It's...

89
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:37,586
We had a pretty small team, and it was forming right when COVID had started,

90
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:40,287
and we were all just starting to work from home.

91
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:42,988
And it was a stressful and uncertain time.

92
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:46,149
No one really knew how all this was going to work,

93
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:49,251
and frankly, work wasn't even really anyone's primary concern.

94
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,993
That said, we have an incredible IT team at Insomniac Games

95
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,414
that did amazing work getting us all going really quickly

96
00:04:58,494 --> 00:04:59,835
in our work-from-home transition.

97
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:02,456
And it's hard to figure out how it could have gone any smoother.

98
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:07,605
As for the day-to-day work, we knew that every day wasn't going to be the most productive.

99
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:10,166
Some days were just going to be tough, and that was always going to be okay.

100
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:12,968
We knew the priority is everyone had to take care of themselves,

101
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:16,389
and we needed to keep our focus on that.

102
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:25,213
But I also think I speak for the team when I say that this really colorful, silly, and super fun game was kind of what we needed.

103
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:28,635
It was a nice distraction during a really strange time.

104
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:31,806
Jumping back to our pre-production hurdles,

105
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,108
one of the first big ones that we

106
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,509
knew we were going to deal with was

107
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:38,511
that this was a pretty sizable game,

108
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,393
and we were going to do it with a pretty slim crew.

109
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,595
Small teams can present workload issues,

110
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:47,718
and you have to work through giving people

111
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:49,699
the right combination of folks in place.

112
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:54,753
to make sure that you're playing to everybody's strengths.

113
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,194
It's a challenge I really enjoy,

114
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:59,255
and I really like working with a small team.

115
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:01,416
It gives everybody a little bit of an opportunity

116
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:03,377
to handle different variety of tasks,

117
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:04,838
but it is a challenge,

118
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:06,539
and one that we knew we needed to take serious.

119
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,601
Also, the camaraderie and communication

120
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,022
seems to be great when you have a small team.

121
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:15,866
Hurdle number two was a pretty big one,

122
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:17,769
and it was one that I think anybody working

123
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:21,333
in a launch title window can understand.

124
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:24,898
We weren't really sure how best to push forward on the PS5

125
00:06:24,938 --> 00:06:27,721
because PS5 was still being worked on when we'd started.

126
00:06:30,244 --> 00:06:32,327
So we needed to be wise about how we set

127
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:33,709
our lofty visual goals.

128
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:37,491
We knew we were going to have caps.

129
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:39,092
We knew we were going to be able to push things,

130
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:41,392
but we weren't sure exactly where our new baseline

131
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:41,912
was going to be.

132
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:43,673
We weren't sure what kinds of things

133
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,093
we were going to be able to afford now.

134
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,954
And we knew that we were going to have to establish

135
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:48,734
where our limits were.

136
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:53,375
But honestly, one of the biggest hurdles that we dealt with

137
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:55,796
really early in production was understanding

138
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,556
that we needed to make a clear generational leap in quality

139
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:00,837
over the last Ratchet and Clank game on PS4.

140
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:02,217
And that game was stunning.

141
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:05,839
It was lauded at the time for its amazing visual fidelity,

142
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,821
and there was a real concern that we needed to figure out

143
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,362
exactly how we were going to improve on an already

144
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:13,305
outstanding foundation in a way that shows the promise

145
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:14,225
of next-gen lighting.

146
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,188
So, where did we start?

147
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:22,111
We needed to start identifying exactly which areas

148
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,212
we knew we could improve on.

149
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:26,094
First off, we wanted to make artistic advances

150
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,755
to make the game feel more cinematic.

151
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:29,896
We wanted the player to feel like they were living

152
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:31,938
inside of a movie instead of just playing a game.

153
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:35,573
Second, we wanted to showcase technical improvements

154
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:37,574
in both reflections and indirect lighting

155
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,335
to make the world feel more realistic.

156
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:43,298
And last, we wanted to expand on our post-processing

157
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:45,859
to match that of feature animation levels of polish,

158
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,420
further refining and implementing bloom,

159
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,681
chromatic aberration, color correction,

160
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,302
all that fun post stuff,

161
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:54,564
just really to dial in the polish.

162
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:57,565
And while we had some ambitious goals here,

163
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,046
luckily we weren't starting completely from scratch.

164
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,118
Insomniac was just coming off of the huge success

165
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:07,218
of Marvel's Spider-Man, and with it came a lot of knowledge

166
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,739
about best practices and workflows.

167
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,659
As I mentioned before, we're still learning the limits

168
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,099
of what a PS5 can do,

169
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:16,920
but we know what a PS4 is capable of.

170
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,580
So we started with that,

171
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,440
knowing that we would be able to push things more

172
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,281
as production went on.

173
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:25,361
We started from a foundation of making sure

174
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,962
that we followed a PBR pipeline

175
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:28,302
that had a foundation in lighting

176
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,942
that could be measured in the real world.

177
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:35,433
we would make sure that our contrast ratio of direct and indirect light matched real-world measurements.

178
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:42,783
And a major lesson that we learned on Marvel's Spider-Man was that the act of lighting a space tended to have stronger results when we kept things simple,

179
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,066
which we'll explain more in a bit.

180
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:48,756
So I've been talking about the pipeline.

181
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,417
What specifically does that mean

182
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,759
for the Insomniac lighting team?

183
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,560
We'll get into the details in a moment,

184
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:55,402
but essentially this is our roadmap

185
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:58,385
for clean, simple, predictable lighting practices

186
00:08:58,445 --> 00:08:59,006
for our games.

187
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:02,089
By using these steps, we're able to pace ourselves,

188
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,552
keeping polish for the last steps in the process,

189
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,033
and instead focus on getting

190
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:07,415
the fundamentals right up front.

191
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:13,720
The first place that we always start when we're lighting a level is exposure.

192
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,562
Exposure is really the foundation of everything that we do.

193
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:21,124
It affects everything that we do afterwards, and we need to get it locked down early.

194
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:24,185
Not setting this correctly at the beginning can be tricky,

195
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:26,266
because the impact is not immediately obvious

196
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,228
and can really start to become more obvious as production rolls on.

197
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:34,590
An improper exposure can cause inconsistency in glowing materials and visual effects

198
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,351
and in the intensity of placed light values throughout the game.

199
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:43,307
It can also lead to situations where the player will walk into a really bright area and the camera doesn't adjust,

200
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,668
or we walk into a dark area and it doesn't get brighter.

201
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:51,051
Essentially, we need to treat this step less like an artistic or an aesthetic step,

202
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:55,873
and more like a technical first step that is consistent with values that we've set across the game.

203
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:59,655
What we're aiming for in our first pass of lighting is predictability.

204
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:04,125
Let's take a look at an example of the impact

205
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:06,205
of different exposure settings can make on a scene

206
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:08,286
in a way that isn't entirely obvious to the lighter

207
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:09,106
when they're starting out.

208
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:11,307
We have a really simple hallway here.

209
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:13,548
The results in the right and left,

210
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:15,008
if you're only looking at the lighting,

211
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:16,448
are not really very different,

212
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:18,809
but there is a very noticeable difference

213
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:20,730
in how bright this green cube is getting.

214
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,951
The reason that exposure has such an impact on materials

215
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:25,451
is because essentially we're brightening

216
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,851
and darkening the entire scene,

217
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:29,152
and it's bringing things like emissive materials

218
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:31,293
along with it on the right.

219
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,802
Think of a good comparison or a good example to think of

220
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,083
is like a cell phone screen.

221
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:41,724
If you open your phone up,

222
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:44,366
you have auto brightness turned off.

223
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:47,688
If you open this up in a dark room, a movie theater,

224
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:48,748
everybody's gonna look at you

225
00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:51,470
because you've got this really bright glowing screen

226
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,191
in front of your face.

227
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,212
If you take the same phone outside,

228
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:55,252
it's gonna be really dim.

229
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:58,054
We have to think about those sorts of things

230
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:00,055
when we're trying to set our exposure.

231
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:05,856
Many of the assets that are going to go into our lighting

232
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,697
may not come in for weeks or months,

233
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:09,197
so we are not going to immediately see

234
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:11,178
these sorts of things until later down the road,

235
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:12,798
which is why we need to be predictable

236
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:14,598
in the lighting that we set up.

237
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:17,379
We not only want our lighting to be predictable for us,

238
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:20,820
we want it to be predictable for everybody across the game.

239
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,321
Once we have established our exposure,

240
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,321
we are going to set our key light intensity.

241
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:30,002
Again, this is not a value that is set for aesthetics,

242
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:32,702
but a value that is coordinated with the value of the exposure.

243
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:34,738
Throughout the work on the level,

244
00:11:35,118 --> 00:11:37,880
we like to treat these two settings as locked variables

245
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,402
that the rest of the lighting work is balanced around,

246
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:43,925
whether it be light intensity, fog brightness, god rays,

247
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:44,825
you name it.

248
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:47,127
Everything's impacted by these first two things.

249
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:50,509
This ensures that we're working on the same baseline

250
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,151
for the whole lighting team across the game

251
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:54,692
and making sure we have consistency.

252
00:11:57,557 --> 00:12:00,079
The next big step for us is to get a good ratio

253
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,000
between direct and indirect lighting.

254
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,563
Almost all of Ripped Apart is taking place

255
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,865
in large outdoor areas, and in every level,

256
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:09,347
we're starting with a wide, majestic vista shot.

257
00:12:10,107 --> 00:12:11,689
And of course, these are all alien worlds,

258
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:14,792
so matching earth lighting ratios may not seem necessary,

259
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:17,454
but I felt like after doing a lot of testing early on

260
00:12:17,474 --> 00:12:19,175
where we were just kind of eyeballing things

261
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:21,417
and sort of trying to get in the ballpark,

262
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:22,698
things weren't really clicking.

263
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:27,649
starting from a strong place where lighting matched what our eyes are familiar with

264
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,530
and gave us better results quicker.

265
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:33,413
To get it right, we want to know what the real-world ratio is.

266
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:36,035
And this is a rather simple process if you have the equipment.

267
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:39,957
You'll need a digital SLR camera and a gray calibration card.

268
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:42,879
You set the camera to a fully manual mode

269
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,242
so that it'll override anything the camera's trying to do for you,

270
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:50,825
including shutter speed, f-stop, ISO, all that good stuff.

271
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:55,000
You can refer to a photography guide for best settings to use

272
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,721
for the time of day that you're shooting in.

273
00:12:57,381 --> 00:13:00,723
But essentially, once you've set your F-stop

274
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:02,884
and shutter speed, you don't change it again.

275
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:06,927
So you're gonna go outside with your camera

276
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:10,288
and you're gonna snap a picture of your gray card

277
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,289
in direct sunlight.

278
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,250
And then you're gonna turn away from the sun

279
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,271
and snap another picture.

280
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:16,892
You can also just go into a shadow area

281
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:18,033
like I did in the image here.

282
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,290
And there you go.

283
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,092
Take these pictures into a photo editing software,

284
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,174
desaturate it, and get an RGB reading,

285
00:13:24,214 --> 00:13:26,796
and figure out how many times brighter the sunlit card is

286
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:28,136
than the card in indirect light.

287
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:29,818
And there you have it.

288
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:32,960
You have a direct to indirect lighting contrast ratio.

289
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,302
For a sunny Los Angeles afternoon,

290
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:37,703
we ended up with roughly a three to one ratio here.

291
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:41,626
The next step is to just recreate

292
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,227
this exact process in InGen.

293
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,130
We're looking for the same three to one ratio

294
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,651
in our direct versus indirect.

295
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:51,892
If key light and adaptation are locked, this process should run rather smoothly.

296
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:56,396
If it's not, it might be a good idea to either brighten or darken your sky and rebake until

297
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,917
you reach the expected ratio.

298
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,862
The next steps of the pipeline is actually placing our lights, prefabs, and probes.

299
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:08,159
The big goal for this project was to try to work simple and realistic.

300
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,661
Every light needed to have a motivated light source, and we didn't want to have any phantom

301
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:17,704
lights on ratchet, or manipulate the bounce or strength of our bounce light anyway.

302
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:19,925
We wanted to be simple and PBR.

303
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,288
In this example of Rivet's Hideout, a majority of this room is lit by just a few very large

304
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:25,628
lights.

305
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:30,996
While generally seen as a negative to have overlap of this extent,

306
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:34,558
we found that this actually caused less performance issues to deal with,

307
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:36,760
and it kept our setup simple.

308
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,922
After all, it's easier to dial 3 to 5 lights than 10 to 15.

309
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,164
And aesthetically, we got more realistic bounce light

310
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:46,366
and more natural adaptation in our exposure.

311
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,590
From then on, it's an adjustments game,

312
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:52,791
tweaking and rebaking until you get something

313
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:53,552
that you're happy with.

314
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:56,133
It's important that you rebake continuously.

315
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:58,014
The game is in constant flux

316
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:00,455
and other departments are always adding things to levels

317
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:01,855
and you don't want any surprises

318
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:02,776
midway through production.

319
00:15:05,257 --> 00:15:06,777
So after you get it technically correct

320
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,238
and in the ballpark artistically,

321
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:10,599
it's time for the exciting part, post-process.

322
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:13,257
You don't want to do this step too early,

323
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:15,879
because anything you're doing to add visual flourish now

324
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,241
can actually complicate your initial setup

325
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,203
and lead to technical mistakes later on.

326
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:26,227
But all that being said, the post-process step in production

327
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:28,309
is where a project can really find its voice.

328
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:32,240
In Rift Apart, we were going for a more futuristic, colorful look.

329
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:36,784
We wanted lens flares that would make Star Trek jealous, and a color scheme that would

330
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:39,066
make players excited to see more.

331
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:43,649
That meant adjusting the color correction to saturate the scene and push the contrast

332
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,171
for a more cinematic feel.

333
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:49,975
It also meant adjusting the fog to soften the overall look of the piece to match the

334
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,336
quality of feature animation.

335
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:55,107
We mentioned earlier that lighters are the finishers of an image,

336
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:56,508
and this is exactly what we mean.

337
00:15:57,128 --> 00:16:01,470
These final steps in the process can dramatically change the tone, style,

338
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,051
and feel of a game completely.

339
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,533
And that's why it's so important that everything is done correctly.

340
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:10,856
Trying to polish lighting on work that wasn't built on a solid foundation

341
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:13,097
is an immensely more difficult task,

342
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,258
one that takes substantially more time

343
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:18,300
and is likely to never hit the quality bar that we're looking for.

344
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,481
We have an example of exactly that.

345
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,752
This is a train station in Nefarious City

346
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:27,654
that we've relit using a series of common workarounds

347
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:28,994
and inefficient workflows.

348
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,356
To start out, there's entirely too many lights in here.

349
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,797
It's starting to flatten everything.

350
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:36,617
And because we have so many lights,

351
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,719
I had to start making several of them skip shadow casting

352
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,620
because we were running into performance issues.

353
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,281
Even that didn't help with performance,

354
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:46,162
so I had to start having some of the lights

355
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:47,642
only contribute to bounce light.

356
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:50,133
And then we still had performance problems,

357
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:51,975
so I reduced the fall-off of the lights.

358
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:54,377
But because those lights were falling off so quickly,

359
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:55,978
now I'm getting less bounce light.

360
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:57,779
So then I'm adding more lights

361
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,601
to get more fill into the corners.

362
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:02,963
If this is starting to become our sound

363
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:06,026
a little complicated and messy, it's because it is.

364
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,689
This is a weird foundation to start with.

365
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:12,011
And what we're doing is we're chasing our tails,

366
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,012
trying to get a look that wasn't built

367
00:17:14,412 --> 00:17:15,473
on a strong foundation.

368
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:20,265
So at first glance, you may not be able to see anything

369
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:22,107
truly wrong with this scene.

370
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:24,769
You can see the color tone and the mood we're going for,

371
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,491
and most people wouldn't notice right away

372
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:27,331
some of the issues.

373
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:29,994
But compared against a scene lit using the pipeline

374
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:30,834
that we've talked about,

375
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:33,276
the difference can be pretty stark.

376
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,790
When we light something correctly, it's just obvious.

377
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,610
This is the same train station lit

378
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,351
using the pipeline we've been outlining.

379
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:43,211
This has fewer lights, somewhere around five lights,

380
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,632
I think, are taking up most of the room.

381
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,292
Better performance and easier to adjust for performance.

382
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:53,073
If we needed to, oh, better performance,

383
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,433
but if we need to dial those lights,

384
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:57,834
we can narrow cones on four or five lights a lot quicker.

385
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,515
We have got better player pathing

386
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:01,815
and the material's already better.

387
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:04,015
And bonus, it also just looks prettier.

388
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:05,748
Let's take a look at the details.

389
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,335
The image on the left is missing shadows from this platform.

390
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:12,979
In some ways, it's hard to tell that there's even

391
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:15,242
a platform present because the contrast is missing,

392
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,764
and it's making the image harder to parse.

393
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:22,564
One of the primary reasons we're losing contrast here is that the light above the platform isn't casting any shadows.

394
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:28,447
It's a common technique to move to in the ages-long battle with making sure a game is performant,

395
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:32,208
and in previous generations of hardware, it made a certain amount of sense to do this.

396
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:36,850
In the past, we've all had to cut corners to keep the cost of lighting from impacting playability,

397
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,711
sacrificing visual fidelity for performance.

398
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:44,856
But with the power of the PS5, we were determined to find other ways to get that performance back

399
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:48,598
and not resort to tactics such as removing shadows from lights.

400
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:54,001
We lit scenes with the idea that anything that a light is touching is casting a shadow,

401
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,503
and anything else, and anything less, and we're losing immersion.

402
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,912
The other issue we're running into here is player pathing.

403
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:05,753
The blue of this light is supposed to act as a beacon

404
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,393
and pop so that the player knows

405
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,654
where they're supposed to exit.

406
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,774
The image on the left does have this to some extent,

407
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:13,835
but the colors aren't contrasting enough

408
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:16,195
and the path to get there is less clear.

409
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:18,456
In the image on the right, we have a clearer sense

410
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:19,656
of not just where we need to go,

411
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,917
but we can see the platforms leading me to it.

412
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:27,038
And what about when we focus on our Lombax friend here?

413
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,825
By over-optimizing a setup, we have a character that is not doing the PS5 or the Amazing Character team justice.

414
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:37,528
Ratchet has lost his highlights, he looks extremely evenly lit.

415
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:43,172
When the cinematics begin to roll in, we really want to make sure that the level lighting was done correctly,

416
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:46,234
or the cinematics will become substantially more difficult to handle.

417
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:49,837
The glowing mouth on Ratchet, on the left, is of major importance.

418
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:54,640
As soon as he starts opening his mouth in a cinematic, it's going to look like his mouth is glowing.

419
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,991
And there's not a lot that we can do in lighting to sort of bring that back.

420
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:03,634
We're all trying to figure out how to balance aesthetics and performance,

421
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:07,516
and all too often we find ourselves making tough decisions with the amount of lights,

422
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:09,677
the fall off of lights, et cetera,

423
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:14,239
making sure that a pretty picture isn't creating a game that, frankly, no one can play.

424
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,802
But what we found is following the pipeline that we generally put ourselves in a good position

425
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:23,444
to get a strong foundation of lighting that didn't have to make too many sacrifices.

426
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,705
Our simpler setups were easier to tune for performance.

427
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,646
We didn't need extraneous fill lights

428
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:30,207
because our bounce light was done correctly

429
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:31,008
in the first place.

430
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,109
And if you look at the images above,

431
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,690
the image on the left isn't awful,

432
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,832
but it didn't quite hit the mark for a game

433
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:39,374
that we wanted to show the promise of next gen lighting with.

434
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:42,416
It's missing specular highlights and shadows

435
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:45,818
and our characters and environment are suffering as a result.

436
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,960
But with all that said,

437
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,581
we're still making a video game here

438
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:53,003
and it's impossible not to run into performance problems.

439
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,841
To keep the game running smoothly,

440
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,204
each department is allotted a certain percentage of power

441
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:00,946
that we can use to affect the scene.

442
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:03,588
In lighting's case, that's about eight milliseconds.

443
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,070
Now that's not a hard and fast rule

444
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,572
as different scenarios require different departments

445
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:09,893
to take up more of that budget,

446
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,795
but it's a strong place to start.

447
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:15,698
Taking a look at a differently incorrectly lit scene,

448
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,741
we can see that lighting is actually at 25 milliseconds here.

449
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:21,083
That's three times the size of our budget.

450
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,572
The reason lighting is so high here is because the scene was flooded with smaller, unoptimized lights

451
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:31,435
that were inefficiently placed and covering mistakes that could have been easily fixed with proper care.

452
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:39,220
That's why it's extremely important for us to tackle performance early and often because it affects the entire game.

453
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,408
But of course, even when we do our job correctly,

454
00:21:44,588 --> 00:21:47,528
not everything is as simple as lighting a static room.

455
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:49,629
If everything would have just sat still,

456
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:51,549
our game would have been a heck of a lot easier to light.

457
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:52,750
But it's not.

458
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,850
And a big reason for that is because

459
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,630
we were making a complicated game.

460
00:21:57,331 --> 00:21:58,631
One of the main features of the game

461
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:00,171
is the ability to open a portal

462
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:02,032
and enter a completely different level.

463
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:05,532
That requires both levels to be open at the same time.

464
00:22:05,972 --> 00:22:07,233
And if we aren't lighting efficiently,

465
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,193
that's two inefficiently lit levels at the same time.

466
00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:13,374
We built a game featured around fast loading,

467
00:22:13,735 --> 00:22:16,136
and lighting is one of the most expensive things in the game.

468
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:18,298
That's why it's ultimately so important

469
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,880
that we are responsible for our own work,

470
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,201
and then look for creative solutions afterward.

471
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:25,663
If you'd like to learn more

472
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:27,444
about the incredible port of work in the game,

473
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:30,006
you can check out Peter Kao's GDC talk,

474
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:31,867
Shifts and Rifts Dimensional Tech

475
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:33,989
on Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart.

476
00:22:37,018 --> 00:22:39,279
Here's a specific problem that we run into

477
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,961
with performance a lot,

478
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:43,082
and it doesn't have an immediate answer.

479
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:44,884
We did all the things we just said.

480
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:47,385
We kept our lighting simple, we followed the pipeline.

481
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:50,448
There's only one real driver of light in this scene,

482
00:22:50,508 --> 00:22:52,509
and it's the sun, and we need the sun.

483
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,292
So if we've not gone crazy and placed a lot of lights,

484
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:58,594
why is lighting double our budget?

485
00:22:59,114 --> 00:22:59,694
What happened here?

486
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:01,436
Well, there's a few reasons.

487
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:03,537
First off, the power of the PS5

488
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:05,338
isn't just going to the lighting department.

489
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:09,227
Everything that lights are hitting in this game is getting more expensive to light.

490
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:15,733
Ripped Apart is known for its stunning environments, huge crowds, amazing characters, and active, vibrant scenes.

491
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:18,916
And we love them, but they come at a cost.

492
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:24,520
In this particular scene, what we are seeing is the cost of lighting a complex and dense environment

493
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,923
without a lot in the way of optimization available for us on the lighting team.

494
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:33,208
But we did accomplish our goal here of getting this very lovely shot performant, and let's dig into how.

495
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,813
First off, our core team made incredible looking fur,

496
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:41,295
but fur that somehow didn't tank our frame rate.

497
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,778
For lighting, we skip rendering shadows for the fur shells

498
00:23:44,838 --> 00:23:46,900
and only render the base geo for shadow maps,

499
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,442
which makes the shadow map rendering much cheaper

500
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,364
and unintentionally, but neatly,

501
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:54,066
also adds a sort of subsurface scattering effect

502
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:54,527
to the fur.

503
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:56,669
In the deferred lighting pass,

504
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:59,932
we combine shadow maps with screen space contact shadows

505
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,234
to pick fine shadows from the individual strands.

506
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,130
This is all to say that often when we're lighting,

507
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,511
the most expensive thing that we're dealing with

508
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,631
are the characters, and it wasn't a problem

509
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:11,852
that we ran into very often on Ratchet and Clank.

510
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:14,753
And it's a really lovely game.

511
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:16,593
It's great seeing the characters look this good

512
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:17,593
and not cost a ton.

513
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:21,654
For our second item, it's worth highlighting

514
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:24,675
the gargantuan effort of our core team

515
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,176
in exploring and implementing more and more refinements,

516
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,576
optimizations, and improvements

517
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:31,197
to our ray tracing throughout production.

518
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:34,377
Ray tracing was always going to be a major feature of this game.

519
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:37,339
Clank is, after all, a walking chrome ball,

520
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,680
and you're seeing everything on him at all times.

521
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:44,463
But that it was done this impressively with this minimal of an impact

522
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:46,925
on performance is the reason that this team was able to win

523
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,466
best technology award at this year's Dice Awards,

524
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:52,508
and also a tech award last night at the GDC Awards.

525
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:55,290
A major tip of the cap to this team.

526
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:59,634
And then finally, we can't stress enough the importance

527
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:01,035
of the hard work that the environment

528
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:02,895
and character teams did, not only creating some

529
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,096
of the most stunning environments

530
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:08,177
and characters imaginable, but by putting in the work

531
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,678
to optimize and ensure that LODs were in place.

532
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:13,939
Circling back to this scene,

533
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,959
lighting dropped almost nine milliseconds

534
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,240
in a matter of a couple of weeks.

535
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:20,416
due in large part to the work of people

536
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:22,017
that I mentioned in the previous slides.

537
00:25:22,718 --> 00:25:24,559
I didn't really do anything here.

538
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,380
Lighting dropped nine milliseconds

539
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,222
with minimal input on lighting

540
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:31,583
because lighting is affected by everybody else.

541
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:35,626
We could have reduced shadow quality of our key light

542
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:39,268
to make this work, but performance was really a team effort.

543
00:25:39,428 --> 00:25:41,749
Not all solutions are gonna be immediately apparent

544
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,012
and we don't wanna try to bring out the big guns too early.

545
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:52,188
So by working together, we're able to keep that incredible PS5 quality graphics look

546
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:53,929
and run in frame at the same time.

547
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,592
Okay, so now let's dive into the fun stuff, making the art.

548
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:04,515
Following these rules and more allowed us to start with a good foundation for our lighting.

549
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:08,938
But our next step was taking on what we'd learned and putting it into production

550
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:10,319
and bringing it into our levels.

551
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:12,560
Let's take a look at some of what we had to do.

552
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:14,701
It was a lot.

553
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:19,330
This was a massive linear game with expansive worlds.

554
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:24,813
And on top of that, we had over one hour of cinematics taking place on 13 distinct planets

555
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:26,954
that all needed to have their own unique look,

556
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:31,876
some of them requiring multiple lighting setups for return visits or alternate dimensions.

557
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,917
They each had to express a different mood and story

558
00:26:34,957 --> 00:26:38,799
while still feeling like it lived in the same universe with the same level of polish.

559
00:26:40,983 --> 00:26:44,025
Developing a look can be a daunting process that takes a village.

560
00:26:44,526 --> 00:26:47,268
From initial ideation all the way to the finished project,

561
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:50,511
you're constantly working to hammer out the identity of a space.

562
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:52,652
To explain how this process works,

563
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:56,215
let's take a look at one of the levels that exemplifies not only the process,

564
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,497
but the pivots we had to take during production.

565
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:00,159
This is Blizzard,

566
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:04,062
the level that underwent some of the most narrative and design changes

567
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,183
throughout the game's lifetime.

568
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,368
At the beginning of production,

569
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:11,090
Lizard's narrative concept revolved heavily around

570
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,912
those green crystals placed around the environment.

571
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:16,693
Because of that, they wanted them heavily contrasted

572
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,294
against a red monochromatic look.

573
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:20,915
It also took place underground,

574
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:22,616
meaning that the majority of the light

575
00:27:22,656 --> 00:27:25,078
had to come from the glow of the orange lava underneath.

576
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:28,960
Most of our concept art was based heavily around

577
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,521
mood and theme of a space,

578
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,682
and it's up to us to interpret that mood

579
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:35,103
and make it something usable for practical level lighting.

580
00:27:37,065 --> 00:27:39,967
Early concept art, while helpful in finding a visual tone,

581
00:27:40,387 --> 00:27:42,548
doesn't always take into account player pathing.

582
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:44,590
That's the need to guide a player

583
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,391
throughout a level easily and naturally.

584
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,473
And that's where things can get really tricky.

585
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:53,376
After we tried to match the concept art in the game,

586
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:56,058
we found we were contending with multiple issues here.

587
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:58,199
We wanted the players to be impressed

588
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,301
with the beautiful open vistas of the level,

589
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:02,922
but we also needed them to know where to go.

590
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:08,688
Because of the monochromatic color scheme, it was hard for the player to understand where the points of interest were.

591
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:15,073
And without another source of light, it was difficult to point the player toward that next objective while still looking natural.

592
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:21,979
Through exploration, we quickly determined that we needed to add another color to break up the monotony of the lava.

593
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,862
We needed another source of light, but in an underground space, that can be really hard to come by.

594
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,082
So after talking to narrative and environment,

595
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,824
we determined that changing the location of the space

596
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,985
was necessary to get the look we wanted.

597
00:28:37,587 --> 00:28:39,388
So we talked to our AD and concept team

598
00:28:39,448 --> 00:28:41,129
about possible artistic avenues.

599
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:42,970
We went back and forth,

600
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,231
trying and experimenting with color and theme.

601
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:48,393
And eventually it was decided to knock out that back wall

602
00:28:48,713 --> 00:28:50,795
and get the key light and the sky contribution

603
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,616
into the space to contrast nicely against all that orange.

604
00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:58,743
After they decided on this general concept look, it was our turn to bring it into the game.

605
00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:05,107
Like we said before, interpreting concept art can be really tricky.

606
00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:08,669
Even though we had solved some of those issues with color scheme,

607
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:11,510
we were still having those same player pathing issues.

608
00:29:12,071 --> 00:29:15,273
The overall complexity of the environment and just the size of the space

609
00:29:15,313 --> 00:29:17,694
led to the player getting easily lost and frustrated.

610
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:26,087
Above, or to the side, are two examples of Brines and I's interpretations.

611
00:29:26,707 --> 00:29:31,390
On first glance, they seem really similar. After all, we were following the same concept art,

612
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:36,134
we were trying to address the same issues with player pathing, readability, and mood.

613
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:40,537
But this was one of the first times in productions where we had differing opinions on how to achieve it.

614
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:48,382
Like we said, we talked a lot on this project, from favorite types of pizza to level direction.

615
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,817
We were constantly in communication.

616
00:29:51,437 --> 00:29:53,099
We talked back and forth with each other

617
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:55,181
about how we should tackle this issue and more.

618
00:29:55,581 --> 00:29:57,643
And there's countless Slack messages between us

619
00:29:57,683 --> 00:29:59,765
discussing every problem and every solution.

620
00:30:00,986 --> 00:30:02,748
We can't really stress how important this was,

621
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,050
both because we made a majority of this game from home

622
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:08,193
and because it made our work stronger when we worked together.

623
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,981
So this was my first time leading a team,

624
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:16,022
and I knew going in that I wanted to extend

625
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:17,963
the same level of trust that I'd always had

626
00:30:18,103 --> 00:30:20,424
with our awesome art director, Grant Hollis.

627
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:22,685
Approaching feedback to this team

628
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:24,186
was always a little bit less of a,

629
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:25,967
this is how I need you to fix this,

630
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:30,029
and a little bit more of us identifying issues

631
00:30:30,209 --> 00:30:32,730
and starting a conversation about how best to resolve.

632
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:39,660
In this example of Blizzard, it was very clear that we all understood what the problems were,

633
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:45,403
and we're trying to solve it with lighting, and we know what the issues are.

634
00:30:46,164 --> 00:30:50,246
This is a perfect example and a great opportunity to let someone on the team follow through

635
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,687
on the vision that they wanted to do.

636
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:56,867
And it made all the difference, not just because this space turned out tremendous,

637
00:30:56,967 --> 00:31:00,908
utilizing our fog to create a strong sense of foreground, middle ground, background,

638
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:06,090
and adding visible fixtures to add lighting that contrasted against the organic environment,

639
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,532
but also because trust had been established and it carried through the rest of the project.

640
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:13,973
We both talked later on after the game had launched about how cool this moment was on the project

641
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:15,534
and how much it helped us grow as a team.

642
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,051
Sorry about that.

643
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:24,872
With FLEAZAR really starting to take shape

644
00:31:24,912 --> 00:31:27,093
at a broad strokes level, it was time to start digging

645
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:29,274
into making each area within the level

646
00:31:29,314 --> 00:31:30,734
feel distinct and exciting.

647
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:33,376
The different districts, the Honeycomb Mission,

648
00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:35,757
the Underground Lava Cave, the Grand Vista,

649
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:39,018
they all work together to create a cohesive vision,

650
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,219
but one with enough variety in the color palette

651
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,380
and contrast that individual spaces

652
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,521
were able to stand on their own.

653
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:49,400
And that leads us to one of the more exciting and challenging

654
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,701
opportunities on this project, figuring out

655
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:53,961
how to compare and contrast not just the levels

656
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:57,923
with each other, but with levels that have multiple dimensions.

657
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:00,484
Ratchet & Clank is all about two things,

658
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:03,685
blowing stuff up with crazy weapons and insane levels

659
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,385
that encourage the player to explore.

660
00:32:06,246 --> 00:32:07,786
Each new world you go to is a chance

661
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:09,167
to see something spectacular.

662
00:32:09,187 --> 00:32:11,827
And that meant after establishing one planet,

663
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:14,088
we needed to make sure that it felt entirely different

664
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:14,648
from the rest.

665
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:18,107
Each level had to have its own unique color scheme and identity.

666
00:32:18,428 --> 00:32:23,031
In cases like Blizzard, we even had to compare some levels against their own interdimensional counterpart.

667
00:32:24,032 --> 00:32:29,096
Doing these constant checks helped us make sure that each space felt like an entirely new alien world,

668
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:32,579
as well as making sure that our lighting felt consistent throughout the game.

669
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,944
Something really special about Rift Apart was how much time we had to accomplish real polish on this project.

670
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:43,319
As many of you know, that doesn't always happen in production.

671
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,781
Whether that's a AAA game or a midterm,

672
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:47,802
you're often running right up to the wire.

673
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,464
But because of our faithfulness to the pipeline,

674
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:52,225
our constant checking of the game,

675
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,086
and the dedication of the team,

676
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:55,727
we had a little bit of extra time

677
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,008
to make things as good as we could.

678
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:00,270
That meant we were able to go back to each balanced area

679
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,072
and really dial in and explore what we wanted to do.

680
00:33:03,913 --> 00:33:06,394
It was through careful planning and many slack threads

681
00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:10,076
that we were able to take something from good to great.

682
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:17,946
When you're deep in production, it's easy to get overwhelmed with design, player pathing, and technical work.

683
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:22,430
It's so much to keep track of that it all makes art take a back seat in your brain.

684
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:28,036
While the previous image was... it was fine. It wasn't where we wanted it artistically.

685
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:34,803
With this added time, we were able to dial in on exactly what our key areas of focus were and put in the work to fix them.

686
00:33:36,036 --> 00:33:38,418
Sometimes that meant doing more post-process work,

687
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,980
tweaking the color schemes of specific areas

688
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,200
to make them feel more unique.

689
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,482
Other times it was fog adjustments

690
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,363
to really dial in the mood of an area.

691
00:33:47,204 --> 00:33:48,225
In this specific spot,

692
00:33:48,665 --> 00:33:50,726
we needed to make a more cohesive color scheme,

693
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:52,828
which involved changing the emissive signs

694
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:54,209
and the light they gave off

695
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:56,170
for a more focused, polished look.

696
00:33:59,294 --> 00:34:02,216
Later in production, many of our biggest cinematics started coming in,

697
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:06,859
and it became a huge undertaking that needed a lot of quick turnaround and fantastic results.

698
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:10,081
It was at this point I decided I was going to have Oz and Miki,

699
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:12,463
two incredibly skilled cinematic lighters,

700
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:16,325
begin focusing on taking these major parts of the project to final.

701
00:34:16,926 --> 00:34:20,588
They took on the significant role of not only lighting these cinematics,

702
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:24,971
but like we kind of mentioned before, functioning almost as quality control for the final image.

703
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:28,880
This meant tackling a lot of things that aren't really associated with lighting,

704
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,862
like making material adjustments, making fur that looked wet when it was raining,

705
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:37,566
animating the fur to blow around if the characters were up high or in a storm,

706
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:43,650
and always, always, always making sure that our two Lombaxes had great eye spec.

707
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:50,294
Meanwhile, Brian and myself turned our attention to wrapping up our level work.

708
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:55,238
We would regularly play the game, creating extremely long pages of notes for us to address,

709
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:57,940
as well as items of feedback for other teams.

710
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:02,764
Then we'd split that work up, knock everything out we could, and do it all over again.

711
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:07,548
We did this repeatedly for the final month or so of production, and I think I can speak

712
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:11,331
for Brian when I say that not only was this some of the most fulfilling polish work I've

713
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:13,533
ever done on a project, but it was some of the most fun.

714
00:35:16,689 --> 00:35:22,112
Nowhere is there a better example of collaboration really bringing a space to the finish line than Nefarious City.

715
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:26,694
One of the first levels that the player sees in the game, and a level we just needed to knock out of the park.

716
00:35:27,574 --> 00:35:32,636
This was one of the biggest challenges in the game because it had to feel moody and atmospheric, but also full of life.

717
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:38,699
That's a lot of hats to wear for a level, not to mention that the player needed to be able to navigate through all of this visual noise.

718
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:44,502
One of the unique things about this project was the amount of collaboration that was done.

719
00:35:44,887 --> 00:35:49,071
We spent months passing this level back and forth between us, building on each other's strengths,

720
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:52,874
getting ideas from one another, and lending a hand too many times to count.

721
00:35:53,555 --> 00:35:58,159
Closing in on the end of production, I handed this level off fully to Anna to bring home,

722
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,760
and she absolutely nailed this space.

723
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:04,124
It went from looking like a great level to just an absolutely incredible environment.

724
00:36:06,974 --> 00:36:10,137
Nefarious City is one of the things I'm most proudest of in the game,

725
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:12,280
not just because it's a great level,

726
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,884
but because of the challenge and collaboration it took to get there.

727
00:36:16,785 --> 00:36:18,347
I started this project as an intern,

728
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:21,210
and after I finished college, I was given the opportunity

729
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,412
to come back and finish what I had started.

730
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:28,912
I learned more about lighting, teamwork, and the struggles of game development on this

731
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:32,455
game in this very level than I ever had in a classroom.

732
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:37,199
To me, Rift Apart isn't just a great game, but it's a sign of the personal and professional

733
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,021
growth it took for me to get right here on the stage today.

734
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:42,924
And it's something I couldn't be more happy to share with you.

735
00:36:46,902 --> 00:36:49,324
So in the end, through a lot of communication and hard work,

736
00:36:49,344 --> 00:36:51,605
we were able to make something memorable together

737
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:53,245
in challenging circumstances.

738
00:36:53,746 --> 00:36:55,447
It took incredible buy-in from everyone

739
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:57,928
to accept a task like this and to collaborate like we did.

740
00:36:58,807 --> 00:37:01,448
This is, for me, the most pride I've had in a project

741
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:02,508
that I've worked on.

742
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:05,569
And it's because of how well everyone executed

743
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:06,290
across the board.

744
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,850
Environment, character, animation, VFX,

745
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,111
core design, gameplay, it all comes together

746
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,232
in something like this.

747
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:15,672
I think I speak for the both of us

748
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:17,233
and the entire Rift Apart crew

749
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:19,213
when I say that this was a career highlight

750
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,654
and we hope that everyone has enjoyed experiencing it

751
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:23,135
as much as we enjoyed making it.

752
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:29,739
So with that, thank you for coming out today, and we will open this up for Q&A.

753
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:53,191
Hello, wonderful talk, guys. Really informative. Really

754
00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:56,475
appreciate it. I'm kind of curious about you're talking

755
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:58,618
about lighting and the materials. How closely did you

756
00:37:58,638 --> 00:38:01,121
have to work with the artists on the team to get better

757
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:03,945
reflections? Or is it just like, thankfully, everything worked

758
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:05,306
out like the PBR pipeline?

759
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:09,359
Sure, yeah, that comes up all the time.

760
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,541
We have to work really close together

761
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:13,402
because as we said, this is a team effort.

762
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:16,325
So oftentimes we'll go in and light a scene

763
00:38:16,365 --> 00:38:18,266
and if we see something isn't responding

764
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:20,308
the way we'd expect when we're working with the pipeline,

765
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:23,150
we start investigating into the specular,

766
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,332
the gloss, the roughness, all of those material channels.

767
00:38:26,493 --> 00:38:28,414
And if we notice something seems strange,

768
00:38:28,714 --> 00:38:30,396
we'll reach out and talk to them about it

769
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:30,996
if there's an issue.

770
00:38:32,037 --> 00:38:32,938
Yeah, great question.

771
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:33,278
Thank you.

772
00:38:38,454 --> 00:38:40,496
First of all, thanks for that fantastic talk.

773
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,179
I thought this is truly generation-defining work,

774
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:44,220
and it is amazing.

775
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,363
So hats off, that's like once again.

776
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:50,127
The question I have is pipeline-related,

777
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:54,712
but with respect to getting parity between SDR and HDR.

778
00:38:55,472 --> 00:39:01,714
A lot of times, as we are in our phase of development, what we are seeing is that there

779
00:39:01,794 --> 00:39:07,975
is a push for HDR from manufacturers, but there isn't a lot of HDR devices out there.

780
00:39:08,595 --> 00:39:15,997
There's a large chunk of SDR devices, but if you focus on getting the content across

781
00:39:16,117 --> 00:39:20,138
following the SDR pipeline and then later magically try to switch it to HDR, there can

782
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:23,679
be all kinds of hell that can break loose with values and things like that.

783
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:27,481
So did you guys run into issues with respect to, you know,

784
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:32,224
getting your HDR pipeline figured out and getting SDR at the same time to

785
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:35,146
kind of get some sort of parity and, you know, just be,

786
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:38,027
it wouldn't be just like flat, flat out washed out or anything like that.

787
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:45,620
So yeah, I don't want to get too much into the technical stuff because I'm afraid I'll put my foot in my mouth with what Core does.

788
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,381
But they do incredible work getting our work from SDR to HDR.

789
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:56,042
For us, the way that we do it, we're all working on HDR monitors.

790
00:39:56,962 --> 00:40:03,724
But we have, at least for myself, I have an HDR TV that I'm launching the game on regularly, playing it.

791
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:08,327
Where we normally see most of the differences is in the really bright spots.

792
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,589
We have more room now in that top end.

793
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,772
So it's really just about validating your work regularly.

794
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:17,815
I mean, a big initiative in our studio is constantly playing the game,

795
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,937
and it's important for us when we were looking at that HDR.

796
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:26,268
quality to make sure that we're not losing details or that things aren't looking washed out.

797
00:40:27,249 --> 00:40:32,893
It was something that came up a lot on Spider-Man. So we kind of had hammered out sort of the

798
00:40:33,573 --> 00:40:38,777
issues of how all that worked going into this game already. Thank you. Sure.

799
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:56,548
Hello. I again really impressed with the talk. I love it when you break things down into half sort of the creativity of how beautiful the colors can be. And the other half is the engineering. And then there's a third element of guidance.

800
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:03,390
For people that don't have access to the top shelf talent.

801
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:11,936
How do we study lighting in a way with the amount of work

802
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:14,719
that's out there on say DeviantArt or Pinterest

803
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,962
for inspiration and then learning about

804
00:41:18,062 --> 00:41:20,064
how to tweak it in game?

805
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:23,547
Where's that fine tuning and where's that sort of

806
00:41:24,588 --> 00:41:29,373
autodidactic self-training, if at all possible?

807
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:32,180
That's a great question.

808
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:35,323
Yeah, so there's a planet.

809
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:36,964
You can get inspiration from anywhere, right?

810
00:41:37,004 --> 00:41:38,825
You can go on Pinterest, just like you said,

811
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:40,367
and just getting into the system,

812
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:42,388
whatever you're using and kind of going crazy

813
00:41:42,468 --> 00:41:43,970
is a fun place to start.

814
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,872
Working together as a team is always wonderful

815
00:41:46,892 --> 00:41:49,094
to bounce off ideas of each other, just like we mentioned.

816
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,757
But yeah, one of the best things that I've kind of done

817
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:55,379
to really get a feel for lighting

818
00:41:55,419 --> 00:41:56,980
is actually going out there with a real camera

819
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:59,242
and just messing around with studio lights

820
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:03,566
having a fun shoot day with your friends and your team and just trying different

821
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:05,387
things and exploring different lightings,

822
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:09,171
just to get a real feel of what it looks like when you're, you're really in there.

823
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:11,453
It helps a lot, at least for me. Do you have any?

824
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:15,336
Yeah. I mean, for me, I think when I was starting out,

825
00:42:15,396 --> 00:42:17,238
I would look at pretty pictures and I would go,

826
00:42:17,278 --> 00:42:18,278
I'm going to try to make that look.

827
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:23,106
exactly like this and I think that's how a lot of people start. I think

828
00:42:24,247 --> 00:42:30,533
Spider-Man's where I learned a lot about trying to slow down and like try to do things realistically

829
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:34,877
with lighting that I could measure in the real world because the problem I was finding a lot is

830
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:38,260
I would light like a dining room and it looked super cool and then I'd walk to the other corner

831
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,042
of the dining room and I'd look back and it didn't look...

832
00:42:40,473 --> 00:42:41,254
super cool at all.

833
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:45,117
So it was about trying to make sure that I do it right,

834
00:42:46,258 --> 00:42:48,800
get everything sort of set up, make it boring essentially,

835
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,622
and then start trying to look at that stuff

836
00:42:51,642 --> 00:42:53,624
like from Pinterest or Google or whatever

837
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:55,185
and start going, okay, so how can I start

838
00:42:55,225 --> 00:42:57,126
like nudging this closer to that

839
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:59,488
instead of starting with trying to dive right

840
00:42:59,528 --> 00:43:00,389
into making it pretty?

841
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:05,193
So then second part, is there a point

842
00:43:05,253 --> 00:43:06,614
in studying cinematic lighting?

843
00:43:08,407 --> 00:43:10,928
Yeah, I love cinematography.

844
00:43:10,948 --> 00:43:13,329
I've got tons of books sitting behind me

845
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:15,089
in my Zoom calls all the time

846
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:16,370
because I like looking at that stuff.

847
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,771
For me, a lot of it is inspiration.

848
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:23,233
We use some of the practices that we have.

849
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:24,253
We're a little bit, you know,

850
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,614
we're doing things in real time

851
00:43:25,634 --> 00:43:27,254
so we can't do all of the things that they do.

852
00:43:28,415 --> 00:43:30,556
But yeah, it's definitely a huge help for me.

853
00:43:30,656 --> 00:43:33,737
I like seeing how they use color to help with mood

854
00:43:33,817 --> 00:43:36,098
and to support narrative and that kind of way.

855
00:43:36,868 --> 00:43:37,829
Yeah, absolutely.

856
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:38,970
Yeah, we did that all the time.

857
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:41,631
We didn't often do that as much for Ratchet.

858
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:44,473
I mean, we had a lot of things we wanted to pull from,

859
00:43:45,093 --> 00:43:48,335
sort of inspirationally, not so much direct artistically,

860
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:51,457
but all the time when I was creating skies

861
00:43:51,477 --> 00:43:53,558
or trying to set up a general idea of what I wanted,

862
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:56,500
we'd look up, you know, Star Trek and Star Wars

863
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,220
and all the cool space stuff out there

864
00:43:58,321 --> 00:44:00,602
and we'd wanna make it as cool as we can, you know,

865
00:44:00,782 --> 00:44:03,323
just try and get anything we could to do, yeah.

866
00:44:03,884 --> 00:44:05,044
Fantastic, thanks a lot.

867
00:44:05,324 --> 00:44:05,605
Thank you.

868
00:44:10,828 --> 00:44:17,054
Hi, so I was wondering, so for something like an effects that causes a large amount of light,

869
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:22,158
like a large explosion, would that be more of your guys' department to kind of work on

870
00:44:22,198 --> 00:44:25,962
that light and how it interacts with the world or would it be more of the effects artists

871
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:28,824
or be kind of like a combination collaboration between the two of you?

872
00:44:30,862 --> 00:44:31,482
Great question.

873
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:32,763
It's both.

874
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:34,804
I can't see it.

875
00:44:34,984 --> 00:44:38,046
Yeah, it's a weird domain because obviously, you know, they want to do their effects.

876
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:41,409
They want to make the most incredible, amazing explosions, which they did.

877
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:44,271
And then they have to give off a certain amount of light.

878
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:49,194
So oftentimes what kind of came out was either a collaboration or we, you know, just talk

879
00:44:49,214 --> 00:44:54,257
for advice or, you know, if we saw something that didn't quite match up for what we expected,

880
00:44:54,297 --> 00:44:56,759
we talk about it, see why, and come up with a compromise.

881
00:44:57,339 --> 00:44:59,901
Yeah, it's all just about collaboration, but great question.

882
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:00,922
Thank you.

883
00:45:00,942 --> 00:45:01,463
Of course.

884
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:05,245
Morning.

885
00:45:06,466 --> 00:45:07,386
Kind of a similar question.

886
00:45:07,426 --> 00:45:14,230
I was curious about the interplay between the design team and maybe when they're doing

887
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,171
white box or anything.

888
00:45:15,411 --> 00:45:18,713
Do they do lighting that they hand off to you and like this is gameplay critical lighting?

889
00:45:18,753 --> 00:45:19,813
How does that work at Insomniac?

890
00:45:21,641 --> 00:45:22,862
I think it kind of depends.

891
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:25,885
It depends on the designer and the lighting artist,

892
00:45:25,945 --> 00:45:30,008
but I think what I've seen is when we've moved to work

893
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:32,210
from home is that it seems like in a lot of ways

894
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,611
our communication's gotten stronger.

895
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:37,495
So I know just early gray box stuff now,

896
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:39,817
I'm already talking to designers about what they want to do.

897
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:43,119
And if they want to place lights, that kind of works for me.

898
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:50,765
Generally, what my focus has been is starting with an atmosphere that kind of sets the tone and mood of what they're going for,

899
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:53,567
so it can kind of help them sell the story that they're trying to tell.

900
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:56,689
And then we'll talk about where to place lights.

901
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:01,112
If I can do it, great. If they want to do their pass first, that's also great.

902
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:07,237
We also have a system where people can add annotations, so there's like little notes in the level, so I can see.

903
00:46:07,937 --> 00:46:12,260
We have a cinematic that will play here, so maybe I want to craft some lighting around that.

904
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,884
Or I need them to go push this big red button over here, so I'll kind of try to help guide them in that direction.

905
00:46:19,104 --> 00:46:28,670
But I don't want to speak for everybody, but I feel like I'm pretty flexible when it comes to how designers want to work with things.

906
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,111
It's just important for us to make sure we're talking a bunch.

907
00:46:32,472 --> 00:46:32,692
Thank you.

908
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,775
Great talk, thank you all.

909
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:40,515
So I was just kind of curious,

910
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:42,616
as lighting artists in the next generation,

911
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,496
do you see any sort of emerging trends

912
00:46:44,576 --> 00:46:45,757
in lighting that's coming up?

913
00:46:45,857 --> 00:46:48,057
Dynamic shift more so than static

914
00:46:48,117 --> 00:46:49,418
and light mapping and things like that?

915
00:46:52,338 --> 00:46:54,019
I don't know about exact trends,

916
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:56,659
but I can tell it's becoming more important,

917
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:57,720
I guess, to the process.

918
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,080
Maybe that's the wrong way to put it,

919
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,560
but before, lighting was something

920
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,661
that had to be done to put in.

921
00:47:04,207 --> 00:47:06,728
we didn't have the tech to make it something incredible.

922
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:09,430
And now, with things becoming a little bit better,

923
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,251
we can really focus in on its own unique thing

924
00:47:13,312 --> 00:47:15,212
and make something really incredible with what we have.

925
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:17,313
So I've seen a lot of a big trend

926
00:47:17,373 --> 00:47:18,834
and people just paying more attention

927
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:21,655
and trying to get the best details out of what we have.

928
00:47:22,156 --> 00:47:23,896
But as for specifics, do you have any?

929
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:32,542
Yeah, I just, I think the big thing is trying to move more and more towards dynamic shifting things so that we're not baking quite as much.

930
00:47:32,702 --> 00:47:39,464
It's going to take a while to get there, I think, but we're already seeing some really cool stuff across like with the Blumen.

931
00:47:40,705 --> 00:47:43,266
And I think it'll just keep getting more and more refined.

932
00:47:43,926 --> 00:47:48,908
But yeah, like Anna said, I think that lighting plays a pretty big role in selling sort of the visual.

933
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:56,166
component of next gen. And yeah, I just, I don't know, it's exciting. I like, I like doing this.

934
00:47:57,488 --> 00:47:58,689
Thank y'all. Yeah. Thank you.

935
00:48:03,935 --> 00:48:07,920
That was a great talk. My question is, as a lighting artist,

936
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,543
beside deadlines, how you decide when to stop?

937
00:48:11,828 --> 00:48:13,589
That's a really good question.

938
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:18,093
Because some things can always be better, right?

939
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:21,336
Like, does the art director give you a green light,

940
00:48:21,676 --> 00:48:24,619
this is right or wrong?

941
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:26,861
So the art director, did they give us green light,

942
00:48:26,881 --> 00:48:27,582
is what you're asking?

943
00:48:29,642 --> 00:48:36,704
Yeah, so what we do is we'll get our concept, our initial sort of, this is what we're going for.

944
00:48:37,544 --> 00:48:42,265
We'll start lighting the scene based on that. We'll have meetings with our director.

945
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:50,207
The way that Grant Hollis likes to work is he likes to see what we're doing and start doing sort of paint overs of where he thinks this thing could go for final.

946
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:54,450
And we just sort of do that back and forth throughout the process.

947
00:48:55,090 --> 00:49:00,813
As far as when we know when to stop, the game has to ship at some point, I guess.

948
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:06,116
I mean, like Anna pointed out in one of the slides, we had all these notes, and it was great,

949
00:49:06,136 --> 00:49:11,479
because we had kind of hit a point in the project where we actually had time near the end,

950
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,380
and it was sort of like...

951
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,322
okay, we don't have to stop. We can actually just keep going with this thing. And Anna was awesome

952
00:49:18,342 --> 00:49:23,404
because she just kept playing the game and writing down all these things. And yeah, I mean, we kind

953
00:49:23,444 --> 00:49:28,686
of worked up to the wire. I remember the day we went gold, too. We were just working right up to

954
00:49:29,026 --> 00:49:34,468
the time where they were like, okay, you got to stop now. Yeah, it was awesome. Okay. Thank you.

955
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:34,848
Okay.

956
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:44,997
Well, if there aren't any more questions, we can go ahead and wrap this up.

957
00:49:45,177 --> 00:49:48,300
I think we're going to be hanging out at the wrap-up room.

958
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:50,061
I think it's across the way.

959
00:49:50,622 --> 00:49:52,704
So if anybody wants to stop by and say hi, that'd be cool.

960
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:55,286
But yeah, again, thank you for coming out today.
