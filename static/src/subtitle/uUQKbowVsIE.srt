1
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:06,859
I've got a couple of announcements before I go.

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:07,719
You've heard these all week.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,721
Please silence your cell phones.

4
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:11,683
Also, I'm going to throw one in there.

5
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:14,466
If you've got an iPad, don't just hold it up taking

6
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:15,307
pictures of the slides.

7
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:16,067
Really distracting.

8
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:20,478
For evaluations, you guys will receive an email

9
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:21,939
after the session.

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,640
Please fill those out.

11
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:24,841
I'll read them, GDC will read them.

12
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:25,702
They really help us out.

13
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:28,564
On top of that, after this, and I'll say this at the end,

14
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:30,685
I'll be in the wrap-up room to answer any questions.

15
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:32,386
I'm probably gonna be really tight on time,

16
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:33,767
so I won't be up here answering questions.

17
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:36,829
Other than that, I hope you guys enjoy.

18
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:38,330
Thanks for showing out on a Friday morning.

19
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:43,782
I'm Richard Carillo, I'm a game director at Ubisoft Toronto, and welcome to Interviewing

20
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:44,462
for Game Design.

21
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:48,727
My goal in doing this talk wasn't to stand here and say, hey, I'm an amazing interviewer,

22
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:51,850
you guys should do what I do, although if you feel that way at the end, that's totally

23
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,111
fine.

24
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:58,338
My goal was to solve a problem that I noticed at my studio and I expect may exist at many

25
00:00:58,398 --> 00:00:58,558
others.

26
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:04,934
So I've been at Ubisoft Toronto for over five years interviewing candidates as we grew from 150 to over 500 people.

27
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:11,180
And in that time I've interviewed candidates that are in no way game designers, all the way to people who are industry experts.

28
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:17,186
And five years later I still go into interviews and end up talking to candidates that are not game designers.

29
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:23,652
But the problem was that other interviewers in our studio, other game directors, other senior designers, had given them a thumbs up.

30
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:27,693
And instantly I thought, okay, how do we solve this?

31
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,794
What questions are you asking that lead you

32
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:30,875
to such a positive assessment?

33
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:32,196
What questions am I asking that lead me

34
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:34,237
to such a negative assessment, and how can we resolve that?

35
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,759
So this is more of an interview post-mortem

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,100
as I deep dive into the processes we've gone through

37
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,082
at our studio, and I hope that other studios can use this

38
00:01:42,122 --> 00:01:43,443
to better their own hiring practices,

39
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,625
and even candidates can use this to understand

40
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:47,446
what's gonna happen in the interview process,

41
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:49,347
and also what to expect from the job.

42
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,200
So when I noticed this problem, my first instinct, of course,

43
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,682
was to talk to the other interviewers,

44
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:57,083
figure out what questions they're asking,

45
00:01:57,103 --> 00:01:58,585
figure out what answers they're expecting,

46
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,168
and then also to kind of watch them interview

47
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:02,750
and see what's going on.

48
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,932
And I noticed a lot of the standard go-tos

49
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:05,593
that you'd expect.

50
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:08,215
First off, deep dive into experience.

51
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:10,137
So obviously the interviewer pulls out the resume,

52
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:11,878
asks them to do a quick rundown,

53
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:15,362
and then starts probing at interesting points along the way.

54
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:17,864
And this can lead to what I call the resume trap.

55
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,987
That candidate has put everything they can talk about

56
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:21,967
on that resume.

57
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:24,249
And you're probably gonna spend a majority of your time

58
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,531
trying to see if they actually did what they said they did.

59
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:28,013
But even after that,

60
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:29,594
if you determine that they have experience,

61
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:31,055
it still doesn't say whether or not

62
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:31,876
they're a good game designer,

63
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:32,837
just that they have experience.

64
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:36,871
Also, I noticed a lot of questions about process and documentation.

65
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,213
I never really understood process questions.

66
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:43,816
The answers generally are these, in a perfect world, this is what I believe my process is,

67
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:47,559
and most answers to process questions start to sound the same from candidate to candidate,

68
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,560
so it doesn't really do a good job at separating candidates.

69
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:57,155
game ideas. A lot of interviewers will ask questions about, hey, can you pitch an idea

70
00:02:57,455 --> 00:03:00,877
for a game you really like? Can you pitch an idea for our game that you're interviewing

71
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:05,779
for? And everyone has ideas. And I'll say this throughout the presentation. Game designers

72
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,080
do not come up with game ideas. That's not our job. Our job is to pick all the different

73
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,942
ideas we reference from other games, we reference from the team, put those ideas in the systems,

74
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:15,823
and make sure we're building something that actually works.

75
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,551
uh... so when you ask about game ideas and ask them to pitch him as an

76
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:19,952
interview

77
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:22,999
uh... you know really determine if they're games under a game enthusiast

78
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,643
of course again everyone has ideas

79
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:28,391
And finally, this is a major one.

80
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:30,732
You end up spending a lot of time testing interviewing skills

81
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,972
instead of testing job skills.

82
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:35,133
A lot of interview questions are those open, broad questions

83
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:36,833
where even if you ask, as the candidate,

84
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:38,574
what are you looking for?

85
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:39,874
They'll respond with,

86
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,334
oh no, I just wanna see where you're gonna take it.

87
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,055
These are horrible questions

88
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:44,515
that end up really just testing

89
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:46,416
if the candidate understands what you're looking for

90
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:48,836
and can control the conversation.

91
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:50,496
But there's a lot of great game designers

92
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:51,677
that aren't good at interviewing.

93
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,397
There's a lot of bad game designers

94
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:54,397
that are great at interviewing

95
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:55,978
and can BS their way through that process.

96
00:03:56,938 --> 00:04:00,820
So I noticed a lot of these things going on in the interview, and the majority of the interview were these questions.

97
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:05,082
And they all dance around one main question, but they never really ask it.

98
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:07,604
And that main question is, are you a game designer?

99
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:11,966
This is probably the most important question, and this is what you want to get out of that interview.

100
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:17,129
Because again, they can have experience, they can have a process, and they can have ideas.

101
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:18,850
None of that makes them a good game designer.

102
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,491
So how do you ask this question?

103
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:24,153
And this became kind of the main thing I started focusing on in trying to resolve this problem.

104
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,043
First, you have to understand what game design is

105
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:28,284
and define it for your studio.

106
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:29,325
And this is my definition.

107
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:31,607
It may be different from studio to studio,

108
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,008
as some studios may be more technical

109
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:33,829
with their game designers.

110
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,590
Some studios may actually have level design

111
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,191
with their game design.

112
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:38,253
But this is for our studio.

113
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:40,655
So game designers design systems.

114
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:42,557
We are not idea generators,

115
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:43,577
and I kind of said this already.

116
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,599
A system is a series of mechanics,

117
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,781
and mechanics are a series of ideas.

118
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:49,822
So that's why when you go to your game designer

119
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:51,664
and you say, hey, I got a cool idea,

120
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:52,384
wouldn't it be cool if,

121
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:54,165
and the game designer looks at you like you're crazy,

122
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:56,247
it's not because it's not a cool idea,

123
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,008
it's because they're stepping through it and going,

124
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,990
okay, how does that idea change the mechanic?

125
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,491
How does that alter the system?

126
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:02,792
How does that affect the game?

127
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,254
And that's the mental process for game design.

128
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:06,155
That's what they own.

129
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:08,496
And that's not something everyone can do.

130
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,118
But again, everyone has game ideas.

131
00:05:10,138 --> 00:05:11,158
There's nothing special about that.

132
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:13,706
We're also problem solvers.

133
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,067
We aren't design critiquers.

134
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,711
To solve a problem, you have to understand the system,

135
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:19,133
you have to identify the problem,

136
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,755
and then, of course, you have to propose solutions.

137
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:22,998
To critique design, you just have to not like something.

138
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,001
I don't like chairs with poor lumbar support.

139
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,363
That doesn't make me good at designing chairs.

140
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,826
And finally, we're big on owning the player experience,

141
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:34,548
but we're not level designers.

142
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,530
And the difference there is level design

143
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,651
focuses on player experience,

144
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,913
but they focus on building engaging spaces

145
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:41,695
and good flow through those spaces,

146
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,617
while game designers will focus on

147
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:44,878
building engaging gameplay loops

148
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:45,859
that keep the player hooked

149
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,181
and keep the player invested in the experience overall.

150
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:51,093
So this is my definition of game design.

151
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:54,316
Again, it may be different from studio to studio,

152
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:56,197
but the first step for me was to define it,

153
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:58,418
and then on top of that, now as an interviewer,

154
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:00,920
I want to ask questions that lead me to answers

155
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,041
that are on the green side,

156
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,942
and then I wanna stay away from questions

157
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,003
that generally turn toward answers on the red side.

158
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:07,645
Because again, I don't want idea generation,

159
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,045
I don't want people design critiquing.

160
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:13,310
So let's step through each of these sections, starting out with basic systems.

161
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,574
And I want to give you guys a bad question and a good question that I've seen in this process,

162
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:20,798
so you can get a better understanding of the issues we had at our studio.

163
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,901
So first bad question, and you may hate me because you may ask these questions.

164
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,951
What's your favorite game and what would you change in that game?

165
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:30,633
There's a lot of variance to this question, but my main issue with it is

166
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:34,155
it really is just saying, I want you to talk until I hear something interesting.

167
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,737
And then if you say something interesting, maybe I'll join the conversation and

168
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:38,398
maybe we'll go deeper into systems.

169
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:40,819
But what you really want from this answer is for

170
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:44,341
them to deep dive into a system in a game they like, pick it apart,

171
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:46,102
figure out some problems that were with it, and

172
00:06:46,142 --> 00:06:48,443
then bring up some solutions that might fix those problems.

173
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,624
but this isn't what this question's asking.

174
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,184
What you're actually gonna get from this question

175
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:54,005
a lot of the time is, oh, I like this game,

176
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,245
but I wish it had more characters.

177
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,045
That has nothing to do with game design,

178
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:58,866
but it's a valid answer because you asked

179
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,526
some sort of an opinionated open question.

180
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:03,167
So breaking this question down a little further,

181
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:04,847
again, it's not about systems or game loops.

182
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,128
For the candidate to be able to answer that way,

183
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:09,308
that's just them understanding that that's what you want

184
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:10,869
and then controlling that conversation,

185
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:12,489
which is good for them, but you may be missing out

186
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,590
on great game designers that aren't good at that.

187
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:18,555
And again, it's all about idea generation and design critiquing.

188
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:20,157
It's just too open.

189
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:22,700
And the easy way to figure out if your questions are too open is take 10

190
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,164
minutes, sit down, write down all the good and bad answers to that question.

191
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:29,328
And if you can't do it because there's infinite answers,

192
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:30,870
it's way too open of a question.

193
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,693
and generally if you can't figure out all the good and bad answers, how can you quantify

194
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:35,174
their answer?

195
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:38,957
And at the end, that's what a lot of game designers kind of, it goes off of feelings.

196
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:40,819
I really felt like that was a good answer.

197
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,441
And this guy, I didn't really feel like his answers were good.

198
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:47,605
And that's why you get certain designers that like candidates while at the same time other

199
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,127
designers really don't like those candidates because it's all completely subjective.

200
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:55,105
and what they talk about again you know no i actually had this happen me i've

201
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:58,546
asked all these questions and for five minutes this person went on about in the

202
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:02,028
game i've never heard of but they really enjoyed and i just had a thinking ok i

203
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:02,888
can't fall is at all

204
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:05,009
this is a horrible never asking this question again

205
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:12,241
Now I tried to figure out some solutions to this and try to change this question a little

206
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:15,804
bit to still get the hint of the question that leaves it more open for them, but also

207
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:19,226
really making it more about them tearing apart systems so I can understand they understand

208
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,147
what game systems are.

209
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:24,790
But really the only way I found to successfully figure out if the candidate understands systems

210
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:28,893
is to ask about a specific system and then add or remove a mechanic from that system

211
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,674
and see if they understand the implications of that.

212
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:32,936
And that leads us to our good question about systems.

213
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,068
You're working on a game of rock, paper, scissors.

214
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,470
Your creative director wants you to remove

215
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,431
one of the three options,

216
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,253
giving the player only two options to choose from.

217
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:42,374
What goes through your mind?

218
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:44,516
Now, stepping through this,

219
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:46,478
I started easily with rock, paper, scissors.

220
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,360
This is something no one's gonna be confused by.

221
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,561
If you don't understand rock, paper, scissors

222
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,403
and never played it and you wanna go into game design,

223
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:52,525
just you're failing already.

224
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:56,286
And again, your creative director wants you to remove one option.

225
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:58,347
That's me removing one mechanic from that system.

226
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,107
I want to see if you understand what that does to it.

227
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:01,608
And then what goes through your mind?

228
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:03,548
Generally, I don't care about the answer.

229
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:05,649
I don't care about them jumping straight to something.

230
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:06,989
I don't want to say, OK, solve this problem.

231
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,830
I want to hear about their mental process.

232
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,111
That's the main key for game design, is understanding, OK, maybe if I do this.

233
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:14,252
No, wait, that didn't work out.

234
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:15,192
I want to hear when they fail.

235
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:16,132
I want to hear when they succeed.

236
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:17,253
I want to hear the steps they take.

237
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,603
And generally this is what goes through a game designer's mind when they hear this question.

238
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:27,090
I sort of just peed on rock, paper, scissors, the holy grail of game design, and they're

239
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,795
just completely in mass hysteria usually and completely confused.

240
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:30,697
Why would you want to do this?

241
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:31,779
You're a horrible creative director.

242
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,534
But let's talk about a bad answer.

243
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,155
I actually came up with this question

244
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:40,276
out of frustration midway through an interview

245
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:42,797
because the candidate just seemed like someone

246
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:43,718
who wasn't a game designer.

247
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:47,180
It seemed like someone that was more of a project manager.

248
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,740
They didn't really design systems.

249
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,621
They brought people together to design systems.

250
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:53,043
So they couldn't really solve problems themselves

251
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:53,463
in that way.

252
00:09:54,383 --> 00:09:55,584
And then I really, when I came up with that,

253
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:56,704
I was like, okay, this is gonna be simple.

254
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:58,886
There's no way this person's not gonna be able to answer this.

255
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:00,386
Everyone in the world knows what happens

256
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:01,647
when you remove an option from rock, paper, scissors.

257
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,208
And this was his answer.

258
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:05,910
I would ask why he wants to change it.

259
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,431
This is valid to a degree.

260
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:09,212
This isn't a horrible response,

261
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:10,933
wanting to understand the goals of the creative director.

262
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:12,513
Now I have to play the role of the creative director

263
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:14,314
and say, okay, he wants it to change

264
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:18,277
because he feels three options is too complex of a system

265
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:20,198
and it would be easier for the user

266
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:21,118
if there was only two options.

267
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,880
It's a horrible answer, I know, but whatever.

268
00:10:25,777 --> 00:10:26,897
I don't like removing options.

269
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:28,898
Okay, so I'm getting a little frustrated here.

270
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:29,938
I don't really care what you like.

271
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:35,181
But is that because, you know, it's just based off your feelings and you're just a game player

272
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:36,061
and you like more options?

273
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:39,763
Or is that because you understand that removing an option builds a less engaging system?

274
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:41,123
I'm not sure what you're getting at.

275
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:43,824
I would try to convince him not to do that.

276
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:47,606
Again, play the role of the creative director and I just said, okay, he's not convinced.

277
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,622
I'd get the team together and we'd figure it out.

278
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:53,562
And this was the key point in the interview where I was just like,

279
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:54,583
alright, this is over.

280
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,444
You didn't understand at all what that would do to the system,

281
00:10:57,464 --> 00:10:58,644
you didn't think about systems at all,

282
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:00,825
you're just thinking about how to manage that creative director,

283
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:03,466
how to manage change in the game space,

284
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:05,227
and then how to manage other people

285
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:07,328
to bring them together to solve this problem for you.

286
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,550
And this is another answer I haven't gotten before.

287
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,531
But I'd kind of be excited to get it.

288
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:16,351
I would remove paper, the confidence in that.

289
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:19,929
Just like paper's stupid, no one likes it.

290
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,451
But so far up to this point,

291
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:25,993
even though I thought this sort of was a silly question

292
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,695
that most people would be able to talk about,

293
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:30,077
it's done a great job at separating candidates

294
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:32,218
into people that understand systems and people that don't.

295
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:34,340
So let's talk about some good answers.

296
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:40,704
Impossible! This actually was a game designer at our studio, because I felt so bad and awkward

297
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:44,547
after coming up with that question, thinking, okay, maybe it's such a crazy, ridiculous

298
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:50,132
question. Like, it's so simple that it confused him. So I brought it to other game designers

299
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:54,316
in our studio, which is, I just want to make that point, test out your interview questions

300
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:57,719
with other game designers. It's the easiest way to playtest them and see if they actually

301
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:57,880
work.

302
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:01,316
That would destroy the balance of the game, of course.

303
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:03,698
This is kind of the basic process that you would think of

304
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:05,319
when you remove an option from rock, paper, scissors.

305
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,521
If you remove paper, the rock would always win.

306
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,743
I added this in here because I wanted to talk a little bit

307
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:11,305
about the different perspectives of these answers.

308
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:12,846
That would destroy the balance of the game

309
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:13,587
as someone thinking about it

310
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,608
from a systems perspective.

311
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:17,030
If you remove paper, the rock would always win.

312
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,992
As someone stepping through it as if they were the player,

313
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,374
noticing that, okay, if I do that, then I do this.

314
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:24,297
So it's just an interesting opportunity

315
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:25,578
to look at different perspectives and answers.

316
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:28,533
You can't do rock, paper, scissors with two options.

317
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,814
One always wins or it's always a stalemate.

318
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,775
Of course, that encapsulating answer.

319
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:35,116
But again, I ask them to kind of walk

320
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:36,217
through their mental process.

321
00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:38,598
So at this point, usually I say, okay,

322
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:40,779
now what's your response to the creative director?

323
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,540
Because that gives them a chance to take a step back.

324
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,881
They're not just rambling their mental thoughts.

325
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,042
They're thinking, okay, I have to compile this now

326
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,863
into something for a superior.

327
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:50,985
And this can actually lead to great answers, which it has.

328
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:56,008
And that great answer being brought to you by Seinfeld.

329
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:00,717
uh... so george and jerry were having an argument and they played with a call

330
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:01,877
missio the choose game

331
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:05,858
uh... what i call on the needs and this is a two option system so this is a

332
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:10,240
candidate that not only recognize that okay that destroys rock-paper-scissors

333
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,681
but the creditors to want to option system i can give it to option system

334
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:17,663
uh... so in this game uh... you have to pick teams one players on one players

335
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:17,983
evens

336
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:21,244
you're going to be able to throw either a one or two out at the same time

337
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,965
you add up the fingers, and in this case it's three,

338
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:24,706
so odds wins.

339
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:26,647
There's two opportunities for odds to win,

340
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:27,767
two for evens to win,

341
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:30,349
but there's actually an extra step,

342
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:31,710
which is a little bit more complexity.

343
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,531
Now you have to select teams in this game,

344
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,131
whereas Rock, Paper, Scissors, you don't have to select teams

345
00:13:35,452 --> 00:13:36,172
but there's three options,

346
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,333
which the creative director thought was complex.

347
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:41,055
So at least this is a proposal for the creative director

348
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:42,135
who wants a two option system.

349
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,216
So again, a great answer for someone

350
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:46,258
that recognizes the issues, Rock, Paper, Scissors,

351
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:47,959
and then still tries to give the creative director

352
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:48,759
what they're asking for.

353
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,713
So when asking questions to try and see if the candidate understands systems or game

354
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,375
loops, some takeaways, don't ask open questions.

355
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:02,857
Open questions generally lead to opinions, they lead to really weird answers, and I don't

356
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:06,460
think you can really determine whether or not they're good for the job based on those

357
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,282
type of questions because they may go really off into weird areas that are still valid

358
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:12,783
but don't really tell you whether or not they're a good game designer.

359
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:15,253
know the good and bad answers.

360
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:16,834
Now what's key here is again,

361
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:18,175
I went through all the good and bad answers

362
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:19,216
and even a great answer here,

363
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:21,158
and that allows me to quantify their answer.

364
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:22,359
I mean, if it's too open,

365
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,440
I can't figure out if it's a good answer or bad answer,

366
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,981
really, I mean, it's just based off feelings.

367
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,583
On top of that, if I know all the good and bad answers,

368
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:29,724
I can give that to a recruiter

369
00:14:29,844 --> 00:14:31,345
and they can do a lot of the work for me,

370
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:33,507
kind of screening these people before it gets to me.

371
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:35,709
And if you've maybe noticed at your studios,

372
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:37,710
Generally, recruiters will ask for questions

373
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,790
and it's actually very hard to do

374
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,191
because they don't understand game design,

375
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,492
they don't understand how to judge open questions

376
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:43,353
and these open answers,

377
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:45,014
so it's not something they can do easily.

378
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:48,356
So finally, to test systems,

379
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:50,137
add or remove a mechanic from a known system

380
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:51,978
and then see if they understand those implications.

381
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,519
So this is kind of my great way of understanding

382
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,800
how to test systems and game loops,

383
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,140
but we still have two other skills,

384
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,962
which is problem solving and player experience up next.

385
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:02,163
And I generally like to use real world problems.

386
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:03,544
I wanna see them step through something

387
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,085
they might be stepping through on the job.

388
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,280
First, of course, bad question.

389
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,423
You need to design a new NPC for a game,

390
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:12,504
where do you start?

391
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:14,245
I've actually seen this question asked

392
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:17,047
and I sort of cringed because I don't know

393
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:18,148
even what they're looking for.

394
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:20,010
Is this a process question?

395
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,911
Are they asking him to solve a problem somehow?

396
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:22,852
Where do I start?

397
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:24,313
I start with understanding the game

398
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,835
and then the NPCs that are currently in the game

399
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,416
and how I can challenge the player outside

400
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:28,417
of what you're already challenging.

401
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:30,518
But what this question feels like it's saying

402
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,459
is just design, go.

403
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:32,320
Design something.

404
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:35,783
uh... which is very difficult to answer and again it's one of those

405
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:37,324
open questions that's just

406
00:15:37,624 --> 00:15:38,525
i want to hear you talk

407
00:15:38,986 --> 00:15:40,247
and and see where you go with this

408
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,590
now a great answer for this question isn't going to your process that's kind

409
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,513
of a boring answer no one's really pay attention to a great answer to this

410
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:50,856
question is going back into your experiences and talking about when you

411
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:55,059
design an npc why you designed it that way what process you went through that's

412
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,042
actually looking for it's not what they're asking great interviews will

413
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,464
give that to emporium viewers won't just be confused

414
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,843
And a good question, if you're looking to figure out

415
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:07,965
how they design an NPC, if you're looking to figure out

416
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:09,127
what their process actually is,

417
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,608
don't ask them what their process is,

418
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:13,711
ask them, give them a scenario

419
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:15,773
and try and have them step it through that scenario.

420
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:16,654
So this is a good question.

421
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:18,716
You're working on Far Cry and the creative director

422
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:20,958
asks you to design a tank vehicle as an enemy encounter.

423
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,000
Two points to keep in mind while designing this.

424
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:28,518
One, Far Cry is an open world game and the creative director wants us to be a roaming NPC that can be encountered anywhere.

425
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:33,065
Two, Far Cry supports a wide variety of playstyles from the stealth archer to the demolition man.

426
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,488
All playstyles should be able to overcome this tank encounter.

427
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,433
What's the first thing that crosses your mind when given this task?

428
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:43,429
It's a loaded question, obviously, and something I give more to mid- to senior-level designers.

429
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:45,970
But stepping through it, starting with Far Cry.

430
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,472
A huge franchise for Ubisoft, and if you haven't played it, you shouldn't be interviewing for game design at Ubisoft.

431
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:52,192
It's that simple.

432
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:55,413
And I want to stress that for anyone that's looking to interview in this room.

433
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:57,854
I've interviewed a lot of people, oh, I haven't played Far Cry, sorry.

434
00:16:58,094 --> 00:16:58,734
You shouldn't be here.

435
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:02,035
You're asking to take the keys of that franchise and be on the game design team.

436
00:17:02,415 --> 00:17:03,676
How can you do that if you don't know the game?

437
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:08,936
uh... second point is i'm asking to sign a tank vehicle i'm not asking to sign a

438
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:11,117
dragon for drug sequence in far cry

439
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:14,380
that's really complex and again i don't care but their answers i don't care but

440
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,701
their ideas for designing dragons

441
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,282
i want to keep it very simple

442
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:20,244
uh... because what's really important is these two problems that i laid out

443
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:23,307
far cry is an open world game we want this to be an open world encounter

444
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:26,469
which means we don't want to be an arena encounter which we've all seen those

445
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:27,610
where you walk into an arena

446
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,772
there's rpg scattered everywhere and you're like okay

447
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:30,812
something's about to go down

448
00:17:31,873 --> 00:17:33,233
That's not the type of encounter we're looking for.

449
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,374
We want something that is just roaming the world freely

450
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:36,194
with systemic rules.

451
00:17:37,415 --> 00:17:39,095
Far Cry supports a wide variety of play styles.

452
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:40,736
So what are all the play styles?

453
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:41,596
How can you solve that?

454
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:43,477
And what's the first thing that crosses your mind?

455
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:45,617
Again, I wanna hear their mental process,

456
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:48,178
but more importantly, I'm trying to turn this interview

457
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:49,078
into a design session.

458
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:51,759
Interviews generally test interview skills.

459
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:53,920
Design sessions are gonna test their job skills.

460
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,480
And the more comfortable they can be

461
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,621
in that design session, the better.

462
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,322
So let's step through some bad answers.

463
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:00,922
I love doing that.

464
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:06,624
uh... skipping encounter i've had can i can it that actually once said okay

465
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:08,005
okay design a tank encounter

466
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:11,046
okay so that you destroy one tank and you know what to make it difficult

467
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:12,106
worldwide to tanks

468
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:14,748
and i was blown away like you just passed everything

469
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:18,669
uh... you'd be this can it did not understand what really game design was

470
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:20,730
and what the meat of their job really was gonna be

471
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:23,928
tangents that dodge the question

472
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,649
uh... so i had a canada's well go through all i would love to steal a tank

473
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,771
and drive the tank and for five minutes when stop talking about driving the tank

474
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:34,372
which completely wasn't this question about and take a vehicle as an enemy

475
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:37,454
too much reference

476
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:40,455
and references good generally but if you never bring it back

477
00:18:40,975 --> 00:18:43,676
to solve the problem there's no purpose to it if you talk about

478
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:46,277
uh... which one can it did just battlefield tanks for the next five

479
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:49,759
minutes uh... it didn't really help out in in solving this problem and i kept

480
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,540
trying to bring him back to the problem is trying to solve

481
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,965
and they don't understand the problems. Again, I laid out those two problems

482
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,108
and the whole point of the question is

483
00:18:58,448 --> 00:19:02,314
do you understand what issues will come if you get those problems and try to

484
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:03,716
design a tank with those in mind?

485
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:06,019
And that leads us to our good answers.

486
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:10,463
The first one being the open world problem, which again, it's not an arena.

487
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,285
This is now something that's roaming the world that has systemic rules,

488
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:16,587
which generally means the player needs to bring the solution.

489
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:18,588
There's solutions that are scattered everywhere.

490
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:21,289
Now you could scatter the solution all over the entire world,

491
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:23,430
but that may cause its own problems.

492
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:29,045
and in play styles. So this is a chance for the designers to try and think of

493
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:32,289
okay what are all the different player types that existed in that game that I played

494
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:36,414
hopefully and then what challenges and opportunities can be used to overcome the

495
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:40,299
tank in those different player styles. If I have just a bow and arrow, how can I take out this tank?

496
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:43,293
And this starts to get a little bit dangerously

497
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:44,834
into idea generation.

498
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:46,774
So it's your job as the interviewer to say,

499
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,034
okay, what other problems might that idea create

500
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:49,735
that you just mentioned?

501
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:51,875
You gotta keep bringing it back to problems to solve.

502
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:53,415
You wanna see, as I said earlier,

503
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:55,516
if they have an idea in their head,

504
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:58,336
can they judge, okay, what does that do to the mechanic,

505
00:19:58,356 --> 00:19:59,436
what does that do to the system,

506
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:00,657
what does that do to the overall game?

507
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:03,177
Can they own that process?

508
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:04,617
And this is an opportunity for you

509
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:06,278
to bring bad ideas to the table,

510
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:07,838
ideas you know have holes in them,

511
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:09,218
to see if they can detect those holes.

512
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:14,957
And most importantly, combined, problem one and two

513
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:16,898
actually create a major problem for stealthier players.

514
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:18,499
People have to bring their own solution,

515
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:21,620
and then also they have to somehow overcome this tank

516
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,561
as a stealth player.

517
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:25,943
And that leads us to a great answer.

518
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:28,977
So this was actually a candidate

519
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:30,599
that was sort of failing at this question.

520
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,542
I was trying to turn it into a design session.

521
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:34,525
He was fumbling around, didn't really understand

522
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:37,249
until finally at one point his nerves went away

523
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,832
and he just sort of felt good

524
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:41,635
in that design session type mentality

525
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:42,796
and started riffing really well

526
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:44,499
and talked about Splinter Cell.

527
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:50,823
mentioned, we had this thing in Splinter Cell that NPCs are generally walking around with

528
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,225
weapons the entire game and they can get kind of monotonous.

529
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:56,727
NPCs don't really feel like real characters if that's all they're doing.

530
00:20:57,468 --> 00:21:01,991
So there was a couple things added where sometimes an NPC would have his gun far away from him

531
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:06,053
on a table, leaning up against a wall, taking a smoke break, or he's talking to another

532
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:10,416
NPC, and if you startled that NPC they'd freak out and try and rush towards that gun, giving

533
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,438
you more opportunity to try and take that NPC down.

534
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,958
but it also added a lot more narrative into the world

535
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:16,259
and made these characters feel more real.

536
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,759
He utilized this and turned it into something

537
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,320
the tank could do, that's roaming the world,

538
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,580
the two guys get out of the tank, have a smoke break.

539
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,981
This gives an opportunity for that stealth player

540
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,721
to take those guys out, or an opportunity

541
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:28,601
for you to steal the tank.

542
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:31,322
Now, again, this is tough between,

543
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:32,682
is this a cool mechanic system

544
00:21:32,702 --> 00:21:33,622
that could be used throughout the game?

545
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:35,103
Is this a cool idea?

546
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:36,263
But it didn't really matter,

547
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:37,503
because in that design session,

548
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:39,304
what this did was provide a revelation,

549
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,364
that it's not a tank, it's two guys in a tank.

550
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:43,525
And for a stealth mechanic, that's huge.

551
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:45,706
Because in stealth games, what you're usually doing

552
00:21:45,746 --> 00:21:47,207
is manipulating these NPCs,

553
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:49,388
and it's hard to manipulate a faceless tank.

554
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:51,169
But if you know there's two guys in that tank,

555
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,030
now you're thinking, okay,

556
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,490
how can I get those two guys out of that tank?

557
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,211
Can I smoke them out?

558
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:55,031
What else can I do?

559
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:57,312
And that really made the design session start to come alive.

560
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:59,734
And that made me think, okay, day to day,

561
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:00,834
I could talk with this guy.

562
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:02,235
I could have a cool design session with him,

563
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:03,456
and we could solve problems together.

564
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:11,989
So, again, to solve problems, some take away for problem solving and player experience.

565
00:22:12,449 --> 00:22:15,672
Don't ask how they design, offer scenarios with problems.

566
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:21,557
Generally, what you're really asking when you ask them how they design is, hey, how

567
00:22:21,577 --> 00:22:22,417
do you solve problems?

568
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,340
And I don't know how to ask that or even answer that, to be honest.

569
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,422
If you ask someone how they solve problems, don't be surprised when they say, oh, I think

570
00:22:28,462 --> 00:22:30,204
about it, and then solutions come up.

571
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:33,666
It's a very confusing, weird question and a weird answer.

572
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:37,248
Turn the interview into a design session.

573
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,950
It allows you to test their job skills

574
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,251
instead of testing their interview skills,

575
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,252
which I kind of mentioned before.

576
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,014
And then finally, keep the conversation on track.

577
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:46,696
You want it to be about solving problems.

578
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:47,577
So you want to see, again,

579
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:48,958
you want to see if they can take that idea

580
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:50,799
and say, okay, how does that affect the mechanic?

581
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,760
How does that affect the system?

582
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,121
Work it up through that process.

583
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:54,142
That's what game designers own.

584
00:22:56,461 --> 00:23:01,285
So as a kind of recap, I kind of successfully, with those two questions, talked about how

585
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:05,048
to get those skills, those four skills I'm looking for, out of the interview process.

586
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:08,491
And those bad questions I talked about, how to stay away from idea generation, design

587
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:10,592
critiquing, those type of things you're not looking for.

588
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:14,816
Generally, rock, paper, scissors, a great question for junior designers.

589
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:17,498
The tank question, again, more mid to senior level designers.

590
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:19,300
But what about game directors?

591
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,681
And I wanted to throw this in here

592
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:21,901
to step through this process again

593
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:23,603
just to get it ingrained in your head.

594
00:23:24,243 --> 00:23:25,324
The first thing we start with

595
00:23:25,524 --> 00:23:26,985
is what skills are we looking for?

596
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,187
So high-level direction and the ability to build brands

597
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:31,368
and understand brand values.

598
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:33,530
And if we take that further

599
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,691
and start talking about a bad question,

600
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:36,092
which many of you may have heard,

601
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,173
where would you take the next far cry?

602
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:42,713
uh... so this again i hopefully by now you can see this question ago of this is

603
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:43,213
too open

604
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:45,095
all's releasing is a technical ideas

605
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:48,056
don't be surprised if you ask this question when the person says all

606
00:23:48,297 --> 00:23:51,539
parker could be in space and talks about space for the next ten minutes and all

607
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,740
you're doing is that they're thinking why ask this question i don't care about

608
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,140
this idea

609
00:23:56,677 --> 00:24:00,720
A good question, critics are saying that many Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and

610
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,661
Far Cry are becoming too similar of experiences.

611
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,162
What's the root of this criticism?

612
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,243
How are these brands different?

613
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:07,745
And how would you help differentiate these brands in future installments?

614
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:12,128
I'm going to put these questions side by side because it completely represents kind of the

615
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:13,449
point I'm getting at right now.

616
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:16,731
Too many people asked the question on the left, not enough people asked the question

617
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:17,131
on the right.

618
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,773
And it's not about amount of text.

619
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:22,518
With the question on the left, you're gonna get very open answers that are gonna be all

620
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:23,579
about idea generation.

621
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,841
Is this person good for the job?

622
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:25,582
I have no idea.

623
00:24:25,602 --> 00:24:26,464
Do they have bad ideas?

624
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:27,565
Yeah, so does everyone else.

625
00:24:28,922 --> 00:24:32,664
On the question on the right, you're going to get at the root, which is, here's a problem to solve

626
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:35,125
that we actually have in the world right now.

627
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,408
And also, do you understand the brand values of Far Cry and Assassin's Creed?

628
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:41,189
Do you understand the things that makes them different?

629
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:44,450
Obviously, at Ubisoft, we have a lot of Ubisoft values we try and put in all of our games,

630
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:48,273
which start to make some of the games overlap in terms of open world great experiences.

631
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:50,774
But what makes each of these franchises also different?

632
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:54,076
And how can you build on those differences to separate these brands in the future?

633
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:58,594
So hopefully you guys will start noticing

634
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:00,456
as you ask questions, as you listen to questions,

635
00:25:01,537 --> 00:25:03,438
where they're gonna go, where they probably shouldn't go.

636
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,641
So just a final thoughts on where we go from here.

637
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:11,865
So for interviewers, define game design.

638
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:13,806
It's sort of the first step of your job

639
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,068
is to figure out, okay, what are the skills I'm looking for?

640
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:17,630
What does it mean for my studio?

641
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,991
Again, it may be something more technical in your studio

642
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:21,172
which you wanna add technical questions.

643
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,795
You may merge game design with level design at your studio

644
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:25,436
which you wanna include those skills as well.

645
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:29,493
Build direction, or build direct questions, sorry,

646
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,255
for that definition that you laid out.

647
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:36,998
And then know the good and bad answers for those questions

648
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:38,498
so that you can maybe even give them to recruiters

649
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,280
so that you can understand and quantify those answers.

650
00:25:42,747 --> 00:25:44,109
turn interviews into design sessions,

651
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:46,472
because again, you're trying to test job skills,

652
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,075
you're not testing interviewing skills.

653
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:52,441
And you can actually get people to ease in a little better,

654
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:55,485
because generally people get nervous around interviewing,

655
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:57,187
people don't get nervous that are designers,

656
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,929
in design sessions they feel a lot more comfortable.

657
00:26:00,587 --> 00:26:04,089
keep reviewing your hiring process on this is extremely important and this

658
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:05,389
isn't like something to do annually

659
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:07,430
every time you ask a question you get a bad answer

660
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,511
wonder if

661
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:09,771
that was a bad question

662
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,413
uh... really judge yourself and start testing questions on each other

663
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:16,794
uh... buff if someone says something poor interview if they're going for the

664
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:18,895
next interview talk to that person is gonna be interviewing them

665
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:22,096
uh... really figure out okay this was bad see if you can probe their little

666
00:26:22,136 --> 00:26:24,097
further see if i think he was a bad question or maybe

667
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:25,778
uh... he just understand

668
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,839
Raising it out to me this raises the bar for the entire industry.

669
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,501
If we can raise the bar for a game designers if we can raise the overall

670
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:34,981
our industry will improve.

671
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:39,923
And I just want to add a section for candidates as well.

672
00:26:41,324 --> 00:26:44,285
There's a lot of people I know that want to be game designers. A majority of those

673
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:45,826
people don't understand what game design is.

674
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:49,527
And so my first step usually is to try and scare them away from being game

675
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:49,907
designers

676
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:51,148
and see if they can handle that.

677
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:56,252
So a couple of things to keep in mind if you want to go into game design or if you're looking for another job.

678
00:26:57,053 --> 00:27:00,496
Game design is a profession. Too many people treat it like a hobby.

679
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:06,242
And what I mean by that is too many people are turning their nose up at indie games because they like major games,

680
00:27:06,522 --> 00:27:11,947
or at mass market games because, oh that's the 8th iteration, oh it's all the same, I'm an indie game person.

681
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:13,509
This isn't a hobby.

682
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:14,671
This is a profession.

683
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:16,895
So you want to play everything, reference anything.

684
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:19,379
And I tell my game designers, if it's 90 plus, you've played it.

685
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,503
If it's 80 plus and in your genre, you've played it.

686
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:23,227
Everything else is your hobby.

687
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:24,529
You can do whatever you want with that time.

688
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,393
But you've got to really start taking this seriously.

689
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:28,947
Game design is tedious.

690
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,748
You're designing a world.

691
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:33,851
You have to really fill all the holes in that world

692
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:35,352
to make sure they're designed before it goes

693
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:37,214
into production or you're gonna waste a lot of time.

694
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:38,715
For more information on this,

695
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:40,777
Liz Englund actually has an amazing blog post

696
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:41,698
called The Door Problem.

697
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:44,080
Really goes at the tediousness of what your job's

698
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,342
actually gonna be and hopefully it will scare people away

699
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:47,223
from wanting to be game designers.

700
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:52,948
uh... think out loud your mental process is the main important thing we're after

701
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:56,210
i don't want you to flounder around on top too much not knowing where to go i

702
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,292
don't want to go straight to the answer i don't care what the answer i'm not

703
00:27:58,312 --> 00:28:01,754
gonna use that answer i want to hear your thought process and where you go

704
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:02,475
in terms of

705
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:06,417
all that the system that works here that doesn't work here okay made that fails i

706
00:28:06,437 --> 00:28:07,358
want to see where i can take this

707
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:08,679
uh... that's the main key

708
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:11,521
uh... not only is that help you interviews it's gonna help you design

709
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:12,622
sessions and help you pitch

710
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:14,323
your design systems to the team

711
00:28:14,764 --> 00:28:16,405
uh... because you can say okay here my goals

712
00:28:16,425 --> 00:28:17,886
here are the problems i was trying to solve

713
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:21,617
Here's some ideas I had that didn't work, and here's why I went to this one.

714
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:23,824
And generally that's going to get people on board more often.

715
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:27,643
Game design isn't about your ideas,

716
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:29,985
it's about everyone else's, and I can't preach that enough.

717
00:28:31,146 --> 00:28:33,688
The entire dev team is a group of passionate people

718
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:35,650
that will have ideas, and I usually say ideas

719
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,452
are like Legos in a sea of Legos,

720
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:39,273
and too many game designers are picking up a Lego

721
00:28:39,293 --> 00:28:40,475
and going, look, this one's mine.

722
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:42,677
And there's Legos everywhere, who cares?

723
00:28:43,117 --> 00:28:44,118
Nobody cares if that's yours.

724
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:46,460
Your job is to build something out of all those Legos.

725
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,281
That's the key.

726
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:49,583
Understand which ideas work, which ideas don't work,

727
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:51,345
and then build the experience you're trying to build.

728
00:28:54,177 --> 00:28:54,838
That's my talk.

729
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:56,438
This is my contact information.

730
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:57,019
I usually throw it up.

731
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:58,259
People tell me not to, but whatever.

732
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,801
I love to keep the conversation going,

733
00:29:01,361 --> 00:29:03,462
both on the interviewer side, on the candidate side,

734
00:29:03,502 --> 00:29:04,523
if you guys have any other thoughts.

735
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:06,804
Also, two years ago I did a talk

736
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:07,985
called Designing Your Design Team.

737
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:09,926
It's on the GDC Vault.

738
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:11,867
Please check this out on the GDC Vault after as well.

739
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:13,908
And if you look at those and have any other thoughts

740
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:15,649
on either of those, I'd love to hear it.

741
00:29:15,729 --> 00:29:17,430
So please, let's keep this going.

742
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:20,172
Also after this, probably out of time,

743
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:21,752
so I'm gonna go to the wrap-up room

744
00:29:21,772 --> 00:29:22,893
if you guys have any other questions.

745
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:23,353
Thank you.
