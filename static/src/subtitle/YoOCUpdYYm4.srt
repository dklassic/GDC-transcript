1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,321
So welcome and thank you for coming for this talk.

2
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:15,583
I hope you can find some value in this.

3
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:18,604
But I'll go ahead and start.

4
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,885
So first off, a little summary about what I want to talk about today.

5
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,387
I'm going to go through a little bit about what Valheim is.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:41,949
and a history about Valheim, how everything started with the release, the launch, the reception about that, a few war stories that happened along the way.

7
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:47,624
I'm going to go through the different patches that we've done since release.

8
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:48,904
We're still not at 1.0.

9
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:55,148
I'm going to go through a few challenges that we've had during that time.

10
00:00:56,068 --> 00:01:03,793
I'm going to talk a little bit about early access, how that has worked for us, some thoughts on that, and about getting to 1.0.

11
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:10,878
First off, I want to say I'm not an expert in any of this.

12
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:12,780
This is just my perspective on everything.

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,702
The thoughts are my own, mostly.

14
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,245
And yeah, so take it or leave it.

15
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:22,708
There's also going to be some spoilers.

16
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:24,009
Personally, I hate spoilers.

17
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,153
So yeah, you could definitely go to the Alan Wake talk instead.

18
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:31,176
if you don't want to be spoiled.

19
00:01:31,977 --> 00:01:38,928
And also, thanks for my team for helping me out on this talk, giving me some feedback to make sure that it's not just a bunch of bullshit.

20
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,431
Hopefully.

21
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:49,427
And yeah, overall this talk is just basically giving you an insight to what we've been doing, how we do stuff, and yeah.

22
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:53,450
But first off, an introduction.

23
00:01:53,570 --> 00:02:00,935
So my name is Jonathan Smars, or Smosh in Swedish, and I'm the lead engineer on Valheim.

24
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:02,733
I'm also a designer.

25
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:05,534
You have my email up there if you want to get a hold of me.

26
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:12,136
I'm also on Twitter, or X. I post stuff about Valheim and other projects as well.

27
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:16,538
Also called a lot of other things at the office.

28
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:24,640
Jay Bloat, Johnny Longtalk are some of the more politically correct ones, so I'll leave the other ones off.

29
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,662
I started off when I was 10 or 11.

30
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:31,483
with Raydream Studio 5 in the 90s.

31
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:32,864
I got into modding Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament.

32
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:34,065
I made some cars for an Unreal mod called Unwheel

33
00:02:47,775 --> 00:03:12,248
uh... which made it into pc gamer it's the uh... this the the caterpillar truck down there uh... when i was thirteen which was really huge for me at the time uh... felt really awesome so i guess that was kind of my start of feeling that yeah i really want to make games uh... i did modding for a while i got my first industry job at dice two thousand six uh... worked on bad company uh... so depending on how you count that i guess i got

34
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:22,654
around twenty years on the gaming industry which sounds like a lot uh... crazy to me uh... because yeah i mean i really don't know what i'm doing still so

35
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:27,278
I'm also a volunteer firefighter.

36
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:34,121
You can see me working on Valheim from the fire truck in one of the photos there after a fire.

37
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:39,042
I love traveling and hiking in saunas and jumping in lakes and stuff like that.

38
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:43,044
And I have four lovely kids that I try to spend time with.

39
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,506
I also just want to... That sounded bad.

40
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:48,946
Sorry.

41
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:50,825
I

42
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:12,216
which is the little, yeah, all those little icons down in the bottom there.

43
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:30,381
And just a small tip for anybody wondering, like, getting into the industry, learning to make games, like, what should I do and all that, I would personally really recommend modding or game jams, because it really teaches you from start to finish how to make something, it gives you a deadline, you go through all the steps, and you can get feedback for

44
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:31,585
what

45
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:56,535
A game made by Irongate and published by Coffee Stain.

46
00:04:56,995 --> 00:05:02,299
Both of us are located in a small town called SkÃ¶vde in Sweden with about 40,000 people.

47
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,921
It's in between Stockholm and Gothenburg.

48
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:10,884
The game was made by a very small team.

49
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:14,705
We have grown a little bit since then, but not a lot.

50
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,226
And it's an amazing team.

51
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:20,367
I just want to give a huge shout out to everybody on the team and at the company.

52
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:24,107
It's really a lot of talented people doing a great job.

53
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:34,830
And also, all our talented partners are Publisher Coffee Stain, the animation studio Brick, which made these awesome animated trailers that I was showing before we started off.

54
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,604
and which you'll see during this talk.

55
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:48,588
Also, like lots of other partners, Patrick and Dennis for amazing music and audio, and Pictiv and Fish Labs for porting and stuff like that.

56
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:51,870
So, yeah.

57
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:54,891
I said that already.

58
00:05:55,812 --> 00:06:00,414
So the game is a brutal Viking exploration game for one to 10 players.

59
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:09,345
It's a huge procedural world with nine biomes, two of which are unreleased.

60
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:13,386
One is coming quite soon.

61
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:26,349
It's called a survival game, and I guess it is, but originally this was thought of as an adventure game, and we still think of it as that mainly, but it's, yeah, so.

62
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:37,752
The design of Valheim is based around three design pillars, our ABC, which is adventure, building, and combat.

63
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:46,338
And we try to keep an even balance of these three throughout the game and not lean too heavily into any of these.

64
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:49,159
and

65
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:12,797
a bunch of different play styles, which means that you can play the game together with a group of friends, even though they're not all into the exact same kind of a game.

66
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:14,617
It's a co-op game.

67
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:20,538
You play it on your own server and in your own time.

68
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:21,978
Somebody wants to go out fighting.

69
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:25,179
Somebody wants to stay at home and build a house.

70
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:26,799
Somebody else wants to farm and make food.

71
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,980
And somebody wants to go chopping wood.

72
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:31,527
of

73
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:57,463
which is

74
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:13,328
Yeah, but it has an old style of graphics, but with modern lighting and effects.

75
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:17,249
It also has, maybe you could call it retro game values.

76
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:26,792
We don't have any microtransactions or require you to be online or battle passes or invasive DRM and bullshit like that.

77
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:29,633
I think that's a lot of things that people appreciate.

78
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:30,553
I don't know.

79
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:32,934
Yeah.

80
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,124
short history about how did everything start.

81
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:42,647
And this is before my time, so I shouldn't be the one telling this story.

82
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:45,208
But here I am giving the talk.

83
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:46,809
So here it goes.

84
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,351
It all started out as a solo project by Richard Sensen.

85
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:51,992
He did it in his free time.

86
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:54,714
He was working at Pieces Interactive.

87
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:59,437
And he, let's see what I got there.

88
00:08:59,477 --> 00:08:59,597
Yeah.

89
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:09,207
He got his friend and colleague Henrik Tonquist to join him as a co-founder and formed Iron Gate in April of 2019.

90
00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:15,809
And at the same time, they also hired their first employee, Robin, who's sitting right here.

91
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:16,550
Awesome guy.

92
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,650
You can talk to him afterwards.

93
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,431
He loves food.

94
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:29,594
Originally, the game was supposed to be a peer-to-peer MMO called Fade.

95
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:57,864
which is why our networking model is not a traditional server client model, but individual clients are owners of the area that they enter, which makes, it's quite good for a game where you're exploring in different areas because you will have zero lag even if you're on crappy connections in different areas of the world, but it also means that if you are and you're in the same area, some people, yeah, a lot of people complain about this as well.

96
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:03,372
So, let's see.

97
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:08,175
A little bit about how we do stuff and what we do at IronGate.

98
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:14,638
One of our principles to work after is the good enough sentiment.

99
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:26,503
Trying to make everything good enough, like not trying to make everything perfect, not overcomplicate things, spend tons of time on overscoping certain things.

100
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:34,293
This is also something that we constantly struggle with, so it's easier to say than to do, I guess.

101
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:45,019
Work ethics, I think, is an important part, something I wanted to mention, because it's not always great in our industry.

102
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,242
At IronGate, we believe that people have to have a healthy work-life balance.

103
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:52,724
to make the best games possible.

104
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:58,069
So we have like 7 hour workdays, 6 weeks vacation.

105
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:01,673
We don't do overtime, we don't crunch.

106
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:06,718
These were things that were established before release as well, before all the success and everything.

107
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:13,745
So yeah, just want to say let's try to move the industry in that direction and we'll get better games and you'll get, everybody will

108
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:15,926
earn more money in the end anyway.

109
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:20,167
So let's try to help each other out on that.

110
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:22,128
I need to see if I can scroll.

111
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:22,988
Yes, I can.

112
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:24,149
Good.

113
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:25,669
Okay.

114
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,671
So small team.

115
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:33,653
We are, I think, 13 people

116
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:35,504
at the moment

117
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:47,172
that

118
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:27,862
And we want to stay focused on our vision for the game, which is basically make the best possible game that we can without worrying too much of the other aspects of business and too many opportunities and things like that, which is a luxury we can afford because we've had success.

119
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:33,164
So it's easy to say that, and it might not be easy for everybody to do that.

120
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:36,225
But we're happy to be in a position where we can.

121
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,404
And yeah, everything we do is for the greater good of Alheim.

122
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:51,568
Our fans might sometimes disagree, but there's also a lot of people who offer us support and say that, yeah, keep doing what you're doing.

123
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:53,409
You're doing it good, and so on.

124
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:55,029
So we're happy for that.

125
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:05,915
And also, I just want to shout out to QA, which I think is sometimes undervalued, and it deserves a lot more.

126
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:08,896
I've had the great pleasure of working with great

127
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:19,115
QA, which is really a big help, having faster duration time, always keeping the game, everything working really well, not ending up in a buggy mess.

128
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:25,562
So the launch.

129
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:31,449
On February 2nd, 2021, Valheim launched into early access.

130
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:33,655
of

131
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:53,702
a whole lot more than anybody ever thought or expected or could imagine in any way and it's completely crazy.

132
00:13:56,805 --> 00:14:04,913
It also launched on Xbox, Microsoft Store first in 2022 and then on Xbox Series and One in 2023.

133
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:12,678
I mean, it's done incredibly well.

134
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:13,718
We're very happy for that.

135
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,544
At the time of release it was the fifth most played game of concurrent players on Steam ever.

136
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:25,328
And since then it's been passed by a whole bunch of games, really successful, great games.

137
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,810
It was called a rare exception of Early Access.

138
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:33,414
Early Access has had kind of a bad name for various reasons.

139
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:35,595
So that's a very nice thing to hear.

140
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,979
We also got the Game of the Year award from PC Gamer, which is awesome.

141
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,962
It was the first Early Access game to get that award.

142
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,825
We also got the GDCA two awards two years ago.

143
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,767
Sadly, none of us were here at the time because of COVID.

144
00:14:54,887 --> 00:15:07,008
And I like this GIF over here showing the search queries for the US, which was every single state for 10 days straight was just Googling Valheim.

145
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:18,008
which is to me insane that it's like not something more important, but yeah.

146
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:18,909
It's kind of funny.

147
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,271
So why did it go so well?

148
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,494
And yeah, I am not the person to ask.

149
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:28,196
Everybody has their own theories.

150
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:29,717
Your guess is as good as mine.

151
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,080
Yeah, nobody was expecting it to go this well.

152
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:42,992
internally their hopes were to sell like 10 or 20k to be able to continue working on the game otherwise we maybe would have like had to

153
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:47,712
stop working on it and start, or they would have to start working on something else.

154
00:15:49,293 --> 00:16:12,250
We don't have any real metrics or science of why it went well, but some of my, I don't know if you care why I think so, but I think some of the reasons why, besides being a kind of a approachable gameplay loop that worked, that was both like challenging but also accessible, but also let you do whatever you want in the world,

155
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:31,742
combined with releasing during covid when everybody was stuck in their apartments and allowing them to play a game like up to more like a co-op game with more than four players together with your friends just running around in the forest chopping down trees i guess that was appealing so timing was good

156
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:35,686
It also had a very low entry barrier on price.

157
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:37,728
Funny story about that.

158
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:49,458
The price was set to $20, I think, but the Steam automatic translation to different currencies set it at 16 point something.

159
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:50,039
I'm

160
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:23,882
every single like every single reason to make the game easier uh... an easier buy will make uh... i think it increases the chance for a game to go well personally i think a lot of games on steam are overpriced uh... not for the value that they provide definitely not they should be priced much higher but uh... your main focus uh... for a debut game

161
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:38,591
I think should be getting the game into as many players' hands as possible and just having people play it, spread the word of mouth, and better to sell 100,000 copies at $10 than to sell 10,000 copies at like $30 or something.

162
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:38,691
Also,

163
00:17:48,402 --> 00:18:16,049
small download size i wanted to mention uh... the game was like one gigabyte per at launch and i think it's one thing i haven't heard mentioned too many times but uh... i think it's could be an important factor considering the amount of people in the world who have uh... pretty bad internet connections and also maybe they have full hard drives there's a steam deck now to consider and all things like that so i think like buy a new game and it's like install a hundred and twenty five gigs

164
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,850
And yeah, I think it's just crazy.

165
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,933
So I think that's a good thing to try to strive for if you can.

166
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:26,915
And also, it had trees that would fall on your head and kill you.

167
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:31,138
And I guess that was a good reason as well.

168
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:44,027
OK, so I'm going to go into some war stories, some funny things or not so funny things that has happened during our launch.

169
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:45,948
First off,

170
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,286
Like I said, nobody was expecting huge sales.

171
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:55,190
Coffee Standard Publisher have this funny thing where they do internal betting at the company.

172
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,231
And I've been told there's no stakes involved.

173
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:02,834
I'm not sure that I'm trusting that, but it's just for fun.

174
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:10,498
But here are the numbers, anyway, for what they believed that Valheim would sell and the rating on Steam there would be.

175
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:19,060
Thankfully, our publisher then, Emilia, was the second highest.

176
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:20,941
She's sitting right here.

177
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:22,503
She's now the studio head of Coffee Stain.

178
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:27,466
Yeah, she believed in us the most, and we're happy for that.

179
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,429
So yeah, it's just a funny little list there.

180
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:37,474
Then we have the roadmap, which is part of the title, I guess.

181
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,818
So what happened was our publisher,

182
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,140
thought it was not Amelia.

183
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,501
She was actually on maternity leave.

184
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:51,263
At the time, I think.

185
00:19:51,763 --> 00:19:54,704
They wanted us to publish a road map because that's what early access games do.

186
00:19:56,665 --> 00:20:00,387
And this was like maybe not very well communicated.

187
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:11,492
It was kind of hacked together at the time and it showed up while Richard and Robin were just trying to fix bugs and get the game working and everything.

188
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:12,232
And they're like, oh,

189
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:21,053
What are these things that we're going to release in 2021, this year?

190
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:30,817
So it was never meant to have a big promise list of features and set a deadline like that.

191
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:35,804
didn't turn out so well, because the internet never forgets.

192
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:45,472
And they like to remind us that we've promised this, and that we're a horrible developer for not filling our promises.

193
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:55,841
That said, it's definitely great to have a plan and communicate it to your players, but maybe do only the things that you know that you can do.

194
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:00,394
Then we have this other thing.

195
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,256
We bought a horse, supposedly.

196
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:05,338
This is Lisa.

197
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:10,562
She's also sitting right up here, our fantastic 3D artist, then also community manager.

198
00:21:11,762 --> 00:21:17,587
The real story behind this is that a local riding club was having some financial trouble during COVID.

199
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,648
So they just asked if we wanted to sponsor them.

200
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,292
for a not-so-huge amount to buy a horse.

201
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:27,675
And we said, sure, that sounds like a fun idea.

202
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:28,516
We can help them out.

203
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:31,358
We posted this in one of our updates.

204
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:33,179
Lisa thought, this sounds like a good idea.

205
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,583
And they named the horse Valheim.

206
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:40,405
So it's worth it just for that.

207
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:41,186
I think it's awesome.

208
00:21:41,486 --> 00:21:43,788
She lives in Kovde somewhere.

209
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,509
If you want to visit her, I'm sure you're welcome to.

210
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,512
But yeah, that's all we did.

211
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,356
nothing more, but the community also thought like, why are you wasting your time?

212
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:57,197
You should hire more people, finish the game, do all those things.

213
00:21:58,758 --> 00:21:58,958
Yeah.

214
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:08,200
So a quick rundown about the updates we have made since release.

215
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:17,083
Here is a little overview about the patches that we made.

216
00:22:19,158 --> 00:22:28,543
We've had one big update and some small updates, and 79 tiny updates with mixed things.

217
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:34,207
We have Ashlands coming up quite soon, and after that we have Deep North with 1.0 coming.

218
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:37,068
I put some graphs in because people like graphs.

219
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:57,849
it's showing kind of like the first one at the top is like the concurrent players of Valheim's entire lifetime and then since that kind of to zoom in a little bit it's showing the updates below there just to see what the updates have for effect and it's nice I mean it's definitely really nice but

220
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:06,924
Ultimately, it's not really our goal to make an update just to get more players in or to sell more copies or anything like that.

221
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:12,508
We just want to do what's right for the game, make the game in the best way that we can.

222
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,709
And we're learning as we go.

223
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:16,811
We're definitely making mistakes along the way.

224
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:19,594
So the first update was Hearth and Home.

225
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:21,457
First kind of bigger update.

226
00:23:21,978 --> 00:23:29,188
It reworked a lot of the systems, balancing work, added some build pieces, and added like writable, nameable creatures.

227
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:31,512
The community

228
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:35,584
There's no progress.

229
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:36,565
There's no progression.

230
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:39,207
So that's too bad, I guess.

231
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,850
There's a picture of one of the interesting bugs that showed up.

232
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,512
We just were going to add a hot tub.

233
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:47,853
But it turns out you can go swimming under it.

234
00:23:48,113 --> 00:23:52,837
And also, if you destroy it, the whole world would have the ocean level of the hot tub.

235
00:23:53,698 --> 00:24:01,383
So from just wanting to do one simple, small thing often turns into more headaches.

236
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:08,890
Then we did an abomination update, which was we wanted another creature for the swamp.

237
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,690
This is not the final version.

238
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:21,612
It's like the, yeah, I mean, it doesn't look great, but the final form is like some of our favorite creature in the game still.

239
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:31,594
It was, we were thinking like we wanted to release a patch and not mention this so that people would just be running around in the swamp and then all of a sudden it's like, rah!

240
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:38,449
But we realized that people didn't appreciate when we make things and don't write it in the patch notes.

241
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:41,371
So we started making more detailed patch notes after that.

242
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:50,517
It's based on a Swedish folktale called RotvÃ¤lta, which means like a fallen tree stump with roots.

243
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:55,261
And the story is something like, don't play close to those or it will eat you.

244
00:24:56,381 --> 00:24:58,623
I guess because it can flip up and they can get you.

245
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:00,590
of

246
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:49,858
there was a like we were finishing up this update and it felt like something is missing and uh... robin like friday morning is like i made a concept for a bat and then he just like threw together this model textured it and threw it over to christopher sitting over there our animator uh... animated some stuff threw it back to me implemented stuff made it work put it in the cave and it was all done uh... within one day which that's why we call it bat friday and we tried to

247
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:54,140
We try to say, oh, should we have a bad Friday this Friday?

248
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:59,923
And then eventually we haven't had a lot of those, but something that we strive for.

249
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:05,265
It's also been renamed to Feature Creep Friday, which for some reason gets canceled every time.

250
00:26:06,985 --> 00:26:10,387
So yeah, I'm a supporter of those.

251
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:17,421
After that, Mistlands was our first big update with a new biome.

252
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:25,649
It had lots of new content of every type of the game, items and monsters and food and everything.

253
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:33,517
Neutral creatures, it had a whole magic system and yeah, big update.

254
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:34,998
The community

255
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:36,722
was

256
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:57,689
Um, it started out actually, I think Lisa wanted to make or was it that Robin told?

257
00:26:57,829 --> 00:26:58,630
I don't remember.

258
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,956
Yeah, Lisa wanted something to do between an update and Robin was like, yeah, you can make some cool clothes or something.

259
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:07,480
So she's made some nice dresses and stuff on then.

260
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:23,013
so there was meant to be just like tiny little thing and then one day Richard bikes to the office and he's like oh I had this idea let's make a new NPC and a whole like you have to do this and this to get those things and yeah it just kind of

261
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:30,331
run away again and grew into this like much bigger thing, which makes like everything takes time.

262
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:47,980
So sometimes it's good to ask like is this progressing are are to the goal that we're trying to reach or like it's also good to make like side content as we call it, but but in the end like people are always asking like a missiles when Ashland's when constantly so

263
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:53,415
Yeah, it grew a little bit bigger, but I think it also turned out quite nice.

264
00:27:53,835 --> 00:28:03,059
We also had a world modifier added at the time, which was something that is allowing you to customize the game.

265
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:11,983
It's difficulty, but also settings making, like being able to play without a map, without portals, or customize it in different ways.

266
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:35,044
which kind of goes hand-in-hand with our philosophy of like it's your world it's your game do whatever you want with it and at the same time it's not like it was a little bit mixed internally like we also think it's interesting to say like oh you can actually beat Valheim now you can turn it down and it can be easier so yeah it's not completely

267
00:28:36,184 --> 00:28:37,185
a given.

268
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:44,491
But I think it's something that a lot of people appreciate, and it's also, for myself personally, I like to be able to say, oh, I want a bigger challenge.

269
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:47,053
Let's crank up the difficulty a little bit.

270
00:28:47,513 --> 00:28:53,338
But also, I want to be able to play with my kids so I can turn off the monsters and stuff, and we can walk around in the world.

271
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:59,643
We go into a dungeon filled with skeletons, and my five-year-old asked me, what are the skeletons doing here?

272
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:00,944
Because they're just passive.

273
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:02,465
I'm like, just don't hit them.

274
00:29:02,565 --> 00:29:03,846
They'll be nice if you're nice to them.

275
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:05,628
They live here.

276
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:20,236
Ash Lens is our upcoming second biome to be released.

277
00:29:20,777 --> 00:29:22,298
It's set to be released quite soon.

278
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:29,341
It's beginning to reach the end of the biomes that we have promised.

279
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:37,223
We're getting to the play styles a lot, giving a lot of new items, lots more content, new mechanics, and everything.

280
00:29:37,263 --> 00:29:40,044
It's going to be very interesting to see how it is received.

281
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:45,266
Let's see, yeah.

282
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,267
So a few other challenges that we have had along the way.

283
00:29:50,147 --> 00:29:51,548
The workload balance is

284
00:29:53,194 --> 00:30:21,370
like we are very small team to to decide on what do we put our time on like do we want to fix bugs work on like side great secondary stuff improve stuff polish all things work on the next biome optimize the game do platform work for the platforms take care of the team the community engagement and things like that it's always a real balance of trying to figure those things out

285
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,531
Being on multiple platforms definitely does take some time.

286
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:30,132
We have really great porting studios that have helped us out on this.

287
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:39,454
But because we want feature parity, everything that's put into the game, we want it to be the same on PC as on Xbox and everything.

288
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:47,116
There's always some overhead keeping all the branches in sync and things like that.

289
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:56,984
Yeah, and also we want to support cross-platform multiplayer, which sounds like, of course, you want to support cross-platform multiplayer.

290
00:30:57,324 --> 00:31:00,487
And now I'm glad that we do, because it's best for the game.

291
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:04,611
But knowing the headache of making sure that everything is 100% in sync and also

292
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:08,121
of

293
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:40,700
like the lowest spec machine Xbox one is makes us have to spend some time all mostly reporting studio, but still spend time looking at optimizing the game.

294
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,223
But in the end it's also good for everybody so yeah, it's a mixed bag.

295
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:49,567
I guess one little not so funny story.

296
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:54,171
What happened on Xbox even after tons of of QA and testing on Xbox.

297
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,364
At release, there were some reports like, oh, my house fell apart.

298
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:05,968
There's this mountain where there isn't supposed to be a mountain, and things like that.

299
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:10,832
The map would be 99.9% identical, except in certain spots.

300
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:21,843
And it took us a while to figure out that, I don't know how many of you are programmers, but there was some tiny, tiny discrepancies in the floating, rounding point calculations between

301
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:41,014
the old version of Mono and IL2CPP on Xbox, which is fine for all cases, except if you have a huge long list of random procedural generation that becomes cascadingly wrong at certain points.

302
00:32:41,174 --> 00:32:46,497
At one point, the switch is flipped, and then the rest after that will be different.

303
00:32:47,745 --> 00:32:51,868
That was also a headache to get that fixed.

304
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:55,190
Yeah, spending some time getting merch done.

305
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,132
I have some here for those of you who are not bored and leave before the end.

306
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:07,637
Starting a company with a new team, getting everybody synced and working together.

307
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:26,292
growing the team, people changing roles within the team, and spending time on team building, making sure that everybody can work together and are healthy and so on.

308
00:33:26,712 --> 00:33:30,115
Creating an office space, moving between offices.

309
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:37,180
There's so many of these practical things that might not be considered part of pure game development, but they do take time.

310
00:33:38,373 --> 00:33:39,575
Production pipeline changes.

311
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:41,198
Like in the big.

312
00:33:43,146 --> 00:34:11,705
In the beginning when there's very few people then the how we work was just like oh, this is a cool thing Okay, let's make it and there's like three people in that room And that is that that becomes made and after that like move over to like we had Google Sheets Which was not great, and then we moved to Trello, and then we moved to Monday Which is what we're working on now, but it's like it's a big difference like every single person you add to your team is adding complexity And making it yeah like there's more overhead involved in the production

313
00:34:12,646 --> 00:34:14,067
Also, engine upgrades.

314
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:20,472
I'm sure everybody loves to upgrade to the next version of Unity or any other game engine.

315
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,214
It works great most of the time, actually, but there's some hiccups.

316
00:34:26,236 --> 00:34:28,257
So, I don't know how I'm doing for time.

317
00:34:28,677 --> 00:34:29,318
Maybe it's okay.

318
00:34:30,238 --> 00:34:34,021
Early access, then.

319
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:39,345
Why does early access exist, and is it good, or is it bad, or what is it?

320
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:43,171
I don't really generally like making lists of pros and cons.

321
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:52,095
It's much too black and white for me, but I did it anyway because it's good to, yeah, I don't know, give, to list things up.

322
00:34:53,596 --> 00:34:57,297
So, but everything, everything is a gray, I would say.

323
00:34:58,178 --> 00:35:00,559
So first off, why would somebody do early access?

324
00:35:00,939 --> 00:35:01,880
Obviously for funding.

325
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,163
You don't have enough money to work on the game for five years, so you want some, some extra funding for that.

326
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:11,764
That's a very valid reason.

327
00:35:15,265 --> 00:35:16,325
Early evaluation.

328
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:25,048
Like, this is really both good and bad, but it could be a good idea to get to know, is this going to be a good game?

329
00:35:25,768 --> 00:35:28,068
Like, do people like this game or not?

330
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:33,290
Or should I spend more of my time making this game, or should I make something else?

331
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:40,994
And that is a good thing, but it's also a bad thing if you're presenting something that is not in a good state.

332
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:53,260
So when you release to early access, make sure that it's in the best presentable state that you could be, because you only do release once in that regard.

333
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,442
So it's both good and bad.

334
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,211
Two releases, which is kind of true, kind of not true.

335
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:04,792
It's definitely both good and bad.

336
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:08,273
You release it early access and you get your 1.0.

337
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:14,955
I'm not sure how all the Steam algorithms work and stuff like that, so maybe it's not really two releases, but still.

338
00:36:17,556 --> 00:36:21,237
It could be a point of buying two lottery tickets instead of one.

339
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:29,981
play you get a lot of play player play testing and feedback from from people.

340
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:39,189
Some people expect this to be kind of like a beta of some sort which it is not most players treated do not read it as early access and they will give you better views.

341
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:47,055
But you do get feedback like if it's well planned you can get the feedback that you need to make the game good for your one 0.0 release.

342
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:55,264
And it also is like helping you growing the community, engaging the community, making them kind of part of the game development.

343
00:36:55,304 --> 00:37:05,127
Like, depending on how much of the, how much feedback you're taking, like balance changes and improvements, it's a really good way to engage players in your game.

344
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:18,512
It's also very inspiring to have people play your game and say that they want more rather than sitting by yourself in a basement, in a garage or something like that and just waiting.

345
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:25,132
Bad first impressions.

346
00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:33,775
Like I already said, it's a really bad idea to release a game if it's not in a good state.

347
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:35,195
Then it's better to keep it.

348
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:40,777
And so that will lead to negative reviews on Steam if you choose Steam as your platform.

349
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:43,398
And you might think that

350
00:37:45,936 --> 00:37:49,979
Yeah, there's the early access reviews and all that, and people might come back.

351
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,401
But most people don't come back to change the review.

352
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:53,402
They're done with the game.

353
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:56,684
If it's a bad game, it's going to keep being a bad game.

354
00:37:57,265 --> 00:37:58,386
Your review score is going to be there.

355
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:06,312
And it will also demotivate you a lot if you have a release and it turns into mixed or mostly negative or something like that.

356
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:10,434
What are the chances that you're going to get more money from that or get more sales?

357
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:14,516
I mean, the chances are you're going to abandon the game and then move on to something else.

358
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:20,759
So make sure that that don't release it too early.

359
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,722
Also, the two releases I wanted to point out that while it's good to buy the two lottery tickets.

360
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:32,064
The chance of snowballing.

361
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:33,264
a lot

362
00:38:49,622 --> 00:38:49,642
I

363
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:13,950
When you are working on your game by yourself, you can, of course, do it in your own time, take your time, no stress from the outside.

364
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:18,594
And when you're done, or if you need to spend another year doing it, then you do that.

365
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:28,300
As soon as you've released your game, getting into this one, as soon as you release your game, you have to tackle a bunch of other things as well.

366
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:31,563
The first of them being is that

367
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:32,203
I'm

368
00:39:51,363 --> 00:40:05,278
keep the the pure like if you want to be able to make like really rough decisions or big decisions changes and to the end of your your game that it's probably a good idea to not release it before that and you can of course do it but the response will probably not be great.

369
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:13,773
Also staying relevant for, like, many early access games like us are early access for multiple years.

370
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:25,878
And it could be difficult to feel motivation after a number of years with player counts dwindling and thinking, like, OK, how many people will actually play this once it's done?

371
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:28,799
Because we had our time at some point.

372
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:36,663
And providing support, like technical support, for both

373
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:44,387
both actual customer support like answering emails and stuff like that, but but fixing like jumping over to fix bugs.

374
00:40:46,888 --> 00:40:56,035
For for current players rather than actually just work on the game that you want to make and do those things later so that that changes this whole workload balance thing quite a bit.

375
00:40:58,628 --> 00:40:59,629
Backwards compatibility.

376
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:09,031
This is of course different for different games, but I think it's applicable for a lot of early access games, especially for us where we do not want to like.

377
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:17,894
People spend in some cases hundreds of hours on their world building and exploring and making this world theirs.

378
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:26,016
We would not want to post an update that would force them to reset their world and start from the beginning.

379
00:41:26,676 --> 00:41:26,916
like this.

380
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,463
Yeah, that being said, I'm not completely promising that there might not come a point where that happens, but hopefully not.

381
00:41:54,803 --> 00:42:04,468
It also goes for save games, making sure that they do not get corrupted or anything like that and we've had cases where

382
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:15,131
Sadly, many cases where something breaks and we get emails like, I spent 400 hours building a city and now my world is gone.

383
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:26,575
And to be honest, we've had a lot of sleepless nights over stuff like that, like posting an update, thinking this is going to be good, and then like waking up the next morning to hear like, oh, there's five people who lost their worlds.

384
00:42:27,235 --> 00:42:28,895
So that really, really does hurt a lot.

385
00:42:29,076 --> 00:42:33,537
And we do a lot, like we really do as much as we can to try to prevent that.

386
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:41,025
And we, I think we have had a lot of cases where we've been able to recover this in some way, which also takes time.

387
00:42:41,865 --> 00:42:48,469
But we also put in systems like backup systems and better cloud-safe support and things like that to prevent that from happening.

388
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,325
It also raises the standards both internally and externally.

389
00:42:56,946 --> 00:43:04,014
So if Valheim never went into early access, it would have been done by now.

390
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:07,698
The last biomes would have been done maybe a bit leaner.

391
00:43:09,275 --> 00:43:11,116
if you compare them to other biomes.

392
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:24,621
But because of the effect of having a successful game and having people wait for that, and they've waited for a while, then you really have the pressure of, OK, we really want them to like this.

393
00:43:24,661 --> 00:43:33,624
We don't want to disappoint our players, which raises our own standards, which makes us spend even more time building the next biome.

394
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:36,026
which raises the standard even more.

395
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:38,308
And then it's a vicious cycle.

396
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:39,389
It just builds on itself.

397
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:49,918
So that is something that we struggle a lot with trying to find what is the sweet spot of good enough and what is like, no, no, this isn't good enough.

398
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:51,720
Is it going to be good enough?

399
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:53,581
So on.

400
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:59,487
And also to think about what is your ultimate motivator on

401
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:02,161
Why are you making this game?

402
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:03,104
What is your point?

403
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:05,011
What is your focus on your next update?

404
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:21,000
I mean, it makes sense that some games are like, if you just want to sell more, or if you want to increase your player count and have this like, I mean, of course, everybody wants to make money and so on, and have to.

405
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,661
But is that your goal?

406
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:25,763
Are you thinking only about the next update?

407
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:33,507
Or if you want to release an update every single week, or every single month, or something like that, that puts a lot of stress and changes how the game will be in the end.

408
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:47,433
For us, like I mentioned earlier, we approached this just wanting to make the best possible game, which is a luxury that, yeah, gladly we can afford.

409
00:44:50,715 --> 00:44:52,996
Yeah, that's basically everything I just said.

410
00:44:55,637 --> 00:44:57,357
Why did Valheim go into Early Access?

411
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:03,240
It was for the same reasons which I also mentioned maybe, but because

412
00:45:05,347 --> 00:45:19,262
funding did not like we needed to make sure that it was worth putting more money money into this or not we the publisher wanted to make sure it's worth putting more money into this or not.

413
00:45:22,697 --> 00:45:24,958
And that, I guess, is a big reason why many people would do that.

414
00:45:25,438 --> 00:45:49,329
One thing that we do, though, is that we do not treat it as early access, which is one really important point, is that if you're releasing your game on early access, if you think about it as early access and think, oh, it's fine, we'll just put work in progress, missing, that button doesn't work, there's some bugs over there, don't walk over there, then that's the experience that people are going to have.

415
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:55,837
And we do not want to put anything in the game that doesn't feel good enough or done.

416
00:45:57,959 --> 00:46:03,266
Which is why we made, say, the first 60% of the biomes done.

417
00:46:04,437 --> 00:46:14,849
and the last ones are basically missing, rather than making 60% of them done individually and have like this half broken mess, missing a bunch of stuff along the way.

418
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:22,678
And I think that is a big reason why we get a lot of nice comments about saying that it doesn't feel like an early access game.

419
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,762
That's very nice because that's what we were hoping.

420
00:46:27,943 --> 00:46:29,444
We do not release tons of updates.

421
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:35,730
It's great if you can, and if that's part of your plan, but that's not how we do it.

422
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:47,239
We try to have a good community relationship, communicate on a lot of different, like we have Discord and Reddit and lots of different places where we communicate.

423
00:46:49,061 --> 00:46:49,822
I also think that

424
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:51,371
it's

425
00:47:08,947 --> 00:47:10,469
some trolls on social media.

426
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:18,095
My favorite is a Twitter account dedicated to asking why there's not bikes in Valheim at every single update.

427
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:21,798
So yeah, I think it's funny.

428
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,440
Lisa does too.

429
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:31,092
Yeah, staying true to our vision while also listening to feedback.

430
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:33,873
This is the balance, which is really difficult.

431
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:50,499
Maybe I'm repeating myself again, but while we want to stay true to this vision, there are cases, of course, where we have this idea and we realize with the feedback that we're getting, no, that wasn't a great idea.

432
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:52,860
So then we can

433
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,023
tweak it, and then we can think about it one more time.

434
00:47:57,364 --> 00:48:01,949
And also take in feedback of various types, of course.

435
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:07,956
I just want to make the best game that we can, like I said.

436
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:11,039
So is your game suited for early access?

437
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:12,860
Let's see.

438
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,961
This was supposed to be that I was going to click them down, but I guess I did miss that.

439
00:48:16,322 --> 00:48:17,842
It's just supposed to say no.

440
00:48:19,623 --> 00:48:22,445
So if you have to ask, I would say no.

441
00:48:23,685 --> 00:48:29,328
If you don't have to, and if you have to ask, or if you're unsure, I would say don't do it.

442
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:30,629
Better to wait.

443
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:32,109
Keep it in the oven.

444
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,430
Make sure it's really, really good.

445
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,051
Even if you do release, make sure it's really, really good.

446
00:48:37,612 --> 00:48:39,373
Also, I would say single experience games.

447
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:45,775
It's not an expression, but like games where you're meant to play it more or less one time from beginning to end.

448
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:54,998
Story-based games or very specific, like say, Metroidvania, where you want this one progression that you probably do one time.

449
00:48:56,218 --> 00:48:57,399
I would say don't do that.

450
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:00,040
Also, live service.

451
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:02,937
I don't know.

452
00:49:03,337 --> 00:49:05,098
They're going to make updates forever anyway.

453
00:49:05,178 --> 00:49:07,158
So it's basically just the same thing.

454
00:49:07,418 --> 00:49:08,418
Why call it early access?

455
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:09,919
I think that's weird.

456
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:28,002
But games which are more focused on replayability, where you need balance feedback or you want a lot of balance feedback, you want to iterate on that a lot, that is better suited for that.

457
00:49:28,062 --> 00:49:31,463
And multiplayer games, which you will be playing and coming back to a lot.

458
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:33,430
Let's see, how are we for time?

459
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,010
Not so great.

460
00:49:36,152 --> 00:49:36,972
Is Valheim suitable?

461
00:49:37,873 --> 00:49:38,694
It's kind of suitable.

462
00:49:40,015 --> 00:49:41,416
It did go quite well.

463
00:49:43,077 --> 00:49:48,481
But it definitely made the game development take a little bit more time.

464
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,423
But in the end, I think it will make Valheim into a better game.

465
00:49:53,465 --> 00:49:55,066
So bottom line, it depends.

466
00:49:55,246 --> 00:49:56,087
It's not for everybody.

467
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:57,448
It's not free money.

468
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:03,042
And also, again, I'm not an expert at this.

469
00:50:03,142 --> 00:50:05,145
If you feel that you want to do it, go ahead and do it.

470
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:06,687
It's definitely up to you.

471
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:11,394
If you do it, have a plan.

472
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:15,759
Think through what you're doing.

473
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,581
Talk to people.

474
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:17,342
Do your research.

475
00:50:18,263 --> 00:50:18,343
of

476
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:37,593
Yeah, I think I'll skip through that.

477
00:50:39,674 --> 00:50:42,396
And getting to 1.0, we have the extra dot there.

478
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:44,657
Have an extra strategy.

479
00:50:44,777 --> 00:50:51,420
Don't just go for, don't just like silently release 1.0 and call it 1.0 and think that, oh, it's going to explode.

480
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,980
Try to do something with it.

481
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:57,943
Make it feel like an actual release so that there's a huge reason to go back.

482
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:00,824
I would say polish everything.

483
00:51:02,905 --> 00:51:03,926
Try to go out with a bang.

484
00:51:05,347 --> 00:51:09,130
Add things like achievements, like make it feel like a high production value.

485
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:11,291
Everything around that.

486
00:51:11,492 --> 00:51:13,773
Maybe think about mod support and things like that.

487
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,518
And project fatigue is definitely something to consider.

488
00:51:19,898 --> 00:51:25,022
You're probably extremely tired of your game at that time, but try to don't fall on the finish line.

489
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,283
Try to finish up as much as possible.

490
00:51:27,844 --> 00:51:28,844
And these are the things that were

491
00:51:30,097 --> 00:51:45,009
kind of trying to think about and aim for, for our last biome, which is Deep North, which will come out with early access, no, first 1.0 release after our Ashlands release.

492
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,032
And that's it.

493
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:49,293
Thank you.

494
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:04,626
So yeah, they did say that we have time for questions, because there's not a talk directly after this.

495
00:52:05,146 --> 00:52:10,912
I also have a few items with me, which I will throw out to you if anybody wants some stuff.

496
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:13,934
I don't know.

497
00:52:14,655 --> 00:52:18,078
T-shirts are probably not going to be in your sizes, but let's just try anyway.

498
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:24,905
You can meet at the back if you don't get the size that you want, and maybe somebody will trade you.

499
00:52:29,758 --> 00:52:30,919
T-shirts are horrible to throw.

500
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:35,682
That's why they have these T-shirt guns.

501
00:52:40,225 --> 00:52:40,505
Wow.

502
00:52:42,966 --> 00:52:43,227
Oops.

503
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:44,027
Oops.

504
00:52:44,948 --> 00:52:46,469
There's one more on the last one.

505
00:52:47,189 --> 00:52:47,589
There you go.

506
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:48,630
See?

507
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,193
See, I have more.

508
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:57,516
It's also good to sit in the front, I guess, if it's T-shirts.

509
00:52:58,196 --> 00:52:59,017
Maybe these will fit.

510
00:52:59,037 --> 00:52:59,217
Wait.

511
00:53:01,189 --> 00:53:01,789
I'll do like this.

512
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:02,710
No.

513
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,271
You can come get these afterwards.

514
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,073
But these I can throw farther.

515
00:53:07,173 --> 00:53:09,214
So a little bit farther.

516
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:13,237
Actually, this is going to take too much time.

517
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:29,708
There's an Xbox controller.

518
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:30,209
I'm keeping that.

519
00:53:37,202 --> 00:53:38,563
OK, there you go.

520
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:42,606
Yeah, so any questions?

521
00:53:43,246 --> 00:53:45,088
Also, I guess we'll run a few questions.

522
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:51,252
And if anybody wants to ask us, like, basically most of the Valheim team is actually here, sitting up here front.

523
00:53:51,793 --> 00:53:56,796
If anybody wants to meet and talk to anybody individually, we'll stick around for a little while after this talk.

524
00:53:58,378 --> 00:53:59,458
But yeah, shoot, questions.

525
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,140
All right.

526
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:02,521
Sorry?

527
00:54:03,681 --> 00:54:03,962
Of course.

528
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,802
I have a question about the world modifiers.

529
00:54:07,822 --> 00:54:11,187
Do you get info back on what players choose, and do you act on that if you do?

530
00:54:21,707 --> 00:54:26,792
OK, the question was about, do we have any information or metrics about what people choose on the world modifiers?

531
00:54:27,653 --> 00:54:30,275
And funnily enough, we don't have any metrics whatsoever.

532
00:54:30,836 --> 00:54:33,618
We did have metrics, and it's a great idea to have metrics.

533
00:54:34,759 --> 00:54:38,022
But we used Google Analytics, which was not super popular.

534
00:54:38,082 --> 00:54:39,524
So we just turned it off really early on.

535
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:43,627
But maybe at some point, we will hopefully add that again.

536
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:46,410
Over there?

537
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,894
I had a really great time playing this game with my friends.

538
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:53,878
So first of all, thank you for bringing this experience to us.

539
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:03,667
My question was, were you aware of any exploits or sequence breaks that players discovered, things like that?

540
00:55:03,907 --> 00:55:05,789
And what was your response to them?

541
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,833
OK, so the question was about exploits and sequence breaks.

542
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:25,373
I wouldn't say we're aware of them at the time, but we are very happy to see people exploring the game in different ways and making plays and speed runs and playing the game backwards, doing all this crazy stuff.

543
00:55:25,553 --> 00:55:33,955
And we don't explicitly try to, as long as it's not a hard bug breaking the game, we don't want to hard lock people away from doing that.

544
00:55:34,475 --> 00:55:36,636
It's just a great way to play games for people who want to do that.

545
00:55:38,196 --> 00:55:38,457
Thank you.

546
00:55:39,217 --> 00:55:39,457
Over there.

547
00:55:40,356 --> 00:55:43,439
Hi, you mentioned your appreciation for your QA team.

548
00:55:43,879 --> 00:55:47,763
I'm curious, can you elaborate on how they work with the developers and the rest of your team?

549
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:52,667
Okay, so our QA team has mostly been Andreas, who's sitting over here.

550
00:55:54,408 --> 00:55:57,191
And he's now the producer, Ann Valheim.

551
00:55:57,211 --> 00:55:58,532
He's a great guy.

552
00:56:00,669 --> 00:56:30,349
and he basically just means that I do stuff immediately send it over to him and he tries it immediately sends it back and says what's not working and I fix it so that there's not like this lag of things being in the game for two weeks before it comes back and having a long list of things but rather like I would basically almost not even come back from getting my coffee or something and he'd be like oh you this is broken like whoa okay oops my bad so yeah and he's also like yeah maybe you should check this before you

553
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:34,250
I'm trying to get better at that.

554
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:35,551
I'm recovering.

555
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:38,131
Thank you.

556
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:39,372
Over here.

557
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:40,752
Yeah.

558
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:43,753
Do you ever plan on releasing on PlayStation?

559
00:56:46,514 --> 00:56:46,834
Maybe.

560
00:56:47,494 --> 00:56:47,934
I don't know.

561
00:56:48,835 --> 00:56:50,735
And if not, why?

562
00:56:55,809 --> 00:57:10,295
Hi, you had talked about how Nistlands and Ashlands were in the original plan to ship.

563
00:57:10,835 --> 00:57:16,197
I'm curious if you can tell us more about your choice to make the Deep North or where that came from.

564
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,691
OK, yeah, so that was before my time.

565
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:21,752
That would be Richard mainly to talk to, and he's not here.

566
00:57:21,812 --> 00:57:25,193
But you can ask Robin, who's been with Iron Gate the longest here.

567
00:57:25,634 --> 00:57:27,735
He probably has a great answer for that afterwards.

568
00:57:30,176 --> 00:57:30,536
Hello.

569
00:57:31,216 --> 00:57:35,818
Could you talk a little bit more about the music in Valheim and just the inspiration or process for it?

570
00:57:37,196 --> 00:57:39,457
OK, so we have a composer, Patrick.

571
00:57:39,637 --> 00:57:43,418
He's asked this one to Robin as well.

572
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,498
He knows much more about this.

573
00:57:44,939 --> 00:57:46,779
He directs the music a lot.

574
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:51,361
And it's, yeah, I think it's better.

575
00:57:51,461 --> 00:57:52,481
We can talk about it afterwards.

576
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:53,141
OK, thank you.

577
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:53,662
Probably better.

578
00:57:53,822 --> 00:57:54,282
Thank you.

579
00:57:54,342 --> 00:57:54,622
Sorry.

580
00:57:55,502 --> 00:57:57,723
OK, any more other questions?

581
00:57:58,743 --> 00:58:00,304
Then whoever wants to, you can come up.

582
00:58:02,204 --> 00:58:03,765
And yeah, thank you very much for coming.
