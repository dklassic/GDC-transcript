1
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:06,681
think that's it. All right. So I'm mayor shepherd and this is

2
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:11,144
Reagan burns and together we're metanet software. So we're a

3
00:00:11,204 --> 00:00:16,126
tiny game developer based in Toronto and we made N and plus

4
00:00:16,186 --> 00:00:19,788
and N plus plus. We've been designing levels for the series

5
00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:24,050
off and on since 2004. So at this point we've got about 10,000

6
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:26,692
levels that we've made which is

7
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:30,894
roughly equivalent to each of us making at least one level

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,255
every single day for the past 12 years,

9
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:35,436
which is kind of a huge amount of levels.

10
00:00:36,477 --> 00:00:39,599
So if there weren't so much potential variety

11
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:43,040
in these games, that would have gotten old really fast.

12
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,301
And that's kind of what we're gonna talk about today,

13
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:47,723
our design process and what we've learned

14
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:49,824
over the past decade of making levels.

15
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:52,745
And hopefully there will be a few things

16
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:54,946
that you can take back to your own processes.

17
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:59,036
So there's a lot to designing levels,

18
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,596
and this talk is only an hour,

19
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:02,737
so I definitely could not fit everything in.

20
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:06,418
Also, I only have time to talk about solo level design.

21
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:08,459
Multiplayer is a huge can of worms,

22
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:10,380
so don't have time for that.

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,621
But if I do end up skimming over something

24
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,201
that you really want to hear more about,

25
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:18,203
or I guess if you just want to hear more in general,

26
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:19,483
please feel free to get in touch.

27
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:22,044
Here's our emails and Twitter things,

28
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:23,125
and we'd love to chat.

29
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,113
Okay. So let's get started. Who has played N, N plus or N plus

30
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:35,358
plus? Awesome. Thank you. Lots of you. So for those who haven't,

31
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:40,622
N plus plus is a stylish 2D action puzzle platformer where

32
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,424
you control a tiny ninja who can run and jump.

33
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:49,273
So here is a video of a new player playing through the first set of levels in N++.

34
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:54,097
And then we'll show a video of an advanced player playing through the last set of levels

35
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:54,838
in N++.

36
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:59,121
So you don't really get a sense of what it feels like to play the game, though, and that

37
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:01,543
is part of what makes it so unique.

38
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:05,266
So if you haven't tried it, please do pick it up.

39
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:06,547
It's on PS4 right now.

40
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:09,390
We're trying to get a version for Steam done this year.

41
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,932
But in any case, hopefully this video gives you some sense of

42
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:15,394
what the style of the game is, what it looks like, and

43
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:16,415
basically how it works.

44
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:20,778
So there are thousands of levels in the game, and each

45
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,841
was painstakingly handcrafted by Reagan and I, which I will

46
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:25,962
be describing in detail.

47
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:30,686
And in each level, your goal is to touch the switch to open

48
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:33,288
the exit, and then get to the exit to beat the level.

49
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:38,148
Levels are grouped into sets of five that we call episodes,

50
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:41,409
and that lets us give a sort of dramatic arc to the levels.

51
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,391
We arranged the episodes into a 20 by five grid

52
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,011
with a difficulty gradient,

53
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:50,892
so players always have 20 episodes available

54
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:52,553
that they can play at any time,

55
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,493
and that way hopefully they don't get stuck.

56
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,963
You have 90 seconds to beat all five levels in an episode,

57
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:02,004
and collecting gold adds to your time,

58
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:03,144
which is also your score,

59
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:04,865
and that's that timer bar at the top.

60
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:09,627
And you can't attack enemies, you can only avoid them.

61
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:12,368
So you can manipulate their behavior to get around them,

62
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:14,748
but you're a pacifist, so that's really all you've got.

63
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:18,526
Okay, so even though this talk is about level design,

64
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:21,089
we need to start by just briefly discussing

65
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,611
the game design of N++,

66
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:25,255
because there's a ton of interconnectivity there,

67
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,998
and there's a lot of overlap.

68
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:30,561
Level design is heavily influenced by game design.

69
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,304
So, makes sense to go over that really quickly first.

70
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:37,844
So, generally, a game's design is the set of rules,

71
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:39,985
entities, behaviors, and relationships

72
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,105
that makes up a game.

73
00:03:41,546 --> 00:03:43,646
And that implicitly defines all the things

74
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:44,847
that can happen in a game.

75
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:47,447
So Reagan and I designed the game, too,

76
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:49,608
and that means that we know it very well.

77
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:51,369
But even if that weren't the case,

78
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:53,909
our job as level designers is first,

79
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,630
to explore that huge possibility space

80
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,131
that's latent in the game design.

81
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:02,034
so that we can discover various arrangements of elements

82
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:04,196
that produce interesting experiences

83
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:05,598
for the player to engage with.

84
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:09,081
And second, to develop a deep understanding

85
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,223
and knowledge of these elements and experiences

86
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:13,926
so that we can combine them in unique ways

87
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:15,647
that have some depth and can really

88
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:17,209
sustain the game's intrigue.

89
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:21,674
So, before we talk about how we did that specifically

90
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,777
in M++, let's just take a look at the gameplay rules

91
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:27,440
and how they influence the level design possibilities.

92
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,922
So, M++ seems really simple.

93
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:31,623
There are just three buttons.

94
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:34,546
You can run left, you can run right, and you can jump.

95
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,568
But because of the way the game works,

96
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:38,790
there's actually a lot that you can do within that.

97
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:43,150
So the biggest thing that makes N++ different

98
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,652
from other platformers is the movement model.

99
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:48,175
Movement is the essence of a platformer.

100
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,418
It's the core of the genre that has a huge influence

101
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,421
on level design because it determines

102
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,682
what the player character can do.

103
00:04:55,782 --> 00:04:59,725
So the movement model that we designed in N++ is the reason

104
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:02,208
each level feels a bit different from each other level.

105
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:05,411
And it's also why controlling the ninja doesn't feel like

106
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:06,451
controlling Mario.

107
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:08,493
So let's start there.

108
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:11,776
In most platformers, movement is trivial.

109
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:14,299
If you want to run left, you press left, and you're

110
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,360
instantly running left.

111
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,463
If you want to jump, you press jump, and you're jumping, and

112
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:19,724
that's really all there is to it.

113
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:20,985
But in N++,

114
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,908
the controls aren't that direct.

115
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:26,370
So the Ninja has a lot of inertia

116
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,812
and it takes several seconds to change direction

117
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:30,874
or to reach top speed.

118
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,096
But your top speed is really high

119
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,799
and you can outrun most of the enemies in the game.

120
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,502
So that makes it feel a lot more like a driving game

121
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:41,824
where you're constantly adjusting your velocity

122
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:45,047
and you have to develop a feel for your vehicle's momentum.

123
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:47,550
It's a pretty different experience for a platformer.

124
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,874
And it means that as a player, you always have to be anticipating the future state of the world,

125
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,536
instead of just relying on Twitch reflexes.

126
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:01,207
Jumping is also a little different in N++.

127
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,328
So instead of a single jump arc,

128
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,788
you can choose between two types of jump

129
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,049
by pressing left or right when you jump.

130
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:10,510
So if you're on an angled surface,

131
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,431
you can jump forward uphill,

132
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:15,292
or you can jump outward perpendicular to the hill.

133
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,773
And if you're on a wall, you can jump up the wall

134
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,253
or out the way from the wall.

135
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:22,274
So this is where level design matters.

136
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:25,615
It affects what jumps and moves are available to the player.

137
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:31,741
These jumping mechanics require learning and experience

138
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:34,745
to develop a feel for, but once players master them,

139
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:37,609
they have a huge amount of fine-grained control

140
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:40,433
over the ninja, and that lets them be able

141
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:42,176
to tackle more difficult challenges.

142
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:47,353
So in Mario, it's your horizontal velocity

143
00:06:47,393 --> 00:06:48,393
that affects jump height.

144
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,254
So you can jump higher by running faster.

145
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:54,096
But in M++, it's your vertical velocity

146
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:55,236
that determines jump height.

147
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:56,997
And combined with wall jumping,

148
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:59,478
this creates a feedback loop where you can build

149
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,379
a huge amount of upwards momentum

150
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,779
if you time your jumps right.

151
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,301
So there are all these little subtleties to the controls

152
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:07,782
that give players choices,

153
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:09,742
and those choices are complemented

154
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:11,843
by what's afforded by the level design.

155
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:18,007
A big component of that is the tiles that the player character collides with.

156
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:24,192
So another part of what makes N++ so different from other platformers is the set of tiles

157
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:24,892
that we designed.

158
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:30,057
In most platformers, there are just usually three types of surface that your character

159
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:30,817
can move around on.

160
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,920
Horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree angles.

161
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,841
But we didn't want to just stop there.

162
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:38,183
We wanted to build on that foundation and...

163
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,946
open up some new movement possibilities.

164
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:45,489
So we added 22.5 degree and 67.5 degree angles

165
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,010
and curved surfaces.

166
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:51,033
And that gives players more opportunities for acrobatics

167
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:53,776
and for gaining and conserving speed.

168
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:57,058
And they give level designers lots more tools

169
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,041
for creating interesting shapes and nuanced environments

170
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:01,121
that really feel distinct.

171
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,172
So the last thing that I want to mention about movement

172
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,834
is that in most platformers,

173
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:09,358
the character's collision shape is a box

174
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:11,441
and you move in pixel-sized increments.

175
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:15,707
But in N++, your character's collision shape is a circle

176
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,329
and you move in fractions of a pixel.

177
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,374
So this makes collision detection a lot more precise.

178
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,218
And it means that the game feels extremely smooth

179
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:26,762
and fluid, and there's a wide range of moves

180
00:08:26,802 --> 00:08:28,204
that players can execute.

181
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:31,148
And we tuned gravity in the simulation speed

182
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:34,172
so it feels more slow-mo, and players can actually

183
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:35,193
use that precision.

184
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:38,959
So as a result, you can develop your skills to the point

185
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:42,241
where you can pull off incredibly specific maneuvers

186
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,043
and narrowly squeeze between enemies

187
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:46,585
to fit into tiny spaces.

188
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:49,107
And then there are various expert techniques

189
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,328
that emerge out of that, like corner jumping,

190
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:53,310
which is not required to beat the game,

191
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,472
but it means that there's this whole new set of moves

192
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:59,154
that you can kind of unlock once you master the basics.

193
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:00,876
And again, it's only three buttons.

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,523
So for players, movement in N++ is a performance

195
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:08,225
that needs to be learned and mastered.

196
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,206
And that's the foundation of level design.

197
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:14,049
So our goal as designers is to have a deep understanding

198
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:15,430
of how to control the ninja,

199
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:17,512
to teach the control to players,

200
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:20,354
and then to provide a variety of different contexts

201
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:22,856
and motivations so that players can apply

202
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:25,318
what they've learned and test and expand

203
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:26,899
the boundaries of their skills.

204
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,445
Each level in M++ is sort of like a puzzle,

205
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:36,287
but as a player, you rarely have to stop and think.

206
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:38,289
It's more that your practical knowledge

207
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:39,890
is constantly being tested,

208
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,891
both how to move through the level

209
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:44,373
and what's possible in terms of movement,

210
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:45,814
given what's nearby.

211
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:49,514
So, we talked about tiles and movement.

212
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:52,376
Now let's get into the other entities in the game,

213
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:53,737
the enemies and objects.

214
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:57,180
So, to make moving around levels even more challenging,

215
00:09:57,621 --> 00:09:59,642
we added a variety of very simple enemies.

216
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:01,564
First of all, there are mines,

217
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:02,905
which are the little red dots

218
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:04,666
that you can see scattered around.

219
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,988
They're static and passive enemies,

220
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,531
and they're the main staple of N++ levels.

221
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:12,033
We use them to fine tune the possibilities

222
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:13,334
that are defined by the tiles.

223
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,542
Then there are drones, which are those little turquoise circles

224
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:18,182
moving around.

225
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:21,584
They're driven only by time, and the player

226
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:22,845
has no control over them.

227
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:24,426
So they're mostly used to generate

228
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:27,748
different patterns and rhythms of available and unavailable

229
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:28,128
space.

230
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:31,790
The other enemies are all driven in some way

231
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,071
by the ninja's position.

232
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:35,132
So they motivate players to move,

233
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:38,354
and they do that with various types of chasing and seeking

234
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:39,354
and shooting behaviors.

235
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,234
So since movement is constrained by the tiles

236
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,857
and the mines and the other enemies,

237
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:49,163
negotiating this constantly shifting set of constraints

238
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:51,185
is the main activity the players perform.

239
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:55,488
The last ones are toggle minds and evil ninjas.

240
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:57,690
And they're special because they're overtly

241
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,173
about the player's past actions affecting

242
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,135
available future actions.

243
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,197
And they transform areas of the level

244
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:05,338
that you've already moved through.

245
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,301
So toggle minds are safe to pass through once

246
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:09,462
before they become deadly.

247
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:12,245
And evil ninjas are evil clones of you

248
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:15,308
that do exactly what you did two seconds after you did it.

249
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:18,455
So that can be a little bit difficult for players

250
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:20,537
because it's way more complex

251
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:22,640
than any of the other AI in the game.

252
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,363
So evil ninjas are very challenging enemies,

253
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,486
but they're also very intriguing

254
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:29,969
because they're different every time you encounter them.

255
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:34,433
So then there are objects, which are all tools

256
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,215
that either shape the space the ninja can move through,

257
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:40,057
or let the player manipulate the ninja's motion

258
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:42,800
beyond what's normally available running and jumping.

259
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,022
So we have launch pads that shoot you into the air,

260
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:49,045
bounce blocks that slingshot you in various directions,

261
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:52,527
boost pads that double your current velocity

262
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,408
as you move through them,

263
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:56,150
one-way platforms that block your movement

264
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,391
in a particular direction,

265
00:11:57,832 --> 00:12:00,033
and then there are doors that you can lock and unlock.

266
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,080
So, because the enemy and object behaviors

267
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,722
all relate to the ninja's position,

268
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:08,025
each level is essentially a mechanism

269
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:10,469
that is indirectly controlled by the player

270
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:11,691
as they move the ninja.

271
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,156
And as designers, our job is to make sure

272
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:18,180
that that's intriguing and fun to navigate and manipulate.

273
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:22,590
So one major way that we try to do that in N++

274
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,472
is we try to add many paths through the level

275
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:26,892
so that players have options

276
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:28,694
and they can find one that works for them.

277
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:31,796
This is another thing that makes N++ different

278
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:33,597
from other hard platformers

279
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:36,859
because they tend to prefer a single fixed route

280
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,060
through the level that the player

281
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,561
just has to execute perfectly.

282
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:41,743
But creating a variety of routes

283
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:44,525
is a really important part of how we design levels

284
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,027
and I'm gonna go into a lot of detail on that in a bit.

285
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:52,413
So the last part of the game design that I want to talk

286
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:55,076
about is the single screen presentation.

287
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:59,702
So each level, as you can see in N plus Plus, is all on one

288
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:02,585
screen, and that contributes to the puzzle elements of the

289
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,028
game's design, and it lets players see

290
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:06,010
everything all at once.

291
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:11,531
So the graphics of the game really need to support the design in order for both to work well.

292
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:17,655
And we designed the graphics of N++ to encourage players to look at a level and read it really quickly

293
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:21,718
without much conscious effort so that they can get a feel for the possibilities

294
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,941
and plan a route and then just start anticipating what will happen on it.

295
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:30,486
So we chose a minimal visual aesthetic for N++ that was

296
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:33,711
functional, extremely functional, and as stylish as

297
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:34,852
we could make it.

298
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,338
And we made sure to be consistent about identifying

299
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,202
dangerous entities and safe ones with color and shape.

300
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:43,999
Because the game is so challenging,

301
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:47,481
we need to keep visual design simple so that players are not

302
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:49,462
overly distracted or overwhelmed,

303
00:13:49,582 --> 00:13:51,743
because that would make the game incredibly frustrating.

304
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:55,144
And making the state of the world obvious and clear

305
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,926
lets us push the complexity of level design

306
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:00,327
to extremes that would be way too hard to read

307
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,788
if the graphics were any more ornate.

308
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:04,809
So here's an example of what I mean by that.

309
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:08,866
This is the sort of thing that would just be impossible

310
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:10,326
if the graphics weren't so simple.

311
00:14:10,606 --> 00:14:13,127
Because as it is, it pushes right up to the limits

312
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,607
of what you're able to parse and focus on as a player.

313
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:17,567
There's a lot going on in that level,

314
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,648
and you have to kind of be on your toes all the time.

315
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:23,669
So that's the basic game design.

316
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:25,409
Now that we've gone over how the game works,

317
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,449
I can get into level design and talk about

318
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,590
our process for designing variety.

319
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,870
AKA, how do we keep players interested

320
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,370
when there are thousands of levels?

321
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:40,887
So the basic process is, we make levels, we test them,

322
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:44,369
we refine them, we revise them, we retest them,

323
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:46,310
and then when we think they're done,

324
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,131
we rank them for difficulty,

325
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:50,332
and we order them into episodes,

326
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:52,873
and arrange the episodes into a grid.

327
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,974
So this process takes a tremendous amount of time,

328
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:58,355
and we pretty much just edit and refine levels

329
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:01,537
from the start right to the end when we ship the game.

330
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:05,830
That's okay though, because N++ is a game that lives and dies

331
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,371
by the quality of its levels, so if they sucked,

332
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,231
this game would not be special at all.

333
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,993
So the first step in the level design pipeline

334
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:15,593
is coming up with new ideas.

335
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:18,734
Making new levels is something that we did constantly

336
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:20,255
throughout the entire project.

337
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:22,015
Sometimes for months at a time,

338
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:25,176
and others when we just had a free day here and there.

339
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:29,776
So it's a collaborative effort, but Reagan and I both make

340
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:32,919
levels individually, and then we pass them back and forth,

341
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:35,102
which is really useful.

342
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:38,946
Because if a person is stuck on how to make a particular

343
00:15:38,986 --> 00:15:42,370
design work, often the other person has fresh eyes and good

344
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,492
ideas about how to approach it.

345
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,433
So the goal, generally, is to create levels that are as

346
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:52,316
different from each other as possible so that we can ensure

347
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:54,558
playing the game is interesting and varied and it

348
00:15:54,598 --> 00:15:55,239
doesn't get old.

349
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:59,623
So the ways that levels can be different are the general

350
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:03,106
difficulty of the level, the length and duration of the

351
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:06,389
level, the types of movement required by the player,

352
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,551
whether you're traveling mostly vertically or

353
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:10,813
horizontally or a mix.

354
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:14,072
whether there are lots of flat surfaces

355
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:15,613
or mostly angled surfaces,

356
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,374
the types and combinations of enemies

357
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:19,595
and objects in the level,

358
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:21,855
the various types of pacing,

359
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:24,477
whether the level peaks at the beginning, middle, or end,

360
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:27,918
the types of skills required on the part of the player.

361
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:29,779
Do you have to be really patient

362
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,459
or do you have to have great reflexes

363
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,100
or be good at higher level planning?

364
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,921
The types of space in the level,

365
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:38,602
whether it's more wide open

366
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:40,983
or it's more full of narrow hallways.

367
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:43,665
and the use of space in the level.

368
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:45,286
So is it more of a linear level?

369
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:46,827
Is it kind of a there and back?

370
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,348
Is it an open unstructured space?

371
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:52,691
Or is it kind of a hub and spoke situation?

372
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:56,133
So there are lots of ways that structurally and visually

373
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:57,454
levels can be distinct.

374
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,116
And the main way that we find new ideas

375
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,657
is really just by sketching and playing around in the editor

376
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:03,738
and seeing what happens.

377
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:07,698
We figured that we would gradually learn the nuances

378
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:09,058
of game design through play.

379
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:12,079
So for us, the process is enjoyable and low stress,

380
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,441
and we can develop and expand our vocabulary naturally.

381
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,342
Generally, we try to be really careful

382
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:19,902
about what we add to a level,

383
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,583
and ensure that absolutely everything has a clear purpose.

384
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:24,904
And we try to make sure that both aesthetics

385
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:26,545
and gameplay are highlighted,

386
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,925
because we really like a balance.

387
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:32,090
So here's a finished level so you can see how it works.

388
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,072
The goal is to ride those thwomps,

389
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:37,273
which is the little square enemies

390
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,234
that are traveling from right to left.

391
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:42,335
And you need to avoid all of the mines

392
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,276
and drones and that laser,

393
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,618
and try to get up to the exit in the top right-hand corner.

394
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:50,540
It's not as easy as it looks.

395
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:54,005
So here is a frame by frame recording

396
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:55,146
of that level being made.

397
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:58,027
And you can see that we started with the basic idea

398
00:17:58,187 --> 00:18:01,168
of the player needing to traverse the screen

399
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:02,029
on those slumps.

400
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,110
And then we played around with the spacing of the enemies

401
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,871
to find something that worked really well.

402
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:09,292
And just started developing the rest of the level

403
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:09,892
around that.

404
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:11,993
So what the space that you're moving through

405
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:12,854
really looks like.

406
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,635
And after every screenshot, what you're not seeing

407
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:16,716
is that we play test.

408
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:20,117
And so that we know how the changes that we're making

409
00:18:20,197 --> 00:18:20,857
affect the level.

410
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:23,459
And that's one of the great things about our editor,

411
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,819
is that you can just switch back and forth really quickly

412
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:28,200
between developing the level and testing it.

413
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,201
So it makes that process really easy.

414
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,463
Here's another level that's more open,

415
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:37,464
and it's focused on the idea of avoiding

416
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:38,844
a whole swarm of death balls,

417
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:40,925
which are those purple circles

418
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:42,726
that are coming out on the left there.

419
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:52,115
And here is an example of refining a sketch into a first

420
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:54,837
draft. So again, you can see we started with the idea of an open

421
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:57,359
space and some death balls and then we just play around with

422
00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:02,143
the placement and we add some mines and gold and further define

423
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:05,385
the roots in the level and then we polish the tiles a bit. So

424
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:08,068
here we're just loosely playing around with things to figure out

425
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:14,212
what works and what we want to keep. So...

426
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:17,531
In order to create levels that are really difficult from each

427
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,813
other, we try to approach level design from

428
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:20,994
many different angles.

429
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:24,777
We really find that the process influences the results, and

430
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:25,838
you get out what you put in.

431
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,661
Also, you never know where inspiration will come from, so

432
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,062
we really try to be open-minded.

433
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:34,499
So sometimes we start with an evocative level name

434
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,420
and just try to think about what kind of level

435
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,340
would match that name.

436
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,921
Sometimes we look to architecture.

437
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:42,142
We find that the exteriors of buildings,

438
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:45,363
as well as the floor plans, are huge sources

439
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:46,324
of interesting shapes.

440
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:49,345
Sometimes you're just making a level

441
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:52,046
and you have an idea for another level.

442
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:53,366
It's like a happy accident.

443
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,947
And sometimes we just sketch in the editor

444
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,208
until we find shapes that feel like

445
00:19:58,228 --> 00:19:59,629
they might be interesting to move through.

446
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,088
So we have a lot of different strategies.

447
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,631
And something that we found really useful

448
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:06,393
is keeping an in-progress file,

449
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:09,236
which for us by now is filled with thousands of levels.

450
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:12,239
But often an initial idea doesn't totally work,

451
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:14,562
but there's something there that's interesting

452
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,504
that you can build on or use later.

453
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:20,088
So here's an example of an in-progress sketch.

454
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:21,750
You can see it's totally not done.

455
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:26,296
We were just trying to figure out different toggle patterns,

456
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:28,659
a grid arrangement of mines and bounce blocks,

457
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,262
and we were just getting a sense of what players can do.

458
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:33,906
But we couldn't really find how it was gonna turn

459
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:35,748
into a finished level, so we just left it.

460
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:39,908
And this is great because new stuff from scratch

461
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:42,069
feels a lot different than when you're working

462
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,410
with in progress fragments.

463
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:46,012
So trying to fix or rearrange things

464
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:47,853
is a really different creative challenge

465
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,154
than coming up with new ideas.

466
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:50,695
And that means that you can alternate

467
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:53,317
between the two approaches and not get as tired.

468
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:58,783
This is an example of a sketch that was in progress for a bit,

469
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:01,904
and then we finished it and put it into the final game.

470
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:05,886
So it starts as just a really plain idea, a very simple space

471
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:08,047
with a few fun movement possibilities.

472
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,809
And then we developed it further into a first draft version,

473
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:15,311
and then we, oh, where we expanded the level

474
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:16,671
around that initial space.

475
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:20,053
And then finally, we tweaked the placement of a few things

476
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,814
and polished it a little bit, added some embellishments,

477
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:24,755
and put it into the final game.

478
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:28,864
So having this file of in progress ideas

479
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:35,245
really let us feel free to try new level ideas

480
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:37,586
without inhibition because we didn't have to stress

481
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:38,966
about an idea working or not.

482
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,867
Or we didn't get hung up on trying to make it work

483
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:44,147
because if it doesn't work, you can just throw it

484
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:45,748
into the bin and come back to it later.

485
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:51,114
In practice, most of the in-progress levels never actually make it out of the bin, but

486
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:55,617
psychologically it's nice to have it there so that you don't feel bad about failing or

487
00:21:55,677 --> 00:21:56,538
wasting time.

488
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,921
And especially when you're dealing with this volume of work, being productive is often

489
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:06,165
about managing your expectations and keeping yourself motivated, and having the freedom

490
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:09,968
to just scrap an idea at any point really helped keep things moving.

491
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,120
Okay, so once a level seems good enough,

492
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,601
which is just a gut feeling,

493
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,922
we think the idea is solid and we sit down

494
00:22:18,982 --> 00:22:19,962
and go through it together.

495
00:22:20,162 --> 00:22:21,262
So whoever made the level,

496
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:22,743
the other person would play through it.

497
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:24,583
And this is a really fun dynamic

498
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:26,984
because you kind of naturally want to impress

499
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:28,644
or surprise the other person.

500
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:33,246
Overall, we approach making levels as a collaboration

501
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:35,506
and we pass things back and forth

502
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:39,367
and talk about problems or potential that exists

503
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:40,448
or we just talk about...

504
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:43,963
what the other person has created

505
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:45,724
and why it might be interesting or not.

506
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:48,905
So generally we find this a terrific method

507
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:52,346
for generating a diverse and varied set of levels

508
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:53,727
because we're both individuals

509
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,607
and we each have our own tastes and interests

510
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:58,488
but we can team up to cover a much wider range

511
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:01,770
and compensate for each other's weaknesses or blind spots.

512
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:06,227
So the main focus of this early review together

513
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,908
is to rank the difficulty and to rate the quality

514
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:11,389
of each level, which is data that we use later

515
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:13,430
when we're organizing them into episodes

516
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,791
and putting that in the grid.

517
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:19,333
So our quality rating is just a scale from zero to two,

518
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:21,894
and it's based on the specialness of a level,

519
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:24,416
which really is just, does this stand out

520
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:26,176
compared to an average level?

521
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:30,060
And it's very subjective, it's just a gut feeling.

522
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,302
And being able to determine what we would consider

523
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:36,125
specialness is just developed over time

524
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,527
with our experience playing and designing the game.

525
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:41,209
So here's an example of a zero level.

526
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,832
It's fun but it's just kind of repetitive

527
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:47,174
and it would really need some editing

528
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:49,576
to add a bit of variation and interest to it.

529
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,617
So this level either needs more work

530
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:52,738
or we should just cut it.

531
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:56,457
Here's an example of a one quality level.

532
00:23:56,877 --> 00:23:58,598
So it's relatively plain and simple.

533
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:02,960
It has some varied options for movement and it looks nice.

534
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,781
It's good but it's not exceptional

535
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,462
and this is really important.

536
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:09,423
It doesn't have to be any better than this.

537
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:11,884
You do not want all your levels to be twos,

538
00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:13,344
because that gets exhausting,

539
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:15,405
both as a player and as a designer.

540
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:18,045
Dynamics are really important here.

541
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:21,086
So just like in music, where the quiet parts of a song

542
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:24,348
help the loud parts to feel even louder and more impactful,

543
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:27,108
relatively ordinary levels like this one

544
00:24:27,288 --> 00:24:29,629
help the exciting ones feel even more exciting.

545
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,751
So here is an example of a two.

546
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,717
Oh, sorry, PowerPoint's a bit buggy on this computer.

547
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:38,898
This is a two.

548
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:40,000
It's very different.

549
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:41,902
There's lots going on.

550
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:43,163
It's relatively long.

551
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,067
And it features two completely different sections,

552
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:48,189
one of which is entirely optional.

553
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,592
So there's lots for players to do here

554
00:24:50,912 --> 00:24:52,695
and lots of interesting situations

555
00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:53,856
they can get themselves into.

556
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:54,857
So that's great.

557
00:24:57,255 --> 00:24:58,876
This is our difficulty scale.

558
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:01,338
So it's a rank from zero to seven,

559
00:25:01,878 --> 00:25:04,000
and we base that on our estimate of the skill

560
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,781
and knowledge required to beat the level.

561
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:07,802
We're always trying to find that sweet spot

562
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:09,864
where a level is just challenging enough

563
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:11,265
that it requires effort,

564
00:25:11,565 --> 00:25:13,706
and it feels really satisfying when you complete it,

565
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:15,308
but it's not too frustrating.

566
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,169
Players always need to know that they can do it.

567
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,051
Maybe they just need a bit more practice

568
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:21,452
or to try it a few more times,

569
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:23,653
but they can get there.

570
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:26,455
So our eight-point scale really helps us.

571
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:29,176
figure out where levels need to be in the order.

572
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:31,978
And again, completely subjective measurement.

573
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:34,159
We both vote and then we average the results.

574
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,100
And we don't really get too hung up

575
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,261
with finding that perfect rating immediately,

576
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:40,282
which we think is also important.

577
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:43,084
Because if we try to make things perfect all at once,

578
00:25:43,824 --> 00:25:46,085
we grind to a halt and we just focus on that.

579
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:49,087
So instead, we find that if we make things better

580
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,568
incrementally, we eventually get close enough to perfection.

581
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,910
So a lot of this process for us relies on gut feelings.

582
00:25:57,887 --> 00:26:00,931
The next step of the pipeline and the main level design task

583
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:02,433
in Ed++ is editing.

584
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:06,157
So we constantly played through the entire archive of levels,

585
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,361
refining them, improving them, and sometimes cutting.

586
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:14,637
This kind of playtesting led to our tough but fair level design style.

587
00:26:15,178 --> 00:26:23,368
Because we played through the levels so many times that anything that's overly frustrating or clunky or just unfair

588
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:28,454
naturally gets smoothed out because those parts annoy us and we cut them or we fix them.

589
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,290
So the idea behind our editing process parallels the game.

590
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,151
Most M++ levels are really short

591
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:38,012
and they take less than a minute to beat.

592
00:26:38,812 --> 00:26:41,374
And it gets exhausting and boring to work on

593
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,235
the same level for hours at a time.

594
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,616
So we took our cues from playing the game

595
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:47,917
and instead we split the hours of editing

596
00:26:47,937 --> 00:26:50,458
across many different passes.

597
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:52,960
And we iterate quickly through every single level

598
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,181
again and again instead of doing a few large passes.

599
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,571
We focused on one specific task at a time.

600
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:04,152
So for example, the placement of gold in all the levels.

601
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:07,293
Because as you look at that one task

602
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:10,113
over thousands of levels, you get really good

603
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:12,114
at understanding all the nuances of it.

604
00:27:12,494 --> 00:27:14,894
But if you were constantly switching focus

605
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,815
and looking at many different issues on each level,

606
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:19,995
you get distracted and you miss things.

607
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:22,356
And you might never really develop

608
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:24,256
as much insight into each element.

609
00:27:25,384 --> 00:27:27,669
And then when you return to a level on the next pass,

610
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,036
which is much later, you have a better idea

611
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:33,421
of how everything fits together and you're fresher.

612
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:36,086
So generally, it's been great.

613
00:27:37,396 --> 00:27:39,337
Well, one warning about that iterative approach

614
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:42,758
is that you can end up overdoing things

615
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:45,259
because it's really hard to figure out when to stop.

616
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,260
So near the end of development,

617
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,620
we reviewed all of the levels,

618
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,861
and we realized that a lot of that beautiful simplicity

619
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:54,242
that we love so much had totally been lost,

620
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:56,763
and things weren't really very minimal anymore,

621
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,004
which is something that we love,

622
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,285
because we just messed with them too much.

623
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:02,485
So here's an example of that.

624
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,646
This is Occam's laser.

625
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:17,919
And the initial level is based around a series of jumps between platforms with some lasers that interfere with your jumps and force you to jump at certain times.

626
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:27,049
So we played around with that a lot and we added some variety and we kept adding more and more and more embellishments until that simple idea was totally lost.

627
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:31,232
So we dialed it back a bunch and we kept the original idea

628
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:34,595
but also added some of that nice variation back.

629
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,139
This is where having good tools really saved us.

630
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,043
Our level archive contained every single version

631
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:43,725
of a level that we'd ever made.

632
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:48,730
So we could make a case by case decision to revert or not.

633
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:52,858
So one thing to note though, getting carried away with the

634
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,000
edits actually ended up being a good thing for us because it

635
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,962
helped to inspire the secret levels, which I am really

636
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:00,843
excited to get to in just a moment.

637
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:04,205
So the last important step in making levels

638
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,145
is naming the level.

639
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:09,068
Meaningful level names is a way for us to add another

640
00:29:09,108 --> 00:29:12,250
dimension to a level and make the experience more rich than

641
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,731
like level number 967 would be.

642
00:29:16,032 --> 00:29:17,593
So this is Bullshit Mountain.

643
00:29:18,984 --> 00:29:20,586
And this is an example of a level name

644
00:29:20,606 --> 00:29:22,147
that we think really works.

645
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:24,410
It's unique, it's silly,

646
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:26,233
and it signals something to the player.

647
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:28,876
So there are a few really tricky parts in this level

648
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:31,359
and the title lets players know that that's intentional.

649
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:32,861
It's not really a mistake on our part.

650
00:29:33,742 --> 00:29:35,744
And it hopefully undercuts the frustration

651
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:37,046
that they're going to experience

652
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:38,308
with a little bit of levity.

653
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:44,510
Level design is kind of like cooking,

654
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,471
so you have to constantly taste the food

655
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:47,652
to know how it's coming together.

656
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:50,494
But that also makes you get used to the flavor.

657
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:52,335
And since we've been playing this game

658
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,157
for more than 10 years, it makes it really hard

659
00:29:55,177 --> 00:29:56,958
for us to keep an objective perspective

660
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:58,579
on the difficulty of each level.

661
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,181
But difficulty is something that you wanna be able

662
00:30:01,221 --> 00:30:03,703
to craft and sculpt and really control.

663
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:06,224
So it's crucial to have a good understanding of it

664
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,326
so that you can use it effectively as a tool.

665
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:14,019
We have a number of strategies, but the main one is showing the game during development

666
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:14,599
at events.

667
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,605
Her experience with showing the game is we watch horrified as no one can make it past

668
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:26,111
even the easiest levels, and then we go home and we tone down the difficulty of everything.

669
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:29,053
And then the same thing happens at the next show,

670
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:32,495
and the next one, but eventually we've refined it

671
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,456
a bit more and smoothed out everything

672
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:38,258
so that finally people can actually play it.

673
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:39,298
And it's still really hard,

674
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:41,700
but at least the difficulty curve is smoother.

675
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,682
So this whole process of making levels is iterative,

676
00:30:45,702 --> 00:30:46,862
and we think that's necessary

677
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:49,584
because there's just way too much to focus on all at once.

678
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:52,745
Okay, so that's the basics of level design.

679
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,707
Now we can talk about the really fun, more complex stuff.

680
00:30:56,643 --> 00:30:58,352
So, as we make levels.

681
00:30:59,312 --> 00:31:01,573
We're trying to consider what the player's thinking

682
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:02,793
and feeling as they play.

683
00:31:03,213 --> 00:31:04,714
Because aside from designing spaces,

684
00:31:04,854 --> 00:31:06,915
of course we're also designing experiences.

685
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:10,136
Reggie and I really try to be sympathetic to the player,

686
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:12,457
while at the same time we want to challenge them

687
00:31:12,757 --> 00:31:13,758
as much as possible.

688
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,199
Because ultimately we want them to succeed

689
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:18,400
and feel proud of their hard earned skills.

690
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,901
N++ is a tough game, but what's fun about it

691
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,082
is how satisfying it feels to get through

692
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:25,523
the challenges that you're up against.

693
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,264
So we really want every player to be able to feel that.

694
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,462
And it's not just one player that we have to consider.

695
00:31:31,862 --> 00:31:33,243
It's a whole lot of different ones,

696
00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:35,825
and they each have different talents and personalities.

697
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:38,347
So a big part of our job as designers

698
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:40,528
is understanding players and giving them ways

699
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,069
that they can be themselves.

700
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,351
So in order to support and accommodate

701
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:47,253
a wide range of skills and techniques,

702
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:49,975
one thing that we do is to design multiple routes

703
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:51,015
through each level.

704
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:55,178
So let's take a look at routes using one example.

705
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,474
This is Trivium Reactor.

706
00:31:59,655 --> 00:32:02,696
And the first path that we're gonna show you

707
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,317
is the just beat the level route.

708
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:08,340
So there's a line here, but it's not a specific line

709
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,101
that you have to stay on, it's really just

710
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:12,422
to sort of illustrate what we're talking about.

711
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:15,364
There's a huge amount of looseness and flexibility there

712
00:32:15,504 --> 00:32:18,246
so that players have the opportunity to be creative.

713
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:20,107
That's something that we think is really important.

714
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,323
So, this is the Just Beat the Level route.

715
00:32:23,423 --> 00:32:25,605
It's the most basic and the easiest route.

716
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:29,148
And we try to support a range of Just Beat the Level routes,

717
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:31,850
which does happen naturally a lot of the time

718
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,912
if you don't constrain the solution too much.

719
00:32:34,593 --> 00:32:37,536
So expert players naturally just try to blaze through

720
00:32:37,596 --> 00:32:39,457
tricky sections as quickly as possible.

721
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,861
And novice players try to move through them slowly

722
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,382
and they can do that relatively safely.

723
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,214
So doing this this way lets players modulate

724
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:51,240
the difficulty themselves in an organic way

725
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,964
and they feel empowered to do so,

726
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,649
which we think is a big part of game design.

727
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:01,122
The other main type of route is the all gold route.

728
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,783
So in N++, we give you a badge for collecting

729
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:04,923
all the gold in a level.

730
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:08,083
And we design the all gold routes as a bonus

731
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:10,964
for advanced players, either to make their first

732
00:33:11,044 --> 00:33:14,225
play through more interesting, or just as an extra

733
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:16,145
challenge that they can return to later.

734
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:18,665
So we think that this is interesting because,

735
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,746
again, it gives players agency.

736
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,226
It's a difficulty mode that you don't have to choose

737
00:33:23,306 --> 00:33:25,687
from a menu, you can just try for the all gold

738
00:33:25,907 --> 00:33:28,087
and you can abandon your plan if it's too hard.

739
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:29,513
Come back to it later.

740
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:33,814
All gold routes typically involve longer,

741
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:37,576
more difficult routes than just beating the level.

742
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:40,177
So you can see here that the all gold route

743
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:42,618
involves going around the level twice

744
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:44,618
and then there's a pretty tricky jump at the top.

745
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:48,020
So some of these challenges are already notorious

746
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,381
among fans for being marathon tests of skill and patience

747
00:33:53,182 --> 00:33:54,482
and really stress management.

748
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,986
So, this is the Lunatic device,

749
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:02,351
which is another example of us telling the player

750
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:03,532
what they're in for.

751
00:34:04,353 --> 00:34:06,336
And this level is pretty easy to beat,

752
00:34:06,456 --> 00:34:10,522
but the all gold route is extremely difficult.

753
00:34:10,622 --> 00:34:11,644
It is optional, but.

754
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:13,365
It's quite a challenge.

755
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,386
This one took Man Vs. Game three entire hours to beat.

756
00:34:17,186 --> 00:34:20,727
And I really wish I had sound for the video clip

757
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,528
that I'm going to show.

758
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:23,668
But you can find it on YouTube.

759
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:26,589
And hopefully, it's funny enough without the sound.

760
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:28,210
But this is what happened when he finally beat it.

761
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:43,501
It's so good.

762
00:34:46,223 --> 00:34:48,765
Yeah, so it's a tough game.

763
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:51,287
So this is the last path that I want to talk about.

764
00:34:51,307 --> 00:34:52,708
It's the secret challenge path.

765
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:56,630
They are very devious and they're extreme challenges

766
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,291
that we made for expert players.

767
00:34:59,092 --> 00:35:01,934
And we hid them in plain sight within the levels themselves.

768
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:04,395
So the secret challenges are only unlocked

769
00:35:04,555 --> 00:35:06,116
once you've beaten the game and you've collected

770
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:07,457
a lot of all gold badges.

771
00:35:07,877 --> 00:35:10,019
And they usually force players to unlearn

772
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,880
all of their previous successful routes

773
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,821
and approach things really differently.

774
00:35:14,502 --> 00:35:17,263
So, in this example, the secret challenge is to touch

775
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:21,005
all of the toggle mines without touching any of the gold.

776
00:35:21,525 --> 00:35:23,346
And figuring out how to do that includes

777
00:35:23,386 --> 00:35:24,507
a bit of a sneaky trick.

778
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:28,189
So one of the mines in the top right is slightly misplaced,

779
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,290
which creates a slightly larger gap

780
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,091
that you can just barely pass through.

781
00:35:32,952 --> 00:35:35,533
We only use this slightly misplaced object trick

782
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:38,194
twice in 600 levels, so it's not something

783
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,676
that players are expecting, and that makes it even cooler

784
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,056
when they see it and they figure out

785
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,177
what it is they're supposed to do.

786
00:35:44,932 --> 00:35:46,973
Okay, now I'm gonna talk a bit more about secret challenges

787
00:35:46,993 --> 00:35:48,975
because they're brand new to the series

788
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:51,757
and we're super excited about them and really proud of them.

789
00:35:52,798 --> 00:35:54,980
So these are some videos from YouTube

790
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:58,403
of a streamer doing some secret challenges.

791
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:01,706
And in both of the videos, the secret challenge

792
00:36:01,746 --> 00:36:03,307
was to touch all the toggle mines

793
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:04,788
without touching any of the gold.

794
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,991
And you can see that the routes are incredibly difficult

795
00:36:08,511 --> 00:36:10,153
and they really require moving around

796
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:12,114
in ways that feel almost wrong.

797
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:16,714
So what happened during development was we sometimes got

798
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:18,535
bored while we were testing levels.

799
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:20,798
We started inventing weird goals like,

800
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:22,659
I wonder if I could beat this level

801
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:24,221
without getting any of the gold.

802
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:26,683
Or like, I wonder if I could toggle

803
00:36:27,223 --> 00:36:28,865
all the mines and survive.

804
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:30,887
And it turned out to be pretty interesting.

805
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:37,031
So the secret challenges came out of us finding these hidden potentialities and then polishing

806
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:43,997
them into fun experiences. And we made them for hardcore fans but also for ourselves because

807
00:36:44,017 --> 00:36:49,002
they're so weird and different. They give us something to be excited about even after such a

808
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:49,542
long time.

809
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:53,934
A lot of the time, secrets in games don't really have

810
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:55,355
a lot to do with the game itself.

811
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,237
They're just an unrelated surface layer.

812
00:36:57,797 --> 00:36:59,259
But we wanted to follow the example

813
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:01,420
of Super Mario World secrets,

814
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,543
which really show how magical and transformative it can be

815
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:07,906
when the secrets are integrated right into the very core

816
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:08,927
of the game's design.

817
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:14,646
So, we have the secret challenges that emerge from the level design, and then there are

818
00:37:14,686 --> 00:37:18,349
secret levels, which are unlocked when you beat enough secret challenges.

819
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:24,275
Just like the secret world in Super Mario World, the secret levels in N++ are dramatically

820
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:28,359
different from the normal levels, and they subvert all the normal design rules that we

821
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:32,262
use and really push everything to the extreme, which was pretty exciting for us.

822
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:37,799
So M++ secret levels are all remixes of existing levels,

823
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:40,481
and like I mentioned before, when we were editing,

824
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:43,684
we realized we'd sort of taken it too far in some cases,

825
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:46,145
and all of that elegant minimalism

826
00:37:46,185 --> 00:37:48,087
that we love so much was totally gone.

827
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,712
But the new stuff that we were doing was also really

828
00:37:51,912 --> 00:37:54,154
exciting, it was just a bit weird.

829
00:37:54,874 --> 00:37:58,336
So making secret levels was a way for us to take these

830
00:37:58,397 --> 00:38:02,019
weird offshoots and push them even further and give them

831
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,040
a place in the game that felt like it fit

832
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:05,341
and didn't feel gimmicky.

833
00:38:06,582 --> 00:38:09,184
So for example, this is Orbital Habitat.

834
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:11,125
We really liked how this one looked.

835
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:13,827
This is just a normal level, like a regular level.

836
00:38:14,488 --> 00:38:17,090
And we liked how it felt to move through the space.

837
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,611
But then when we were editing.

838
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:26,699
We ended up adding all these additional flourishes, which were fun, but they totally destroyed the elegance that we felt the original version had.

839
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:30,601
So, we reverted to the old version and put that one in the game.

840
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:38,665
And then later, when we were making the secret levels, we took that overcooked version and we just kept going with it until it looked like this.

841
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:43,531
So the secret level version is even more complicated.

842
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:45,032
It's totally not minimal.

843
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,555
And the all gold and secret challenge routes

844
00:38:47,735 --> 00:38:48,996
are incredibly involved.

845
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:51,278
They're really long, they're quite difficult,

846
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,541
and they have a few tricky moves

847
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:56,204
and require some sequence breaking to accomplish.

848
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:57,645
But that's what makes them

849
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:59,567
so incredibly satisfying to complete.

850
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:04,490
So, like I said before, the process really influences

851
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,554
the results, and our process for making secret levels

852
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,639
was totally different than for making regular levels.

853
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,543
And that really helped them feel special.

854
00:39:14,582 --> 00:39:17,525
So, we would strip out everything but the tiles

855
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,347
from an existing regular level,

856
00:39:19,988 --> 00:39:21,649
and then we'd manipulate them in some way.

857
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,051
So we would rotate them,

858
00:39:23,431 --> 00:39:25,933
or swap the solid and empty space.

859
00:39:26,274 --> 00:39:29,077
We would often just copy and paste fragments

860
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:30,158
all over the level.

861
00:39:30,698 --> 00:39:32,700
Basically keep working with the tiles

862
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,083
until we generated some new shapes that felt interesting.

863
00:39:37,328 --> 00:39:38,849
And this approach was really different.

864
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:42,271
It turned level design into kind of a game or puzzle for us.

865
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:44,513
So, like you have this set of tiles,

866
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:45,273
what can you do with it?

867
00:39:45,353 --> 00:39:48,115
What can you come up with that makes it feel different

868
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:50,216
but maybe still references the original?

869
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,401
Here's an example of a secret level where we took the

870
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:58,702
original level, and we inverted it, and then we flipped it

871
00:39:58,742 --> 00:40:01,182
vertically, and we used that as the basis for a level.

872
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:05,703
So this is actually the last level in N++, and it's a very

873
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:07,043
tricky sequence puzzle.

874
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:11,404
So there are tons of different options for where you can jump

875
00:40:11,504 --> 00:40:15,125
to and from, but all of the sequences but one end up

876
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:16,405
trapping you on the way back.

877
00:40:17,186 --> 00:40:19,726
So three people in the world have beaten

878
00:40:19,746 --> 00:40:20,446
this level right now.

879
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:23,027
It's a tough one.

880
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:29,190
So since the foundation of secret levels was already there,

881
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:32,612
we could put our time into making extremely complex

882
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:34,733
and involved enemy and object designs,

883
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:37,475
and especially for the all gold and secret challenge routes,

884
00:40:37,955 --> 00:40:39,396
because secret levels have those too.

885
00:40:40,577 --> 00:40:43,118
So here's another example of a secret level being made.

886
00:40:43,578 --> 00:40:45,439
You can see that we start with the original level,

887
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:47,660
and then we just kind of start playing with it

888
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,081
and trying various things.

889
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:50,102
We took it, oh.

890
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:53,730
You can't see that right now.

891
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:56,837
Is it playing?

892
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,145
OK, well, anyway, so we.

893
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:05,310
This level especially was quite complex.

894
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:10,215
It ends up being really, really intricate and difficult.

895
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:13,499
And there are so many options and sequences

896
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:16,862
of events in the final level that it's quite bewildering.

897
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:19,625
And that's sort of what makes it feel so refreshingly different

898
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,989
from the other minimal kind of elegant levels.

899
00:41:26,506 --> 00:41:26,866
What's that?

900
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:29,229
All right, I'll just keep going.

901
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,912
Okay, so that's the practical stuff,

902
00:41:32,873 --> 00:41:36,297
but there's a more considerate side to level design too,

903
00:41:36,357 --> 00:41:38,720
and we think that that really helps make the game

904
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,861
and the levels memorable.

905
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,530
So, as we design levels, we try to teach players

906
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,291
the concepts and keep them interested in

907
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:47,933
bettering their skills and taking on new challenges.

908
00:41:48,694 --> 00:41:51,076
But we really try to think about why people are playing

909
00:41:51,156 --> 00:41:52,457
and what they might be thinking.

910
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:55,820
Our philosophy is that levels are a kind of conversation

911
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,041
that you're having with the player.

912
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:00,384
We want that conversation to be playful and intriguing

913
00:42:00,524 --> 00:42:03,867
and constructive and loose, but never bullying or mean.

914
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:05,968
N++ is really difficult.

915
00:42:06,269 --> 00:42:08,370
If it were unfair or it took cheap shots,

916
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,691
it would just be infuriating.

917
00:42:11,102 --> 00:42:13,564
And this is where repetition in level design

918
00:42:13,604 --> 00:42:14,545
can be really helpful,

919
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,207
because it helps players learn

920
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:17,868
without being constantly frustrated.

921
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:20,250
It allows them to recognize situations

922
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,391
that they've been in before,

923
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:23,273
and then apply the skills that they've learned.

924
00:42:23,973 --> 00:42:26,095
You just need to be careful that the repetition

925
00:42:26,155 --> 00:42:27,817
is more like theme and variation,

926
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:30,719
instead of the exact same situation over and over.

927
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,845
So here, hopefully, is an example of subtle repetition

928
00:42:37,105 --> 00:42:38,046
that feels different.

929
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:42,475
So those two bottom hallways look very similar.

930
00:42:42,595 --> 00:42:44,977
They've got gold, they're guarded by a floor chaser enemy.

931
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:48,639
So the same skills are used to get through both of them.

932
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:50,501
But the varying lengths of the hallways,

933
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:52,742
the placement of the gold high or low,

934
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:54,303
and the different arrangement of toggle mines

935
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:56,865
is enough to help each experience

936
00:42:56,905 --> 00:42:58,286
feel a little bit different.

937
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,329
Another strategy that we use to generate

938
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:04,631
interesting repetition is to make sibling levels.

939
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:07,473
So those are two different takes on the same idea.

940
00:43:09,307 --> 00:43:11,789
So here's an example of sibling levels that are an easy and

941
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:13,791
hard version of the same basic idea.

942
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:16,833
So they both have similar tiles and two evil ninjas that

943
00:43:16,853 --> 00:43:17,614
you have to evade.

944
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:22,118
But in the easy version here, the level is quite short.

945
00:43:22,238 --> 00:43:24,660
You only have to double back through the evil ninjas once.

946
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,441
The gold is pretty easy to get.

947
00:43:26,822 --> 00:43:28,343
And there are only a few mines.

948
00:43:29,244 --> 00:43:30,264
But in the hard version.

949
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,770
Here, it's much longer.

950
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:35,373
There are multiple sections where you have to double back

951
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:38,017
through your past selves, and the gold's really hard to get.

952
00:43:38,558 --> 00:43:41,722
But in both, the skills required to be successful

953
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:42,703
are essentially the same.

954
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,432
So to keep repetition from being boring,

955
00:43:46,812 --> 00:43:50,034
we vary the context each time the player revisits a space.

956
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:53,396
So because of gravity, moving up through a space

957
00:43:53,677 --> 00:43:56,078
is a very different experience than moving down.

958
00:43:56,278 --> 00:43:58,160
So when we reuse vertical space,

959
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,861
it automatically feels different.

960
00:44:00,761 --> 00:44:02,763
Horizontal movement is symmetrical though,

961
00:44:02,883 --> 00:44:05,484
so it's important to use enemy placement patterns

962
00:44:05,524 --> 00:44:08,186
that break that symmetry so that each leg of the journey

963
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:10,308
feels like you're moving through a different area.

964
00:44:11,964 --> 00:44:12,805
So here's an example.

965
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:16,306
The vertical ascents on the outer left and right

966
00:44:16,346 --> 00:44:17,847
are the exact same tile shapes.

967
00:44:18,287 --> 00:44:20,008
So we offset the spacing of the mines

968
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:22,469
to make each one require a slightly different approach.

969
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:26,131
The center part is an example of varying context

970
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:28,052
to make that same space feel different.

971
00:44:28,412 --> 00:44:31,113
So the micro drones are patrolling counterclockwise

972
00:44:31,153 --> 00:44:33,835
around the room, which means it's easy on the way there

973
00:44:33,955 --> 00:44:35,095
since you can just go with the flow.

974
00:44:35,616 --> 00:44:38,980
but it's a lot more challenging on the way back when you're moving against the current.

975
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,563
So even though we've reused that space in the center,

976
00:44:41,783 --> 00:44:44,346
each time you're in it, it feels like a completely different room.

977
00:44:47,537 --> 00:44:51,720
Another way that we try to ease frustration is by giving players choices.

978
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,243
So we try to make sure that players are only rarely required to move quickly through the

979
00:44:56,283 --> 00:44:56,904
entire level.

980
00:44:57,524 --> 00:45:01,167
It's really nice to leave some spaces where they can move at their own pace and breathe

981
00:45:01,207 --> 00:45:01,487
a little.

982
00:45:02,348 --> 00:45:07,692
This freedom lets players really express themselves and find their own paths, which is a lot more

983
00:45:07,732 --> 00:45:09,753
enjoyable than a more constrained design.

984
00:45:10,173 --> 00:45:11,635
And it leaves room for speedrunners.

985
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:16,860
So here's an example of a level that gives players

986
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,680
a lot of freedom.

987
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,081
So there are lots of challenges, but there's space

988
00:45:20,142 --> 00:45:21,622
to pause after each one of them.

989
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:23,303
And there's no real need to rush through it

990
00:45:23,363 --> 00:45:24,423
unless that's what you want to do.

991
00:45:25,784 --> 00:45:29,066
A big part of our job as designers is to keep players

992
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,266
on their toes and invested in the challenge

993
00:45:31,507 --> 00:45:32,527
without exhausting them.

994
00:45:33,047 --> 00:45:34,968
And there are tons of subtle ways that we can do this.

995
00:45:35,876 --> 00:45:39,281
So I mentioned that the Ninja in N++ has a wide range of

996
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:43,025
speeds. And we try to use this as much as possible. We want

997
00:45:43,045 --> 00:45:45,709
players to be constantly negotiating and maneuvering

998
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:48,953
within the range of possible trajectories. Because that's

999
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:51,557
much more rewarding than just holding the button down and

1000
00:45:51,597 --> 00:45:53,399
running at top speed the entire time.

1001
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:59,399
So although we usually stay within the middle of the range

1002
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:02,082
of the ninja's motion, we try to guard against players

1003
00:46:02,122 --> 00:46:04,784
becoming complacent by occasionally requiring them

1004
00:46:04,844 --> 00:46:06,466
to hit those behavioral extremes.

1005
00:46:06,706 --> 00:46:08,768
So that way the whole range is always useful.

1006
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:14,093
So, in this level, the first jump needs to be taken at max speed.

1007
00:46:14,433 --> 00:46:17,974
You have to hold the jump button down the entire time to make sure that you clear that

1008
00:46:18,034 --> 00:46:18,654
first gap.

1009
00:46:19,475 --> 00:46:21,775
But the bottom jump changes things up a bit.

1010
00:46:22,296 --> 00:46:27,017
It looks really similar and an inexperienced player might be tempted to just apply the

1011
00:46:27,057 --> 00:46:32,299
exact same approach, but if you do that, you'll go too far and hit those mines on the wall

1012
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:32,939
above the exit.

1013
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:37,267
And if you don't jump hard enough, you'll fall short and smash into the ground.

1014
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:43,472
So you have to perform a very delicate moderation of your velocity in mid air to

1015
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:46,054
make sure that you land safely on that exit.

1016
00:46:46,134 --> 00:46:48,035
And it's really satisfying when you nail it.

1017
00:46:50,957 --> 00:46:54,262
Part of the challenge of playing N++ is that players

1018
00:46:54,302 --> 00:46:56,345
need to be responsive to the demands of the level

1019
00:46:56,465 --> 00:46:59,008
on the fly and to develop the skill of reading the level

1020
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:00,410
to see what's possible to do.

1021
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:03,074
So you can't always blaze in at top speed

1022
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:06,218
and you can't just apply one strategy across the board.

1023
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:07,499
That would really be boring.

1024
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,423
We think that engaging this sort of higher level

1025
00:47:10,463 --> 00:47:12,885
contextual awareness is just as important

1026
00:47:12,985 --> 00:47:15,608
as the basic muscle memory reflex skills

1027
00:47:15,988 --> 00:47:19,011
so that all parts of the brain are engaged and learning

1028
00:47:19,071 --> 00:47:21,733
because that's what Regan and I find most fun as players.

1029
00:47:22,734 --> 00:47:25,337
So to make that work, we really need to try to understand

1030
00:47:25,397 --> 00:47:27,299
and appreciate each player's experience.

1031
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,815
We also try to consider player psychology,

1032
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:32,816
especially understanding the varying amounts

1033
00:47:32,856 --> 00:47:34,057
of tension through a level,

1034
00:47:34,377 --> 00:47:36,238
and how that affects the pacing of the level.

1035
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:38,420
So here's an example.

1036
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,442
The top part is incredibly difficult.

1037
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:43,403
So you have to weave through a whole bunch

1038
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,864
of evil ninja clones of yourself,

1039
00:47:45,284 --> 00:47:47,146
which gets harder and harder as time passes.

1040
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:49,448
The bottom part is relatively easy,

1041
00:47:49,468 --> 00:47:52,092
but you probably spent a lot of time and effort

1042
00:47:52,212 --> 00:47:54,095
finally clearing that top challenge,

1043
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:55,918
and you don't want to have to go through that again.

1044
00:47:56,178 --> 00:47:58,722
So that contextual stress follows you

1045
00:47:58,762 --> 00:48:00,585
into the bottom section and makes it feel

1046
00:48:00,765 --> 00:48:02,608
much more tense and exciting.

1047
00:48:05,305 --> 00:48:07,506
Part of the motivation behind the design

1048
00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:09,566
of the Toggle Mine and Evil Ninja enemies,

1049
00:48:10,106 --> 00:48:12,907
which are new in M++, was to provide us

1050
00:48:12,947 --> 00:48:14,728
with more tools to reuse the space.

1051
00:48:15,188 --> 00:48:17,368
So these enemies are modified by the player

1052
00:48:17,468 --> 00:48:19,989
and they allow players to influence the difficulty

1053
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:21,949
and challenge of the level as they play.

1054
00:48:22,689 --> 00:48:25,230
So this lets them intuitively connect their ninja

1055
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,570
with the mechanics of the level

1056
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,551
and it really makes it more interesting

1057
00:48:28,931 --> 00:48:30,631
because when they return to a space,

1058
00:48:31,131 --> 00:48:33,252
it's a bit different and they've had a hand

1059
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:34,252
in making it that way.

1060
00:48:35,724 --> 00:48:43,152
So understanding and supporting or subverting player expectations is a really important part of making great memorable levels.

1061
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:48,638
And it really helps players connect with the game in a meaningful way by making them part of that conversation.

1062
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,243
Our biggest goal is always to support player agency

1063
00:48:53,624 --> 00:48:55,246
by rewarding learning and growth.

1064
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,909
Because we want players to be choreographers

1065
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,091
as well as performers.

1066
00:48:59,451 --> 00:49:02,174
We want them to plan a route and then execute their plan

1067
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,977
and then make changes on the fly,

1068
00:49:04,557 --> 00:49:06,300
rather than just being forced to execute

1069
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,684
a sequence of moves that we as level designers preordained.

1070
00:49:11,843 --> 00:49:14,966
Here's an example of giving the player lots of options

1071
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:17,088
and letting them figure out their own way.

1072
00:49:17,649 --> 00:49:20,451
So we made sure that you can pick any pair

1073
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:23,173
of adjacent switches and construct a single jump

1074
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:24,575
that will pass through both of them.

1075
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:27,057
It's really hard, but it's very rewarding.

1076
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:27,677
It feels great.

1077
00:49:28,538 --> 00:49:30,119
Or you can just get them all individually,

1078
00:49:30,439 --> 00:49:32,961
but you still need to figure out an order that will work.

1079
00:49:33,421 --> 00:49:35,923
And that rocket means that the specific order matters

1080
00:49:36,063 --> 00:49:37,984
because you'll be in a different position

1081
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:40,786
at a different time, and that'll change where the rocket is

1082
00:49:40,886 --> 00:49:42,768
and what trajectories it blocks.

1083
00:49:43,568 --> 00:49:45,289
So there's an incredible amount of freedom

1084
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,451
in terms of how you want to tackle the challenge

1085
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,973
with a sort of combinatorial explosion

1086
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:51,734
of branching possibilities.

1087
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:54,556
And plus plus levels are about players

1088
00:49:54,636 --> 00:49:57,298
finding their way through it, rather than the way.

1089
00:50:00,062 --> 00:50:03,703
So overall, level design in M++ is about creativity

1090
00:50:03,723 --> 00:50:04,663
within constraints.

1091
00:50:05,283 --> 00:50:08,124
We have a fixed small set of entities and tiles

1092
00:50:08,324 --> 00:50:10,264
and a fixed single screen to work with.

1093
00:50:10,784 --> 00:50:13,145
So we could really get into and understand

1094
00:50:13,325 --> 00:50:15,846
all the nuances and details about each component

1095
00:50:15,966 --> 00:50:17,306
and how they all interact.

1096
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:19,747
That let us create a variety of levels

1097
00:50:20,307 --> 00:50:22,308
to challenge and reward players.

1098
00:50:22,828 --> 00:50:24,648
And to refresh the series with some ideas

1099
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,589
that really felt like they belonged there

1100
00:50:26,709 --> 00:50:27,789
even though they were brand new.

1101
00:50:29,434 --> 00:50:32,617
M++ is a dialogue between player and designer,

1102
00:50:32,657 --> 00:50:34,599
and we really try to respect and support

1103
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,261
and encourage players, and to understand them

1104
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,804
so that we can create a game that's varied and challenging,

1105
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:42,827
and ultimately, incredibly satisfying to play,

1106
00:50:43,027 --> 00:50:45,950
which is what we think keeps players coming back for more,

1107
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:46,891
even after 12 years.

1108
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:54,153
Here are some conclusions and take aways that I thought would

1109
00:50:54,193 --> 00:50:58,315
be more applicable to a variety of games rather than just N

1110
00:50:58,476 --> 00:51:03,479
plus plus. And yeah, that is all I have time to talk about

1111
00:51:03,499 --> 00:51:05,040
today. Thank you so much for coming.

1112
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:17,187
So again, a quick reminder to fill out your feedback forms,

1113
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:19,551
which should be arriving by email shortly.

1114
00:51:20,392 --> 00:51:23,696
And do try N++ if you get a chance.

1115
00:51:24,577 --> 00:51:26,240
And I think we have time for some questions

1116
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,061
if anyone has any.

1117
00:51:27,822 --> 00:51:28,863
Come on up to a mic and.

1118
00:51:31,352 --> 00:51:31,812
Great talk.

1119
00:51:32,073 --> 00:51:35,073
I just had two questions kind of related to

1120
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,994
the amount of time it takes to pass levels.

1121
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,814
So I remember one of the later legacy levels

1122
00:51:39,874 --> 00:51:42,235
took me a good six or seven hours to pass.

1123
00:51:42,835 --> 00:51:44,275
So I was just wondering, based on that,

1124
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:46,296
did that slow down your design process?

1125
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,576
And following on from that,

1126
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:50,377
what was sort of the average amount of time

1127
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:51,237
it took to make a level?

1128
00:51:51,937 --> 00:51:53,838
And did that slow down your design process?

1129
00:51:55,531 --> 00:51:57,853
Well, I mean, very quickly off the top,

1130
00:51:58,453 --> 00:52:00,295
it takes, I think, about four hours

1131
00:52:00,355 --> 00:52:02,056
start to finish for every level.

1132
00:52:02,517 --> 00:52:05,639
It varies depending on the complexity of the level

1133
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,583
and what sorts of things we're testing for, I suppose.

1134
00:52:10,643 --> 00:52:14,386
But yeah, each level does take quite a long time.

1135
00:52:15,247 --> 00:52:16,047
Did you want to add something?

1136
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:21,672
No, sorry.

1137
00:52:22,332 --> 00:52:23,753
OK.

1138
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:26,614
Yeah, I mean, just definitely making the levels,

1139
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:30,936
we want to make sure that we try to explore every possibility.

1140
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:34,938
And yeah, it sometimes takes a really long time.

1141
00:52:35,398 --> 00:52:37,379
Also, levels, when we make them now,

1142
00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:39,200
take us a bit more time to, like,

1143
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,421
it takes a little bit more time to come up

1144
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:44,882
with a good idea, because at the beginning, there were so many.

1145
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:46,203
We could just do anything.

1146
00:52:46,243 --> 00:52:47,843
And now that we've made, like, 10,000 of them.

1147
00:52:49,284 --> 00:52:50,885
There's not as much that we can do anymore.

1148
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:52,425
Thanks.

1149
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:53,585
Thank you.

1150
00:52:55,386 --> 00:52:55,946
Let's go over here.

1151
00:52:56,326 --> 00:52:57,046
Let's go back and forth.

1152
00:52:57,106 --> 00:52:59,307
I'm just going to stand on my feet instead of.

1153
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:02,368
You talked a lot about player agency.

1154
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,529
Have you ever thought of allowing players

1155
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:07,370
to design their own level and create modification of their?

1156
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:12,070
Excellent question. Yes, actually there's a built-in level editor in the game and we support

1157
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:18,112
online free global level sharing for all. Because, yeah, we really love that, we love to see what

1158
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:23,413
other people create as well. And it's often really, really interesting to see especially how they

1159
00:53:23,593 --> 00:53:28,174
differ in their level design. It's awesome. Thank you.

1160
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:30,584
Kind of an offshoot of that question.

1161
00:53:30,984 --> 00:53:34,789
Years ago when you made N+, I entered the contest

1162
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,292
and one of my levels got into the game.

1163
00:53:37,512 --> 00:53:37,833
Awesome.

1164
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:40,516
And I was wondering, it started my career.

1165
00:53:40,556 --> 00:53:42,859
I've been making levels ever since.

1166
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:43,239
Oh, cool.

1167
00:53:43,299 --> 00:53:45,983
And I'm curious if you had any interest

1168
00:53:46,063 --> 00:53:47,625
in doing maybe another contest.

1169
00:53:48,357 --> 00:53:52,699
for that again. It would be great for me but also those getting

1170
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:57,060
started. It bolsters your confidence. I can do this. Look

1171
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,782
it made it in a real game. It was huge for me. So thank you.

1172
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:02,702
Thank you. That's awesome to hear.

1173
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:04,883
Yeah, that's like super, super amazing.

1174
00:54:10,302 --> 00:54:14,105
I should point out that that was actually a contest for legal

1175
00:54:14,205 --> 00:54:17,028
reasons. We were not allowed to call it a contest because that

1176
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:22,553
would involve, I don't know. And actually I think like one of the

1177
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,935
reasons why we did that was that we were trying to get the global

1178
00:54:24,955 --> 00:54:28,318
level sharing working in N plus. But Microsoft

1179
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:32,020
had some concerns about people making inappropriate content.

1180
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,262
They didn't have, anyways, so we weren't allowed to do that.

1181
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:36,723
So we were kind of like, okay, this is a way to get people

1182
00:54:36,823 --> 00:54:38,984
to see what the community is making.

1183
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:43,947
And we sort of specifically for N plus plus decided

1184
00:54:43,987 --> 00:54:45,889
we didn't want to do one of those

1185
00:54:45,969 --> 00:54:47,289
because we wanted to make the.

1186
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:52,595
level sharing so good that there was no need for us to cherry

1187
00:54:52,635 --> 00:54:55,858
pick. There is a little featured section in the user made levels

1188
00:54:55,878 --> 00:54:58,681
where we curate it and pick out our favorites. That's sort of

1189
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:01,645
the same thing. Thanks so much for letting us know. That's

1190
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:02,385
really, really cool.

1191
00:55:06,194 --> 00:55:10,396
you guys for answering questions about physics and things like

1192
00:55:10,436 --> 00:55:13,497
that way back in the day on the forums. All those tutorials were

1193
00:55:13,537 --> 00:55:19,539
super helpful. As far as my question, I just wanted to ask

1194
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,601
if for N plus plus or even N plus if there was any new

1195
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:25,642
features that you considered that you decided just added too

1196
00:55:25,662 --> 00:55:28,483
much complexity or disrupted the game play when you were in the

1197
00:55:28,503 --> 00:55:29,583
process of building it out.

1198
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,762
there are a few new enemies and stuff that we were prototyping

1199
00:55:35,862 --> 00:55:40,125
that we ended up scrapping because they, it was just too

1200
00:55:40,165 --> 00:55:45,429
much. It was like specifically we kind of added portals. One

1201
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:49,351
thing about 2D games is you have to stuff, empty space has to be

1202
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:53,134
contiguous or there's no way to get to it. And so this was a way

1203
00:55:53,174 --> 00:55:56,416
to let players could beam through a solid region and end

1204
00:55:56,476 --> 00:56:00,439
up in an empty. That's way too much. It's just getting to be

1205
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,827
like we tried to kind of, yeah we're kind of saving it for the

1206
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:09,249
future basically.

1207
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:13,611
Hi. How long did it take you to come up with controls that you

1208
00:56:13,631 --> 00:56:17,234
thought were really solid and how did you know that when you

1209
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:17,654
got there?

1210
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:25,153
it was so long ago. How long did that take? I think it took about a week to write the player

1211
00:56:25,193 --> 00:56:30,917
controller. We made the original in for a flash games contest. And we did have a lot of stuff

1212
00:56:30,937 --> 00:56:34,600
already like the rag doll and the tile collision. Everything was already laying around so we were

1213
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:39,423
just kind of figuring out how to make a game out of all these pieces we had. But the player

1214
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:42,846
controller took about a week and then probably we tuned it like.

1215
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,631
over the course of the next month as we were adding the

1216
00:56:45,691 --> 00:56:48,798
other stuff. I don't know how we decided.

1217
00:56:49,427 --> 00:56:54,009
when it was done. Honestly we didn't know that it didn't super

1218
00:56:54,089 --> 00:56:56,410
click until we added it. Initially it was just you were a

1219
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:01,013
circle. And that was sort of like okay, whatever, this is

1220
00:57:01,053 --> 00:57:03,714
fine. We proceeded with development. But once we added

1221
00:57:03,874 --> 00:57:06,936
all the animation in, that's when it really started to feel.

1222
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,857
It made a pretty dramatic, which is strange because it doesn't

1223
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:12,378
actually change the motion at all. But it really changed our

1224
00:57:12,418 --> 00:57:16,360
perception of it. And we had not anticipated that at all. But it

1225
00:57:16,401 --> 00:57:18,322
was quite a huge thing when it happened.

1226
00:57:19,396 --> 00:57:22,299
Thanks.

1227
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:22,620
Hi.

1228
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,181
I like the presentation today.

1229
00:57:24,802 --> 00:57:28,566
So for the level zero or potentially boring level

1230
00:57:28,586 --> 00:57:31,790
designs, would there still be use cases for them?

1231
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:35,194
Like, for example, for tutorial sections or whatnot?

1232
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:37,336
Or would that just be a case by case basis?

1233
00:57:37,742 --> 00:57:39,063
Yeah, it's mostly case by case.

1234
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:42,666
So tutorial, I mean, we historically

1235
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:44,867
had not really done a great job on the tutorial.

1236
00:57:44,907 --> 00:57:46,929
So we really tried to do that well in N++.

1237
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:49,370
And I think generally we succeed,

1238
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:51,792
especially comparatively.

1239
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,974
But mostly for tutorial levels, you just

1240
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:56,615
have to keep it super, super simple.

1241
00:57:56,915 --> 00:57:59,677
So even the one that I showed, that zero level,

1242
00:57:59,857 --> 00:58:01,619
would probably be too complex.

1243
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,440
I mean, I guess we could put it at the end of the tutorial.

1244
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:04,621
But.

1245
00:58:05,454 --> 00:58:09,077
They often had to be a lot more simple than we thought.

1246
00:58:09,097 --> 00:58:11,499
Because, I mean, it's hard to make a very simple level

1247
00:58:11,539 --> 00:58:12,700
without it being boring.

1248
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:15,183
So there's like a fine line that you kind of have to,

1249
00:58:16,324 --> 00:58:17,485
again, it's a gut feeling.

1250
00:58:17,545 --> 00:58:19,486
But you just kind of have to play with it

1251
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:21,608
until it seems just interesting enough,

1252
00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:23,830
but also isn't overcomplicated.

1253
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:26,231
And I feel like that level might be over complicated.

1254
00:58:26,251 --> 00:58:27,971
But again, yeah, it's a case by case thing.

1255
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:30,112
So some of them, yes, we can totally repurpose.

1256
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:33,052
Some of them we would use for secret levels.

1257
00:58:33,072 --> 00:58:35,473
Because again, the tile shapes might be interesting.

1258
00:58:35,853 --> 00:58:37,473
Surely we could strip out everything else

1259
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:39,374
and then play with it a bit and see what happens.

1260
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,394
But some of them you just have to cut.

1261
00:58:41,474 --> 00:58:43,115
And that was something that we had to deal with too.

1262
00:58:43,475 --> 00:58:45,475
We've done all this work, but you know what?

1263
00:58:45,495 --> 00:58:46,416
There's no way to save it.

1264
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:47,256
Right.

1265
00:58:48,094 --> 00:58:49,778
And then somewhat related to the tutorial,

1266
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:53,946
when you were still crafting the player controller,

1267
00:58:53,986 --> 00:58:56,010
did you ever attempt level design?

1268
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,255
Or did you wait until it felt right enough

1269
00:58:58,295 --> 00:58:59,798
to start developing?

1270
00:59:00,797 --> 00:59:04,880
remember? We didn't have the level editor built then but we

1271
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,503
certainly had a bunch of different levels that were just

1272
00:59:07,543 --> 00:59:11,927
kind of like defined in code just because you kind of need

1273
00:59:11,987 --> 00:59:15,310
all those different angles and the different little just like a

1274
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:18,713
variety so you can test like all of the different ranges of

1275
00:59:18,853 --> 00:59:20,935
movement and height and stuff like that. So there's

1276
00:59:20,955 --> 00:59:22,136
definitely like.

1277
00:59:22,877 --> 00:59:25,498
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't like levels that you could play.

1278
00:59:25,538 --> 00:59:27,159
It was just sort of a level that sort of would have

1279
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:29,560
one of everything, or would have sort of a bunch

1280
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,162
of different configurations that you could drive it around

1281
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:33,863
and get used to how it worked.

1282
00:59:34,243 --> 00:59:34,783
Okay, thanks.

1283
00:59:35,424 --> 00:59:35,604
Thanks.

1284
00:59:36,784 --> 00:59:38,825
Hi, thanks for the great talk.

1285
00:59:39,986 --> 00:59:41,467
I have one question, but before that,

1286
00:59:41,487 --> 00:59:44,208
just a really small sort of a remark slash request.

1287
00:59:44,709 --> 00:59:47,870
So when you were talking about all the considerations

1288
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:51,673
of what makes the levels feel different from one another,

1289
00:59:53,094 --> 00:59:56,719
like the speed of traversing the level, the layout,

1290
00:59:56,819 --> 00:59:59,583
et cetera, I found that really valuable

1291
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,687
because it sort of gives you a set of parameters

1292
01:00:03,368 --> 01:00:06,833
so you can just think about how you can even think about

1293
01:00:06,873 --> 01:00:08,395
making your level of, you know, like.

1294
01:00:09,317 --> 01:00:13,018
just the task of making all of these thousands of levels

1295
01:00:13,098 --> 01:00:14,278
wouldn't be possible without it.

1296
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:16,459
So if you ever put this online or anything,

1297
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:18,379
it would be really good to have all of those

1298
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:20,439
sort of in a list.

1299
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:23,620
Yeah, so the question is actually

1300
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:30,221
about the sort of grid size for the levels.

1301
01:00:30,721 --> 01:00:34,042
Was it a fluke, or is it flexible, or is it fixed,

1302
01:00:34,142 --> 01:00:36,662
or did you get to that, you know,

1303
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:42,641
possible space. In N plus we actually because we had to

1304
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,643
support SDTVs we had to implement zooming and panning

1305
01:00:45,663 --> 01:00:49,166
and stuff. And so since we were doing that we supported like a

1306
01:00:49,226 --> 01:00:53,009
range of level sizes. But for N plus plus we sort of started

1307
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:57,812
with like okay, it's 720 is like the lowest common denominator

1308
01:00:57,872 --> 01:00:59,674
and all the UI and everything was designed around that. And

1309
01:00:59,694 --> 01:01:03,757
the tiles were all like we kind of, because you can't

1310
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,830
everything has to be in multiples of a tile. You can't

1311
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:10,891
add half a tile to the level. So we basically right at the start

1312
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:14,331
of development just figured out, okay, what's the biggest space

1313
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:17,572
we can make where stuff is still big enough that you can see it

1314
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:20,553
on a TV from a certain distance sort of thing. And I think what

1315
01:01:20,573 --> 01:01:23,373
we ended up with is like 44 tiles horizontally and 23

1316
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:28,774
vertically. And it's fixed. In N plus plus it's only that and it

1317
01:01:28,794 --> 01:01:30,855
doesn't change. But it is like

1318
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,502
I mean maybe we should have gone a bit bigger or smaller.

1319
01:01:34,522 --> 01:01:35,002
It's hard to say.

1320
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:36,303
Thank you.

1321
01:01:37,184 --> 01:01:37,464
Thanks.

1322
01:01:40,386 --> 01:01:40,807
Thank you.

1323
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:50,654
OK.

1324
01:01:50,695 --> 01:01:52,336
So if anyone still wants to chat,

1325
01:01:52,636 --> 01:01:54,838
we're going to head over to the wrap up room briefly.

1326
01:01:54,938 --> 01:01:57,940
And otherwise, thank you so much for coming and have a great day.
