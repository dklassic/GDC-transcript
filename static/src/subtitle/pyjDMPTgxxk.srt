00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:04,618
Hello.

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:12,975
So first I've been asked to have you silence your cell phones.

3
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:15,461
And then we can start.

4
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:22,778
So I am Eric Dodds, I am the game director on Hearthstone and I'm going to talk a little bit about

5
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:28,862
10 things that while we were developing Hearthstone we found to be very very useful

6
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:32,404
sort of as high-level design things so I'm going to talk a little bit about the specifics

7
00:00:33,104 --> 00:00:36,126
of the things we did and also sort of why those things are important.

8
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:40,347
And so here are the things that I'm going to be talking about.

9
00:00:40,868 --> 00:00:44,909
As you'll see, there's a whole bunch of things crossing a whole bunch of different ideas,

10
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,591
and they're all pretty big topics, so I'm not going to be, you know, deep diving into any of the specifics.

11
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:53,112
It's going to be more just talking about a couple of examples,

12
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:57,014
how they related to Hearthstone and sort of the ideas behind them.

13
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:04,437
So, the first thing that worked out very, very, very well for Hearthstone is that we

14
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:06,258
were able to iterate fast.

15
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:10,981
And that's certainly something that you will hear over and over if you go to GDC talks,

16
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:14,602
it's not like rocket science or anything to iterate fast.

17
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:17,844
And certainly on Hearthstone we found that...

18
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:23,365
we had tons and tons of bad ideas that we needed to try and then not do and so

19
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:28,146
that quick iteration let us not do all of those ideas and I guess the

20
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:35,187
interesting thing is is perhaps how we did the quick iteration so to start we

21
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:40,008
had a lot of pure design time and what I mean by that is me and Ben Brode the

22
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:44,389
other designer on the project spent a lot of time before anything else really

23
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:47,130
happened trying to figure out what the design of the game was

24
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:55,750
And I would love to say that that was planned, but accurately what I can say is that instead

25
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,614
all of our engineers were moved to another project for a while to help out with that project.

26
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:05,277
And so we got a lot of inadvertent pure design time.

27
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,141
And for us, it was very, very important

28
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:10,102
for a couple of reasons.

29
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,925
The first reason why this design time was important

30
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:14,646
was of course because our engineers

31
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:16,388
were not asking us questions

32
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:18,049
and bothering us asking those questions

33
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:19,291
so we could focus on design.

34
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:27,170
Actually one of the big reasons it was important is because if we had had engineers to ask us those questions

35
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,973
We would have answered their questions, and we wouldn't have had enough information

36
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:36,265
to actually know what we were going to do in the final design.

37
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:40,626
And so we would have told them things that later on would have kind of hosed us

38
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:44,667
because we would have later on said okay here's our design now and they would

39
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:47,128
have gone you know a year ago when you told us

40
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,569
that you wanted it to work like this well we implemented like this and then

41
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:54,490
it would have made it much more difficult or impossible to do the actual

42
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,051
design that we sort of wanted to to follow through with.

43
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:05,648
And in this pure design time, since of course we had a couple of designers and we had our lead artist as well, but no engineers,

44
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:10,190
we spent a lot of that time doing paper design.

45
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:20,315
And it works of course very well for our game because our game is based and comes from the physical collectible card game genre, that's its basis.

46
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:22,976
But I actually think that there's a lot of games that could end up doing...

47
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:26,740
more paper design time than they otherwise do.

48
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,444
And certainly I can say, as far as game development goes,

49
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:33,887
one reason that it was super useful for us to do this is because,

50
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:36,270
strictly from an expense point of view, I mean,

51
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:38,452
having two designers working on stuff,

52
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:43,017
doing paper design is a cheaper thing to do than having a full team rolling.

53
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,199
I can talk a little bit about this specific design.

54
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,781
So when we were working on the game, we were trying to solve a whole bunch of different

55
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:52,721
design problems.

56
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:58,524
And this specific card or idea was trying to solve the problem of the heroes feeling

57
00:03:58,604 --> 00:03:59,464
really powerful.

58
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:03,446
Because when we were working on Hearthstone, one of the ideas we had is we wanted heroes

59
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:08,748
to not just be a punching bag, but to be this powerful character that actually interacts

60
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:13,470
with the environment and isn't just something that gets beat up.

61
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:21,905
And the issue we had with that, or sort of the reason we went in this direction is we decided,

62
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:26,569
hey, maybe we can make a really powerful hero who doesn't show up until later in the game.

63
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:30,272
So there's a fortress that you have to smash your way through before the hero leaps out.

64
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:33,394
And then once the hero leaps out, he can actually be powerful,

65
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:38,498
and we actually had a whole system where you spent points buying super cool weapons and armor and stuff for him.

66
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,582
But there ended up being a number of problems with this model not the least of which being that you

67
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:47,944
Generally didn't destroy the enemy's fortress you just built up a huge army

68
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:52,307
Waited till you had overwhelming force and then crushed their fortress and hero at the same time

69
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,589
But it was very very valuable for us to try things like this discover

70
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:59,811
They were terrible and and move on just in a paper format

71
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,567
Another thing that worked out very very well for us is we made a flash prototype of the game.

72
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:11,175
This is a picture of the game sort of in the middle of our flash prototype ideas,

73
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:13,258
not very early, but not towards the end.

74
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:20,537
What worked out well for this is that we got to try a whole bunch of the ideas in the Flash prototype,

75
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:26,900
and our final Flash prototype mechanically actually looks almost identical to how the

76
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,082
game looks today as far as mechanics. I mean it doesn't have the pretty 3D world and a lot of

77
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:37,223
the cool effects and all that kind of stuff, and some of the cards are certainly changed,

78
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:43,265
but the game field itself and the basic interactions and mechanics and UI were all

79
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:44,586
ready and done.

80
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,081
And what that meant was when we finished with this Flash prototype and we were ready to start building the real game,

81
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:52,882
we pointed to the Flash prototype and told our engineers,

82
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:57,644
hey, we're just going to sit around for a few months, why don't you just make that thing that's this game right here?

83
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:07,207
And it let the engineers make the back end of the game exactly how it was going to end up being design-wise,

84
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:11,529
so we didn't have to later on make changes and get in trouble because there were engineering problems behind the scenes.

85
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,970
So it was a huge advantage for us to build this Flash prototype.

86
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,553
And of course it also meant that we got to very quickly try a whole bunch of ideas, put

87
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:24,094
them into the Flash prototype, not worry that it was junking up the code because we knew

88
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,155
we were going to throw it away in the long run.

89
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:34,419
So another very important thing for us in Hearthstone was sharing the vision with our

90
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:34,759
team.

91
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,122
Certainly everybody on our team is going to be participating in making the game.

92
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:48,928
If you've ever been on a game where everybody on the team is not making the same game, it doesn't go so well.

93
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:53,572
And yeah, there's a lot of ways of communicating what the game is all about.

94
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:59,137
You can communicate it via, you know, just talking a lot about it or showing some example games

95
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:03,081
or sharing design documents which normally make people fall asleep.

96
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:10,709
But what we did is we had a set of six stakes in the ground and these were the

97
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:16,496
basic ideas that we used to communicate both to ourselves and and to new people

98
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,459
who are joining the team and pretty much all of the people who are involved in

99
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:22,062
around the game what the game was all about.

100
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:26,624
And so that at a high level made sure that everybody who was making the game

101
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:29,986
was making the same game and had these same high-level ideas.

102
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:34,007
Yeah, these are actually two of the the six stakes in the ground and I'll

103
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:38,770
certainly be talking about some more of them later, but these stakes were just

104
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,711
critical for communicating to the rest of the team what the game was.

105
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:47,153
and the reason why that ended up being so important, or I think it's important really in all games,

106
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:52,239
is that certainly on the Hearthstone team, everybody on the team is a designer,

107
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,442
and I think this is really just true across all of game development,

108
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:59,827
that all of your engineers and artists and pretty much everybody involved in the game

109
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,949
is making design decisions, large and small.

110
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:23,118
and there's a couple of ways you can go about sort of designing the game and the way we decided to go about it is that on the design side we sort of said here's the big way we want this idea to work, here's sort of the big picture idea behind whatever the system is that our engineers or artists or whatever we're putting in and then the engineer or artist has

111
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:27,859
both the knowledge because they understand sort of the the big vision and

112
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,220
also the the

113
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,802
on the ground knowledge to make the right implementation choices there because

114
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:39,644
There's often going to be a lot of small details that the person who's actually doing the implementation

115
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:43,946
You know the engineer artist or whatnot is going to notice that's going to be hard to notice up front

116
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:46,937
You, of course, could handle this as a designer

117
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:50,178
by putting out a design document that

118
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:51,599
details every little detail.

119
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,280
But I've had bad experience with that in the past,

120
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,701
because design documents end up being outdated about two

121
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,742
seconds, usually, after you send them out.

122
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:03,063
And you can't really cover all the details.

123
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:06,144
So sort of along the lines of this,

124
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:07,845
one of the things that was very important for us,

125
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:10,386
and I certainly recommend, is making sure

126
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:13,187
that everybody on your team has what

127
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:14,547
I think of as designer brain.

128
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:18,128
and when looking at somebody to be on our team,

129
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:20,648
I'm much more excited about an engineer

130
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,069
who is a good engineer, who has designer brain

131
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:25,870
and sort of can think like a designer

132
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,190
as an engaged in the game,

133
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,190
rather than an amazing engineer

134
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:32,131
who's not really into the game you're making,

135
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:34,332
they're not really interested in playing it,

136
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:36,812
they're not really, don't have strong designer brain.

137
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:39,213
So it made a world of difference for us on Hearthstone

138
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:40,933
that sort of everybody on the team

139
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:42,994
was able to make those design decisions

140
00:09:43,054 --> 00:09:44,954
and let us move forward together sort of as a whole.

141
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:54,538
So, simplifying Hearthstone is probably at a high level our biggest goal from the very

142
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:54,918
beginning.

143
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,481
I mean our thought about Hearthstone as a whole was we wanted to make a game that took

144
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:04,462
what's cool about collectible card games and made them accessible to a lot more people.

145
00:10:05,923 --> 00:10:11,706
Collectible card games in general are pretty complicated beasts that are pretty intimidating to get into

146
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:18,030
and so we wanted to make sure that we made a game that everybody could sort of understand and start playing immediately.

147
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:30,293
And one of the things that that meant was we started questioning the basics of what it meant to make a collectible card game or for something to be a collectible card game.

148
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:42,157
So for instance, there's a lot of collectible card games that have a lot of specific different turns and you have to understand this phase and this phase and this phase and what can be done in each of those phases.

149
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:44,778
And we decided, okay, we're going to rip all of that out.

150
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:50,069
The only phase, there's only one phase, the time you get to do stuff, your turn.

151
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,180
And during that turn you actually can just do whatever the heck you want to do in any order.

152
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:01,477
One of the reasons ways that turned out very well is because it actually adds some tactical depth

153
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:08,761
and one of our general rules when we're looking at simplifying a system is can we simplify that

154
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:15,766
system without removing sort of depth of play and in fact in this case as we removed sort of

155
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:17,907
the turn order in a lot of ways it added depth of play.

156
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:24,974
Another basic thing that we sort of thought about and challenged when working on Hearthstone

157
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:32,399
was the traditional collectible card game resource model, which traditionally has your

158
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:36,882
resources being cards that are drawn, that are part of your collection, just like your

159
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:39,443
creatures and spells and that you build your deck out of them.

160
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:48,312
for a whole bunch of different reasons we felt like it was pretty important for us to simplify the game in that area and to make it so that the

161
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:56,897
resources were in fact a thing that you got automatically every turn rather than a thing that was a card in your hand

162
00:11:57,357 --> 00:11:59,338
and there's a bunch of different reasons for this

163
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:03,660
certainly one of them is as a new player of a collectible card game

164
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,603
and I actually can even say for myself who is a very experienced player of collectible card games

165
00:12:08,923 --> 00:12:10,924
whenever I look at a collectible card game and go what

166
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:17,677
percentage of mana or resources or whatever I should put in the deck I generally go online

167
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:22,078
and look up something because it's just very complicated to figure out how you should build

168
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:22,458
a deck.

169
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:30,000
And also putting resources in your deck is not nearly as exciting as minions and spells

170
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,601
so if I'm putting together an awesome deck I want to go, I'm going to put fireballs and

171
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:34,941
giants and dragons and...

172
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:41,573
resources is just it was not as exciting. And lastly it actually helped speed play

173
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:47,139
which was really important to us for Hearthstone to make sure that the game played pretty fast

174
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:51,803
and normally in a collectible card game I have two choices at the start of my turn I go

175
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:55,887
am I going to play a resource or which resource am I going to play and then I choose to do the

176
00:12:55,927 --> 00:13:00,191
cool thing which is playing my spell playing my minion you know that sort of thing and so

177
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:01,532
this speeded that up as well.

178
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:09,715
Another thing, this is sort of a geeky thing that makes me happy, but it's also a good example as well,

179
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:15,301
is that we were able to effectively remove the idea of exhaustion in a lot of ways.

180
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:24,430
And to me, why this is cool is as we were simplifying the game, we made a lot of specific smaller choices to simplify things

181
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,894
that let us do something on a larger scale that felt simpler.

182
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:34,279
And the smaller things that we did as we were working on Hearthstone is when we were working on the game,

183
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,884
we were talking about, well, do we want minions in play to be able to have an ability that you can activate?

184
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:46,110
You know, a lot of collectible card games let you use either attack with your minion or use it to do something else.

185
00:13:47,632 --> 00:13:49,354
From a UI point of view we looked at it

186
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:53,678
And we went we really like it that I can single click on a minion

187
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:58,723
And it's always going to mean attack. We don't have to have a pop-up menu. We don't have to have left click right click

188
00:13:58,943 --> 00:14:03,788
It's it's a very simple thing so we decided for you know the the shipping of Hearthstone

189
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:10,375
We're not going to have any abilities on on minions that are triggered by you activating them. You just attack with your minions

190
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:18,964
Then a separate thing that we did was as we were looking at defenses and how creatures defend themselves.

191
00:14:19,745 --> 00:14:30,070
Traditionally, if I have a guy who can stop enemy attackers, you would, you know, tap or exhaust or whatever the term is depending on the game to block an enemy attacker.

192
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,092
and we, at first we were thinking that was the right way to go

193
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:38,273
we didn't really like the fact that it was a response on the enemy's turn

194
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:42,275
and then I think it was actually, it was a long time ago, but I think it was actually a bug

195
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:46,617
where the taunt actually stayed up permanently

196
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:50,458
and we played it for a little bit like that and we liked it

197
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:54,460
and we thought, hey this is great, let's get rid of a defensive creature having to

198
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,680
you know, taunt or exhaust or...

199
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,782
tap or exhaust or whatever to stop an attacker and

200
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:03,184
Once we got rid of those two things we realized that

201
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:07,706
This concept of tapping or exhaustion normally applies to a bunch of different things

202
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:12,609
But for us at this point all it really applies to is whether the creature has attacked or not

203
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:16,652
So what that meant was when we were doing our tutorial, we could say,

204
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:19,554
hey, if the creature can attack, it has a green glow around it.

205
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:20,655
If it can't, it doesn't.

206
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:22,536
We're not explaining anything more to you.

207
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,498
In fact, we only barely explain that.

208
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,061
And so this whole concept sort of goes away,

209
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:32,324
and you can understand the game much more quickly early on.

210
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:38,937
Summoning Sickness is something that is also traditionally in collectible card games,

211
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:43,501
and it's a mechanic where a creature, when it first comes into play, cannot attack that turn.

212
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:51,498
And we didn't like this very much either because it had the complexity of a creature could either not be able to attack because it already attacked,

213
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,319
or a creature could not be able to attack because it had just come into play.

214
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:03,102
And so, and I don't again remember if this was when we were doing the flash prototype or doing it with physical cards,

215
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:10,525
but we decided, hey, let's try to remove this and see what happens, and we removed it, and it was really, really bad.

216
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:10,605
And...

217
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:16,667
Really what happened was we were trying to simplify something and we lost so

218
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:22,050
much depth that we went okay we don't really love having two different things

219
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,472
that are indicated sort of in the same way but it doesn't matter we have to

220
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:29,373
have summoning sickness in there it just makes for a much worse game to not have

221
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:32,835
summoning sickness so this is an example of something where we tried to simplify

222
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:37,297
the depth was just not there after we simplified so we just decided we're

223
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:39,858
gonna undo it and and do it the old-fashioned way.

224
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:47,513
And so this is one of the things that I have discovered after many years of working on WoW and Hearthstone,

225
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:52,778
which is you never end up, never stop adding stuff to your game.

226
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:54,920
And so when we're talking about the game, we're going,

227
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,263
okay, this is sort of the right level of simplicity that we want.

228
00:16:58,863 --> 00:16:59,124
And then...

229
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:07,654
over time we start adding additional things to the game here and there for various reasons and and often it's like a little thing here

230
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,298
And a little thing there and very quickly you look at your beautiful simple

231
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:18,627
UI or interface or whatever it is and realize that it's not quite so simple or beautiful anymore

232
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:31,677
And that's not even to talk about what we're looking at on Hearthstone now is to be adding additional features going forward and you know having this struggle between a very simple accessible UI with all of the cool features we want to put in.

233
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:36,241
So really a big example of this is our victory screen.

234
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:46,188
When we were working on the game we were like hey we want to have this awesome victory screen we're going to make it look super cool and we did that and you know we had the big victory or defeat happen at the end of the game.

235
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:53,252
And then a while later we went, you know what, we probably have to have quests that award you for doing various things.

236
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:58,235
So, okay, okay, the end of the game is victory or defeat, and then a quest screen pops up,

237
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:02,178
because we felt like it was the best way to, or the best place to indicate that.

238
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,240
And then we went, well, sometimes there's two quests, so it's a victory or defeat screen,

239
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,261
and then a quest screen, and then another quest screen.

240
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:15,046
And then we decided that we needed to make some changes to ranked play to add a lot more clarity there.

241
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:21,049
And so then the victory defeat screen was the victory defeat screen, and a quest screen, and maybe another quest screen,

242
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,771
and maybe the indicator that you went up or down rank.

243
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:29,555
And then suddenly our beautiful, simple, you know, end of game screen was...

244
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,477
much more complicated than I would have liked.

245
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:34,438
So that's certainly an area that, you know,

246
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:35,659
if I could travel back in time,

247
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,440
I would have gone back and seen what we could have done

248
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,042
to make it more simpler or more integrated

249
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:40,803
or something like that.

250
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:43,404
But it's an example where you just never stop adding stuff,

251
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:44,825
or certainly we don't.

252
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:56,359
So the next big point is sort of a super obvious one, keep it deep, and it's sort of of course at odds with the simplify idea.

253
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:06,526
But again, really what it meant was that whenever we were simplifying the game, we were focusing on removing complexity rather than removing depth.

254
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:15,282
And if we ever remove complexity and also remove depth, we thought about that change like the summoning sickness one.

255
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:24,007
Or if we ever were in a case where we felt like we really had to simplify the game and we were going to lose some depth,

256
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:30,171
we then thought about what's an idea that we can put back into the game to make sure that we still have all of that depth there

257
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:32,812
that's not as complex as the previous idea.

258
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:40,681
So probably the biggest biggest thing that we did in Hearthstone to sort of address that directly was hero powers

259
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:42,102
and

260
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:45,456
In some other collectible card games

261
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:51,178
There's a variety of things that you can do with your mana on the board and you can play cards out of your hand and other

262
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:54,319
Things so there's a lot of combinatorics and as we change the game

263
00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:02,222
We realized that we didn't have as many combinatorics as far as the possible ways you could play your sets of cards. So for instance

264
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:08,865
Without hero powers and without anything else if I have three mana and I have a card that cost three and a card that will

265
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:12,286
Cost one I'm pretty much just gonna play the card that cost three

266
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:19,279
So what we did was add hero powers, which is a thing that you can do every turn that costs 2 mana

267
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:25,200
that is not as powerful as a card, but is still a very useful thing to do, and also very class specific.

268
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,161
So if I have 3 mana and I have a hero power, I can either use the 3 mana card,

269
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:34,182
or use my 1 mana card and use my hero power, or maybe I just use my hero power.

270
00:20:34,762 --> 00:20:37,843
And this is only in the simple case, but it's really an example of us.

271
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:42,687
wanting to make sure that there were a lot of tactical depth and a lot of tactical choices

272
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:45,469
as sort of as you were playing the game and we put hero powers in

273
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:49,092
to do that as well as a few other things but that was the primary reason.

274
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:54,957
This is a slide that will jump back a little bit to the simplicity slide.

275
00:20:56,815 --> 00:21:04,097
When we are making a card, we have sort of a general rule, which is if someone new reads that card for the first time,

276
00:21:04,757 --> 00:21:10,039
and they do not understand it immediately, they have to stop and parse it,

277
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:16,982
then that card is probably too complicated, and either we go back and we spend a lot of time wordsmithing that card

278
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:20,503
to make sure that that effect is something that you can instantly understand,

279
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:23,824
or in a lot of cases, we actually went through and we just...

280
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:29,966
junked that card or that idea or changed it in some way to make it easily understood and

281
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:36,208
Actually as a quick aside parse is a word that I use a lot when we're talking about the team and for me that means

282
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:41,409
does the player who's reading the whatever the text is have to actually stop and

283
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:46,230
Figure out what it meant. So if I have to I'm reading along and I go what was that word?

284
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,792
Oh, yeah, that word means this other thing. Okay, I had to stop and it's a bit of a jarring experience and we really want

285
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:57,055
flow state so you're reading the card and you don't even know that you've

286
00:21:57,076 --> 00:22:03,000
stopped to read it you just understand what it does and going back to the keep

287
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:09,084
it deep idea for our game where we focus on the depth is focusing on combinations

288
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:12,887
of cards making for interesting interactions so for instance the first

289
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:16,790
card here is whirlwind it does one damage to all minions there's some

290
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,891
interest in that card in and of itself

291
00:22:19,452 --> 00:22:23,172
But when you add a second card to that, that's another pretty straightforward card.

292
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:26,113
A card that whenever it takes damage, you draw a card.

293
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:32,734
It becomes a lot more interesting because you might play your Acolyte of Pain out and then whirlwind and suddenly a negative thing turns into a positive.

294
00:22:33,274 --> 00:22:38,335
And throw the Berserker on top of that, that gets stronger every time anything takes damage.

295
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:41,136
And then suddenly you have a lot of interesting depth there.

296
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:48,857
But we didn't get that depth through just making a lot of text or a card you have to really parse.

297
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:59,336
Okay, so the fifth thing is immediate fun, and this was actually one of our stakes in the ground, immediate fun for new players.

298
00:23:02,587 --> 00:23:09,014
One of the conundrums here is that learning is normally fun, and as a new player you'd think,

299
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,018
hey I'm learning a game, all these things I'm learning, it's normally a fun thing,

300
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:16,944
except that when you don't know enough to see where the fun is, to see where the depth is,

301
00:23:17,144 --> 00:23:21,028
it's often not immediately fun, and so...

302
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:28,415
We talked a lot and worried a lot about the experience of players having 10 seconds into the game and 30 seconds into the game

303
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:33,419
and how quickly can a player really understand this game and how quickly are they having fun.

304
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,085
So, one of the things that we did was we made sure that we kept text short.

305
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:48,383
And it led to some pretty funny conversations because we'd talk about some piece of our introductory text where we're teaching you the game and we'd go,

306
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:54,170
wow that text has six words in it, that's kind of a lot, is there any way we can cut that down?

307
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:57,574
And those were serious conversations we had.

308
00:23:57,774 --> 00:23:58,976
And then we used context.

309
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:02,079
in combination with that text, so lots of bouncing arrows,

310
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,522
sort of a green highlight around the thing

311
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:06,104
that you should be interacting with,

312
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:08,226
to very quickly get you playing the game,

313
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:10,448
rather than reading about how to play the game.

314
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:12,791
And that was super important to us.

315
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:19,438
Another thing that was pretty important, and I think it's pretty straightforward,

316
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:23,560
but that as long as the player has learned enough to actually start playing

317
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,903
the real game, we didn't want to teach them anything else. So sort of our goal

318
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:32,285
with our introductory experience was to teach the player enough so they felt

319
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:36,267
like, hey I know how to play this game, I'm gonna go jump into this game, rather

320
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:39,548
than teaching them everything that they needed to know to play the game sort of

321
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:42,830
in the long run. And this is partially because learning stuff is actually

322
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,350
really fun.

323
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:50,334
But it's also partially because we just wanted to get you to get you through this experience and through the sort of the talking

324
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:53,796
Experience and to the main experience very quickly and very painlessly

325
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:54,777
so

326
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:59,740
There was very often during development people around the company would say hey

327
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,563
You don't teach the player about freeze or secrets or all kinds of things that we deliberately didn't teach the player about

328
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:06,804
because we felt like

329
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:08,406
We teach the player about this.

330
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:10,168
You know what, they're gonna learn this later,

331
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:11,890
once they're actually jumped in

332
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,912
and having a good time with the game and playing the game.

333
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,295
And we just don't need to explain this to you.

334
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:17,055
You will figure it out

335
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:18,517
and you'll have a good time figuring it out.

336
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:24,629
But really I can say we actually just listened to George Fan.

337
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:27,170
He's the designer of Plants vs. Zombies.

338
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:35,254
And he has said a whole lot more than I will say today about how to make an awesome introductory experience.

339
00:25:35,854 --> 00:25:37,715
And he gave a talk here a couple of years ago.

340
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:40,656
If you do a search for George Fan GDC 2012, you'll find it.

341
00:25:40,676 --> 00:25:40,736
And...

342
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:47,740
Internally we really just said is this experience up to the sort of plants

343
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,662
versus zombies introductory experiences that's sort of the gold standard we used

344
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:57,045
and if you're working on an introductory experience I cannot recommend enough

345
00:25:57,546 --> 00:26:01,308
listening to George because he's just a smart dude especially about introducing

346
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:02,068
players to games.

347
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:10,945
So this is a point that has a lot more to do probably with our games than a lot of games you're working on,

348
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:12,826
and that is embracing the medium.

349
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:18,090
And to us what that means is we're coming from this physical CCG space,

350
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,131
and we're going to a digital space.

351
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:24,414
And our goal was to make the best digital collectible card game we could,

352
00:26:24,454 --> 00:26:25,614
so we didn't want to end up...

353
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:29,516
thinking about or getting stuck with any of the things that work great in a

354
00:26:29,576 --> 00:26:35,978
physical space and do not work as well in a digital space and there were a

355
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:39,660
number of those. Probably the biggest thing that we implemented along those

356
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,620
lines were secrets.

357
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:57,038
And what that is in response to is in, I would say, an awful lot of physical collectible card game, there's a concept called responses, where I play a card on my turn and my enemy out of turn can play a card in response to that, and I can play a card in response to that, and so on.

358
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:07,340
This works great in physical collectible card games because of the nature of the interaction that you're having with the other player.

359
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,902
I mean, you're basically having a conversation with the person who's sitting across from you,

360
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:14,543
and the nature of just basic conversation has a lot of...

361
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:20,026
shifting backwards and forwards in time and interrupting and and it's sort of built for that and so

362
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:23,387
With a response in in a physical collectible card game

363
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:27,749
I can go I'm gonna play a giant and now I'm gonna play a drat and they go wait wait wait wait

364
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:29,130
No, go back to that other thing

365
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,072
I'm gonna counter spell it or lightning bolt it or whatever the heck you're gonna do and it works great in that space

366
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:35,953
in a digital space

367
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:39,936
because you don't have that immediate back and forth, that conversation,

368
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:44,801
it's more it's either one person's turn or the other, it causes a lot of problems.

369
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:49,886
And so because we were designing specifically for the digital space,

370
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:52,388
we put secrets in the game.

371
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:55,431
And this is because we wanted to make sure we kept the depth.

372
00:27:56,132 --> 00:28:00,955
of me doing something on my turn and not knowing that I'm going to get to do all the cool stuff

373
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:03,676
that there might be a surprise waiting for me on my opponent's side.

374
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:09,280
And a secret is a card that you put into play that is triggered by a set of circumstances

375
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,762
and when it's triggered it does a specific thing but your opponent doesn't know what

376
00:28:12,802 --> 00:28:13,922
those circumstances are.

377
00:28:14,383 --> 00:28:17,925
So they can try to play around it, but in a lot of ways it's a lot like trying to play

378
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:18,885
around a response.

379
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:22,488
You know, if you are seeing your opponent in Magic has two blue mana open.

380
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:30,023
You're definitely assuming certain things and secrets are a lot the same way. So that's what we did to make it a

381
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:32,087
digital game and emphasize that.

382
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:39,382
Another thing we did was put digital cards in, cards that you can really only make in the digital space.

383
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:44,847
Some of those cards we just put in because we wanted to mess around with the space and see what the possibilities were,

384
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:50,071
like Nazdormu, which is a card that changes the turn timer to 15 seconds.

385
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:57,617
So that's a card that wouldn't work at all in a physical space, but in a digital space it's kind of fun, it's kind of interesting,

386
00:28:57,717 --> 00:29:01,380
and as we try cards like that, we're going to find some that are super exciting.

387
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:08,824
For me, one of the more exciting things though was where we got to solve problems by being

388
00:29:08,884 --> 00:29:11,425
in a digital space that you can't really solve in a physical space.

389
00:29:12,065 --> 00:29:17,747
So the ThoughtSteel card here was originally, long ago, a card that

390
00:29:18,668 --> 00:29:23,551
When you played it, you actually took two cards out of your opponent's deck rather than copying them.

391
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:30,215
And when you take two cards out of your opponent's deck, there was a lot of emotional negativity to that.

392
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:35,879
Especially from our high level players who felt like you're taking two of the cards that are my, the cards that...

393
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:40,623
you know, cement my deck together, my endgame cards, the cards that solve problems.

394
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:45,728
And it was very emotionally negative and we wanted to solve that problem.

395
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:49,152
And so what we did was we thought about it and went,

396
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:52,535
hey, we're a digital game, let's just make it copy cards out of their hand.

397
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:56,058
It still gives you the feel of beating up the opponent with their cards,

398
00:29:56,098 --> 00:30:00,643
but we lose that emotional negativity of actually stealing the cards from the opponent.

399
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:07,738
So another thing that was important to us, and it's kind of funny to be saying this,

400
00:30:07,758 --> 00:30:11,061
because on one hand I'm saying we wanted to look at what we wanted to be changing,

401
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,082
and on the other hand I'm saying don't change too much.

402
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:18,326
And what I mean really by don't change too much is make sure that all of the

403
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:21,308
things that players are sort of expecting when they come to your game,

404
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:24,911
that you are providing for them because those are things that you don't have to

405
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:28,134
explain to the player, and anything that you don't have to explain to the player

406
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,174
is just a godsend.

407
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:33,697
So for a first-person shooter, it would be something like,

408
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:36,579
okay, WASD are gonna be my control keys

409
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,560
because I don't have to explain that to the player

410
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,521
and they'll get angry if you don't have that.

411
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:43,203
But there's some areas where,

412
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:44,944
that are a little bit interesting

413
00:30:45,184 --> 00:30:47,265
in the decisions we made in Hearthstone

414
00:30:47,585 --> 00:30:48,506
and why we made them.

415
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:52,128
So for instance, early on we were talking about,

416
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:53,329
hey, this is a digital game,

417
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:54,369
one of our stakes in the ground

418
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:56,250
was embrace the digital nature of the game,

419
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:57,071
and we went.

420
00:30:58,604 --> 00:31:03,648
Does it have to be a card? Could it be a rune? How about a potion vial that pours the guy out on the ground?

421
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:09,433
Of course there was lots of talk about, you know, Star Wars chess, say, little miniature monsters fighting it out there.

422
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:13,496
And so these were all, this is actual concept art for the game where we were trying to figure out...

423
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,181
what the heck is our collectible going to be?

424
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:18,223
Because it could be anything, it doesn't have to be a card.

425
00:31:18,884 --> 00:31:20,945
And after talking about it a lot, we went,

426
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:23,828
you know what, it's crazy for us to not make it a card?

427
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:27,451
Because as a card, anyone who's ever played cards,

428
00:31:27,531 --> 00:31:29,313
whether it's, you know, a collectible card game,

429
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:32,035
or hearts, or spades, or any card game,

430
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:33,036
knows that...

431
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:38,137
you can shuffle cards, that you can draw a hand of cards, that you can play cards,

432
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:41,198
that can be discarded. There's a whole bunch of things that you understand

433
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:45,079
about cards and a large group of people understand about cards that we don't

434
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,000
have to explain and so there's no way we're giving that up because it's so

435
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,221
important to have that sense of familiarity and sort of know what the

436
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:52,901
game is going to be.

437
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:02,744
Also, we spent a lot of time talking about the words that we used for everything because it's so important to use words people know.

438
00:32:02,764 --> 00:32:09,969
And it sort of seems obvious that the attack value of a minion should be attack, and the health value of a minion should be health.

439
00:32:10,689 --> 00:32:17,314
but one of the reasons that I point that out is because there's sometimes an idea of

440
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:22,978
hey, our game is all about this thing, so instead of health, let's call our defensive trait morale

441
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:28,643
and what that means is anytime a player sees morale, first off, they have to learn what the heck morale is

442
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:32,886
and second off, they have to end up parsing your game more, because when something says

443
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:36,969
hey, gives a minion plus three health, you don't have to parse it at all, you instantly know

444
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:41,843
I know what that thing does, assuming I know which bubble is attack and which bubble is health.

445
00:32:42,304 --> 00:32:46,345
Whereas if it says give plus three morale, I not only have to know what morale is, I then have to

446
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:52,408
figure it out. And so just using terms people know is super important. We spent tons of time even

447
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:57,931
talking about what should we call the offensive trait. Okay, let's call it charge because when

448
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:59,311
we were talking to it at Blizzard...

449
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:05,854
Most people felt like that would be the trait that lets you attack right away. What's the defensive trait? It's taunt etc. Etc

450
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:10,956
tons of time spent just figuring out sort of the names for things and

451
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,237
even the names of

452
00:33:12,697 --> 00:33:20,660
Your spells and minions and cards was pretty important. So for instance early on we are trying to explain to the player

453
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,322
What's the difference between a minion and what's the difference between a spell and it's not especially to someone who's new to collectible card games

454
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:28,083
It's not a super obvious thing

455
00:33:29,143 --> 00:33:34,945
But if we call one of our early spells Fireball, you actually in your head already know what a Fireball does.

456
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:37,766
You know, oh, it's going to deal some damage and go away.

457
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:43,987
So while we're teaching you about spells, at the same time you have a thing that you know is a spell from your outside experience,

458
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:46,928
which you can go, okay, I know how this is going to work.

459
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:50,549
And we even actually get additional bonuses here in that...

460
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,342
you probably think of Fireball as a spell from the outside experience,

461
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:58,723
hey that's an attack spell that probably does a fair amount of damage and

462
00:33:59,183 --> 00:34:02,124
so suddenly you know, hey six damage is probably a reasonable

463
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:05,906
reasonably fair amount of damage. So we're teaching you a bunch of stuff

464
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:09,467
just by the names of things based on outside experience

465
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:13,428
and that stuff is super valuable too in sort of keeping things the same for

466
00:34:13,448 --> 00:34:14,949
players and giving them what they expect.

467
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:21,986
This is a topic that's very near and dear to my heart, supporting player stories.

468
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:31,001
And what a player story is specifically is the thing that your buddy is going to tell you that night about their experience.

469
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:36,744
in the game the day before and it's usually not about the narrative that they've read in the story.

470
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:41,966
It's usually, hey I tried to play last night and the servers were down or hey I tried to play last

471
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:47,849
night and I got crushed a couple of times or I used this crazy combo and it was awesome and those

472
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:52,371
are the sorts of things that actual player stories are and it's important for us to embrace player

473
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:57,733
stories and especially as a game that's trying to keep sort of our scope down and be very focused.

474
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:03,740
We really wanted to focus on the player story and not really worry at all about the narrative story.

475
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:10,028
So this is story time where I get to tell a story about World of Warcraft.

476
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,874
This is a dungeon called Sunken Temple from World of Warcraft.

477
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:22,991
This dungeon has a whole bunch of story to it and there's a green dragon and some trolls trying to do something or other to a god

478
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:29,837
and despite the fact that I worked on World of Warcraft for eight years, I still couldn't actually tell you what the real story is

479
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,078
but it's something like that.

480
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:37,923
And that story was not super important to me as I was playing through World of Warcraft.

481
00:35:37,963 --> 00:35:43,007
The story that mattered to me was one where me and a bunch of friends went into Sunken Temple.

482
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:45,649
and back in the day it was a very, very vertical dungeon.

483
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,090
So we traveled all the way up to the top of the dungeon,

484
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,011
and once we got to the top of the dungeon,

485
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:51,532
we wanted to get to the bottom of the dungeon.

486
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,633
And, you know, we could have fought our way back down,

487
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:55,054
but one of my friends, she said,

488
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:57,195
hey, there's this hole in the middle of the floor,

489
00:35:57,215 --> 00:35:58,756
why don't you just jump down?

490
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:00,117
There's water down there, we'll jump down,

491
00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:01,397
and we'll fight, and we'll have a good time,

492
00:36:01,437 --> 00:36:03,499
and we'll avoid all that horrible walking.

493
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,820
So all of us, of course, except for her, jumped,

494
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,761
and we realized the water's about, you know, that deep,

495
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,943
and we all died.

496
00:36:11,763 --> 00:36:13,124
and we all laughed our asses off.

497
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:16,025
And for me, that's the story of Sunken Temple.

498
00:36:16,545 --> 00:36:19,407
And while it's not a fantastic narrative story,

499
00:36:19,987 --> 00:36:22,789
it's a story that's mine, and it's important to me.

500
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:26,290
And so I really feel like giving players those stories

501
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:31,253
is super important, and arguably more important than giving them, you know, the narrative story.

502
00:36:33,095 --> 00:36:39,669
So one of the things that we do in Hearthstone to support this is we create cards that create

503
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,672
player stories.

504
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:46,409
and really how we end up designing those cards is we think of a card idea and go

505
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:50,551
I have no idea what that card idea is going to do. That's probably going to do something really

506
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:55,393
weird and scary and when we're making these cards we actually have a general rule which is

507
00:36:56,013 --> 00:37:01,276
if the card doesn't scare us we probably should try to make it scarier and then we'll try to

508
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:06,158
figure it out in design later or balance later if it's balanced or not.

509
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:12,080
So this specific card, to give an example of a player story that comes from this specific card,

510
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:17,082
this is a card that is a very powerful card for cost two, but once it comes into play,

511
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:19,523
all of your opponent's minions are free for a turn.

512
00:37:20,143 --> 00:37:25,885
And so there's a well-known streamer who, at one point on turn one, played this card,

513
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:29,406
using the coin, so they got an extra man on turn one.

514
00:37:29,426 --> 00:37:31,727
So on turn one they had a 4-4, which is very powerful.

515
00:37:33,687 --> 00:37:38,349
His opponent then proceeded to play a spell for free that took a bunch of cards out of his deck,

516
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:42,629
actually the Thoughtsteal, and then another copy of that that took some more cards out of his deck,

517
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,970
and then a card that took, that copied a card out of his hand,

518
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:51,751
and then the card that he copied out of his hand he played, which, all of these were of course free,

519
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:57,373
which summoned a random minion from the streamer's deck, which ended up being Ragnaros.

520
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:03,106
which Ragnaros immediately fired and destroyed Milhouse Manastorm.

521
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:07,289
So the game went horribly, horribly wrong, but it was an awesome, awesome story.

522
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:12,471
And it's not a story that when we were creating Milhouse Manastorm we had any clue was going to happen.

523
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:16,874
Mostly we created a card that had a lot of possibilities, a lot of open-endedness,

524
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:21,416
and then the players gave us back the stories with all the crazy things that are happening with it.

525
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:30,204
Another thing that is important to us is randomness, and that's certainly an area where there's a lot of, I would say, contention in the community.

526
00:38:30,804 --> 00:38:36,006
But randomness is a pretty important element for creating player stories as well.

527
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:44,148
So this is a picture of our Arena Mode, and how Arena Mode works is you are presented with three different heroes at random.

528
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:50,250
You pick one of those heroes, and then 30 times in a row, you choose one of the three cards that is presented to you.

529
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:58,448
And we have some light controls on the rarity of some of these cards that show up, but we

530
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:03,450
don't have super strong controls, and we certainly don't control the number of any specific card

531
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:03,970
that comes up.

532
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:09,072
So it's been known to happen in the past that you play an arena run and you get...

533
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:15,613
you know, 11 copies of Frostbolt, or 6 Unleash the Hounds and 6 Starving Buzzards, or any

534
00:39:15,673 --> 00:39:20,794
other combination of cards, or heck, 4, or probably not 4, probably like 3 Leroy Jenkins.

535
00:39:21,974 --> 00:39:26,695
But combinations of cards that are just not possible in the real game, or I should say

536
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:32,156
the ranked game, and that create really interesting stories.

537
00:39:32,396 --> 00:39:36,337
And one of the reasons we can actually do this is because our arena mode...

538
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:39,659
you play until you lose three games or win 12 games.

539
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:42,360
So no matter what the deck is, it's going to very quickly

540
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,821
leave the environment one way or the other,

541
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:46,822
and then there will be a new crazy deck that you're playing.

542
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:49,903
And once you get to the high end, you're playing somebody else's crazy deck.

543
00:39:50,463 --> 00:39:53,605
So this randomness creates a whole lot of stories,

544
00:39:53,645 --> 00:39:55,546
and those stories, again, are really important to us

545
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,026
for sort of the health of the game.

546
00:39:58,777 --> 00:40:04,563
And this is just saying that our game specifically chose to have no story and we just focus on vibes.

547
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:08,527
So we say, hey, we're an inn, we're a warm, cozy place, come in and play games.

548
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:11,670
And what we want to do is share your stories.

549
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,154
And again, it's not because I think narrative stories are bad.

550
00:40:15,174 --> 00:40:17,316
I think in a lot of games narrative stories are great.

551
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:19,018
I think they just require...

552
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:23,742
a ton of work. I mean it almost has to be the primary thing you're going for if you're going

553
00:40:23,802 --> 00:40:29,947
for a narrative story and since that was not our focus we didn't go in that direction and I've

554
00:40:29,967 --> 00:40:33,610
certainly seen a lot of games that they go well we're not really going to focus on narrative

555
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,794
story but we want to have one anyway and very often I see that getting in the way because

556
00:40:37,854 --> 00:40:42,577
that story is told with you know just pop-up dialogues with with text in them or something

557
00:40:42,597 --> 00:40:43,498
like that that is not

558
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:47,499
telling a super compelling story so mostly I'm saying if you're gonna tell a

559
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:52,081
story just focus on telling the story but in a lot of cases it's probably

560
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:56,342
better to just stick with vibe and and let the players tell the story and

561
00:40:56,382 --> 00:41:03,884
certainly that's our belief with Hearthstone. This is also very near and

562
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:08,305
dear to my heart and that is that emotional design matters and what I mean

563
00:41:08,345 --> 00:41:11,686
by that is it's very important to be playing paying attention to the

564
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:13,086
emotional state of the player.

565
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:16,864
as they're playing the game and as they're encountering things in the game

566
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:23,771
and in a lot of cases that's more important than sort of the mechanical design

567
00:41:23,912 --> 00:41:25,814
or in some cases even high level balance.

568
00:41:28,383 --> 00:41:37,775
One thing that we've discovered is very often there's emotion in unintended places that as a game developer certainly we don't necessarily, or I often don't think about and should think about more.

569
00:41:38,776 --> 00:41:46,565
And so for instance, a moment of high emotion that's going to probably be higher emotion than anything else a player will encounter in your game is when they...

570
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:53,037
run into the server being down, or there being an error message, or a number of things like

571
00:41:53,137 --> 00:41:57,942
that, that are not things that normally we design for, but I like, I think it's pretty

572
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,885
important to pay attention to, sort of the emotional state.

573
00:42:01,345 --> 00:42:05,849
And this is actually an example of where we changed the game a little bit to make the

574
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,071
emotion of the game better.

575
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:12,900
So this is our spinner and this comes up whenever you're doing matchmaking and

576
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,108
It has a bunch of funny things that it says and it always ends up on well back in the day

577
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:20,594
it always ended up on a perfect opponent and

578
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:26,070
When you actually play the game after you're matched with with this opponent

579
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:31,713
Sometimes it is a blowout whether it's because they got good cards or you got bad cards or they're a better player than you

580
00:42:31,753 --> 00:42:35,795
There's all kinds of reasons why it could be a blowout even if it was a pretty good match

581
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:40,297
But what that means is early on a player would see a perfect opponent

582
00:42:40,997 --> 00:42:43,099
get blown out in the match and go,

583
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,061
I'm super pissed at Blizzard.

584
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,924
This makes me angry because it said a perfect opponent

585
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:49,966
and this did not feel like a perfect opponent.

586
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:52,728
And so we actually just changed the text

587
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:56,932
to read a worthy opponent because it changed qualitatively

588
00:42:56,972 --> 00:42:59,054
sort of the emotional response.

589
00:42:59,314 --> 00:43:01,056
I mean, it's still never fun to get blown out,

590
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:04,339
but it was qualitatively better just changing the wording

591
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:06,701
and setting the expectation slightly differently.

592
00:43:08,872 --> 00:43:14,534
We also do a lot of design for Emotion. This is a discard from the physical WoW trading card game.

593
00:43:15,334 --> 00:43:19,436
Discard card and this is a mechanic that we actually don't do any of in Hearthstone.

594
00:43:20,116 --> 00:43:28,400
Because the effect of playing discard and certain other types of mechanics on your opponent is super disheartening.

595
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,041
It sort of makes your opponent feel powerless.

596
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:36,425
and it's sort of a weird state actually because it's fun to play discard decks and

597
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:43,109
Counterspell decks is another type of deck that we're not really supporting or resource destruction all of those things. It's fun to play those

598
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:49,374
But it's not fun to have those played against you and we felt like the emotional negativity that came

599
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:55,838
From having that played against you was so strong that we didn't feel like that we could really include those mechanics in our game

600
00:43:56,854 --> 00:44:09,618
And it's actually in some cases a problem for us because there are certain types of decks in the metagame that it would be useful if we had discard as a tool to put in players hands to deal with sort of those types of decks.

601
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:13,240
But the emotional negativity is so strong so we're just not going to do it.

602
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,581
We're designing for emotion and just taking those straight out.

603
00:44:17,941 --> 00:44:20,122
We also do a lot of balance for emotion.

604
00:44:20,142 --> 00:44:24,763
A significant number of our changes over the last six months or so have been made.

605
00:44:25,926 --> 00:44:30,989
actually for emotional responses and emotional feedback rather than like high level balance

606
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:36,432
thoughts and mind control is one of those cards that we changed. It's a card that when you play

607
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:40,875
it you take an opponent's minion and put it onto your side and now you own it and the emotional

608
00:44:40,935 --> 00:44:44,677
response to that is is very strongly negative and

609
00:44:45,734 --> 00:44:47,396
we heard all these people complaining everywhere,

610
00:44:47,636 --> 00:44:50,358
oh my god, mind control is too powerful, I can't play against it,

611
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:53,601
it's the strongest card in the game, and we looked at the numbers,

612
00:44:54,182 --> 00:44:58,766
and it was just fine, the card was not an overpowered card.

613
00:44:58,786 --> 00:45:02,249
The problem with the card is it felt super bad to have it played against you,

614
00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:05,132
so we actually increased the cost of the card significantly

615
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:08,695
to make it so that it would be seen less.

616
00:45:09,196 --> 00:45:14,261
sort of in the game as a whole, that it's more of a niche card, even though from a pure balance point of view,

617
00:45:14,301 --> 00:45:20,147
we didn't have to make any changes to it. It was just an emotionally balanced card or an emotionally unbalanced card,

618
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:21,729
I guess, that we felt like we needed to change.

619
00:45:24,165 --> 00:45:28,967
Also, one thing that was pretty interesting that we talked a lot about when we were designing the game is

620
00:45:29,468 --> 00:45:35,311
when do we provide the audio and visual feedback to support specific emotions.

621
00:45:35,711 --> 00:45:42,174
So, when we were first building the game, our artists were working on the effects of attacking

622
00:45:42,194 --> 00:45:46,737
and they're like, we're gonna make this awesome effect when my minion crashes into the enemy hero or your minion,

623
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,198
it's gonna be super cool.

624
00:45:49,038 --> 00:46:04,177
And after we talked about it for a while, we realized that while the attack is a very important moment narratively, like in a movie, whatever, that is going to be the high moment of emotional impact in Hearthstone.

625
00:46:04,938 --> 00:46:09,421
By the time something's attacking, you probably actually know what it's going to be attacking.

626
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:13,643
Or if you don't, you're like, eh, he could attack this or this. Yeah, he attacked that.

627
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:15,424
It's not emotionally high moment.

628
00:46:15,804 --> 00:46:21,087
So instead, what we did is we, instead of focusing our audio and visual effects there as much,

629
00:46:21,147 --> 00:46:22,568
we focused a lot more on...

630
00:46:23,549 --> 00:46:26,990
summoning cards into play because actually the high emotional moment in a

631
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:30,932
game of Hearthstone is when my opponent first put something into play because it

632
00:46:30,952 --> 00:46:34,734
could be anything it could change the game entirely and you just have no idea

633
00:46:34,774 --> 00:46:37,415
so that's the moment of tension what are they gonna play what are they gonna play

634
00:46:37,555 --> 00:46:43,257
oh my goodness it was you know Ragnaros or whatever it was so just for us

635
00:46:43,357 --> 00:46:48,780
focusing our visual attention on the emotional moments that were actually

636
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,021
relevant to the specific game were important

637
00:46:52,862 --> 00:46:57,424
And lastly, another topic that is near and dear to my heart, little victories.

638
00:46:57,964 --> 00:47:01,885
And the idea of little victories is that in a player versus player game,

639
00:47:02,346 --> 00:47:07,388
it's very important to give the player moments where they feel like they did something badass

640
00:47:07,448 --> 00:47:08,748
and changed the course of the game.

641
00:47:09,629 --> 00:47:21,958
And to sort of, and this is only referred to in a player versus player game because in a, like a player versus environment game, that's actually in a lot of cases what the entire game is, is just a series of little victories.

642
00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:30,203
I mean, World of Warcraft is just you doing lots of little cool things and improving your character and it's not a big moment where you go, hooray, I beat World of Warcraft.

643
00:47:30,924 --> 00:47:31,765
So, we...

644
00:47:33,706 --> 00:47:40,171
So we focus on, so we talk about it relating to PvP and sort of an example I

645
00:47:40,231 --> 00:47:46,156
have of a good and bad version of this is a bad version of Little Victories is

646
00:47:46,437 --> 00:47:50,920
I play a first-person shooter and I get killed sort of at my spawn point five

647
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,861
times and then

648
00:47:52,822 --> 00:47:56,523
we lose or even we win at that point but in either case I feel terrible

649
00:47:56,883 --> 00:47:59,725
versus a first-person shooter where I

650
00:48:00,405 --> 00:48:03,686
snipe a guy and then I sneak up on a guy and kill him and then I die a couple

651
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:06,167
times and then we still lose I feel so much better about that

652
00:48:06,368 --> 00:48:09,449
and so I would argue that actually the little victories are in a lot of ways

653
00:48:09,509 --> 00:48:10,449
more important than

654
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:12,290
the the big victory

655
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:21,476
So for Hearthstone, we think of the game as sort of like a puzzle, in that on your turn, how you should go about your turn is, at the start of your turn go,

656
00:48:22,056 --> 00:48:28,701
the enemy has a bunch of minions in play, I'm in big trouble, I've got nothing out, I'm gonna solve this puzzle and by the end of your turn,

657
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:35,205
you've done smart stuff, they don't have minions in play, I have minions in play, I've sort of turned it around and have it go back and forth each turn.

658
00:48:35,465 --> 00:48:38,987
And in a lot of cases that's how it plays out, is a lot of back and forth.

659
00:48:39,307 --> 00:48:42,872
and you get all of those little victories so that whether you win or lose the final game,

660
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:47,577
it's, it's, I mean it still matters, don't get me wrong, it's still much better to win,

661
00:48:47,998 --> 00:48:53,004
but it's, it makes it so that either way you still felt like it was a good and fun game.

662
00:48:54,692 --> 00:49:03,376
And this is actually one of the reasons why we have been aggressively looking at decks that are called one-turn kill decks.

663
00:49:03,956 --> 00:49:11,279
And this is a type of deck in Hearthstone that a player sort of just hangs out and makes the enemy not be able to do anything for a while,

664
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:13,701
or removes their minions, but it doesn't really damage you.

665
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:19,543
And then late game, it drops a bunch of cards on the table and kills you in one turn without sort of any warning.

666
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:25,008
And those decks are super fun to play and they are very challenging to play

667
00:49:25,068 --> 00:49:28,831
I mean, it's it it requires a lot of skill to play a really good one turn kill deck

668
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:34,416
But how it feels for the opponent is it doesn't feel like you gave the opponent those little victories

669
00:49:34,776 --> 00:49:40,301
So basically as the opponent of a one turn kill deck in a lot of cases you feel like yeah

670
00:49:40,321 --> 00:49:42,563
I put out some stuff and it was destroyed and I put out some stuff

671
00:49:42,623 --> 00:49:48,127
It was destroyed and I'm not doing anything cool and suddenly I lost without any ability to sort of save myself

672
00:49:48,908 --> 00:49:58,476
And so, as we've been looking at the balance of the game, the effects that do one turn kills have been ones that we've been very seriously looking on and made a number of changes to.

673
00:49:59,817 --> 00:50:05,441
And, I think that's actually it. So, that is all I have to say about Hearthstone for now.

674
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:20,281
Thanks a lot for coming. I'm happy to talk to people if they want to talk afterwards.
