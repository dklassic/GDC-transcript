1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,391
I'd like to welcome you all here.

2
00:00:06,411 --> 00:00:08,993
We're going to talk about networking, networking etiquette,

3
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:12,015
some things that you can do to improve networking,

4
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:14,497
and just how it helps you connect with people.

5
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:15,798
Excuse me.

6
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:17,659
My name is Jared Huntley.

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,200
I'm a game developer from Cleveland, Ohio.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,582
I own a small studio called Polytundra.

9
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:23,823
We make mobile games and do console ports.

10
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:25,565
Alrighty.

11
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:28,026
Who's advancing?

12
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:32,755
Let's do it like that.

13
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:36,436
All right, who feels that professional networking

14
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:38,977
is or will be a necessary part of their career?

15
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:42,138
Yep, yep, sounds about right.

16
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:45,478
All right, who feels that they could improve

17
00:00:45,518 --> 00:00:46,439
their networking skills?

18
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:48,459
You see this?

19
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:49,779
This is my hand included.

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,580
The thing about networking is it's always something

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,600
that you can improve on.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,081
It's always something that you can learn something new,

23
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,662
you can learn how to connect with people more,

24
00:00:58,822 --> 00:01:00,342
and these are some of the things

25
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:01,422
that we're gonna talk about today.

26
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:06,203
All right, so what we'll be covering together

27
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:07,824
is what is networking?

28
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:09,446
We'll talk about what is the term

29
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:11,127
and look at it a little bit closer

30
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:12,968
and hopefully learn something about it.

31
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:14,750
The different types of networking.

32
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,871
There's different types of networking

33
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:17,312
that are appropriate for different places,

34
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,553
different times, and then finally,

35
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,655
practical networking etiquette tips

36
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:23,596
for the modern games industry professional.

37
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:24,117
Cool.

38
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:27,079
All right, so what is networking?

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,740
So I like to look at the definitions

40
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,861
and kind of break them down.

41
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:33,624
So if you look at the definition.

42
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:37,526
It is really small from over here and doesn't show up big on my screen.

43
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:42,552
OK.

44
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:47,578
The exchange of information or services among individuals or institutions,

45
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,683
specifically the cultivation of productive.

46
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,999
Relationships, thank you, for employers or business.

47
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,560
Sorry, I didn't realize it would show up over there,

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,140
not over here.

49
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:03,422
But the thing, and you know, there's a computer networking,

50
00:02:03,462 --> 00:02:04,642
I hope nobody's a computer here,

51
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:05,683
but we're not gonna talk about that.

52
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:08,084
So let's break this down.

53
00:02:08,424 --> 00:02:10,885
The exchange of information or services

54
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:13,706
among individuals, groups, or institutions.

55
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:18,189
The thing I want to point out here is networking is an exchange.

56
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:20,871
It means it's a two-way transaction.

57
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:24,694
When you're networking with people, you're giving something out and you're getting something

58
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:24,994
back.

59
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:28,877
You always want to make sure there's equivalent exchange.

60
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:34,321
You always want to make sure that you're listening as much as you're talking and that you have

61
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:38,764
an equal relationship with whoever you're chatting with, whoever you're sitting next

62
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:39,965
to, things like that.

63
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:44,601
Next, it's among individuals, groups, or institutions.

64
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,485
The thing I want to highlight here is the individuals.

65
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:51,128
Whenever you're networking, it doesn't matter

66
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:53,830
if you're trying to get a job, it doesn't matter

67
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:58,455
if you're trying to meet a specific employee

68
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:01,278
for a organization, you're always meeting with a person.

69
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:06,718
This is pretty much the most important thing about networking is to remember you're always

70
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:08,239
networking with individuals.

71
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,521
People have their own feelings, people have their own thoughts, and you want to make sure

72
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:15,363
that you're being considerate and thinking about the person you're chatting with.

73
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:20,507
It's not, you know, a machine, it's not, you know, a transaction, and it's not guaranteed.

74
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:24,990
And so when you're thinking about the person, that can make you more empathetic and can

75
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,131
really help you connect with people.

76
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,561
All right, so some general talking tips

77
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,202
that go along with those.

78
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:33,462
When you're talking with somebody,

79
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:34,622
don't hog the conversation.

80
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:38,664
Make sure that you're listening as much as you're talking.

81
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,485
I like to try to listen more than I'm talking.

82
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:44,006
I have something to learn from students

83
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:45,806
up to veterans of the industry.

84
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,007
And I think that when we're listening,

85
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:52,349
it puts our minds and our hearts in the right area

86
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:53,289
to connect with people.

87
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:58,229
Also, remember the individuals,

88
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:00,190
that's what we just spoke about.

89
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:02,772
Listen to exchange information.

90
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:05,333
So if somebody's giving you cool tips,

91
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:07,075
you try to give some cool tips back

92
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,336
and that continues that conversation

93
00:04:09,636 --> 00:04:11,637
and it becomes more of a back and forth rapport.

94
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,272
The other thing is don't assume anything.

95
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:16,833
When you meet with somebody,

96
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:20,195
don't assume certain genders have certain roles

97
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:24,458
or certain people might be in certain positions.

98
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,019
You just want to have an open mind

99
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,180
whenever you meet anybody.

100
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,201
You always want to start from a blank slate

101
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,543
and let them fill it in as you are talking with them.

102
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:35,004
And then lastly, always be authentic.

103
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:36,724
Sometimes we have this pressure.

104
00:04:36,764 --> 00:04:38,064
We're like, oh, I need to look so cool,

105
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:40,205
or I need to make sure I don't mess up.

106
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:43,205
It's fine to be worried and anxious,

107
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:44,245
and I get that as well too.

108
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:46,366
But the thing is, you want to be your true self.

109
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:48,886
You don't want to put on a face for this person

110
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,067
and then turn around and hang out with your buddies,

111
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:53,707
and that person is like, that's the same person.

112
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:56,528
You want to make sure that you're being authentic,

113
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:59,328
you're being true, and that you're connecting

114
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:00,568
with people with who you are.

115
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:04,249
All right, the different types of networking.

116
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,051
So we're gonna dive into a little bit of science

117
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:07,272
and talk about something interesting.

118
00:05:11,516 --> 00:05:12,397
Let me look at this name.

119
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:18,082
So there is a sociologist named Mark Granovetter,

120
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:21,525
and he wrote an academic journal called

121
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,086
The Strength of Weak Ties.

122
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:26,529
And in this he talks about strong ties versus weak ties.

123
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:28,391
I'm gonna take a sip of water.

124
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,653
And so this is an example of strong ties versus weak ties.

125
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,315
Strong ties are basically your core group,

126
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:41,117
the people around you.

127
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,538
So, you know, your best friends,

128
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,461
maybe the people in your cohort in school,

129
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,863
maybe the people in your animation department.

130
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:49,324
Those are the people that, you know,

131
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:50,646
you have a daily rapport with.

132
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,188
Those are, you know, your close core network.

133
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:59,360
But weak ties in this paper, and then I'll kind of, you know, readdress those terms,

134
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:02,243
are the type of people, you know, you chat with occasionally.

135
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:06,667
Maybe they're your Twitter mutuals or friends on Facebook, somebody's business card, somebody

136
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:10,471
that you've spoken with but you don't necessarily have a close relationship with.

137
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:15,573
The important thing to think about is it's not like strong ties are better than weak ties

138
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:19,294
because in his paper, he actually, you can, you know, this is freely available online,

139
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:23,635
you can actually, but he, he makes the point that you're much more likely to get a job

140
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,156
through random acquaintances than with your close friends.

141
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:29,196
So both of these types of people are...

142
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:31,979
extremely useful in your life, in your career,

143
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,882
and people moving back and forth

144
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:36,304
through weak ties and strong ties.

145
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,006
And I like to just think about it,

146
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:40,769
your close friends, the people you chat with regularly,

147
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,613
and the people who you maybe chat with through online.

148
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,776
And they're absolutely both valuable,

149
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:48,818
and you wanna make sure you're networking with both

150
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,820
and kind of keep those equal.

151
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:52,501
All right, enough science.

152
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,482
So like I mentioned, you always want to keep

153
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:55,942
the individuals in mind.

154
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,282
So remembering the people.

155
00:06:57,462 --> 00:07:01,343
So also, you need to be really careful about subscribing

156
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:03,404
to adding value to people.

157
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:06,364
Oh, this person is more valuable to talk with that person.

158
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:08,625
Or I don't need to spend my time with that person.

159
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:09,865
That's completely false.

160
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:13,006
And also, like I said, that paper proves the opposite.

161
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:16,827
The people who you don't know can actually connect you

162
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:18,807
to those other strong networks.

163
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:21,388
Because everybody has those strong core network.

164
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:29,172
networks. And having those, you know, those different friends that, you know, you chat

165
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:33,195
with occasionally can connect you to those strong networks. And what that does is that

166
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,175
expands your network.

167
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,815
So you wanna make sure that there's,

168
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,876
you remember that there's value

169
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,297
in each and every conversation.

170
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:44,677
You can chat with somebody,

171
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,058
and it might lead to a conversation two years down the road,

172
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:49,119
but if you just kind of brush them off and say,

173
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,780
oh, well, they're not in 3D modeling,

174
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,182
or they're not in advanced graphics programming,

175
00:07:57,382 --> 00:07:58,642
which is what I wanna get into,

176
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:01,163
so maybe I don't wanna spend my time talking with them,

177
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:02,884
that's not something you wanna do.

178
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:04,104
You wanna chat with everybody,

179
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:04,885
and just...

180
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,552
Keep, you know, people in your network,

181
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,519
keep up with them occasionally,

182
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,565
and you never know where those connections might lead.

183
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:15,396
All right, so, when you're networking,

184
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:16,557
one of the things that, you know,

185
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:19,238
with me surveying people and experiencing myself,

186
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:20,839
is feeling comfortable.

187
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,501
Me, I'm an extrovert, and so I like talking with people.

188
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:27,042
I like, you know, being around with people,

189
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:28,102
interacting with people.

190
00:08:28,523 --> 00:08:29,783
But a lot of my friends, actually,

191
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:32,625
I think most of my friends in games identify as introverts.

192
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,125
And so one thing you can do

193
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:35,286
when you're going around networking

194
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,727
is if you have an extroverted friend,

195
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:38,928
is go, you know, with the buddy system.

196
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:42,210
Ask your friend, hey, do you mind if I tag along?

197
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,992
And we go to this party, we go to this networking event.

198
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:46,513
It can help both people.

199
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:49,695
The more extroverted person can do the introductions.

200
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:51,536
The introverted person doesn't necessarily

201
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:52,857
need to overextend themselves.

202
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:54,458
And you can kind of tag team.

203
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:56,360
Also, as you're both networking,

204
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,121
you both have different core networks.

205
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:02,364
And so with those powers combined,

206
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:04,125
you're like a super networker, I guess.

207
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:07,767
So, you know, the buddy system works really well.

208
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,047
You know, when you're networking with people,

209
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,308
you also want to try to avoid in-jokes, you know,

210
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:13,148
or inside jokes.

211
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:14,809
Those are things that can kind of, you know,

212
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:16,730
squash the conversation, you know.

213
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,110
You and your friends start laughing,

214
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,831
and everybody else is standing there like,

215
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:20,751
you know, what's going on?

216
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:21,771
Am I supposed to laugh?

217
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,752
I don't know anything about this.

218
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:24,472
So you want to try to avoid in-jokes,

219
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:25,813
make sure that you're being inclusive

220
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,673
and that everybody feels accepted.

221
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:29,654
So another really cool thing,

222
00:09:29,754 --> 00:09:31,735
and I had kind of realized this myself,

223
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,495
and then in doing research, I found a name for it,

224
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:34,496
but there's something,

225
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:39,590
called the Pac-Man Rule by Eric Holscher.

226
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,051
And basically what the Pac-Man Rule is,

227
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:43,471
if you're networking with people,

228
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,212
if you're chatting and you're standing in a circle,

229
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,273
always leave one slice of that pizza pie

230
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:49,833
or one slice of that Pac-Man open.

231
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:51,154
And that does a couple of things.

232
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:54,977
One, it lets people feel like they're able to walk up

233
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:55,937
and join that circle.

234
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:56,978
So it makes it inclusive.

235
00:09:57,018 --> 00:09:59,440
It makes it not like somebody has to break the barrier

236
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,822
to try to just make eye-to-eye contact

237
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:02,542
and chat with somebody.

238
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:02,782
Oops.

239
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:05,885
So when you have the Pac-Man rule,

240
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:09,187
it allows somebody to feel open

241
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:10,628
to approach that conversation

242
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:12,209
and allows you to talk with people

243
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:14,371
who might not have felt comfortable

244
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:16,132
approaching that group before.

245
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:22,199
Also, the other thing about the Pac-Man rule is it allows somebody to quietly excuse themselves.

246
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:25,863
You know, I've had this as well, you know, you're networking with people and you just

247
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:28,926
feel like, you know, that anxiety building up, you're like, I need to steal away for

248
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:32,070
a minute, or you know, you have a phone call and you don't want to, you know, interrupt

249
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,931
a good conversation.

250
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:37,035
If you have that slice always open and you know, you're opening it when, you know, people

251
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:38,757
are coming in and joining your circle.

252
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,181
it allows somebody to just slip out easily

253
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,024
and it just lets everybody feel more comfortable.

254
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:45,208
So as you're doing that, make sure all you need to do

255
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,232
is just take a small step to the right or left

256
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:50,337
and leave a slice for a person to hop in.

257
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:55,098
And then the last tip is make sure you take the time you need it.

258
00:10:56,359 --> 00:11:00,282
I especially felt this, you know, like with my first GDC, I felt like I need to network,

259
00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:01,223
network, network, network.

260
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:02,464
I need to meet all these people.

261
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:04,646
And then at the end of the day, you're just like dead.

262
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:06,627
It's okay to steal away for a minute.

263
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,088
It's okay to take time to yourself.

264
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:11,671
You don't need to, you know, have permission and you're not going to miss out on anything

265
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:15,475
because if you're overextending yourself, you're not going to be the best you, you know.

266
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:17,256
You might be a little bit grumpy.

267
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:20,719
You might not, you know, be able to answer questions as adequately.

268
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,162
So you wanna make sure that when you need it,

269
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:25,823
you're taking time away for yourself.

270
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:29,186
The other thing is, it's not a race or a marathon,

271
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:29,846
it's your career.

272
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:32,748
So this one networking event is a series

273
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,230
of networking events that will happen throughout your career.

274
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:38,393
So if you need to take half a day for self-care

275
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:41,335
to just stay in your bunk and just play Switch

276
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,057
or something like that, absolutely do that.

277
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:44,758
That will keep you refreshed for the next day

278
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:50,022
and make you, and keep yourself healthy ongoing.

279
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,327
Alright, um, starting or joining a conversation. So, this is one that, you know, I also

280
00:11:56,367 --> 00:12:01,095
spoke with a lot of people and, you know, a lot of people, um, you know, have anxiety about or,

281
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:02,056
you know, feel uncomfortable.

282
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:05,730
One of the easiest ways to just start a conversation

283
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,212
is just make eye contact and say hi.

284
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:10,434
If somebody looks like they're open for conversation,

285
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:14,457
if somebody is off in a corner on their cell phone,

286
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,199
you wanna make sure you're respectful

287
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:17,560
and you don't wanna interrupt them

288
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,322
or you don't wanna hover right next to them.

289
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:21,264
But it's okay to just say hi to somebody

290
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:22,365
and see what the response is.

291
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:24,727
And the response usually is a really good gauge

292
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:25,888
on how they're feeling.

293
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:28,229
and whether they're open for conversation.

294
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,971
The other really important thing is,

295
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:32,531
if the person doesn't seem receptive,

296
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,472
it's nothing against you.

297
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:37,534
It's really easy to feel like,

298
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:39,375
oh, I should have been standing over here,

299
00:12:39,395 --> 00:12:41,376
or I should have said it this way,

300
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:42,457
I just kind of blew it,

301
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:43,677
but you want to make sure

302
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:45,578
that you're not reflecting back on yourself.

303
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:47,139
Maybe the person was having a bad day,

304
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,601
maybe they had a whole host of things bothering them.

305
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:51,222
You don't want to have that reflect on yourself

306
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,483
and take that further.

307
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:58,294
If you join a circle and you don't know where to start,

308
00:12:58,714 --> 00:12:59,815
ask a question.

309
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:03,017
You can ask, say, what are you excited about

310
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:04,518
at this conference?

311
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:07,420
Or are there any talks you're looking forward to going to?

312
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:10,422
And those are unconventional questions

313
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,264
to start the conversation going.

314
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:17,527
Then inevitably, that will lead into questions

315
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,589
about what the person is studying

316
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,090
or what they practice in the workplace.

317
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,070
And you can kind of,

318
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:24,732
continue the conversation from there.

319
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:28,754
Another way to start or join a conversation

320
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:30,075
is if there's some people talking,

321
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:31,456
politely walking up and say,

322
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:33,097
hey, do you mind if I join your conversation?

323
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:35,198
That's probably one of the best ways

324
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:37,399
to just join a conversation,

325
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:38,680
whether it be with strangers

326
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,661
or people you don't really know well.

327
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:42,702
If they're having a specific conversation.

328
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:44,924
They might say, oh, not right now,

329
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,705
maybe come around in five minutes or something.

330
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:49,247
Or the best result is, oh yeah, come,

331
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:50,808
we're talking about X or Y.

332
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:53,951
And just being polite and approaching people direct,

333
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:58,474
I think is one of the best ways to join a conversation

334
00:13:58,654 --> 00:13:59,855
and to connect with different people.

335
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:13,058
All right, so another one that kind of goes along

336
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,660
with the things we were just talking about

337
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,481
is making mistakes.

338
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:17,043
We're all human.

339
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:18,245
We all make mistakes.

340
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:20,508
We all accidentally say the wrong thing.

341
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,331
You know, it might come across the wrong way.

342
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:25,535
You know, we might say something we're embarrassed about,

343
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:25,615
but.

344
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:31,011
If you say something and you think somebody might be offended, just apologize.

345
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:34,115
Say, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for that to come out the wrong way.

346
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:37,059
Or I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

347
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,882
And just leave it at that.

348
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:42,425
Make sure when you're apologizing you don't use the word if.

349
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:45,807
That makes it conditional, which is not a real apology.

350
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:48,468
So don't say, oh, I'm sorry if you were offended.

351
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,768
I'm sorry you were offended.

352
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:51,629
I'm sorry that I said that.

353
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:53,930
Make sure you put yourself in the apology

354
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,131
and let the other person know.

355
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,212
So whether it's you say something rude,

356
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:01,453
you misgender somebody, the next thing to do

357
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,954
is just don't dwell on it.

358
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:06,335
The last thing you do is, if everybody's a little bit

359
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:07,375
embarrassed and whatnot, is to.

360
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:11,259
keep on apologizing. You don't want to keep on apologizing throughout the whole conversation.

361
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:17,484
Just that one apology is absolutely fine. You can kind of move on and go from there. And you know,

362
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:22,149
the person, if you give a heartfelt apology, they'll feel that and you know, continue on.

363
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:26,833
And it's not like you make one mistake and you're kicked out or anything like that. It's, you know,

364
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:30,856
we're all human. We make mistakes. And, you know, that empathy when you're really connecting with

365
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,679
people. And like I said earlier, being, you know, genuine.

366
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,533
excuse me, will help those conversations

367
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,717
and in those situations.

368
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:43,680
All right, reaching out.

369
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,623
So a lot of times when we're networking,

370
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:49,967
we have specific, we might have a specific goal

371
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:53,451
or a specific intent that we're looking forward to.

372
00:15:55,077 --> 00:15:58,540
If there's anybody you are interested in talking with

373
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,942
for advice, input, material review,

374
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,645
whether a portfolio, your demo reel or something like that,

375
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:08,588
the most important thing to do is just ask.

376
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,090
A lot of times we're like, oh, it'd be so cool

377
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,472
if I could talk with so and so about my portfolio

378
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:14,292
or this or that.

379
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:17,255
And if you just ask, a lot of times people

380
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:18,235
are receptive to that.

381
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:21,998
Excuse me.

382
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:25,655
So you wanna reach out through whatever channels

383
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:28,656
you have available to connect with this person.

384
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:31,216
That might be emails, that might be a DM,

385
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,137
or like we were talking about before,

386
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:34,857
it might be that extended network.

387
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:36,338
You have your core network here.

388
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,198
Everybody else has their core networks,

389
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:40,899
and if you're interacting with people,

390
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:42,499
you might say, hey, do you know how to get

391
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,779
in contact with so and so?

392
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:45,519
I was interested in talking with them

393
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,260
about X or Y or something like that.

394
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,180
And that kinda goes with the next thing.

395
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:52,599
you want to be respectful of others' times.

396
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,840
So if there's a dev that is prolific

397
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,620
and you're really looking forward to chatting with,

398
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:01,181
you want to make sure that you keep it short.

399
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:04,482
So a perfect introduction is, like we said,

400
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:07,943
walk up, say hi, hey, I'd like to introduce myself.

401
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,124
I'm so-and-so.

402
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:15,986
I really enjoyed your game X and it influenced my design

403
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:17,406
and thank you so much for working on it.

404
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:18,766
And it was nice chatting with you.

405
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:21,628
And that's a complete conversation in one.

406
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:23,590
That's a really quick way to engage with people.

407
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,313
And the nice thing about it is,

408
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:28,714
if that person's feeling receptive,

409
00:17:29,154 --> 00:17:30,695
they can continue that conversation.

410
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,638
And if not, they'll say, hey, thanks so much for talking.

411
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:36,980
And like I said earlier, it's not reflecting on yourself.

412
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,163
They might have a business meeting they're going to

413
00:17:40,203 --> 00:17:40,923
or something like that.

414
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,266
So that's always a really good way to connect with people.

415
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:49,449
Um, after you meet with people you want to make sure you follow up. Uh, email is probably

416
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:54,054
the best because of the, the permanence of it. When you send an email, uh, that sticks

417
00:17:54,094 --> 00:17:58,579
around forever. You know, slack, things get lost, Twitter DMs, things get lost, and email,

418
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,744
people can refer back to, especially if, you know, they're busy, it's easier for them to go

419
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:04,747
back and find it. So, always prefer email.

420
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:08,683
Also, whenever you're asking someone for advice

421
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:11,646
on something, make sure you tell them

422
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:12,947
what you're looking for advice for.

423
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,549
So, hey, I'd like to talk to you about 3D modeling,

424
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,590
and if you don't hear back,

425
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:19,572
maybe reach out in a week or two

426
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:22,174
and do one follow-up email.

427
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:23,335
That's absolutely appropriate.

428
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:28,219
But when you mention what you are looking for feedback for,

429
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,560
that makes it easier for that person

430
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,641
to plan and engage with.

431
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:32,402
Maybe they have a round table or something like that.

432
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:35,337
All right, so kind of wrapping things up.

433
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:37,478
Remember you're networking with people.

434
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:39,579
Every single conversation you have,

435
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:41,639
whether it be professional,

436
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:43,680
whether it be a casual conversation,

437
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,901
they're all people of different backgrounds,

438
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:48,983
different ethnicities, different genders.

439
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,223
You wanna make sure that you're thinking about

440
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:51,544
the people you're talking with

441
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,645
and making sure that everybody's comfortable

442
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,565
in those conversations.

443
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:58,367
Meeting people from your extended network

444
00:18:58,508 --> 00:18:59,948
is the way to meet others.

445
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:01,710
So as you're networking with people,

446
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,531
you're growing that extended network.

447
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:05,652
And if you have something you need,

448
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:07,634
and you're genuinely connecting with people,

449
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,215
it's okay to reach out and ask and say,

450
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,336
hey, I was looking to see if I could connect

451
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:12,557
with somebody from X company,

452
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:14,538
or I could connect with this developer

453
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:16,900
to talk about this very specific design goal

454
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,580
or something like that.

455
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:21,816
And the people, the more people you meet,

456
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:23,457
the stronger your network becomes.

457
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:26,279
Like I said, this network is part of your career,

458
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:28,180
and it's not something that you need to get

459
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,921
all the networking in at this expo

460
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:32,002
and you never have any networking time ever.

461
00:19:32,642 --> 00:19:34,583
It's you have this networking opportunity

462
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:35,964
and that networking opportunity

463
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:37,385
and the next networking opportunity,

464
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,726
and each time your network grows and gets stronger.

465
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:42,668
So remember, have fun, connect with people,

466
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:44,629
and continue to network.

467
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,170
All right, thank you.
