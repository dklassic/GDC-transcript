1
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:04,244
Hello?

2
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:06,105
Hey, everyone.

3
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:11,669
Welcome to the first of many Owlboy talks at this GDC.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,110
Woo!

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:13,690
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:15,211
Only good things.

7
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:20,155
I have the pleasure to introduce you to two of the D-pad.

8
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:20,956
There's more of you, right?

9
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:21,956
Yeah.

10
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:22,317
Yeah.

11
00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:25,519
Two of the D-pad guys, Yoremi and Simon,

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,021
who are here to tell you about the art of Owlboy.

13
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:28,421
Let's hear it.

14
00:00:34,544 --> 00:00:35,505
So, hello.

15
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:38,948
So I've been told to instruct everyone.

16
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,711
So if you're all huddled on the edges here,

17
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:44,013
whenever you come into the room,

18
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:45,855
try to get more close to the middle.

19
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:47,777
Just, it's easier for everyone.

20
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:50,420
So, but if you're comfortable where you are, that's fine.

21
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:55,835
So today is going to be kind of a low-key presentation,

22
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:56,275
I would say.

23
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:59,876
We're going to be showing you everything

24
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,517
that we've been doing for the past nine years,

25
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,339
the small little changes that we've been going through.

26
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,300
And we're going to be showing you

27
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,461
some videos of how terrible things were

28
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:12,202
and how not so terrible things are now.

29
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:15,503
So first, let's have a look at how

30
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:18,925
the world has evolved these last 10 years

31
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:20,225
that we've been working on the game.

32
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:22,042
This guy was president.

33
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,083
So...

34
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:28,224
And this little thing appeared.

35
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:32,106
Yeah, I think we started right before that thing was announced.

36
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:32,366
Yeah.

37
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,627
So, the rise of smartphones, and

38
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:39,709
Allboy actually lived through the entirety of the console generation.

39
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:43,750
We originally signed Allboy to be on Xbox.

40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:52,370
Yeah, we were one of the first indie development projects that actually used XNA, and we've

41
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,012
outlived that programming language.

42
00:01:56,375 --> 00:02:02,042
So, and back in the day, the first time we started traveling around was when we got nominated

43
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:02,562
for EIGF.

44
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:09,427
And after that we got a taste of showing the game around and just getting feedback on it.

45
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:13,969
So every time we would come back from anything, like an event or something,

46
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:19,831
we would return with books full of scribbles and notes and feedback that we wanted to work on.

47
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:25,292
Yeah, and you have to remember that we started as a Norwegian independent studio,

48
00:02:25,632 --> 00:02:28,453
and back then, indie development didn't really exist.

49
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:35,834
Neither did all of the goods and great stuff like engines that you had back then.

50
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:40,555
So we kind of had to start from scratch, and there were not...

51
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,575
Video game courses didn't really exist back then.

52
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:48,416
So when we got the IGF nomination, on one hand it was a big honor,

53
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:49,857
we didn't win it, that's fine.

54
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:55,093
But it ended up opening the eyes of a lot of other people, especially Norwegians.

55
00:02:55,293 --> 00:03:02,136
So the same year, I think we also won Game of the Year for Owlboy in 2010.

56
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,679
That was the year we walked around on the streets of Trondheim with a giant

57
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:12,021
Czech next to a bunch of drunk people, so that was fun.

58
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:15,463
And then we ended up showing the game everywhere.

59
00:03:16,254 --> 00:03:18,775
And at this point, we are completely green.

60
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:21,197
We've never made a big commercial project before.

61
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:23,198
So here we are.

62
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:24,819
We were going to make this big game.

63
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,022
So we ended up making a demo because we

64
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,044
thought we were reaching the end of the line.

65
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:36,647
So we wanted people to actually look what the game looked like.

66
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:38,087
And this was in 2011.

67
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:42,710
So I'm just going to show you a little bit of what the game

68
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,331
actually looked like back then.

69
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,991
Low key.

70
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:56,535
So this is our 2011 demo.

71
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:57,395
Yeah.

72
00:03:57,936 --> 00:03:59,517
So just a show of hands.

73
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:01,818
How many people have played Owlboy?

74
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,879
Yes, there's people here.

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,601
How many played the original demo?

76
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,361
All right.

77
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:11,282
Oh, then the rest of you in for a treat.

78
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:11,823
Yeah.

79
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:15,510
So this is Owlboy as it appeared in 2011.

80
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,791
So you just fly a little around here.

81
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:21,912
This guy appears out of nowhere.

82
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:24,573
Yeah, there's no explanation why he does that.

83
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,474
We were very smart with our level design back then

84
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:32,015
because right before we released it we removed the tutorial.

85
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:36,217
So we had to teach people to do this somehow

86
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,118
and we just added signposts everywhere

87
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:40,378
which no one read and got very frustrated at us for.

88
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:43,776
I can't actually remember how to play this.

89
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:51,362
So one of the things that you did back then was you killed your partner.

90
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:57,048
You could only teleport your friend in if you even figured out how to do that when you

91
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,949
were on the ground, which is really frustrating.

92
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,533
Everything is kind of clunky and you have sort of a set limit for how fast you can shoot

93
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:03,894
bullets.

94
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:11,575
So one of the first things that we did after we released the demo was actually add an entire new dungeon

95
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:15,080
Just to teach the player how to play the game. So

96
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:18,585
right now I'm going to just switch over to

97
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:21,329
Owlboy as it appears today

98
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:39,351
So one of the first things that we did.

99
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,878
Can we full screen that?

100
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:41,561
Yeah, we can.

101
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,224
was we had to reprogram the whole game

102
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:53,606
because widescreen, believe it or not,

103
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,927
was actually not very common back then.

104
00:05:56,688 --> 00:06:00,710
So initially we started Outboy out in a resolution of 800

105
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:06,634
times 600, which actually, if you see it in widescreen,

106
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:08,755
the whole game, since it's pixel art,

107
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:10,416
would make the character look.

108
00:06:11,398 --> 00:06:12,939
Extremely weird.

109
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,580
And yeah, so one of the things we had to do

110
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,121
was go around in the game and resize rooms

111
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:19,981
and do everything.

112
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,522
Since it's a 2D game, it's not that easy

113
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:25,003
to just make it widescreen.

114
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:28,644
And I should mention that when we released the demo,

115
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:31,104
because we had never developed a project before,

116
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:32,925
when people came out and said that,

117
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,346
oh, this looks nice, this means it has X and X in it,

118
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:39,367
that meant that we had to put those things in it.

119
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:44,410
So we started developing like giant rooms,

120
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,892
big free roaming areas, that sort of thing.

121
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:50,054
But one of the other things was it didn't live up

122
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:52,675
to the quality that people were expecting, not really.

123
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:55,557
So one of the first things we started to do

124
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:58,439
was really, really polish things.

125
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:01,948
So as you can see, when you look at it,

126
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:04,310
it just looks like a screenshot, right?

127
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:06,713
This is, it's entirely static,

128
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:09,857
except for Otis twiddling his thumbs.

129
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:12,620
So what we started to do was find ways

130
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,722
for the game to feel more alive.

131
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:15,964
So we added,

132
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,026
movement to clouds in the background.

133
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:23,928
Because the entire game actually has these clouds

134
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:26,629
in the background, which instantly makes it,

135
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,290
you know, come more alive.

136
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,191
But we wanted to go one step further,

137
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:34,632
and if you look deep into the background there,

138
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:37,413
there's some clouds in the parallel layer as well.

139
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,034
So we started moving those around,

140
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:44,096
and started to, you know, find stuff in the levels

141
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:45,816
that we could give life to.

142
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:51,850
And another thing is we wanted things to have this kind of floaty feel.

143
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:58,494
So if I go here, you also have these parallax things that also can float.

144
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:04,317
So if I turn those off, you see it becomes pretty lifeless more or less immediately.

145
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:07,829
Yeah, pretty much everything that we started adding,

146
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:10,191
we wanted to feel like not only that you were there,

147
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:12,492
but that you could interact with everything.

148
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,195
One of the earlier design decisions that we came up with

149
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:21,038
was that we were not going to use portraits

150
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:22,199
whenever people spoke.

151
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:24,120
We needed all those animations to be

152
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,901
within the characters themselves.

153
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:28,803
And one of those things that,

154
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:34,347
The benefits of doing that is now everything felt physical.

155
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:37,330
Everything felt like whenever you touch something

156
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,631
that was in the actual world.

157
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:41,794
So you could, it made us focus a lot

158
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:43,255
on where character placement was.

159
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:47,638
So the next step was, let's see.

160
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:53,407
we had to figure out a way because the game was actually,

161
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:56,989
when you scale up pixel art, it gets kind of jagged.

162
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,671
If you look at the clouds and stuff in the background,

163
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:02,693
they all like chip a little bit away.

164
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,975
But Henrik, our tech programmer,

165
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:09,577
he found a way to make it way more smoother.

166
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:13,139
So if you compare it like this, it goes like choppy.

167
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,741
But once you have the smoothing on,

168
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,042
it actually kind of looks nice.

169
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:19,603
And this is kind of a difficult technical achievement.

170
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:22,605
A lot of people, when they see pixel art,

171
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,267
they say that it has to be exactly within the pixels,

172
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:27,308
which is what we did.

173
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:30,410
We just changed the algorithm to make it appear smoother.

174
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,031
It's a lot more complicated than it sounds.

175
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,743
So the next step was to, let's see, whenever we display the demo to people,

176
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:47,405
they would say that the character art looks kind of clunky when he moves around.

177
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:50,326
So this is how it works in the old demo.

178
00:09:50,826 --> 00:09:53,327
He just, you know, shifts direction immediately.

179
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:57,409
But we added animations for him to, you know, make little turns.

180
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:02,151
And, you know, when he flies in the air, he actually goes from side to side, flipping.

181
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:05,273
And this is what it looked like in the old one.

182
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:11,398
So suddenly he gained a little more weight.

183
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:15,242
Yeah, I think it was an old complaint that we had,

184
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,724
that someone said that his animation frames,

185
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:19,626
that he didn't have enough when he was flying.

186
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:21,307
So I took that as a challenge and I added like 200.

187
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:32,316
So, on the final stage of, you know, getting the game to look like there was actual life in there, was to add wind.

188
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:33,118
So...

189
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,677
We, yeah, Simon?

190
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:42,461
Yeah, essentially, this is gonna get a little technical,

191
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:43,742
but most of you will understand this.

192
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:47,425
In the old NES days, you could shift palettes

193
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:51,288
on background objects to make them appear like they move.

194
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:53,570
It was a really nice way to save memory.

195
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,572
So we did something similar in the sense

196
00:10:56,632 --> 00:11:00,175
that every single object can have multiple textures,

197
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,596
and we can animate those.

198
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:09,343
And we took it one step further by doing it so that every single texture while it's being animated can be contextually interacted with

199
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:15,708
So that means that we can set the motion of the wind where it's coming from you can hit

200
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:22,473
Bushes now if you have an object you can pick it up throwing into it. It'll spawn more particles and react to it accordingly

201
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:24,235
so

202
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:27,697
I think we went overboard

203
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,039
Maybe

204
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:39,623
But we had to keep up because the pixel art and the games were evolving as we were working on Owlboy.

205
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:47,908
So in order to release Owlboy now to modern consoles and to PC,

206
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:55,753
we had to do that extra bit of work to make sure that the game was up to modern standards.

207
00:11:56,112 --> 00:12:08,118
And you have to remember, I didn't say this at the beginning, but the point of Owlboy was to find a way to bring pixel art back into the public consciousness and kind of elevate it to the level that people expected it to be.

208
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:12,820
And when you've developed a game for nine years, that expectation changes a little bit.

209
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:20,764
Yeah, so we ended up, let's see here.

210
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:33,258
We ended up maybe over-improving on the game because of Owlboy's lengthy development.

211
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:37,141
Simon was actually getting better and better at doing pixel art.

212
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:44,026
So at some point he said, let's try to depict Otis as I would have done him today.

213
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:49,351
He posted it on Twitter and the fans went, no.

214
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:53,368
Yeah, because they didn't want me to redo the entire thing.

215
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:56,392
And I don't blame them, because there's like 800 custom

216
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:57,093
animations for them.

217
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:00,097
There were, in fact, a lot of things

218
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:04,102
that we had to sort of dumb down a little bit,

219
00:13:04,622 --> 00:13:07,686
because I was working with eight-year-old sprites

220
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:08,867
and eight-year-old animations.

221
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:11,729
So I changed a few of them, but you can't change everything.

222
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:17,092
So if you play the game, you'll notice that throughout the later areas and the very beginning,

223
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:21,354
the quality is a little different than sort of the middle parts.

224
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:28,141
So at some point we just had to say, okay, we gotta stop now.

225
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,922
We have to find a deadline for a game

226
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:36,644
and we have to figure out a way to cut down on our work

227
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:38,784
because we had actually originally...

228
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:46,728
a lot of ideas that would extend the game, like we had planned for this huge huge city called

229
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:53,852
Advent, which was gonna have, you know, a bunch of different characters, a theater, side quests, and

230
00:13:54,672 --> 00:14:00,095
even like Minecraft was getting really popular at the time, so we wanted to add crafting to the game.

231
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:06,840
Yeah, there was literally a point where we considered breaking it apart and then constructing

232
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,622
chains to pull it back together again with a little furnace.

233
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:11,924
These assets are actually in the game.

234
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,125
I'm surprised no one's found them yet.

235
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:22,159
So what we ended up doing, because this was at a point in our lives where we were getting kind of desperate,

236
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:31,363
and things kind of took a turning point because we were just trying to find our way.

237
00:14:31,743 --> 00:14:36,225
And at that point we started discussing, so what can we do?

238
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:45,651
First off, I'm just going to show you because we actually ended up fully animating and adding Advent as a city.

239
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:52,795
We just didn't... Let's see. Here we go.

240
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:59,720
So this is sort of a look at what Advent would have looked like had we completed it on track.

241
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:02,434
So this is just the main hub area.

242
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:06,096
You guys see this as a brief moment

243
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:10,777
when you arrive in game, but you never saw this.

244
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:14,099
This was supposed to be a full theater area

245
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,819
where you could bring one of your companions

246
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,900
and put on plays.

247
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,641
We actually prototyped this,

248
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:22,082
but it's not finished enough to show off.

249
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:24,163
No, this is the first time we show it off.

250
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:31,792
This is a plant mechanic, because we didn't settle on the vegetables and things that you could eat in the game right away.

251
00:15:32,313 --> 00:15:37,697
So you were supposed to bring seeds, plant them, watch this thing grow, water it, and then eat them.

252
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:39,978
We're very practical.

253
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,163
So, I think we can end it there.

254
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:48,525
We're going to post this video online.

255
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:50,966
Like, even the music is unused in the game.

256
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:54,289
So, we're going to reveal this later on.

257
00:15:54,943 --> 00:16:00,326
Yeah, in fact a lot of the themes I think they make them into the soundtrack, but we never actually used them in the game.

258
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:00,726
Yeah.

259
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:01,547
Very frustrating.

260
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:06,489
So at one point, this is Tender by the way, hello.

261
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:14,973
And at some point we decided to cut down on all of the content in the game.

262
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:17,515
And the important thing here is that...

263
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:23,614
We did this deliberately not to cut content necessarily,

264
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:26,797
but because it ended up being the best thing

265
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:28,117
that we could do for the story.

266
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:30,259
And in fact, we've cut tons of stuff

267
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,100
that most of you will probably say,

268
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,561
I want to play that anyway,

269
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:36,903
but would have destroyed any kind of context in the game.

270
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:38,904
We'll show you some of that later, but this is one of them.

271
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:40,345
So this is what happened to Adler.

272
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:12,643
That was a lot of parallax layers.

273
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:16,945
So at this point we

274
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,541
we knew that we would be able to finish Owlboy.

275
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:29,608
But, let's see here.

276
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,171
But the tone of the game changed

277
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:37,194
because at that point, like I said,

278
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:38,575
we were kind of distraught

279
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:43,138
and a lot of personal things were kind of, you know,

280
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:48,802
uh intervening so we kind of felt that we had failed a lot of people

281
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:55,390
Yeah, I've never really had any problem saying that.

282
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,511
I've been struggling with depression for pretty much my entire life.

283
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:04,033
And when you're, I think it was seven years into the project at that point,

284
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:07,734
that was probably the lowest I've ever felt in my life.

285
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:12,016
And you were going through some very difficult things as well.

286
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:16,417
Yeah, one of my best friends died out of a heart attack.

287
00:18:17,992 --> 00:18:25,697
in his 30s and one of the things that sparked the you know that the part where we destroy advent was

288
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:30,440
part of because I felt like my life had been destroyed right in front of my eyes

289
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,843
so that's kind of how this tone changed happened.

290
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:51,235
Yeah, we also realized, I think I've said this other places, but roughly, I think it was either three or two years before we finished the game, we finally found the red line that connects the entire Owlboy story, and that was the story of friendship.

291
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:56,740
And it sounds very hokey, but it is what kept us together while we were developing it.

292
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:59,162
So we had a lot of things we could relate to.

293
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:03,025
And we ended up rewriting a lot of roles.

294
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:05,766
In fact, this is a little anecdote,

295
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:09,989
but Geddy, the character you see next to you in the game, if you've played it,

296
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,710
you know that he's your best friend,

297
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,973
he's this fantastic guy that sticks up for you no matter what.

298
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:18,955
In the original game, he didn't know who you were.

299
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:24,432
You introduce yourself at the start and he's just some random guy that ends up tagging along.

300
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:26,054
This was a very late change.

301
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:27,175
You're along with Otis, aren't you?

302
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:37,042
Yeah, it was kind of the red thread that we found that brought all the story and the characters together.

303
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:43,306
But we also had a lot of the things that had been haunting us.

304
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:47,527
You know, the part where we had been trying to get this game out since 2011

305
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:53,630
and again and again promised people and those we cared about that this game is coming out.

306
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:01,273
So we wrote an entire intro sequence just depicting this feeling that we were failing.

307
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:08,103
And it just so happened, it wasn't just that we went in and changed it just because we had a change of heart.

308
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:10,945
It just so happened that everything ended up coinciding.

309
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:19,894
We had this story of a mute owl that couldn't live up to his mentor's expectations already,

310
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:24,819
but finally we felt like we could completely resonate with that kind of feeling.

311
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:29,851
And we also had, you know, there were still things that we wanted to add,

312
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:33,014
even though we decided that, no, now is enough.

313
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:36,036
But Simon, of course, going the extra step,

314
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:41,680
I think half of these characters are ready to go into the game

315
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,563
with animations done, but we ended up scratching a lot of them.

316
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:48,445
Yeah, I can point to a few of them.

317
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:50,606
This will probably end up on the Owlboy Reddit at some point.

318
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:58,267
So on the left here you can see there's a guy with a little he's got like dreads

319
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:04,069
and little thing going on top of his head in the school that you visit mid

320
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,850
game this guy was supposed to give you information on all the different enemies

321
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,591
that you need didn't end up adding him because you know the town blew up.

322
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:17,326
The guy that plays the bongos was supposed to have a family

323
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:19,848
living elsewhere in the game,

324
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,730
but you were supposed to interact with them

325
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,392
by wearing little shoes that made sound

326
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:26,653
that you bought in Advent,

327
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,295
and then dance in front of his door.

328
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:31,157
That didn't happen because the city blew up.

329
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:40,383
Buccaneeri, the shopkeep, who has all the little bogwin creatures, was supposed to have

330
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:45,067
a sister with assistants that look sort of like the bogwins.

331
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:51,453
We debated so many times whether or not we were supposed to add her, but again, it just

332
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,474
ended up being cut.

333
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:57,437
And we also have the army general standing next to Otis there,

334
00:21:57,457 --> 00:22:02,279
who was supposed to lead the army bravely into an attack.

335
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,001
Of course, that is his only pose in the entire game.

336
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:08,683
I guess he'll just be disgruntled forever.

337
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:13,708
and then you have the quite large person next to him

338
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:18,509
was the very happy ferry driver,

339
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:22,210
which was supposed to be like a quick travel option

340
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,470
between all the different areas.

341
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,551
But it turns out, when you cut the game down

342
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:29,212
to be easily maneuverable,

343
00:22:29,272 --> 00:22:31,812
you don't need an entire section to drive around in a boat.

344
00:22:32,606 --> 00:22:34,066
So he went along the wall.

345
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:37,027
And all the systems for it and everything was in

346
00:22:37,448 --> 00:22:42,289
and it was functioning, but we just ended up not using him.

347
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,150
So, and we also had a shop called the Bogwin Shop,

348
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,651
which was supposed to be littered around the world.

349
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:52,292
And yeah, so we ended up cutting a lot,

350
00:22:52,513 --> 00:22:55,093
but let's see here.

351
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,194
We even ended up cutting

352
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,345
giant boss fights.

353
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,247
One of those boss fights was with Maulstrom.

354
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,751
Now, a lot of the people that have been

355
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:10,932
digging into the game have found a trigger

356
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:12,654
to get this boss fight to work,

357
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:14,596
and have constantly asked us,

358
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:15,977
why didn't you keep this in?

359
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:20,541
And it's essentially that it makes Maulstrom look very dumb.

360
00:23:21,364 --> 00:23:27,873
because he's supposed to be this absolutely indestructible force of nature.

361
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:31,838
He's supposed to be literally a tank that can walk and punch people.

362
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,563
And if you could beat him, then he seems really weak.

363
00:23:36,063 --> 00:23:38,066
But the boss fight was cool, so we're going to show you that.

364
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:38,967
Let's have a look at it.

365
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:59,096
That's Joe, by the way. It's temporary.

366
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:52,532
Yeah, so that's the Maelstrom fight and even though it was kind of functional and working,

367
00:24:53,112 --> 00:24:58,254
we decided that the way we want to depict Maelstrom is, you know, indestructible,

368
00:24:58,454 --> 00:25:05,277
so we had to remove it. But we also had an entire freaking dungeon.

369
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:09,429
Yeah, so for those of you that have finished the game,

370
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:11,931
you know about the last area.

371
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:16,014
What you didn't know is that the floor you walk into

372
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:18,856
when you enter the big hallway was supposed to crack.

373
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:21,578
And you were supposed to fall down into

374
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:24,740
what was essentially like a massive dump chute

375
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,403
of winding cogs and things that were just

376
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:31,344
gonna grind you up into meat paste.

377
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:37,641
And at the end of this thing you were supposed to meet the third guardian

378
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:49,481
So we scrapped him together with I think about seven enemies that were fully functional,

379
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:58,973
the entire dungeon and the entire story to go with it. So that was I think one and a half year wasted.

380
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,782
And I should also mention, in addition to that,

381
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:09,785
we also cut a fourth gunner that you're supposed to have.

382
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:13,067
And the reason we had to cut her was two reasons.

383
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:16,228
One, she was being used for that boss fight,

384
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:19,070
so we had no use for her there.

385
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,651
And the second was that she turned out

386
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:22,592
to be extremely boring to play.

387
00:27:22,832 --> 00:27:25,133
Yeah, we made her way too overpowered.

388
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:29,318
Yeah, for those that know the character, it was supposed to be Kernel.

389
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:30,499
You meet her at the end of the game.

390
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,982
She builds a giant rocket because she's awesome.

391
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:36,045
Yeah, she had a rocket launcher for a weapon.

392
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:40,269
Which I think Buccaneer ended up using at the final game.

393
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:40,530
Yeah.

394
00:27:41,384 --> 00:27:46,568
So, but what we were pretty happy with in the end, because we scratched a lot of other

395
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:53,295
stuff too, we had something we call the extra dungeons, which even like up to the final

396
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:56,498
two weeks, we started redoing.

397
00:27:58,317 --> 00:28:03,640
Yeah, it was the, this evolves over the course of the entire project.

398
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,742
We started out with something called the Mega Dungeon, which was essentially you find a

399
00:28:07,782 --> 00:28:12,525
door inside a dungeon and it brings you to a big connecting web that links you to all

400
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:13,245
of the other ones.

401
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,767
We found out that that is insane.

402
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,388
And we ended up cutting that.

403
00:28:19,508 --> 00:28:23,412
So we just decided, OK, our level designer, Adrian Bauer,

404
00:28:24,393 --> 00:28:26,576
ended up making a ton of extra stuff for us

405
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:28,197
throughout the entirety of development.

406
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:30,560
So let's put the rest of the story

407
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,141
that we can't tell in those areas

408
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:34,564
and then put all those bosses and things

409
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:36,846
that we've shown you now in those areas.

410
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:38,008
Sound like a perfect plan.

411
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,830
Turns out that's also a lot of work,

412
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,671
especially when you're on the last year

413
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:43,412
of your development.

414
00:28:44,153 --> 00:28:45,414
So how do we rectify that?

415
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,976
How do we tell the most important key story

416
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:49,117
of the entire game?

417
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,739
And we actually came up with this,

418
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,821
standing outside about to go home,

419
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,803
I think it was like a month before we released?

420
00:28:58,044 --> 00:28:59,985
Yeah, two weeks actually.

421
00:29:01,747 --> 00:29:02,467
Oh. Yeah.

422
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:10,178
So what we ended up doing was that we took one of the more empty areas that we had,

423
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:15,100
that felt very interesting, but we weren't sure what to put in there, and just put all of that

424
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,584
in there. And it turns out that was way more interesting than what we had planned for.

425
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:28,450
Yeah, so finally we felt like we had the game that we would have been happy with.

426
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:35,074
So we ended up shipping the game and finally being, you know, content with it.

427
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:41,837
I wouldn't say a hundred percent content, but you know, that's just how the way we work.

428
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:45,579
The I want to tell the story about this real quick.

429
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:49,921
The on the day that we were launching the game.

430
00:29:51,694 --> 00:29:54,276
I mean we were nervous, no doubt.

431
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:56,377
It didn't really feel real.

432
00:29:56,597 --> 00:29:57,798
So we were standing around,

433
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,541
looking at the download bar of this thing,

434
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:03,143
and then we thought we had everything ready.

435
00:30:03,183 --> 00:30:05,004
We had tested it over and over and over again,

436
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:06,986
and then we hit launch on Steam.

437
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:10,929
But we couldn't tell if it was actually launched.

438
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,251
So how do we do that?

439
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:16,714
Well, we go over to the only computer we have in the office

440
00:30:16,754 --> 00:30:20,036
that doesn't have it downloaded, and we downloaded it.

441
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,072
But it didn't work.

442
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:27,933
So we tried for about half an hour to get this thing down

443
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,774
and watched for roughly 15 minutes

444
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:35,094
whether or not this thing was going to download.

445
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,715
And finally, the second it did and we

446
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,735
could confirm that, yes, it was version 1.1,

447
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:42,336
that's when that happened.

448
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,437
So thank you.
