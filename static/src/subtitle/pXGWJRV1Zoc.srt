1
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:04,316
Oh, it is on.

2
00:00:04,576 --> 00:00:04,916
It is on.

3
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:05,396
Now it is.

4
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:06,077
Hi, guys.

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:08,359
Hi.

6
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:12,322
So my name is Dino Ignacio.

7
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:15,925
I'm the UI lead of the Dead Space franchise.

8
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:21,489
I worked on Dead Space 1, Dead Space 2, and Dead Space 3.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,031
And I'm here to basically walk you

10
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:27,114
through the evolution of the UI of the whole franchise

11
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,976
from the beginning to the third chapter.

12
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:33,310
I've said this before, but I'll say it again.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,750
A few housekeeping notes.

14
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:39,052
It's important for me to let you know if your cell phone is on,

15
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,533
please put it in vibrate.

16
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:45,135
I don't mind you guys taking pictures of the slides,

17
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:46,856
so keep your phones on if you want.

18
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:48,817
Just please put it on vibrate, because it's

19
00:00:48,837 --> 00:00:49,617
going to mess with video.

20
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:56,613
Another thing, please do your surveys when you get them via email.

21
00:00:57,074 --> 00:01:00,656
It's very important for GDC to know exactly what you think of these talks.

22
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:03,578
If they suck, you'll never see these people again.

23
00:01:03,638 --> 00:01:07,520
Like, if I'm horrible at this, all you have to do is say,

24
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,322
this guy was horrible and I'll never be allowed in here again.

25
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:13,804
So please be sure to fill up those things.

26
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:17,346
And if you do like me, please let them know because I'd like to be back.

27
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:18,667
I really would.

28
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:21,448
Okay, another housekeeping note.

29
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,696
If you are here to see crafting success, you are in the wrong room.

30
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:31,321
It's happening right now at room 303, South Hall.

31
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,203
This is crafting destruction.

32
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:37,548
Crafting success is at the South Hall, room 303.

33
00:01:42,388 --> 00:01:47,772
I'd really hate it if you guys are here to see castles and end up seeing carcasses.

34
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:49,473
And that's really not cool.

35
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:53,857
So please, if you may want to run over to the next hall, go ahead.

36
00:01:54,898 --> 00:01:55,158
Okay.

37
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,661
This is the outline of what we're going to be talking about today.

38
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,562
We're going to start off with a very general.

39
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:03,685
We're going to talk about the core ideas of the franchise.

40
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:06,447
And we're going to talk about the aesthetic of the franchise.

41
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:09,509
And then we're going to drill into very specific parts of the UI.

42
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,730
We're going to talk about the rig.

43
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:15,144
and cut it up and explain why it is the way it is.

44
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:16,445
And we're going to talk about the front end.

45
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:21,787
And then we're going to break into this evolution of the look of UI

46
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:23,088
from Dead Space 1 to 3.

47
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:24,929
And then we're going to close on the bench

48
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:29,091
and sort of figure out what worked and what didn't work

49
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:32,712
and how we got around some certain things about the bench.

50
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,493
And then we're going to end with Q&A.

51
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:43,832
Before I can talk about Dead Space UI, I should really relate it to the game as a whole.

52
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:48,634
Dead Space was conceived to be an immersive, story-driven science fiction experience.

53
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:55,679
From the very beginning, when I got hired on, our story producer Chuck Beaver, Ian Millam,

54
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:56,359
our art director.

55
00:02:56,999 --> 00:03:01,021
Ben Winant, our production designer, sort of had this edict.

56
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:05,584
They wanted the game to be as immersive as possible so it had to be grounded in reality

57
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,204
despite the fact that it was science fiction.

58
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:12,787
This is something that they pushed towards the audio department, for the environment

59
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:16,029
department, the lighting department, ultimately also the UI department.

60
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,811
We were all challenged to make the most immersive game we could make.

61
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,212
Here's a little backstory in Dead Space if you haven't played it yet.

62
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:28,994
Dead Space is set in a dystopia, a depleted future,

63
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:33,497
where most of the game happens in a derelict ship called Ishimura.

64
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:38,099
Everyone's dead, and the vessel's plagued by space zombies.

65
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:40,361
And you are an engineer named Isaac Clarke,

66
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,562
and your job is to fix the vessel.

67
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:46,624
On a side thing, you realize your girlfriend's there,

68
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:47,425
and you try to save her.

69
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:52,554
So knowing the core and the backstory of the game,

70
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,097
we decided the UI needed to fully support and integrate

71
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:57,158
with the rest of the game.

72
00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:59,539
So we designed Ishimura as a character.

73
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,362
The character of the ship was supposed

74
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:06,044
to be this broken, unpredictable machine

75
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:07,364
that you had to deal with.

76
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:09,886
And if the Ishimura was a character,

77
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:12,188
the UI became its voice.

78
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,384
And the science fiction setting afforded us the license to use very diegetic...

79
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:24,869
approaches for the UI. So, before I go any deeper, I should really explain what

80
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:30,371
diegetic is for some people who don't know what it is. So, diegetic means the

81
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:35,292
element exists both for the character in the fiction and for the audience. So,

82
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:39,253
imagine this, like you were watching that Star Trek movie by J.J. Abrams in the

83
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:44,434
very beginning, you see Kirk steal that car from his father-in-law and he turns

84
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,915
on the radio and as he turns it on you hear beastie boys blaring and that music

85
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,235
belongs to Kirk.

86
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:54,837
as the character. But then the camera cuts to a long shot and now you're seeing

87
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:59,559
the car go over the side of a cliff and now you can still hear the audio above

88
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,941
everything else and now it's a soundtrack. And that's diegetic. The

89
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:08,282
audio belonged to you as an audience member as much as it belonged to Kirk as

90
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:15,045
a character in the story you were watching. And so Dead Space's UI is

91
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:16,666
basically diegetic by design.

92
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:20,734
The sci-fi genre made it very possible for us to do this.

93
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:26,724
The basic idea was that we were able to wrap typical game conventions like loading screens

94
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,469
and save points into believable elements in the world.

95
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:31,551
Here's some examples.

96
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:35,512
The doors that you saw in the game, for the player,

97
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:38,193
was a means for him to get from one point to another.

98
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:40,514
And there was a hologram, because we're in the future

99
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:41,474
and holograms are cool.

100
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:45,275
But for you, as a player, this is basically a streaming gate.

101
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:47,116
You were sitting there waiting for us

102
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:48,777
to stream in the next part of the game

103
00:05:49,437 --> 00:05:52,898
while you're standing there and dealing with some necromorphs

104
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:53,278
or whatever.

105
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:57,039
The tram system in Dead Space 1 is another thing.

106
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:58,319
On the

107
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:04,147
fictional level, it was a map that you would walk up to and see what was uh

108
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:09,890
where else you could go and then press of a button, the camera would zoom in past Isaac

109
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,551
and you would zoom into the map and suddenly you were in the loading screen taking you to the next

110
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:19,074
level and it would snap back out and suddenly you're in the next level and the map is now

111
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:24,236
back on the wall. It was a very diegetic approach to a loading screen. We basically tricked you

112
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:28,398
into thinking you were in a tram but really we were just taking you to the next level.

113
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:34,979
We had many games that had very diegetic sort of elements to them.

114
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,145
The iPoke machine in Dead Space 2 was one of my favorites.

115
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:45,433
In a fictional level, it was a means for Isaac to extract information from his brain.

116
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:50,168
But for you as a player, that laser and that needle

117
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:52,469
was your reticle to get inside his eyeball.

118
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,131
And that monitor on the top is basically

119
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,593
a means for you to judge if you're doing it right or wrong.

120
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:02,794
So it was very diegetic in such that it

121
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:04,075
was both for him and for you.

122
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:08,037
This is an early comp of the taxi system

123
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:10,238
that we created for Dead Space 3.

124
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,000
The skip was the machine that you

125
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,241
would take from ship to ship in the flotilla.

126
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,927
And any typical game would have a travel map like this one,

127
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,288
where you would see where you were,

128
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:25,911
and you could figure out where you want to go by moving

129
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:29,034
your cursor from place to place and clicking a button

130
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:29,455
to go there.

131
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:34,239
We sort of took that idea and decided

132
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:35,800
we should make this diegetic as well.

133
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,842
And so instead of making a full screen takeover,

134
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:39,244
we made it part of your environment.

135
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:40,705
Now it belonged to Isaac.

136
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:46,445
You would see the map in the game as he would look at it on a dashboard of the taxi.

137
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:50,726
And as that's happening, we took it a step further, we gave it to your co-op partner as well.

138
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:55,167
As you were looking at it, your co-op partner could see exactly where you were taking him.

139
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:59,648
It was a great way to get both of you in an engaged space as we were loading the next thing.

140
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:06,290
And the interesting thing about this, that I should say, is that as you were flying there...

141
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,070
you weren't actually seeing yourself fly there.

142
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,252
This was just a little video and some very well-orchestrated

143
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,834
lights that were flying by as you were going there.

144
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,336
Think of this like Star Tours.

145
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,217
You really were just sitting there.

146
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:19,818
The vehicle wasn't really moving.

147
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:22,420
We just had a really cool video showing in front of you

148
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:24,762
as we were changing the whole level around you.

149
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:27,144
This was just a very elaborate loading screen.

150
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:32,308
So we were not just diegetic by design.

151
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:34,190
We were also diegetic by implementation.

152
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,230
A lot of people.

153
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,342
think that we use Scaleform for our game.

154
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:41,984
The interesting thing is that back in 2007, 2008,

155
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,706
there was no such thing as Scaleform.

156
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,869
We wanted to make a UI that sort of sorted and lived

157
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:52,532
in the world that our player, or rather our character, lived in.

158
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:54,493
But there were no tools to do this.

159
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,355
You've got to understand, back then,

160
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,537
Flash was the main tool for making UI,

161
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:00,738
and it probably still is now.

162
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,840
And the one limitation we had back then was that it

163
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:10,105
If we had used Flash, had we used Scaleform, if it did exist, it would be very flat on screen.

164
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:18,130
And we didn't want to do that. We wanted to make sure that you had no safety glass between the character and you as a player in the game.

165
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:24,194
And so we wanted all our UI to be in-world and literally diegetic in implementation.

166
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:30,279
And so we were stubborn and we looked at our toolset and we realized, well, we have a really cool VFX system.

167
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,229
It can render fire and lights and explosions all in game.

168
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:37,954
And so we were like, aha, let's make a UI with particles.

169
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,781
That's the dumbest thing you could ever think of, but we did it.

170
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:47,103
We were like, well, let's add a font tool into the particle system.

171
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:48,024
And so we did.

172
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:51,046
Some very intelligent engineers cooked this up.

173
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:55,208
And we were able to put text in particles and make them float in world.

174
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:57,109
And so that's how we ended up doing our UI.

175
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:58,290
It's diegetic.

176
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,971
And it sorts in the world because it does sort in the world.

177
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:02,012
It glows.

178
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:04,994
And it creates light because it creates light, because they're particles.

179
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:06,334
And that's the big thing.

180
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:08,656
People thought all this time we were using scale form.

181
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:10,637
We don't know how to use scale form.

182
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:11,197
We tried.

183
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,724
It won't integrate with our system.

184
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:14,705
It's an awesome system.

185
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:17,425
I've looked at it, but our engine just didn't like it.

186
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:18,966
So we ended up keeping using this.

187
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:22,566
So even up till Dead Space 3, this is how we made our UI.

188
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:23,767
We made it with particles.

189
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,688
The next thing I want to talk about is the rule set.

190
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:34,149
So any good design has a really good rule set as a cornerstone.

191
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:38,630
One of our first rules was, since we were a third,

192
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:43,525
person game, we had to make sure that our character was always in the same space.

193
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:48,570
This was important for us because it sort of defined where the UI could live.

194
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:53,295
If Isaac was always on the left side of the screen, we knew exactly where to put our UI

195
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:55,998
and where to bias our UI for you to see it.

196
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,002
This is probably another talk.

197
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:03,281
for another time, but the third person sort of format

198
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:05,522
allowed us to really make sure that you were focusing

199
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:08,325
on story, the story of Isaac, rather than being pulled

200
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:11,727
into you as a first person character having an experience.

201
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:13,088
It's another talk.

202
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:14,309
It's probably going to be Chuck's talk.

203
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,974
But anyway, the UI, like I was saying,

204
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,116
was meant to be on the right space

205
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:23,357
because Isaac was on the left.

206
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:25,879
Another rule we had was that all our UI

207
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:29,998
was a meter and a half above the ground plane at all times.

208
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:31,419
Because it was important for us to make sure

209
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:33,340
that you could see what you were dealing with.

210
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,202
We made the mistake of putting UI too high up or too low.

211
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:39,323
And in play tests, we realized nobody really looks there.

212
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,365
And we wanted to make sure that you could see

213
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:42,605
everything that was interactable.

214
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:44,206
That doesn't mean we didn't have elements

215
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,087
up here and down here.

216
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,188
But anything that was important

217
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,869
was within a meter and a half above the ground.

218
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,172
Another thing to talk about is that

219
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:58,887
Not all our UI was actually quite diegetic.

220
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,468
There were things like the options menu, or say,

221
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:05,089
the pause menu, or the difficulty settings menu,

222
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:07,229
that never really belonged to Isaac.

223
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:09,109
Those belong to you as a player.

224
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,090
So where did we put them?

225
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,430
Well, simple.

226
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,971
We decided to put it behind Isaac.

227
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:16,031
So anything that didn't belong to him,

228
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:18,111
we elegantly placed behind him.

229
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:21,172
And so that it was the most transparent way

230
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:23,553
of communicating that this belonged to you, but not him.

231
00:12:24,554 --> 00:12:26,837
And it seemed to work because no one complained.

232
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:32,162
And the last thing, the last rule we have here is we had a very strict color language.

233
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:36,466
Just because we had the power of using any particle we want, we wanted to make sure we

234
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,148
had a distinct color language.

235
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:44,334
The reason for this is that not everyone, as much as I hope they were, was as conscientious

236
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:45,455
of UI design.

237
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:47,837
No one's going to be stopping and looking at everything.

238
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:51,984
with every detail in your UI.

239
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:55,506
They just really want to slam through the next thing to get to the action.

240
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:58,168
And so UI had to be very quick to look at.

241
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,790
And so we made it very clear by color language.

242
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,751
Blue and white was interactive.

243
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:07,754
Red was locked, or not interactive right now, but will be later on.

244
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:12,317
And orange amber basically meant this is just scenic art.

245
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:13,578
You don't have to deal with this thing.

246
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:15,259
It's just there to make the room look pretty.

247
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,400
Now let's go into the look of the game.

248
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:22,022
So as much as we were a futuristic game,

249
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,343
we were a broken future, a depleted future.

250
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:25,744
This was not Star Trek.

251
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:27,545
You are in a derelict mining ship,

252
00:13:27,585 --> 00:13:30,486
and the UI needed to feel unpredictable and broken.

253
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:34,268
That, on a side note, is a very hard line

254
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:36,629
to stand on because it's very easy for people to think that,

255
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,971
you know, you just didn't do your job well.

256
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:42,433
To make something look broken but not low quality

257
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:43,533
is a hard bar to sit on.

258
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,463
The look was inspired by a lot of flickering fluorescent lights and dental lamps, static

259
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:57,147
you see on TV and scan lines, which ultimately should not even exist in a future world, if

260
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:57,847
you think about it.

261
00:13:58,388 --> 00:14:04,812
But we believed in the feeling that these things gave you, because A, it elicited the

262
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:05,732
feeling of sci-fi.

263
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:09,955
It also elicited a feeling of horror, and it gave you a feeling of uncertainty.

264
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:12,316
And so we borrowed a lot of these skeuomorphs.

265
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,928
I should stop here and talk about skeuomorphs if some of you guys

266
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:18,188
are not familiar with the concept.

267
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:21,310
I know that not all of you guys are probably like designers,

268
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,072
maybe some of you are UI designers.

269
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:24,552
Maybe some of you guys are fans of the project.

270
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:27,134
Skeuomorphs should not be confused with necromorphs.

271
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:28,435
Those are totally different things.

272
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,058
So a skeuomorph is basically a derivative object

273
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:37,200
that retains ornamental design cues to a structure that

274
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,621
was necessary in the original.

275
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:39,662
So let me explain that.

276
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:43,104
So for example, back in or before World War I.

277
00:14:45,326 --> 00:14:46,891
uh... cars were made were made of wood

278
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:49,298
they were made of wood because wood was

279
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:51,906
uh... or rather metal was more expensive

280
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:59,725
But then World War I happened and suddenly the production of metal for war made metal cheaper.

281
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:04,248
And so wood was then used as an ornament to show luxury because it became more expensive.

282
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:11,491
And so ever since then, when you get a luxury vehicle, they would put wood in the dashboard or wood on the side of the cars.

283
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:13,112
And that still exists right now.

284
00:15:13,452 --> 00:15:18,095
They put faux wood in your dashboard to make you feel like it's an item of luxury.

285
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:26,039
And that's what a skeuomorph is. It's basically a reduction of an element that used to be necessary

286
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:31,462
into something that just made you feel familiar with something. Another key point is, or another

287
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:37,786
example, is a maple syrup jar that has a loop where you would put your finger in. Back in the day,

288
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:42,148
those loops were big enough for a finger because the jars or the jugs were really big.

289
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:46,092
But nowadays, these maple syrup bottles are really small,

290
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:49,055
and that loop is just there to make you feel like it's traditional.

291
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,438
And that's the same with what's happening in UI right now.

292
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,663
Apple's done this a lot, where they make skeuomorphs in their UI.

293
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,734
For example, their notepad, when you open it up,

294
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:04,076
it brings up a keyboard that isn't really there,

295
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,518
but it's got like bevels and drop shadows.

296
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:08,820
They make you feel like it's a real keyboard,

297
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,301
and the notepad looks like it's paper

298
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:11,902
with torn edges on the top.

299
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:14,223
And then when you write a note,

300
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:16,304
it makes a pencil circle on it.

301
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:19,847
It's not really there, it's not really analog,

302
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,528
but it's meant to make you feel like

303
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:22,469
it's something familiar.

304
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:25,951
And that sort of helps the new user

305
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:27,812
to enter the digital world.

306
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:31,257
It's arguable whether this is good design or not.

307
00:16:31,677 --> 00:16:35,158
Suffice to say, we used it for dead space a lot.

308
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:40,120
We added the notion of scan lines, like I said,

309
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,762
scan lines and flickers to make you feel a sense of dread

310
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:48,263
and a sense of uncertainty that came with those elements.

311
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:49,884
Those are skeuomorphs, basically.

312
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:54,245
So now I'm going to talk about some of the specific parts

313
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:54,885
of dead space.

314
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:56,386
I'm going to start with the rig.

315
00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:01,135
The rig is probably the most recognizable piece of UI in the game.

316
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:04,596
It evolved out of the necessity to keep the player immersed.

317
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:11,680
We needed a way to message your health, your inventory, your ammo count, your location

318
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,681
map without cluttering the game space.

319
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:18,383
Because remember, the big idea was that if we put up all this information on screen,

320
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:19,544
then you're never really immersed.

321
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:22,565
So we had to find a way to show it to you, but not show it to you.

322
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,992
So this is a typical game that was coming out around that time.

323
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,693
You would see there that we've got a mini-map on the right.

324
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:32,675
We've got a health bar on the very left.

325
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:36,417
You've got some inventory items and weapon selectors in there.

326
00:17:36,777 --> 00:17:39,078
This is what we needed to contract into the rig.

327
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:40,919
All this stuff, we had to take it away.

328
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:44,481
Because you were always thinking, if we made a game like this,

329
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:48,363
it would mean that there's a safe wall between you and the game.

330
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,101
and you'd never really be immersed.

331
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:52,743
So we had to take all this away.

332
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:55,946
And the first thing we did was design a way for you

333
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,389
to see your health.

334
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:01,392
And so this ties back to the importance of putting Isaac

335
00:18:01,432 --> 00:18:03,274
on the left side of the screen at all times.

336
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:07,776
uh... we made sure that he was somewhere very clear despite the fact that he

337
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:08,256
could move

338
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:11,539
there was an area where he belonged on screen and so

339
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,922
if the health bar on his back was going to work we had to make sure

340
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:16,343
that that rule was there

341
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:19,285
because you needed to know exactly where you were going to look for your health

342
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:21,187
we put the health

343
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:29,398
on a spine and in the early iterations we made very detailed, ornate versions of it.

344
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:32,079
In the end, we settled on simplicity.

345
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:37,903
This is like, I think, I believe this is the 360 version of Dead Space that never shipped,

346
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:40,704
that came before it became a next-gen title.

347
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:43,045
As you can see, not a lot has changed.

348
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:48,279
It's the basic idea. We had a bar in his back.

349
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:50,300
Simplicity sort of won.

350
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:56,284
We went and tried very elaborate ways of doing this and we ended up with the most simple, most iconic way to do it,

351
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:57,545
which is a bar in his back.

352
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:03,549
That said, throughout the evolution of the franchise, we did change it a little bit. In the first game

353
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,931
it was a tube of light. In the second game, it was more like a hologram.

354
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:11,653
In the third game, to elicit the feeling of vintageness,

355
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:13,593
we gave it a circuitry sort of feel.

356
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:16,634
But fundamentally, it was the same thing.

357
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:23,815
The inventory, there was many attempts at this core system.

358
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,916
When I first came on board, one of my first tasks

359
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,657
was to sort of design this thing and figure out

360
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:32,397
how we could put all that information in one space

361
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:35,638
and be very useful, despite the fact that it's in-world.

362
00:19:37,815 --> 00:19:40,996
We made many attempts.

363
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:43,477
You can see here a version that never really shipped.

364
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,658
We had four weapon slots on the left,

365
00:19:45,738 --> 00:19:49,719
and we had them stacked up in the vertical.

366
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,600
And on the right, you'll notice the early version used

367
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,961
to have three types of nodes.

368
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,282
Not too different from how we ended up in Dead Space 3

369
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,763
with a bunch of different resource types.

370
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,364
This was a very early draft of the game.

371
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:09,821
We ended up designing and refining and using the D-pad more and more as a tool to do certain

372
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:10,422
things in here.

373
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:16,068
And we ended up with something like this in the first game.

374
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:19,832
And so here's how it evolved.

375
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:28,809
We sort of started with four, or sorry rather six key items on the left side, weapon select

376
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:33,274
in the top left, and on the right side you could see exactly how your suit is set up

377
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:38,479
or what level it's in, your nodes and your credits, and in the bottom you could, if you

378
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:44,525
were like highlighting any element you would see exactly what that item was by the description

379
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:44,926
in the bottom.

380
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:56,793
This is how it looked in Dead Space 2. Pretty similar, didn't change much except for the fact that we didn't have key items, so we were able to make the description box much bigger.

381
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:03,148
We did add a little bit more 3D-ness to this one.

382
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:05,870
We sort of slanted a lot of things.

383
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,031
But it's basically the same thing.

384
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:10,333
By Dead Space 3, we brought back key items.

385
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:12,954
And we added more resources.

386
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:15,996
And we took away two weapon slots

387
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,277
to give away for the fact that we now

388
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:21,059
have guns that sort of had two tips.

389
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:23,601
And we gave you a slot for your little robot buddy.

390
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:24,981
Like that guy.

391
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:27,083
Really like that guy.

392
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:32,934
Okay, so weapon selector, I already talked about this, but basically it didn't change a lot.

393
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:38,323
It was a means for you to get to your weapons very quickly, even if you didn't open your inventory.

394
00:21:38,343 --> 00:21:40,887
You just d-padded up, left, right, whatever, and you got there.

395
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:46,635
This part, this brings a tear to my eye.

396
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:47,616
I love this thing.

397
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:48,897
I really, really do.

398
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:53,000
So Dead Space 1 was designed to have this really amazing map

399
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,381
system that sort of opened up.

400
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:56,903
And you would see exactly where you were

401
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:58,424
and where your next objective was.

402
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:01,727
I remember when I first came on the project,

403
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,149
this is one of the demos that Chuck Beaver showed me

404
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:06,511
that got me excited about really joining the project.

405
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,632
They had this system already running.

406
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:10,974
The basic idea was that.

407
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:15,348
This map would open up and you would see exactly where you were, where you're going.

408
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,350
And the problem with it was that it wasn't very useful.

409
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,613
Because, for one thing, it was always oriented a certain way,

410
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:26,755
despite the fact that Isaac was looking left, right, behind you or whatever.

411
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:30,177
It would orient a certain way and you had to spin it to find exactly where you were,

412
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,678
before you could even start to use it.

413
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:36,441
And so as pretty as it was, what we learned very fast was that nobody wanted to use it.

414
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,842
And for a game like Dead Space, which was designed to be...

415
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:49,701
a backtracking and walking around and mission-based game that goes around a ship with a lot of

416
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:50,041
very...

417
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:58,128
generic environments because it was designed to be a space vessel that was industrial in

418
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:58,589
design.

419
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:01,350
It was easy to get lost in the game, but this wasn't useful.

420
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,131
And so we had to rethink our mapping system.

421
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:08,332
This shipped with Dead Space 1, but we had to make another way to do it.

422
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:10,533
And so the locator was born.

423
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:12,094
I remember when this was made.

424
00:23:13,302 --> 00:23:17,204
I think we were in the last month of production when we were in a panic state and we're like,

425
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:21,126
oh my gosh, no one's ever going to get to figure out where to go next.

426
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:21,726
Oh no.

427
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:23,247
And then there was like two camps of thought.

428
00:23:23,407 --> 00:23:26,349
One was like, well, let's make this breadcrumb system that appeared on the ground.

429
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,431
And the other camp that said, well, then if we do that, no one would ever explore.

430
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:34,613
But then what we realized was that by creating this system.

431
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:38,917
We made it so that we gave the level designers a lot more

432
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:41,578
tools to play with in terms of creating places

433
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:43,859
to go other than what was expected to be done.

434
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,922
And so it ended up being one of the most iconic elements

435
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,063
of Dead Space UI.

436
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:54,224
And to be honest, that's amazing because we just

437
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:55,425
slapped it in last minute.

438
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:01,722
Ever since then though, we've refined it a lot.

439
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:04,463
By Dead Space 2, it was curving, it was prettier,

440
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:08,005
and actually allowed you to go to more than just your objective,

441
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:10,446
but also showed you all the other places you could go with it.

442
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:14,308
You could now go to save kiosks and other things with it,

443
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,589
and it would just show you exactly where those places are.

444
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:17,470
It would change.

445
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,292
By Dead Space 3, we refined it even more to couple with the way

446
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:27,775
we handled our Zero-G, and it's a lot more integrated with what

447
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:28,815
you did if you were flying.

448
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:33,419
And we did some really cool improvements to it visually

449
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:33,759
as well.

450
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:35,699
OK.

451
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:40,160
This next part I'm going to talk about is really, really cool.

452
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,401
So I was struggling with myself how I was going to present this.

453
00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:48,842
Because admittedly, I like the one we did for Dead Space 1 the best.

454
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:53,583
But at first I wanted to go, maybe I should go Dead Space 3, 2, and 1.

455
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:57,804
But I think it's better if I really show it to you guys in chronological order.

456
00:24:58,325 --> 00:24:58,485
But.

457
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:04,063
Let me preface that, I think the first one was really awesome.

458
00:25:04,223 --> 00:25:10,887
Anyway, so Dead Space is designed to be a horror experience,

459
00:25:10,907 --> 00:25:11,788
like I said earlier.

460
00:25:12,288 --> 00:25:14,870
And we wanted to use the front end as a means for you

461
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,312
to get into the whole thing.

462
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,654
This was going to foreshadow your whole experience.

463
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:22,855
And so I pitched this idea.

464
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:27,996
for us to make a front end that sort of had this weird

465
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:32,658
out-of-body experience where you would see little videos and like this

466
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:41,062
corruption soup as you were like floating around this weird nether world of like weird things happening and I I said hey I

467
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:45,844
Pitched this to Ian our art director at the time and I said hey Ian. I've got this idea. Let's get like

468
00:25:47,368 --> 00:25:53,451
creatures sort of like writhing and turning and like getting torn apart and muscles getting

469
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:59,754
Blown out of bone and bone like just coming out of things and it'll be really cool and I even went as far as

470
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:02,555
Storyboarding this shit right? This was really fun

471
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:08,258
I drew out this thing where I would we would make models of creatures and animals just sort of like

472
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:13,140
buckling and like bones sort of tearing out of flesh and teeth chattering and like

473
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,302
blood coming down grates and whatever, and it was going to be really cool.

474
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:18,623
And Ian's like, yes, do that.

475
00:26:19,964 --> 00:26:24,286
And then I asked for time for modeling and animation and high-res

476
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:25,747
like sort of like rendering.

477
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:27,408
And we didn't have that time.

478
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:29,089
And I'm like, oh, crap.

479
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:29,909
How are we going to do this?

480
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:36,173
And so the interesting thing is Chuck, who's the story producer of the game,

481
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:40,655
who was also the UI producer at the time,

482
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,076
decided just give me $500 to improvise.

483
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:45,066
And so I went to the store.

484
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:51,090
And then I bought some carob syrup and some food coloring.

485
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,452
And we ended up going to a butcher shop

486
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:56,434
and bought some random animal parts.

487
00:26:57,695 --> 00:26:59,396
And then we bought some mealworms.

488
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:02,118
And then we went to my garage.

489
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:06,381
And did I mention we bought a dead lamb, too?

490
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:06,961
We did.

491
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:09,263
And we started shooting some video.

492
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:11,844
So the UI team got together and shot some video.

493
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:17,679
It was really fun. We shot all this footage that we wanted to throw in the front end.

494
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:24,061
The idea was that we wanted to make the front end look, you know, subliminally scary.

495
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:31,643
And so we shot all this stuff, we cut up animal parts, we shot things, we replayed them in reverse and whatnot,

496
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:34,144
and we ended up with video that looked like this.

497
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:41,082
And, admittedly, probably if you go back, if you played Dead Space, you probably never

498
00:27:41,122 --> 00:27:43,063
even noticed these things, but they were there.

499
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:45,705
They're floating around in the UI.

500
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:50,469
And the idea was not for you to see it, but for you to think about it and have it subliminally

501
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,212
stored in your brain, that this is the kind of game you're getting into.

502
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:58,498
That's been the cornerstone of what Dead Space is. It's not about the

503
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:02,600
RAAAARGH! scare. It's all about the, you know, the subliminal

504
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,063
thinking man's horror. We hid stuff in there for you to find subliminally.

505
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:10,065
I love that story.

506
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:14,987
Not a lot of people know that, so now you know that.

507
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:21,191
That's more shots of it. You should play Dead Space 1 again and see if you can

508
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:21,911
find these videos.

509
00:28:23,242 --> 00:28:25,204
There's some really fucked up ones with eyeballs and...

510
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:32,549
One of the producers in the game was just obsessed with the lamb skull and trying to crack the eyeball out.

511
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,272
We realized that eyeballs are stuck in there pretty well.

512
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:37,013
They're like...

513
00:28:38,354 --> 00:28:40,475
You can't just pop it out. There's no spooning that thing out.

514
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:41,977
There's muscles holding that thing in there.

515
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:43,238
Just so you guys know.

516
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,001
It wasn't me. It was this other guy.

517
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:54,401
So Dead Space 2, the front end of Dead Space 2

518
00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:56,605
was designed without lamps.

519
00:28:57,006 --> 00:28:58,549
We weren't allowed to cut up stuff anymore.

520
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:01,915
EA sort of realized that, sure, that's cool,

521
00:29:01,995 --> 00:29:02,816
but don't do that again.

522
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:10,251
On a side note, yeah, Dead Space 1 was just one of those games that sort of happened because

523
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,615
a lot of crazy people under the radar sort of put it together.

524
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:17,160
I don't know if it could have happened as awesomely as it did.

525
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:20,925
As much as I love everything else we've done, Dead Space 1 was just crazy.

526
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:27,626
So now, Dead Space 2's UI, we sort of took the same idea, but went a little further.

527
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:30,667
We made it so that you're now inside Isaac's brain.

528
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:36,029
The whole premise of the second game was that there's some information in his head, and you're trying to extract it.

529
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,890
And so we made the UI based on this idea.

530
00:29:40,296 --> 00:29:45,201
We started rendering the notion of, or this is concept art that I made, but we started rendering

531
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:47,984
neurons and like

532
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:56,272
brain matter floating around in this nether space while there were like pieces of UI at high-res sort of showing up in front of you.

533
00:29:58,113 --> 00:30:00,656
The idea was that there would be little bits of marker

534
00:30:02,221 --> 00:30:07,322
fragments in there and many of you may or may not have noticed but those

535
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:13,343
marker bits sort of coalesced into a full marker had you finished the game

536
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:16,844
completely and what happened was we designed it so that these were like

537
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:21,865
tied to your level achievements so there were like multiple states of this and as

538
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:26,366
you progress through the game as you did more levels and you finish more levels

539
00:30:27,146 --> 00:30:29,986
the marker came together more and more and by the end of the game you had a

540
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:30,967
full marker floating in there

541
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:35,412
It was a very subtle way of showing the arc of the story.

542
00:30:37,132 --> 00:30:38,472
Again, it was never like

543
00:30:39,612 --> 00:30:44,273
explained to you or spoon-fed to you, but it was there. If you cared to, notice it, it was there.

544
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:46,034
And if you didn't, it was there.

545
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:53,615
Dead Space 3, we sort of took that same idea, but we put it now in a very real environment.

546
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:56,196
We put you in a room instead of being in a very

547
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:59,857
abstract space, now we put you in the room.

548
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:06,791
Specifically, we chose the Rosetta room in the game.

549
00:31:06,872 --> 00:31:08,273
I'm not going to explain too much about it,

550
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:09,655
because maybe you guys haven't played it.

551
00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:13,140
But suffice to say, the idea was that there's

552
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,904
this machine in the middle that sort of held together

553
00:31:15,964 --> 00:31:16,645
pieces of ice.

554
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:19,936
that sort of dissected a creature.

555
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:23,980
And what happened was, we made it so that, much like in Dead Space 2,

556
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,423
the metagame would be that the further and further along you were,

557
00:31:27,463 --> 00:31:30,086
there would be more pieces of glass, or sorry, rather, ice,

558
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:31,547
in the machine in the middle.

559
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,931
And from one of the vantage points, from one of the machines,

560
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:39,035
you would be able to see what's on the dissection bed.

561
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:45,705
And these are just really, really bad early models that I did.

562
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:46,465
That's what I drew.

563
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:47,586
That's what I made.

564
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:51,808
And that's what Jihan sort of painted over it to look like.

565
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:53,769
I made that bad model.

566
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,930
And Jihan painted that.

567
00:31:59,012 --> 00:31:59,973
My job's pretty fun.

568
00:32:00,073 --> 00:32:01,473
I make really bad models.

569
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:05,155
And I've got amazing artists to come in and paint over it.

570
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,277
And eventually, someone will build a real 3D model.

571
00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:08,677
It's pretty fun.

572
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:09,578
I like what I do.

573
00:32:12,121 --> 00:32:13,982
This is just what the menus look like in the third game.

574
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:17,463
The interesting thing is that you could actually

575
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:18,904
tumble around and see.

576
00:32:18,924 --> 00:32:21,825
Actually, this is true of all games of Dead Space.

577
00:32:22,726 --> 00:32:24,206
In the front end, if you tumbled around,

578
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:26,027
you would see secret messages everywhere.

579
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:29,048
That's the whole room.

580
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,090
We have a 10-second kiddie break.

581
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:37,912
Look at that cat.

582
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,914
I mean, just look at that cat.

583
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,620
Look!

584
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:48,282
That's my cat.

585
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:52,263
That's my reminder to me to drink water in the middle of my presentation

586
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,925
and sort of clear your palate of all those dead lambs.

587
00:32:58,766 --> 00:32:59,406
Okay, we're back.

588
00:33:00,907 --> 00:33:02,147
The evolution of the look.

589
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:07,021
OK, story has always been the core of the game.

590
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:10,583
And so we wanted the UI to be fully integrated with the story.

591
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:12,524
And the story's got an arc.

592
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:13,825
The story's got a character.

593
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:16,066
The story's got nuances.

594
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:19,909
And we wanted to make sure that the UI progressed

595
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:20,969
with this growth as well.

596
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,051
And so we always had to react with the characters

597
00:33:24,612 --> 00:33:25,452
and the environment.

598
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:29,535
The first Dead Space, as I mentioned earlier,

599
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:34,437
The UI was sort of tied with the Ishimura.

600
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:36,778
It had to be broken and erratic.

601
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:40,559
This is the sort of world we were sort of painting our UI

602
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,179
on top of.

603
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,081
And it was very important for us to live in that world as a UI.

604
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:48,022
For you to believe us, we had to be there with you.

605
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,903
I mean, by us, I mean the UI guys.

606
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,064
For you guys to believe us creating the UI,

607
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,405
we had to be in there in the world with you

608
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:56,905
and make sense in that world.

609
00:33:58,606 --> 00:34:00,106
And so we had to feel broken as well.

610
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:04,823
And so a lot of the stuff in the first game had that quality of uncertainty.

611
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:06,645
You weren't sure if it was going to work.

612
00:34:07,006 --> 00:34:10,671
And like I said earlier, this was a really thin line to stand on.

613
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:13,735
Because it's very easy for you to think, that stuff's broken.

614
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:14,656
You should fix that.

615
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:15,657
That looks horrible.

616
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,740
It's like that line between a

617
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,890
looking like it's broken and actually is broken is very thin.

618
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:26,071
And we had to thread that a lot.

619
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:28,992
Early on, we were still trying to figure out the style.

620
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:32,072
And a lot of our font was more wobbly and shaky.

621
00:34:32,812 --> 00:34:34,673
QA would come back and say, we can't read this.

622
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:36,593
It's not going to pass TRC.

623
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:40,014
So even though we wanted to make it look broken,

624
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:42,014
we had to make sure that it still was readable.

625
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:45,975
That's some of the UI we use for Dead Space 1.

626
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:48,795
Again, here was the original store.

627
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,851
And now let's talk about Dead Space 2.

628
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:55,134
So Dead Space 2, we now opened up the world

629
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:57,776
into the vastness of a space station.

630
00:34:58,317 --> 00:34:59,778
We were no longer in a broken ship.

631
00:35:00,158 --> 00:35:03,441
We had the ability to show you a bigger, larger world

632
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:04,902
that was Dead Space.

633
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:07,144
There was more than just the mining ship.

634
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:09,126
Now you can see, well, how does the rest

635
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,767
of this depleted universe look?

636
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:13,450
Obviously, there are areas that'll be lush,

637
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:16,773
and there are areas that'll be decrepit.

638
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:20,651
and there will be areas that will be a little bit more polished

639
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:22,192
because they were government institutions.

640
00:35:22,592 --> 00:35:24,914
And there was stuff that actually looked a little bit like the first game.

641
00:35:26,115 --> 00:35:31,499
So in building UI for this, we had to create a wider array of things

642
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:32,240
that could live there.

643
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:35,182
Initially, we had the idea of making machines

644
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:36,523
that allowed you to withdraw money.

645
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:38,852
and like steal money from people.

646
00:35:39,252 --> 00:35:41,392
This didn't actually ship, but we had ideas like this.

647
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,153
We had like health pack machines and whatever.

648
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:46,713
And this breaks my heart that didn't happen.

649
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,994
This was a really cool piece of UI.

650
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:54,855
We had this idea where if you were running low on cash,

651
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:57,735
you could go up to this machine, shove your hand in there,

652
00:35:58,276 --> 00:36:01,096
and it will take some blood from you and change it for money.

653
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:03,016
And the metagame was that.

654
00:36:04,073 --> 00:36:07,295
as your health was going down, your money was coming up,

655
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:10,477
and there would be a point where it would give you a ton of money,

656
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:12,499
but if you didn't pull out fast enough, you would die.

657
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,983
And it was so cool, but we didn't have room for it anymore for the game.

658
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:24,126
We cut this feature, but man, I love this one. I was so excited about this one.

659
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:27,549
This was the store from the second game.

660
00:36:31,297 --> 00:36:37,062
Earlier I mentioned Isaac sort of had to live in the 3D world at all times.

661
00:36:37,582 --> 00:36:43,067
One thing I forgot to mention is that even when you were inside a store or any game mode,

662
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:46,130
you'll realize that a sliver of Isaac is always there.

663
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,193
This was by design. We wanted you to feel like you're always with Isaac.

664
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:53,036
So even if you were like looking through a store, Isaac was there with you.

665
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:58,701
I'll explain later why that rule is broken, but suffice to say that's a rule.

666
00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:02,216
These are just some screens from Dead Space 2,

667
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:04,979
showing some of the more industrial parts of the game.

668
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:06,440
That was the elevator.

669
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:09,703
That's just some cool hologram, some cool hologram.

670
00:37:10,624 --> 00:37:11,304
Dead Space 3.

671
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:12,786
OK.

672
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:20,573
So Dead Space 3 is set on a planet

673
00:37:20,913 --> 00:37:23,355
that's got technology from 200 years ago,

674
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:25,277
meaning things had to look older.

675
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:33,763
The UI that we had to design for this world has to look like a reverse engineered version

676
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:37,365
of the holograms that you were used to for Dead Space 1 and 2.

677
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:42,749
So the basic idea was that anything that Isaac came to the planet with was futuristic.

678
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:44,450
It was the stuff that he already came with.

679
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,993
So case in point, the inventory, the locator.

680
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:55,692
the rig, the pickup sort of AR stuff that we'd see all around, that was all futuristic stuff that

681
00:37:55,752 --> 00:38:00,933
he came with. But everything that he found on there, like the doors, the weapon benches,

682
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:06,594
the machines that he interacted with, had to have a flavor that looked very different from what he

683
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:11,115
had. And the first thing we did was to sort of adapt the color language to be a little bit

684
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:15,916
different and have a little bit more of a greenish hologram tinge to make it look more vintage.

685
00:38:16,536 --> 00:38:19,077
And the other thing was that we effectively changed the font

686
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:21,899
system for everything you see on the planet.

687
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,141
And here's just some more of the rooms

688
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:28,742
that we had to sort of art up with some UI.

689
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:32,904
These were early comps of what we were going to do with UI.

690
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:39,151
So early on, when I was talking to Ian and Ben,

691
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:41,632
they wanted the UI to feel like they were in pieces of glass.

692
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:44,473
And somehow, they refocused and defocused

693
00:38:44,593 --> 00:38:47,975
with three pieces of glass on top of each other.

694
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:50,657
The idea was to make it look like an archaic version

695
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:51,337
of holograms.

696
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:55,359
And then I started asking Ian, well,

697
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,861
if we even have screens right now that are just flat

698
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:01,102
and don't have all this fancy mumbo jumbo,

699
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:03,223
how can we extrapolate that in the future?

700
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:08,318
they're going to be three pieces of glass that sort of are separate and whatever.

701
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:10,259
And he's like, I don't know, just make it look cool.

702
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,081
And really, no, no.

703
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:15,644
But what he said was that maybe in the future, you know, LCDs are gone,

704
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:19,046
or the elements that we use to make screens right now are gone,

705
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:23,570
and so we had to come up with other ways to make holograms or lights on screen.

706
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,911
So this is what we ended up with.

707
00:39:25,271 --> 00:39:29,734
I sort of drew these early mock-ups of what we were going to do.

708
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:36,018
The one on the left was one of the early drawings that I did.

709
00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:41,869
It ended up being too elaborate for what we were trying to do, but it was a great design.

710
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:49,701
idea. Here's some other ideas we ended up with. Some of these machines that I, I modeled these

711
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:54,405
things and some of these, some of these machines ended up in the game as like props that are just

712
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:59,891
on the side, but that's the basic idea. We wanted to make sure that it felt like you were dealing

713
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:03,895
with glass plates as opposed to just light on holograms.

714
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:14,645
This is the audio log system in the game, and you'll notice some remnants of that design that I did, where there's three pieces of glass on the UI.

715
00:40:15,685 --> 00:40:18,946
This is a switchboard that you'd see in one of the ships.

716
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,287
And these are just some ambient UI pieces in the game.

717
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:26,628
This is a suit kiosk.

718
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:33,365
Not a lot of our game UI, our in-game UI, was able to do a lot of flipping and turning.

719
00:40:34,126 --> 00:40:39,330
We tried to do that a lot on the front end, and we did it to this machine and a few others,

720
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:44,475
but we couldn't conceivably make every UI piece in the game animate as well as this

721
00:40:44,515 --> 00:40:47,437
thing or as elegantly as this thing, so we picked our battles.

722
00:40:47,758 --> 00:40:50,300
The reason why we couldn't do it for everything was obviously for cost.

723
00:40:51,253 --> 00:40:51,813
of production.

724
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:58,196
But what we realized is that if you show people something really cool in the front end, like

725
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:02,878
in Dead Space 2, we made sure that the UI you would see in the front end was really

726
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,499
high res.

727
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:08,701
When you go in the game and it's low res, and it doesn't animate as elegantly, you sort

728
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:11,343
of forgive us for that, because you sort of already think about

729
00:41:12,063 --> 00:41:13,204
what it looked like in the front end.

730
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,765
In a very similar way as when you used to have a 2600

731
00:41:16,385 --> 00:41:20,068
and the game looked like crap, but the packaging looked awesome.

732
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:23,210
That's all you needed to fixate on, the fact that there was a really awesome

733
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,951
picture on the box. Same deal.

734
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:32,175
That's the scavenger bot. I have nothing to say about him except he's cool.

735
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:37,818
There he is again. I like that guy. Did I say I like this guy? I like this guy.

736
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:39,780
This is the bench.

737
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,053
Also part of Dead Space 3.

738
00:41:44,553 --> 00:41:48,374
This is the segue into my next slide, which is really talking about the journey that we

739
00:41:48,414 --> 00:41:49,355
took to build the bench.

740
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:59,659
So the bench was originally designed as a means for you to relate to your character

741
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:00,499
being an engineer.

742
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,301
It was meant to be a way for you to upgrade your weapons in Dead Space 1 and 2, and to

743
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:08,582
just sort of like fine tune it.

744
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:13,661
to be what it needs to be. One of the edicts that we had was make sure that this is your thinking

745
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:18,605
man's character. He was an engineer, he wasn't your typical army guy. He was fashioning his

746
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:24,369
weapons out of construction tools. Admittedly, we probably added real weapons down the line,

747
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:32,636
but initially he was dealing with like drills and like ripper blades and like plasma cutters,

748
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:36,259
things that you would expect a space engineer to be using.

749
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:44,184
So here's just a flow we did, a flow of how it worked in Dead Space 1.

750
00:42:44,224 --> 00:42:50,372
You would walk up to it, you would pick a weapon or something that you wanted to update in your inventory.

751
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,702
and then you would add nodes.

752
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:55,024
This was the extent of what we had in Dead Space 1.

753
00:42:55,264 --> 00:42:58,106
You had the ability to drop nodes, generic nodes,

754
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:03,831
into specific sort of paths to improve the weapon's capacity,

755
00:43:03,992 --> 00:43:07,575
reload, and other.

756
00:43:09,556 --> 00:43:12,299
My brain's freezing up.

757
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:13,920
Or it's damaged in its speed.

758
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:17,414
So this was the extent of what we could do at that time.

759
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:21,716
By Dead Space 3, we felt like we really

760
00:43:21,756 --> 00:43:25,158
need to really show off IS-6's ability

761
00:43:25,198 --> 00:43:26,458
to be an engineer even more.

762
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,700
And so we redesigned the bench.

763
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,480
We started thinking, well, instead

764
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,421
of just upgrading your weapons, we

765
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:34,923
needed a system to be able to build weapons from scratch.

766
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:39,325
And so we started redesigning the bench.

767
00:43:41,508 --> 00:43:53,414
If you imagine a weapon crafting system, you're probably thinking, well, there's going to be, you know, something in the middle like a base piece and you'll drag over a gun piece to try it out.

768
00:43:53,434 --> 00:44:01,497
You probably have a pull down menu and you pick a version of a part that you drag down into the weapon you're building.

769
00:44:01,797 --> 00:44:07,400
Which is fine and dandy for a PC game where you have drop down menus and a mouse to...

770
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:09,787
you know, drag things over.

771
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:12,508
This does not really exist in the console world.

772
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:14,930
And you have to understand Dead Space is primarily

773
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,051
designed as a console game.

774
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:19,872
And so all these conventions that

775
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:22,234
allow you to make a deep crafting system that

776
00:44:22,294 --> 00:44:26,256
exists in a PC world don't really

777
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,577
translate to a console world.

778
00:44:27,617 --> 00:44:33,280
Because the worst that you could do in a console type game

779
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,822
is to instill PC sensibilities.

780
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:43,197
If you start thinking that your player is going to be using the analog stick to drag a mouse over,

781
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:47,099
then you're sorely mistaken. That's not how console players work.

782
00:44:47,139 --> 00:44:50,701
They work with a small set of buttons, and everything has to work with those buttons,

783
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:51,782
otherwise you've lost them.

784
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:57,426
And so the challenge was to make a very deep, yet easy-to-use system.

785
00:44:58,526 --> 00:44:59,747
And trust me, it was not easy.

786
00:45:01,607 --> 00:45:05,249
The original concept for the bench was to make it feel like it was analog, like everything

787
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:08,050
else we were doing in Dead Space, it had to be diegetic.

788
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,672
You would see Isaac on the left side and everything was very real, there was like a little bench

789
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:16,413
in the middle, he would be tinkering with a gun and there would be UI bits that showed

790
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:17,954
you exactly what you could do.

791
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:20,655
This was the original design.

792
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,042
that I was cooking up.

793
00:45:23,102 --> 00:45:25,164
It would feel like a tackle box that would open up

794
00:45:25,504 --> 00:45:27,506
and you would get in there and you have all these screens.

795
00:45:28,087 --> 00:45:30,929
And then we redesigned it again to be this machine.

796
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:35,413
So, yeah, you could see in the back.

797
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,995
So I modeled it with a bunch of like.

798
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:43,020
conveyor belts in the back. The idea was that you would come up to it, bring your gun in there,

799
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,363
and there would be on the top of it a conveyor belt that allowed you to see exactly what you

800
00:45:49,383 --> 00:45:55,326
could add to the gun. There would be little boxes and these boxes would be labeled as weapon parts

801
00:45:55,426 --> 00:45:59,968
and you would pick which weapon parts you would want on your gun and you would select it and it

802
00:45:59,988 --> 00:46:03,670
would be added to your weapon. It sounds really cool.

803
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:09,135
And it would have been cool, except it was unusable.

804
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:14,258
It had a lot of problems.

805
00:46:14,718 --> 00:46:20,782
The main one is that we prided ourselves in Dead Space

806
00:46:21,082 --> 00:46:25,405
about using the actual game space to put our UI.

807
00:46:25,545 --> 00:46:27,186
And we've done this thing where we've

808
00:46:27,506 --> 00:46:29,527
put our UI in multiple screens, which

809
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:32,409
was really fine and dandy for small systems like the store

810
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:33,249
back in Dead Space 1 and 2.

811
00:46:34,518 --> 00:46:38,882
But by Dead Space 3, we were trying to shove so much information in front of you

812
00:46:39,402 --> 00:46:44,186
that putting screens on separate, or sorry, information on separate screens

813
00:46:45,908 --> 00:46:48,670
in the meantime also making sure that Isaac was always in view

814
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:50,912
was becoming ridiculously impossible.

815
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:55,656
You know that you've screwed up a system when the team has been using the game

816
00:46:55,676 --> 00:46:59,960
and playing the game, and they'd rather use the debug system to make a gun

817
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,981
than your UI system.

818
00:47:02,061 --> 00:47:05,463
So this was a really sobering, humbling moment for me and my team.

819
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:10,165
For months, people were using this, this, instead of what we built.

820
00:47:10,185 --> 00:47:12,407
And that was really painful.

821
00:47:13,607 --> 00:47:16,009
And so we had to redesign this bench over and over.

822
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:22,792
And one thing we realized is that this whole metaphor of putting things in separate screens

823
00:47:23,493 --> 00:47:27,215
and making sure that Isaac is in view all the time was not going to work.

824
00:47:28,552 --> 00:47:31,033
This was one of the last attempts that we made,

825
00:47:31,793 --> 00:47:33,233
and I was really just pushing it.

826
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,954
I was like, come on, we can make this work.

827
00:47:35,474 --> 00:47:38,275
We're going to keep the boxes in the top,

828
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:41,216
and you would be able to see your parts on the,

829
00:47:42,017 --> 00:47:44,138
or your selection of items on the right,

830
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:46,058
and your stats on the top right.

831
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,699
But it really didn't work, and we had

832
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:49,940
to redesign the whole thing.

833
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,061
And so after a lot of reiteration,

834
00:47:53,781 --> 00:47:57,683
we sort of had to succumb with the fact that we.

835
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:03,577
needed to focus on what actually users needed to have fun with this thing.

836
00:48:05,178 --> 00:48:07,940
And the first thing that had to go away was Isaac.

837
00:48:10,863 --> 00:48:13,505
And the second thing that had to go away was the multiple screens.

838
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:17,368
We had to consolidate it into a typical piece of UI.

839
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:21,272
This is something that you would expect out of any other game,

840
00:48:21,672 --> 00:48:24,875
which is like a very clear, concise, single screen

841
00:48:25,455 --> 00:48:27,036
that brought you through the whole experience.

842
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:32,901
We used the analog sticks to sort of pick the weapon part

843
00:48:33,982 --> 00:48:36,023
or the weapon category that you wanted to change.

844
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:37,423
And you drill down and you change it.

845
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:42,206
This was our safe system built into it.

846
00:48:43,927 --> 00:48:48,089
And so what you realize is that after all those things I said,

847
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,611
all those rules we set up, all that fiction stuff

848
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:54,492
that I believe in, at the end of the day, none of that

849
00:48:54,552 --> 00:48:56,053
is important if your users.

850
00:48:57,331 --> 00:48:59,212
can't really interact with your game.

851
00:48:59,632 --> 00:49:06,434
The bottom line is, fun and usability is more important than the bullshit I was talking

852
00:49:06,474 --> 00:49:07,114
about in the beginning.

853
00:49:07,254 --> 00:49:07,975
All that's cool.

854
00:49:08,795 --> 00:49:09,575
All that is amazing.

855
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:14,597
All those rules, all the fiction stuff that I love, that I really care about, it doesn't

856
00:49:14,637 --> 00:49:16,677
really matter if it can't get the game across.

857
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,399
And so we had to make these changes.

858
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:23,700
I stand by those changes.

859
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:26,622
These were changes that I believe made the game a lot better.

860
00:49:27,283 --> 00:49:31,226
They are not necessarily the prettiest solutions,

861
00:49:31,326 --> 00:49:33,528
but it made sure that you were able to use the system

862
00:49:33,748 --> 00:49:37,551
and you were able to use it as fast as possible in the limitations

863
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:39,432
that you had with a console controller.

864
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:43,650
On that, I want to give my final thoughts.

865
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,270
This was an amazing project to be on.

866
00:49:47,691 --> 00:49:48,991
I had a whole lot of fun because I

867
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:52,252
was able to experiment and play with some crazy tools.

868
00:49:53,232 --> 00:49:57,994
And I feel like our contributions will resonate

869
00:49:58,054 --> 00:49:59,134
into the next gen of games.

870
00:50:00,294 --> 00:50:02,195
I think that the stuff that we did really

871
00:50:02,255 --> 00:50:04,416
means something because we tried some new stuff

872
00:50:04,496 --> 00:50:07,396
and we were able to navigate around.

873
00:50:08,702 --> 00:50:12,224
some of the technical limitations that we had and we were able to navigate around a

874
00:50:12,264 --> 00:50:16,146
lot of the big ideas that we wanted to sort of convey to you.

875
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:19,608
And I think we succeeded, and I really believe in what we did.

876
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:23,731
On that, I want to do some thank yous.

877
00:50:25,252 --> 00:50:30,675
Chuck Beaver, Jason Leung, John Gerasi, Leo Lee, Richard Carillo, Tracy Espoleta, Andy

878
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:33,797
Wright, Christy Yen, Jeremy Benamou, Matt Gallet.

879
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,602
Michael Yen, Bill Fowler, Ford Hu, and Megan Barry.

880
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:42,685
Many of these people don't work with us anymore,

881
00:50:42,745 --> 00:50:44,526
but they were there for every part of the game.

882
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:48,149
The Dead Space team from the first one, the second one,

883
00:50:48,189 --> 00:50:48,729
the third one.

884
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:51,291
And I wouldn't have been able to deliver

885
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:55,674
what I tried to deliver if I hadn't had such amazing people

886
00:50:55,694 --> 00:50:56,214
to work with.

887
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:59,196
Amazing producers, amazing artists, amazing engineers.

888
00:51:00,977 --> 00:51:02,778
On that, we're going to end with.

889
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:05,363
a few minutes for Q&A. Thank you.

890
00:51:19,152 --> 00:51:20,292
Hi, you over there.

891
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,413
So thank you, first off.

892
00:51:22,453 --> 00:51:23,813
I haven't finished the third one yet,

893
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:25,313
but it has been an amazing ride.

894
00:51:26,034 --> 00:51:27,314
I've named my two robots.

895
00:51:28,934 --> 00:51:31,235
And so Reginald and Gomez, totally thank you

896
00:51:31,275 --> 00:51:32,255
for making an awesome game.

897
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:34,896
Specifically, the first time you find one

898
00:51:35,136 --> 00:51:37,997
and there's like enough snow, and you just

899
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:39,718
drop it in the ground and it disappears,

900
00:51:39,738 --> 00:51:42,098
but then the little tennis ball guy, it was brilliant.

901
00:51:42,138 --> 00:51:43,379
Just fantastic.

902
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:46,319
So one of the issues that my friend and I ran into,

903
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:51,541
at the very start of the game that we both feel stupid on and of course it's posted on the internet

904
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:59,504
is the dual control panel situation so you have two control panels and two you know the users

905
00:52:00,144 --> 00:52:05,206
the very first instance of that is in that the intro sequence with the spaceship

906
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:14,264
And I'm not sure how, up until like the repelling sequence, almost all of the dual control panels are on a single machine.

907
00:52:14,604 --> 00:52:18,448
But in that very first instance, they're separated into two specific things.

908
00:52:18,908 --> 00:52:25,874
Did you run into any serious testing issues where both users would try to just hit one of those control panels

909
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:30,899
and spend three minutes looking like complete morons trying to both use the same control panel?

910
00:52:32,035 --> 00:52:37,818
And how did, and then more specifically, how did designing for the co-op experience

911
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:46,683
even further muddle trying to keep the that really holistic experience with the UI, but you know now now it's even more complex?

912
00:52:47,804 --> 00:52:51,686
Co-op sort of changed the whole equation for us. Thank you for the question.

913
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:55,868
The big thing was that

914
00:52:57,077 --> 00:53:03,680
We had to create bigger play spaces, bigger doors to make sure they accommodated the co-op experience.

915
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,182
It made so that our puzzles had to be designed to work for two people.

916
00:53:08,762 --> 00:53:14,385
And admittedly, a lot of these room designs, we were experimenting as we went.

917
00:53:15,865 --> 00:53:17,726
As much as there were standards as we were set,

918
00:53:17,966 --> 00:53:20,408
some of the positionings of those panels

919
00:53:20,428 --> 00:53:21,909
were further apart and closer.

920
00:53:22,489 --> 00:53:24,110
Ultimately, we did some testing.

921
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:28,132
Some people had trouble with them, but a lot of that design

922
00:53:28,232 --> 00:53:31,594
also had to reflect the fact that the rooms were designed

923
00:53:31,614 --> 00:53:33,535
certain ways, and the level designers

924
00:53:33,575 --> 00:53:36,716
had very specific notions of why they were far closer

925
00:53:36,776 --> 00:53:37,257
to each other.

926
00:53:40,047 --> 00:53:46,409
Suffice to say, we were just part of the equation of how things were laid out, and I want to blame that guy.

927
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:54,473
No, no, but not really. Those are specifically designed to sort of...

928
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:59,021
allow you to look at the room in a very large way.

929
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:00,202
And so they're further apart.

930
00:54:00,222 --> 00:54:02,465
So you're not just zeroing in one area.

931
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:03,787
You're supposed to explore.

932
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:06,170
And it's set up that way so you would train your eyes,

933
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,853
or train the player to explore further and separate

934
00:54:08,873 --> 00:54:09,273
yourselves.

935
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:11,616
And so yes, it's OK for you to fail in the beginning.

936
00:54:11,636 --> 00:54:13,539
But the bottom line is you would realize

937
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:14,960
that it's important for you to separate it up.

938
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,821
And that's why that's there.

939
00:54:16,657 --> 00:54:16,817
Hi.

940
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:17,677
Hi.

941
00:54:18,578 --> 00:54:20,619
Since you guys gave yourselves such a restrictive rule

942
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:23,080
set for the aesthetics of all the UI,

943
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,642
I was just curious what aspect of it

944
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:28,883
you found the most difficult to convey well to the character

945
00:54:28,903 --> 00:54:30,024
because of all the restrictions.

946
00:54:31,465 --> 00:54:35,167
Concepts that were difficult to convey well to the player.

947
00:54:35,447 --> 00:54:40,450
Based on those rule sets, we always had, well.

948
00:54:41,331 --> 00:54:47,274
We always had trouble with the fact that the UI sort of had

949
00:54:47,314 --> 00:54:49,975
to live within that height range, because it was so easy

950
00:54:50,035 --> 00:54:53,537
to get our UI lost, because our UI needed

951
00:54:53,577 --> 00:54:55,198
to be seen from certain angles.

952
00:54:55,278 --> 00:54:56,418
Otherwise, it was unclear.

953
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:58,359
And so we had to stick with those rule sets.

954
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,721
Can you say the question again?

955
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:02,521
I'm not sure if I'm getting it.

956
00:55:03,682 --> 00:55:06,503
Which aspect was hardest to convey,

957
00:55:06,563 --> 00:55:09,184
like putting the ammo on the character, or doing the health,

958
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:09,565
or just?

959
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:13,709
Anything that would have been much easier with a more open system.

960
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:14,570
I gotcha.

961
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,280
I don't know.

962
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:21,602
Well, I guess the saving.

963
00:55:21,682 --> 00:55:23,524
Saving was always hard to convey.

964
00:55:23,544 --> 00:55:28,069
Because it's like, you know, in Dead Space 2 we experimented with the idea of like giving

965
00:55:28,129 --> 00:55:32,815
you auto-save instead of like just kiosk save.

966
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:38,261
We ended up fulfilling that promise in Dead Space 3, but what we realized is that it was

967
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:40,023
too important to just put on Isaac.

968
00:55:40,683 --> 00:55:43,444
It had to be on the side of the screen for many reasons,

969
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:44,625
TRC being one of them.

970
00:55:45,025 --> 00:55:46,645
And we sort of broke our own mold with that.

971
00:55:46,945 --> 00:55:49,086
But these are things that we had to deal with to make sure

972
00:55:49,106 --> 00:55:52,027
that you had no save anxiety.

973
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:53,247
Because the problem would have been,

974
00:55:53,287 --> 00:55:54,248
the bigger problem would have been,

975
00:55:54,528 --> 00:55:56,008
you were unsure if you were saving or not.

976
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:58,309
So we had to plaster it on the side of the screen.

977
00:55:58,969 --> 00:55:59,449
OK, thank you.

978
00:55:59,669 --> 00:56:00,209
Five more minutes.

979
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,330
So let's run to this one.

980
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:01,550
Sorry.

981
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,851
For the iOS version, how difficult

982
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:05,771
was it to bring the diegetic feel in the UI?

983
00:56:07,596 --> 00:56:11,159
So our team didn't work on the iPad version.

984
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:13,781
That was Iron Monkey, and they did an amazing job.

985
00:56:14,522 --> 00:56:18,786
But I saw what they did, and I think it was difficult,

986
00:56:18,826 --> 00:56:19,767
but they did it pretty well.

987
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:20,868
Is that a good answer?

988
00:56:20,888 --> 00:56:20,928
Hi.

989
00:56:21,648 --> 00:56:26,633
What were the tools like for creating the UI in Dead Space?

990
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:27,534
They're pretty horrible.

991
00:56:28,394 --> 00:56:29,916
So like I said, they're basically.

992
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,046
They're basically particles, right?

993
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:34,806
So let's go through it this way.

994
00:56:35,447 --> 00:56:38,088
You would see an animation in the game, one that you probably

995
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:39,968
didn't care about, but it happens,

996
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:43,549
is when you walk up to a door, what you would see

997
00:56:43,629 --> 00:56:47,691
is the door would open up, and two parts would open and stop,

998
00:56:47,931 --> 00:56:50,411
while two other parts of the door

999
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,272
sort of turn and move this way.

1000
00:56:53,482 --> 00:56:55,223
And you would see that a lot in the game.

1001
00:56:55,243 --> 00:56:57,444
And you really don't care about it, because all you want to do

1002
00:56:57,464 --> 00:56:58,105
is go through the door.

1003
00:56:58,525 --> 00:57:01,747
But for me, that task was immense.

1004
00:57:01,767 --> 00:57:03,328
Because you've got to understand, these are particles.

1005
00:57:03,928 --> 00:57:05,549
We don't have a keyframe timeline

1006
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:07,490
to animate these things.

1007
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,471
All particles do is fire and forget.

1008
00:57:09,811 --> 00:57:12,272
So that one element, let's focus on one element,

1009
00:57:12,312 --> 00:57:13,313
the top part of this door.

1010
00:57:14,494 --> 00:57:17,615
It needed to go from here, which is not moving, to over here

1011
00:57:17,695 --> 00:57:19,036
and stop.

1012
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,798
That simple motion meant I had one particle sitting here.

1013
00:57:23,595 --> 00:57:28,404
that I killed when you came up to it, and then had another particle that flew off this

1014
00:57:28,464 --> 00:57:32,993
way, but then I had to make it invisible as soon as it got to this point, and had another

1015
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:35,278
particle to replace it sitting right here.

1016
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,822
as soon as this flew away and disappeared.

1017
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:41,925
So you just saw three particles sort of happen in front of you,

1018
00:57:42,245 --> 00:57:45,028
and all that was was the motion of that door going like this.

1019
00:57:45,288 --> 00:57:47,770
Now, mind you, there was this, there was this, there was a spin.

1020
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:51,253
All of those were separate particles sort of moving in a dance

1021
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:54,236
to make it look like it's a door sort of animating all together.

1022
00:57:54,936 --> 00:57:56,378
So that's just one state.

1023
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:57,919
Now, let's talk about.

1024
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:04,258
door opening, door spinning because it's loading the next thing.

1025
00:58:04,478 --> 00:58:05,659
It was impossible to use.

1026
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:06,340
It was horrible.

1027
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,141
And we used it all throughout Dead Space 1, 2, and 3.

1028
00:58:08,181 --> 00:58:11,525
That sounds awful.

1029
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:11,945
Thank you.

1030
00:58:11,965 --> 00:58:12,786
Yeah, it was awful.

1031
00:58:15,628 --> 00:58:16,489
Hey there.

1032
00:58:16,769 --> 00:58:17,890
Basically, assuming that...

1033
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:18,231
Oh, sorry.

1034
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,412
I should jump on him.

1035
00:58:19,672 --> 00:58:19,812
Maybe.

1036
00:58:19,852 --> 00:58:19,992
Oh, yeah.

1037
00:58:20,012 --> 00:58:20,373
Okay, sorry.

1038
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:20,493
Yep.

1039
00:58:20,513 --> 00:58:20,593
Yeah.

1040
00:58:20,613 --> 00:58:20,693
Yeah.

1041
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:20,793
Yeah.

1042
00:58:20,813 --> 00:58:20,893
Yeah.

1043
00:58:21,013 --> 00:58:21,113
Yeah.

1044
00:58:21,133 --> 00:58:21,233
Yeah.

1045
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:23,653
Do you have an opinion on if

1046
00:58:23,993 --> 00:58:29,935
Diegetic works better in first person or third person or do you think it works for both games? I think it works for both games

1047
00:58:32,256 --> 00:58:32,336
I

1048
00:58:32,456 --> 00:58:39,338
Think that it's easier to sell in third person in my opinion, but it works for both games. The reason being is that in first person

1049
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:42,860
You you don't have

1050
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,301
You're like you're you are your eyeballs

1051
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:48,122
And so if you see diegetic you expect the hand to be there as well

1052
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:50,703
And if you're not doing this, then it doesn't feel

1053
00:58:51,635 --> 00:58:53,375
you know, as real.

1054
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:57,477
And so we have the excuse that it's not your hands in the game.

1055
00:58:57,497 --> 00:58:59,397
So if it's diegetic, it's the player's hands,

1056
00:58:59,417 --> 00:59:01,138
and we can animate there, and it makes sense.

1057
00:59:01,918 --> 00:59:06,020
Yeah, it seems easier for third person, like stuff in the world.

1058
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,241
But the HUD, it seems harder to make diegetic.

1059
00:59:09,741 --> 00:59:10,881
All you really have is your weapon.

1060
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:13,642
In fact, a HUD would never be diegetic.

1061
00:59:13,802 --> 00:59:16,803
There's no way, unless you say that it's

1062
00:59:16,843 --> 00:59:18,424
projected into an eyeball, which, yeah.

1063
00:59:19,464 --> 00:59:19,704
Thanks.

1064
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:20,365
Hi.

1065
00:59:21,682 --> 00:59:27,807
So, assuming that you're done with the franchise, I guess, and you end up with a totally different

1066
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:33,072
project in a totally different universe, would you still attempt the diegetic UI?

1067
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:36,335
Are you sort of sold to the concept?

1068
00:59:37,056 --> 00:59:40,960
Are you ready to go back to more standard, more traditional UI elements?

1069
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,452
Yeah, first of all, the franchise is not dead.

1070
00:59:44,032 --> 00:59:44,893
Oh, sorry.

1071
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:46,014
I'll say that.

1072
00:59:47,175 --> 00:59:51,479
But going into other projects, I can't

1073
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:52,920
talk about what I'm working on right now.

1074
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,602
But I will say that we are experimenting

1075
00:59:55,743 --> 00:59:57,504
with different ways to do UI again.

1076
00:59:58,585 --> 01:00:01,828
And I'm willing to go back to traditional styles

1077
01:00:02,188 --> 01:00:03,469
if that's what the project needs.

1078
01:00:03,509 --> 01:00:04,390
That's the bottom line.

1079
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:06,772
It's always go back to what the project needs.

1080
01:00:08,054 --> 01:00:12,144
Dead Space was just so happened to be a project that needed to be immersive as it was.

1081
01:00:12,665 --> 01:00:14,089
And so we got away with some crazy stuff.

1082
01:00:14,289 --> 01:00:16,555
So, I'll take one last question and we're done I think.

1083
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,188
Thanks for the talk and for teaching us the word diegetic,

1084
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:21,249
because we all sound smart now.

1085
01:00:22,209 --> 01:00:25,851
So what I was wondering is, so a lot of the diegetic elements

1086
01:00:26,392 --> 01:00:28,293
happen to work really well for co-op,

1087
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:31,254
but they were there since Dead Space 1.

1088
01:00:31,434 --> 01:00:33,976
All the NPCs have rigs on them, even though usually you

1089
01:00:34,016 --> 01:00:35,917
didn't need to know their health and everything like that.

1090
01:00:36,697 --> 01:00:41,119
Was that in any way instrumental in the concept of Dead Space 3

1091
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,080
having co-op?

1092
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,161
Was this kind of something that you guys always

1093
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:46,522
saw happening in the world and were like, oh, there

1094
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:47,383
should be another player here?

1095
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:48,512
Another what?

1096
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:48,833
Sorry.

1097
01:00:48,893 --> 01:00:49,473
Another player.

1098
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:50,193
Oh.

1099
01:00:50,634 --> 01:00:50,754
Oh.

1100
01:00:51,894 --> 01:00:53,515
I don't know if it was instrumental at all,

1101
01:00:55,516 --> 01:00:58,218
but it sure did make it prettier and made it help.

1102
01:00:58,378 --> 01:00:58,538
Yeah.

1103
01:00:58,678 --> 01:00:58,838
Yeah.

1104
01:00:59,158 --> 01:00:59,358
OK.

1105
01:00:59,439 --> 01:00:59,619
Cool.

1106
01:00:59,659 --> 01:00:59,859
Thanks.

1107
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:02,400
Awesome.

1108
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:03,601
Thank you guys for being here.
