1
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:12,341
Today we are going to look at collaboration, first as a mindset and then as a practice

2
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:16,963
designed to help you get the most out of your recording sessions and foster relationships

3
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:20,325
to inspire creativity and engender productivity.

4
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:22,767
My name is Julie Nathanson.

5
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:25,549
I've been a voice actor for over 20 years,

6
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:28,370
doing games and animation and commercials

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,771
and whatever they tell me to say.

8
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:34,754
In terms of games, I started out doing games like Psychonauts.

9
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:35,935
I played Lampida.

10
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:39,798
In the Final Fantasy games, I'm Prish and Dissidia Duodesim.

11
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,559
In 13.2 and Lightning Returns, I am,

12
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:45,781
and I apologize in advance for this, ChocoBocalina.

13
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,791
Let's see, I play a wide range of roles.

14
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:52,154
Thank you, thank you.

15
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:54,716
I play a wide range of roles

16
00:00:54,817 --> 00:00:57,580
from a soldier in Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,764
to Samantha Maxis in Call of Duty Black Ops.

18
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:07,970
Chill in the Skylanders series and just black in Far Cry 5.

19
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:12,955
And as I stand here next to Eve, who is the voiceover lead at ArenaNet,

20
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:17,339
I can tell you that in the decade that I've been working on Guild Wars 2,

21
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:18,760
I have voiced over 30 characters.

22
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm Eve Eschenbacher, I'm the voiceover lead at ArenaNet, as Julie just said.

23
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,562
I've had maybe as varied a career as Julie's, if not quite as prestigious.

24
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:35,423
I've been in games for about 14 years now.

25
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:39,984
I started as a localization editor at a translation company in Tokyo, Japan, working on a few

26
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:41,905
Metal Gear titles and varied other games.

27
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:46,145
I've been a freelance Japanese to English translator for a number of games and strategy

28
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:49,786
guides, and then I was a translator at the Pokemon company where I worked on Pokemon

29
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:52,807
Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver, and other titles.

30
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:58,348
I got my start at ArenaNet as a copy editor, and then I took over VO from one of the producers

31
00:01:58,428 --> 00:02:02,569
and built the process and the team to what it is now, which enables us to put out large,

32
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:04,889
frequent content updates every two to three months.

33
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,230
Sorry, I'm balancing two computers.

34
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:11,338
collaboration.

35
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:16,120
Guild Wars 2 is a little unique in that we have our living world content updates that

36
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,341
we put out every couple months.

37
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:23,004
Since GW2 launched in August 2012, we've had four seasons of Living World and two expansions.

38
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:29,207
In six and a half years, we've released over 50,000 lines of VO from 70 actors across 38

39
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:34,890
episodes of Living World, in addition to two expansions involving another 50,000 plus lines

40
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,730
of VO from over 100 actors.

41
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:41,777
Some of our actors have been working with us for over a decade, even going back to the original Guild Wars.

42
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:47,044
And that level of commitment and consistency really necessitates a more personal approach, in my opinion,

43
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,809
because people are more likely to want to continue to work with you when you treat them well.

44
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,030
I can vouch for this.

45
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:58,877
So my experience working on Guild Wars 2 has been particularly collaborative, and I've

46
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:02,079
polled my voice actor friends and it seems to be a consensus.

47
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,879
We all look forward to these sessions.

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,302
And I think one of the reasons is this collaborative attitude and collaborative process that Guild

49
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,823
Wars has afforded us all as a luxury.

50
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:17,045
And this collaboration is not just because they almost delivered my baby, which is a

51
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:17,545
true story.

52
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:26,129
So years ago, I was ginormously pregnant and started to have some like, you know, early

53
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,211
labor stuff that wasn't ready for the kid to be knocking on the door.

54
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:34,055
So they just briefly put me in the hospital and I had to miss a Guild Wars 2 session,

55
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:36,757
which of course I apologized for profusely.

56
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:41,160
And when I got to session, still pregnant a few days later...

57
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,404
They all greeted me, these are directors and editors and developers,

58
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:47,826
going, okay, we know how to deliver your child.

59
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:49,648
Mark will get the hot water.

60
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:52,770
Eve and I was like, thanks guys.

61
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:56,374
Luckily, that form of collaboration was not needed,

62
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:57,875
and my child was born in a hospital.

63
00:03:58,436 --> 00:03:59,376
Thank you for your concern.

64
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:01,699
He's nine now.

65
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:02,459
That's true.

66
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,360
It was a long time ago.

67
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:12,555
Why collaboration? I've had to study how to handle social situations because they don't come naturally to me because I'm autistic.

68
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm constantly adjusting and fine-tuning my approach, and I learn from other people, I observe, I adapt.

69
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,223
And as I mentioned a moment ago, I work with a number of actors on a fairly regular cadence.

70
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:32,110
Every recording session, I'm bringing in 25 to 30 actors, and about two-thirds of them are people who have been playing named recurring characters for years.

71
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,351
So I've gotten to know everybody really well,

72
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:36,413
and I've found that a certain approach and mentality

73
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:39,015
work better to keep everybody happy and excited

74
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:40,536
to continue working with you.

75
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:43,498
Basically, my stance is that everybody in the room

76
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:44,398
is a professional.

77
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:46,840
We're all an artist of one kind or another.

78
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,302
And I'm talking about the sound engineer and the director

79
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:51,063
and the actors and the writers and myself.

80
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,824
We're all practicing our version of art.

81
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,145
And we all want to do our best.

82
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:57,847
Communication is the key to quality.

83
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,429
So you treat your actors like they're part of your team.

84
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:02,799
We like that part.

85
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,622
So in terms of defining collaboration, you can get a lot of definitions that have to

86
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:08,803
do with problem solving.

87
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:09,984
There's nothing wrong with that.

88
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:13,066
But I kind of like looking at it from a different angle.

89
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:19,010
Dr. Britt Andreatta, who wrote Wired to Connect, the neuroscience of team leadership.

90
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,012
I spoke about it in a podcast I listened to recently,

91
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:23,734
and she called collaboration

92
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:27,116
a mutual engagement of two or more people

93
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:29,858
trying to achieve some kind of common goal

94
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,701
that they both contribute to in new and unexpected ways.

95
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:37,244
So, it's really an act of creation.

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,724
She went on to say that when people are working together, whatever they're building is going

97
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:45,889
to get tweaked and changed because of the input of each member of that team.

98
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:50,153
So no one can predict how it's going to turn out because it's constantly evolving.

99
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:52,496
That's game dev, right?

100
00:05:53,257 --> 00:05:53,337
So...

101
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:58,478
To explain, in addition to voiceover, which I love, I'm also a writer.

102
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,762
I've written for live-action TV. I've written some Disney mobile game scripts.

103
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:07,206
I've written and consulted on the upcoming Guildlings game for Servo.

104
00:06:07,926 --> 00:06:12,130
And because I am from a family of shrinks with a great interest in psychology,

105
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:15,273
I also happen to have a master's in clinical psychology.

106
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:19,878
So I have three perspectives when it comes to collaboration.

107
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:24,531
From a psychological standpoint, I see so many benefits,

108
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:27,458
from social connectedness to neuro-synchrony,

109
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:28,902
which I promise I will get to.

110
00:06:29,142 --> 00:06:30,024
It's the coolest.

111
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,455
As a writer, I know that the vacuum of the singular creator doesn't yield a lot of that

112
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:42,160
inspiration and innovation that comes from being in a room of other excited creative

113
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,620
minds.

114
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:47,885
And as a voice actor, I know that when I am brought into the process with renderings,

115
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:52,790
videos, storyline, and given access to the world of the game I'm being asked to inhabit,

116
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:58,113
I'm more likely to feel connected to the narrative, relationships, and life of the character,

117
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,635
and more dedicated to the experience of recording your game.

118
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,736
So in short, I feel included.

119
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:07,377
And inclusion matters.

120
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:11,879
Exclusion, by comparison, is measured in the brain

121
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:15,660
in the same way that the brain measures physical pain.

122
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:20,267
Exclusion is measured in the brain the same way that we measure physical pain.

123
00:07:21,148 --> 00:07:28,235
So inclusion, by contrast, offers this openness, this connection and attunement.

124
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:31,758
And from there, real collaboration is possible.

125
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:36,462
So what happens when we have real inclusion and real collaboration and we really, really,

126
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:37,223
really work together?

127
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,105
Neural synchrony.

128
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:42,658
It's really group neural synchrony.

129
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:46,259
So neuroscientists have hooked up people's brains

130
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,679
with EEGs, with the thing that sounds like snuffalopagus

131
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,760
but isn't, the encephalophagram.

132
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,080
That's why I don't say it.

133
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,760
But it's, so you can hook up these people's brains

134
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,321
all working in a room together

135
00:07:57,841 --> 00:08:00,481
and then view the electrical activity in the brain.

136
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:01,841
Check out the brainwaves, right?

137
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:07,102
The more people were connecting and truly working together,

138
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:09,843
their brainwaves start to look the same.

139
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:14,210
Not just a little bit, but they could be traced on top of each other.

140
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:20,634
So when they're really engaged and feeling really, really connected to each other and

141
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:27,399
having a higher degree of empathy, that neural synchrony is even more pronounced.

142
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,822
So that feeling of being on the same wavelength or being in sync when you're really getting

143
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:34,804
it when you're working with someone else, that's real brain science stuff.

144
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:35,985
So

145
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:41,433
That's why we feel like collaboration might be kind of a cool thing,

146
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,914
to add in all aspects of the creation of a game.

147
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,136
And why do this now?

148
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:53,278
I mean, coming together is more important than ever in today's world.

149
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,440
I mean, the old model was kind of more of an exclusionary mindset,

150
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,041
the sense that, you know, we pay you to be here for four hours,

151
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,082
you come in, you say and do whatever we want

152
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:04,123
because we gave you money and you leave.

153
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:04,983
And that's...

154
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:05,304
That's...

155
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:07,316
Great.

156
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:10,017
Well, at the end, we just feel like it's

157
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,498
possible to add a collaborative mindset.

158
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,520
So that just means, really, from the get-go,

159
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,262
looking at a we over a me stance,

160
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:21,923
valuing open-mindedness, and holding the belief

161
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:24,064
that other people have something to add

162
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:25,905
and that we're always learning.

163
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,626
So just starting from that mindset

164
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:30,188
might shift something, might shift a few things.

165
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,070
And we're also going to give you some more concrete tools that

166
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,831
might be helpful once you adopt.

167
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,332
A collaborative mindset.

168
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:43,239
Getting the most out of actors starts with getting the most out of their auditions.

169
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,605
Hey, fancy that. Look, we all want the same thing. You guys want us to nail your audition.

170
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:53,310
We want to nail your audition. We want to work for you. So,

171
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:57,635
when we get your audition material, it's all we get.

172
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,998
And most of us are going to be self-directed.

173
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,823
Most of us working actors at this point, we have home studios.

174
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,927
And even if we're not just directing ourselves at home,

175
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,311
if we go into the agency that represents us to audition,

176
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:13,654
the booth director there doesn't have any more information

177
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:15,256
than we do on the piece of paper.

178
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:20,303
So unless you have us go into a studio and work with a director in person who knows your

179
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:25,709
game, you've got to make sure that what's on that piece of paper is really crucial and

180
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:30,595
helpful for us to build what we can to make the character you're looking for.

181
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:34,479
And in the spirit of collaboration, if you don't hear exactly what you're looking for,

182
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:41,022
Listen beyond the voice print. Don't just listen to the sound of the voice. If it's rough, if it's resonant,

183
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:45,603
it's not just that, right? It's whether someone's connecting with the material.

184
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:52,405
Someone who makes you curious about whether or not she could maybe do something else with that character.

185
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:54,325
That's who you might want to bring in.

186
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:56,886
So...

187
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,466
Guild Wars 2 is a really big game.

188
00:10:59,506 --> 00:11:02,567
It's a giant world with a lot of NPCs having conversations,

189
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:03,688
giving quests and whatnot.

190
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:05,609
And while we do work with Blind Light,

191
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,090
who's our external vendor, to run auditions

192
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,791
for our big new roles, I end up with a lot of little

193
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:13,792
small part NPCs around the world every episode.

194
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:16,613
So I work with the writers and the designers

195
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:17,874
to get a sense of what they're building

196
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,935
so I can make sure that there's enough voices

197
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,595
to go around for all these NPCs.

198
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:26,008
We also have a number of monsters and enemies that need to be voiced.

199
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:29,952
And I work closely with our audio team as we're working out the processing for new monsters.

200
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:33,475
For example, we had this large...

201
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:34,556
Did you see a monster?

202
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:35,898
You pointed to a monster.

203
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:37,099
I pointed to our audio director.

204
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,280
Okay, I feel so much better now.

205
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,821
I thought she was like, and the monsters.

206
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:41,943
Does anyone see something that I don't see?

207
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:46,547
He had this large creature that needed to be voiced.

208
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,889
The performance needed to be done in a certain way

209
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,191
so that when we overlaid the processing on the lines,

210
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:52,512
it didn't become unintelligible.

211
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:55,755
For that, we got one of the writers

212
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,277
to help us record some in-house scratch audio

213
00:11:58,297 --> 00:11:59,498
to test with the processing.

214
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:04,189
And then we could take that into the studio for the actor to hear.

215
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:09,933
So we could demonstrate for him that this delivery plus this processing is going to equal this line.

216
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:13,936
And the actor was awesome. He took that cue and he made the performance his own.

217
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,075
So even just the act of sharing that information was an act of collaboration, right?

218
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:24,021
Some of this stuff seems so simple, but again, coming from a mindset, the rest of it will

219
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:30,088
start to be possible in other aspects of your experience working with or even considering

220
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:31,249
working with voice actors.

221
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,273
So casting sites for auditions.

222
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:40,202
If you can give us an image of the character, we get so much out of it.

223
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:43,242
And you can also give a vocal reference, right?

224
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,403
You can say, well, this really sounds like, you know,

225
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:48,343
maybe something like Hermione in Harry Potter.

226
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:49,903
So that might give us a sense.

227
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:54,004
But a picture does something to our brains.

228
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,925
Because our brains are natural problem solvers.

229
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,585
We are looking for clues.

230
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:03,566
We want, our brains are dying to fix and finish that puzzle that you're giving us.

231
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:11,920
So for a moment, I want you to imagine that I've given you a 1,000-piece puzzle.

232
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:15,142
No, let's make it worse, 5,000-piece puzzle.

233
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:20,745
And I'm going to dump it right in front of you and say, make a thing.

234
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,047
But I didn't put a picture on the box.

235
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:27,948
Your brain's going to get stuck.

236
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:30,254
You can put the corner pieces in.

237
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:31,754
We all know how to find the corner pieces.

238
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:33,455
And you can do the barriers, little boundaries.

239
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,256
After a while, you're just like,

240
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:37,476
ah, I'm going to shove this purple into the purple,

241
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:38,477
and that kind of looks like...

242
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:42,118
Your brain starts to distance from the experience

243
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:43,458
and maybe even shut down.

244
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:47,940
But once you put a picture on the box,

245
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,101
the brain starts firing toward completing the puzzle.

246
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,501
Our brains fire toward possibility.

247
00:13:57,202 --> 00:14:00,886
And if you like that, read everything Dan Siegel has ever written.

248
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,248
It's amazing.

249
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:08,206
In the character backstory section,

250
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:10,407
you probably don't necessarily want to give away

251
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:13,089
exactly the plot or the who and the when of your IP,

252
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,930
especially if you're working on a fairly recognizable franchise.

253
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:19,913
On Guild Wars, we've been cautious in the past about noting that we were

254
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:22,174
recasting beloved characters from Guild Wars 1

255
00:14:22,274 --> 00:14:24,115
who are going to make an appearance in Guild Wars 2.

256
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:27,937
But you still need to find a comparable event or experience that you can

257
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:30,098
reference to give your actor a sense of the journey that

258
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:32,860
the character will be undertaking without giving away the story.

259
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,127
You also want to hit the points of emotion.

260
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:39,769
So be sure to include the range of emotions

261
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:41,749
that this character will need throughout the game

262
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,990
to offer opportunities for your actors

263
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,671
to show you that they can go there.

264
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:50,432
So A, this will help you cast that particular character,

265
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:53,133
and B, give you a sense of whether or not

266
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:55,134
that actor can handle the emotional arc

267
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:56,495
of a similar character.

268
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:59,236
As you've said, sometimes you might be sending out

269
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:03,397
10 audition sides for 60 characters you're looking for.

270
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:10,219
If the character has any combat scenes, make sure to include a small amount of that in

271
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,361
the sides because that warns the actor that the role requires vocal stress and it also

272
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:16,682
gives you a sense of how they can do efforts and gutturals.

273
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:22,205
Auditions and protecting your confidential material.

274
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:25,547
Because casting sites for auditions are a bit public.

275
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:29,509
I mean, they're sent out widely to actors and agents that aren't necessarily under NDA.

276
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,241
You probably want to obscure, cut, and obfuscate your IP-specific terms.

277
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:38,883
You put war never changes in an audition site, and the games press goes, ooh, maybe there's

278
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:39,903
a new Fallout game coming.

279
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:45,925
You say you're recasting a British woman who plunders ancient burial places, and they're

280
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,065
probably going to guess that there's a new Tomb Raider game in the works.

281
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:52,568
There's a tendency to cut away so much from the casting sides to hide your IP that it

282
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:56,309
becomes over sanitized, leaving actors too little to work with.

283
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,451
You cut too much meat off the bone and all you're left with is scraps.

284
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:04,073
What we usually do is write the casting side as if we were writing it for an internal review

285
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:05,054
or an NDA to actor.

286
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:07,330
and then just disguise, find, and replace.

287
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:11,355
And yes, please do change the important details of the character,

288
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:13,658
but don't, just for fun, for example,

289
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:19,284
don't change your main prehistoric villainous dinosaur creature

290
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,847
to a member of the geek squad at Best Buy.

291
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:26,172
Make parallel changes and keep the emotional arcs.

292
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,891
So we want to give you some audition examples.

293
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,492
I'm going to pretend that I'm casting a game,

294
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:35,053
and this is the audition side that I would be sending Julie

295
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:36,653
through our vendor.

296
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:39,054
This first casting side has been scrubbed

297
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:40,395
of all sensitive information.

298
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,176
So let's see.

299
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,197
Let's pretend I've never seen this before.

300
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:46,998
So Emily is in her 20s.

301
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:47,818
That's all I get.

302
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,153
I have three lines from Emily.

303
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:53,996
Remember, bravery is not undone by injury, but by lack of faith.

304
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:55,597
Stop, no more.

305
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:59,899
I may not have been made for war, but I will fight with everything I have.

306
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,420
And now, attack.

307
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,282
So I am going to look for any clues I can

308
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:07,424
in this extremely sanitized audition piece.

309
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:09,085
I have bravery.

310
00:17:09,105 --> 00:17:10,786
I have injury.

311
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:13,207
I have war and fight.

312
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:18,637
Okay, so she's in her 20s and I'm going to say she's a soldier, right?

313
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:21,620
And maybe at the beginning she's talking to herself, right?

314
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,783
Maybe she's got to remind herself that she can do it, you know, get her bravery back

315
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:26,704
because she's been injured.

316
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,287
And the now attack, well, okay, well, hold on, now maybe she's the commander.

317
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:33,830
So I want to make her really commanding and give her a lot of control.

318
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:38,694
So my stab in the dark with very little information would be...

319
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:45,977
Remember, bravery is not undone by injury, but by lack of faith.

320
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:48,698
Stop! No more!

321
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:53,660
I may not have been made for war, but I will fight with everything I have.

322
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:55,461
Now, attack!

323
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,023
So, we have no idea if that was any good.

324
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:04,145
Because we don't know anything about this character or the game.

325
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,069
This version is a little bit less over sanitized,

326
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,570
but it's still obfuscated, so I'm not giving away my IP.

327
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,532
I've changed a few terms,

328
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:16,654
gone with a few parallel sort of things,

329
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:19,236
but it's not giving away exactly what I'm working on.

330
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,817
Now look at all the clues I get.

331
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,518
Sci-fi fantasy?

332
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:26,641
Okay, so maybe not a first person shooter in a modern war.

333
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:29,306
I'm going to read it to you.

334
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:30,568
Age 20s, but immortal.

335
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:35,113
Ah, so maybe her voice and her appearance could be young.

336
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:37,455
But there's going to be a world weariness.

337
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,958
There's going to be an intelligence, a wisdom.

338
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:41,660
Her appearance?

339
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,120
Ha!

340
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:44,042
Look, it's so pretty.

341
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,164
Look, there's glowing lights.

342
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,146
That tells me there might be some magic.

343
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:49,867
There's power.

344
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:52,248
I can see her eyes are determined.

345
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:53,489
Her sword.

346
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,012
There's a lot of mysticism there and a lot of power

347
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:59,954
and a lot of contemplative emotion.

348
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,217
So there's a lot for me to play with just from that example.

349
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:06,199
That's a stock photo I pulled from Shutterstock.

350
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,101
You can too.

351
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,505
So she's a high priestess.

352
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,347
OK, great.

353
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,632
Probably some mysticism there, too.

354
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,101
Selfless, wise, empathic, and determined.

355
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,671
Backstory, high priestess Emelina, and you'll notice that we changed Emily to Emelina.

356
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:25,011
Why?

357
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:28,353
Because Emily feels so modern, right?

358
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:32,494
Young and cute and modern, or just, you know, modern, earthling.

359
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:36,335
Emelina spelled funny, well, I don't know, maybe it's a little bit more fantasy.

360
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:37,415
Just to bring us in.

361
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:44,838
She's the benevolent spiritual leader of the peaceful Palyx, an alien race of human-like

362
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,079
creatures with the ability to assume powers of nature.

363
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:53,631
When invaders began to siphon her planet's resources to fuel their biological weapons,

364
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:59,257
Emelina is forced to become a warrior, training her people to save themselves and their home.

365
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:00,459
So what do I have here?

366
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:05,824
Benevolent spiritual leader, so we have a leader with kindness and connection.

367
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:10,043
We have, we've got invaders.

368
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:13,524
So this beautiful planet is being taken from me

369
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:16,225
and it's my responsibility to now become

370
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,606
and forced to become a warrior.

371
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:21,627
This is an unwitting warrior who will now have to lead.

372
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:24,968
So now the line, the first line we had,

373
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,489
benevolent, spiritual, well now I know.

374
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:31,010
I'm not injured, someone else is injured.

375
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,091
Okay?

376
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,152
So I might benevolently say, remember.

377
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:41,431
Bravery is not undone by injury, but by lack of faith.

378
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:46,879
The next line, internal conflict then determined, so I'm going to say,

379
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:50,484
not that I wrote this or anything, but I'm going to say.

380
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:53,182
You know, work with me.

381
00:20:54,123 --> 00:20:59,247
That stop and no more is she's looking and seeing something that's too painful for her

382
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,069
and then has to make a decision.

383
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:07,054
Maybe because I know this character is going to make a transition during this game because

384
00:21:07,394 --> 00:21:11,057
it's in the sides, that there's a character arc for her that she has to become a warrior.

385
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,539
Maybe this is the minute that she makes the decision.

386
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,502
So stop, no more.

387
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,905
I may not have been made for war.

388
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:24,213
But I will fight with everything I have.

389
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,815
And then leading her people into battle.

390
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:30,117
Well, we've got the now attack.

391
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:32,578
That part's probably about where we went before.

392
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,400
But we have an attack effort at the end.

393
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:37,982
I almost want to cover the mic for it.

394
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:39,383
I don't want to hurt your ears.

395
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:41,424
All right.

396
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:43,906
But she's going to bring her people into battle.

397
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:44,506
Now!

398
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:45,186
Attack!

399
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:46,527
No!

400
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:49,169
Has a little more life to it.

401
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:52,076
I'm going to cast myself in that role.

402
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:53,837
You're hired.

403
00:21:57,598 --> 00:22:00,738
To shift gears a little bit, casting actors for multiple roles,

404
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:05,539
SAG rules say that you can get three roles per four-hour session with SAG actors.

405
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,500
So, you know, sometimes I cast somebody for a named character

406
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,781
and also a generic NPC off to the side.

407
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:14,861
Um, sorry.

408
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:20,887
You want to know the actor's range and listen for ad libs and goofs in the session.

409
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:22,327
First of all, we're all goofs.

410
00:22:22,627 --> 00:22:25,728
We like to listen to ourselves talk, and so when we get in the booth, you're going to

411
00:22:25,768 --> 00:22:26,428
hear a lot of things.

412
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:29,789
Also, you listened for flexibility in our auditions, right?

413
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:36,011
Maybe you heard me slate Julie Nathanson, and then I went into my little kid character

414
00:22:36,111 --> 00:22:39,492
and went, hey, who gave the jog all my peanut butter?

415
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:40,633
So...

416
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:44,497
From my slate, you went, oh, you know what?

417
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:46,279
She could probably play the kid's mom.

418
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:47,841
The mom just has a couple lines.

419
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:50,584
And then also the kid, right?

420
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:53,907
So you're listening for any clues you can from us

421
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:57,351
about how to enjoy our versatility

422
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,792
if we're lucky enough to have it.

423
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:03,337
I've been able to give a lot of our actors different roles with the confidence that they'd

424
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:08,178
nail them based on demos, credits, and just goofy voices they've done between takes.

425
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,660
I cast one of our actors as a Skrit Queen, which in our game Skrit are just these little

426
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,862
rat-like creatures, just based on the fact that she had worked as a Hanson puppeteer,

427
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:20,402
knowing that she would nail it.

428
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:24,943
Preparing for recording sessions.

429
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,066
What we do in preparing for the recording sessions,

430
00:23:30,446 --> 00:23:32,567
there's a lot of table reads and script review.

431
00:23:33,648 --> 00:23:38,329
You want to read it all out loud before you ever start sending anything out

432
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:40,110
because nail down the pronunciations,

433
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,631
the important words in your world.

434
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,792
If you're having a hard time saying it,

435
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:46,153
it probably needs a rewrite.

436
00:23:47,496 --> 00:23:51,940
Gather image and video references to share with your actors of the game content.

437
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:55,363
Get your scripts in chronological order if you can.

438
00:23:55,703 --> 00:24:00,147
This helps everybody keep track of where they are in the story.

439
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:04,251
It's confusing to jump around in story arcs and have to tell your actors, oh yeah, that

440
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,893
guy you just killed, now you're meeting him for the first time.

441
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:12,647
You can create an episode or chapter character art summary sheet if you can.

442
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:18,434
This is an example of one we put together for season four, episode two at ArenaNet.

443
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:21,738
It's the overall arc of the episode and summaries of each chapter.

444
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:27,190
And there were also a few sentences on each named character's backstory, motivation, and

445
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,371
arc for the episode.

446
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:30,693
It's a quick reference for actors, directors, and you.

447
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:35,177
For a long-running game like Guild Wars 2, this kind of helps our actors remember where

448
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:35,978
we left off.

449
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,541
Last time on Guild Wars 2.

450
00:24:40,503 --> 00:24:42,705
So Excel-style scripts.

451
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:45,052
Sometimes you got to use them, right?

452
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:47,054
Sometimes we get into the studio and it's like,

453
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:50,037
we need you to do 400 lines in seven minutes.

454
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:53,241
So context goes away and we just do our thing.

455
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:56,524
Sometimes it's the only format that works for your content.

456
00:24:57,004 --> 00:24:59,086
It's just a number of lines like an announcer.

457
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:02,930
But it's harder to follow the through line of the story.

458
00:25:03,731 --> 00:25:05,092
And it often lacks context.

459
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:08,274
So as before, right, without context,

460
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:10,655
you know, just a generic human female,

461
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:13,757
I would say, no more breaks, we've got work to do.

462
00:25:14,457 --> 00:25:16,758
And then, yeah, and the captain will have our hides

463
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,079
if she sees you loafing about.

464
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,620
Do what you like.

465
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,861
But if I'm going to die, I'll die on my feet.

466
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:23,742
I have no context.

467
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:25,283
I have no emotional quality.

468
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:28,285
I'm just going to say the words, and you'll get it in your game.

469
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,786
But it might not give you the feeling you need.

470
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:32,427
In contrast.

471
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:33,938
movie-style scripts.

472
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:38,226
These are what the actors are used to seeing.

473
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:40,246
Gives the context of the scene.

474
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:42,207
You can see the previous and following lines,

475
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:43,807
and it's easier to follow the through line.

476
00:25:44,387 --> 00:25:46,568
So here we can see that you've got two Corsairs

477
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:47,648
near some wreckage.

478
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:50,709
The first speaker, that would be me at work gathering crates.

479
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:51,649
Oh, OK, cool.

480
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:53,670
So I'm moving while this is happening.

481
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,550
And the second speaker is sitting down.

482
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,691
Oh, now I get it.

483
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:59,331
I'm basically accusing the person next to me

484
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:00,151
of not working.

485
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,672
That really changes the context.

486
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:04,132
So I would say, no more breaks.

487
00:26:04,332 --> 00:26:05,113
We've got work to do.

488
00:26:05,957 --> 00:26:08,158
Work to do? Do you hear yourself right now?

489
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,180
Crocatoric's coming. The brand'll take us all.

490
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,443
Tia, then the captain will have our hides if she sees you loafing about.

491
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:17,925
I'm not spending the last moments of my short little life hauling crates.

492
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:23,129
Do what you like. But if I'm gonna die, I'll die on my feet.

493
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,791
Okay, so I still don't know if that was what they wanted,

494
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:28,512
but I sure got a lot more out of it.

495
00:26:29,893 --> 00:26:30,754
Focal stress.

496
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:34,870
That's a fun topic, isn't it?

497
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,731
Look, it's a hot button issue, and we know it.

498
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:38,732
Professional voice actors, we know

499
00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:42,534
we're going to have to scream and be electrocuted and die

500
00:26:42,554 --> 00:26:43,034
by fire.

501
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,676
We know you're going to have to have us take damage,

502
00:26:45,716 --> 00:26:47,317
and we're going to have to slice a lot of people.

503
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:47,937
We've got it.

504
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:50,698
The thing is that the body can only take so much.

505
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:53,720
So there are ways to structure and handle

506
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,702
vocal stress that, again, is more collaborative,

507
00:26:56,842 --> 00:26:59,323
understanding that perhaps.

508
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:02,206
It may not always just be combat.

509
00:27:02,326 --> 00:27:06,590
For example, one time I got some audition sides for a villain character

510
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,353
and I noticed that in the sides she wasn't yelling, right?

511
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:11,454
Didn't seem too intense.

512
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:18,140
So I made her a little darker and I gave her this rumbling, raspy voice.

513
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,601
I booked the job.

514
00:27:20,442 --> 00:27:23,584
And then I got in there and it's not that she had to yell.

515
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:27,313
But everyone she talked to, she was very intense.

516
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:28,313
It killed.

517
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:29,874
So I had no clue.

518
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:33,176
And I had offered a voice print that I couldn't really

519
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:38,659
sustain for four straight hours in this character

520
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:39,820
at that intensity.

521
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,481
So that's why the clues are so helpful.

522
00:27:42,982 --> 00:27:44,522
Help us help you.

523
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:47,224
Had to be in there somewhere, right?

524
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:49,522
It was my line.

525
00:27:51,344 --> 00:27:52,605
There's a misconception that...

526
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,287
Oh yeah, there it is. That is your line.

527
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:55,668
Pretend I didn't say that.

528
00:27:55,688 --> 00:28:01,534
There's a misconception that soldiers have to have a dark, gruff voice print,

529
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:04,638
and that's not necessarily true, because soldier's an attitude.

530
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:05,759
Anybody can be a soldier.

531
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,589
But help your actors help you.

532
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:10,931
You know, tell the agents roughly how much shouting

533
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:12,333
is going to be needed for the session.

534
00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:14,815
Because actors can have multiple sessions in a day

535
00:28:14,915 --> 00:28:17,137
and this helps them schedule and manage their performances

536
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,318
so they bring you their A game every time.

537
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,061
It can also be helpful for agents and actors

538
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:23,602
to have a sense of how many sessions

539
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:24,723
you're going to need them for.

540
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:28,466
There's SAG rules and guidelines regarding vocal stress,

541
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,727
about a two hour maximum.

542
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:32,449
If you need more, break it up across sessions.

543
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,591
Mix it up with content that's not vocally stressful.

544
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,667
Save your most extreme stuff for the end,

545
00:28:37,687 --> 00:28:40,569
at the end of the session.

546
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:43,611
If you have us scream and die by fire

547
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:45,092
and electrocution at the beginning,

548
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:48,634
by the time you want us to do that really connected scene,

549
00:28:48,674 --> 00:28:49,655
we sound like frogs.

550
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:55,198
Listen to your actors and notice when they're breaking.

551
00:28:55,518 --> 00:28:56,879
Monitoring their vocal stress

552
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:59,340
and offering breaks and relief builds trust.

553
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:01,101
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

554
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:07,390
So one really great tactic is to map out the percentage of your game, or at least of that

555
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,572
session that will be vocally stressful, and give the actors a heads up.

556
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:15,853
Hey, you're going to have 30% of your work today is going to be combat oriented, 10%

557
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:22,315
is going to be the highest intensity and some death screams, 10% is going to be whispered

558
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:25,596
intensity, and then this other 10% is going to be efforts.

559
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:27,457
That lets us know how to plan.

560
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:29,619
And then partway through, you've got this amount left.

561
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:31,601
We've got this many more lines before break.

562
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:35,324
And what that does is it lets us plan, like again,

563
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:38,826
the way you would do in a marathon with mile breakers.

564
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:40,388
It lets you know where you are.

565
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:43,070
If you start out sprinting by mile 21,

566
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,171
you're going to face plant.

567
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:52,523
In the studio, hire a good director and follow their lead.

568
00:29:52,964 --> 00:29:54,366
Let them speak to the actor.

569
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:58,852
Give context when necessary, but just don't give line reads.

570
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:01,515
Give the subtext of the line as a shorthand.

571
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:06,157
But your actors don't tell you how to design the game,

572
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:08,178
don't tell them how to do their job either.

573
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:12,719
Try offering intention, relationship, emotional context,

574
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,240
and be willing to accept a read that's not the one that you're hearing in your head,

575
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,920
if it works for the moment.

576
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,061
Sometimes, they shout and you're like,

577
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:21,841
sorry this is more of a one-on-one conversation.

578
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:27,503
Also in the studio, be energetic.

579
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:31,160
If you can, we know you get tired, it's true,

580
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:35,763
but remember neural synchrony, that really cool brain science thing?

581
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:39,585
You don't want us to synchronize with your boredom and your exhaustion

582
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:40,926
because it's catching.

583
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:44,729
And also, even after all this time I've been doing this work,

584
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:48,471
if on the other side of the glass I see that you're like this

585
00:30:49,392 --> 00:30:53,014
and you're completely done, I think I've screwed up.

586
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:58,647
Even at this point in my career, I'm really lucky that I've been doing this a while, but

587
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:02,668
I'm really still hoping that you guys like what I'm doing.

588
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:05,589
And if I think you're disconnected, I disconnect.

589
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:07,050
I get in my head, did I do that right?

590
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,410
And then I start flubbing lines.

591
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,251
So your collaboration is part of affective resonance.

592
00:31:13,651 --> 00:31:15,712
If you're enthusiastic, I stay enthusiastic.

593
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:21,794
And if you can, tell your actors who they're playing opposite in scenes.

594
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:29,252
It's not required, you know, actors are professionals, but it really helps because they're a tight-knit

595
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:32,018
group and it can help the performance if they know who they're acting to.

596
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:36,936
So I had given Julie this little ghost child,

597
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:38,217
young girl ghost to play.

598
00:31:38,617 --> 00:31:41,057
She's half of a set of twins who were going to be voiced

599
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:42,338
by two different actors.

600
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:47,279
Here's the in-game models for those two twin ghost girls.

601
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:50,319
You know how twins can be super close and in sync.

602
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:51,680
Well, that day in the studio,

603
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,700
all I had to do was tell Julie that her twin

604
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,261
was being played by one of her best friends, Kari Wahlgren.

605
00:31:57,301 --> 00:31:59,722
And she knew exactly what to do.

606
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,001
I got so excited.

607
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,542
I know how Kari is going to handle it.

608
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:05,823
I know how I'm going to handle it.

609
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:08,484
Maybe I won't get every moment of her performance,

610
00:32:08,525 --> 00:32:11,026
but because I can see the lines before and after

611
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,807
and envision one of my best friends,

612
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:14,248
and I'm in a unicorn onesie there,

613
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:18,930
I can make it more real and more connected.

614
00:32:20,554 --> 00:32:23,635
So, yeah, if you outsource your VO.

615
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:24,895
Yeah, if you outsource.

616
00:32:25,475 --> 00:32:27,695
Put together an informational packet for your vendor.

617
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:29,216
You know, they've signed NDAs.

618
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:31,256
Put together scripts, reference materials,

619
00:32:31,336 --> 00:32:33,196
summary documents, casting sides

620
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:35,717
with vocal performance notes for creature process voices

621
00:32:35,777 --> 00:32:37,377
because they don't have that information.

622
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:38,357
It's in your head.

623
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,138
Give it to them so that they can do the job.

624
00:32:41,998 --> 00:32:42,918
What are our takeaways?

625
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,478
So we've learned a lot.

626
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:47,119
Here's our summary of what we've learned.

627
00:32:48,113 --> 00:32:49,576
Prep work is the key.

628
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:55,105
Putting in that extra effort before you even get to the studio raises the quality and saves you a lot of time.

629
00:32:55,846 --> 00:32:56,747
Everyone's an artist.

630
00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:59,512
We all want the game to sound great.

631
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:01,275
So, let's do this together.

632
00:33:02,825 --> 00:33:05,907
Give enough information, but you don't have to give too much

633
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:10,932
So last thing I want to leave you with a tool. Is Sarah Elmaleh in the room somewhere?

634
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:11,452
She is.

635
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:15,856
Oh there she is. This is a lovely woman. She's my friend. That's Sarah Elmaleh.

636
00:33:16,217 --> 00:33:20,120
For fun, you should also know that she's the player character in Anthem.

637
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:22,502
Voice actors like each other.

638
00:33:23,964 --> 00:33:24,424
So

639
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:28,708
so I've just joined a team that's called SWOT and

640
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:32,193
specialized workshops and actor tactics.

641
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:34,214
And you can write down the website address,

642
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:35,675
because you might want it.

643
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,359
This is a group that was begun by Sarah Elmaleh, Jennifer

644
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,060
Hale, and Cissy Jones.

645
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,203
And the idea is to create a free service.

646
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:50,764
And I will say that again.

647
00:33:50,784 --> 00:33:52,065
This is a free service.

648
00:33:53,526 --> 00:34:01,308
to help give developers the opportunity to collaborate with professional voice actors

649
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,709
while your material is still at the pre-casting stage.

650
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:12,451
So we offer two-hour sessions for table reads or even performance capture, virtually or

651
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:13,031
in person.

652
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:15,932
So even if you're out of the country, we can do this virtually.

653
00:34:16,832 --> 00:34:18,473
And we will help you workshop your game.

654
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:23,867
The idea here is to raise the level of content, community, and collaboration.

655
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:29,451
You can't record us while we're doing this, but you get union actors breathing a little

656
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:32,293
bit of life into your words before you're even casting.

657
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:37,717
And yes, if you need maybe just one more session for each project, you get another two-hour

658
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:38,017
session.

659
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:44,132
So I'm excited about this because it's sort of the embodiment of what we're talking about

660
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:47,332
today, the idea of wanting to collaborate together.

661
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:49,473
This group is ready to do that.

662
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:53,174
So if you have questions, Sarah is here.

663
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:55,574
I have some cards, some SWAT cards here.

664
00:34:55,614 --> 00:34:59,395
You're welcome to approach me afterwards, and we'll be happy to talk to you about it.

665
00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:00,475
And so will Sarah.

666
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:02,016
She's nodding and raising her hand.

667
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:03,256
Adorably, actually.

668
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:05,865
Thank you very much.

669
00:35:05,885 --> 00:35:09,550
And if you have more questions, we'll be happy to answer them.

670
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,735
Please make sure to review this talk at the survey link in your email.

671
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:16,020
Yes, and as all Uber drivers, just say, you know,

672
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,986
you really like the music that we played and that we didn't crash the car.
