1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,982
Okay, I think we can start.

2
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:08,984
So, thank you very much for coming over.

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:11,066
Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:13,308
It is our real honor to be here

5
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:18,353
and talking with you about music of The Witcher 3.

6
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:20,775
So, who are we?

7
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:23,446
We have very complicated names.

8
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:26,327
Yeah, so my name is Marcin PrzybyÅ‚owicz.

9
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,787
I'll try not to pronounce my name,

10
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:29,628
because that may be really difficult for you.

11
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:33,188
So let's just agree that I'm Marcin, not Marcin.

12
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:36,169
Marcin like marching, so that's easy to remember.

13
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,750
I'm music director and composer at CD Projekt RED.

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,912
I'm working on the Witcher series for over five years now.

15
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:49,413
Before that, I scored a number of mobile and indie games.

16
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:51,306
and this is Mikolaj.

17
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:53,728
Yes, I'm Mikolaj Strzelewski.

18
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:57,051
I go by Mik if it's easier, and if you have a problem

19
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:59,253
pronouncing my family name,

20
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:00,895
it basically sounds like strong whiskey.

21
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:05,659
So, yeah, I'm a freelance, as you see.

22
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,299
I have to read this.

23
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:14,461
I'm a freelance video game composer, and before The Witcher 3, I worked on the game that you

24
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:21,723
heard, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and I wrote a lot of TV before that, and the project

25
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:27,124
that was pivotal for me to move to video games was a trailer for Dark Souls 2.

26
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:36,188
So we want to show you our creative process behind composing and producing The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt soundtrack.

27
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:42,070
We want to analyze and show why it gained so much attention among critics and players,

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,031
and treat that as kind of post-mortem to our work.

29
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:55,275
And to tell you more about The Witcher, we would like to tell you more about where it

30
00:01:55,275 --> 00:02:00,359
came from, about the franchise lineage and how it all affected our work.

31
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,383
It all started with, yeah, with The Witcher book hero in...

32
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:17,035
The first story was written in 1988 by a very prolific Polish fantasy writer, Andrzej Sapkowski.

33
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:27,741
In 1988 he wrote a story, which was then followed by two short volumes of stories and then a couple more books.

34
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:34,323
Just to remind you, witchers are professional monster slayers,

35
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:38,431
witchers are mutants with superhuman abilities,

36
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:42,398
and the most important one, most famous one, is Geralt.

37
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:49,600
Now, after the books, people in Poland decided to film,

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,340
to make a movie about The Witcher,

39
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,621
and I hope you will never see it,

40
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:56,382
because it's a terrible one, disastrous, I've heard.

41
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:58,643
I chose not to see it, and you should do the same,

42
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:02,944
in order not to spoil the view you have on Geralt.

43
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:06,285
But I heard, Marcin, sorry?

44
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:11,181
Yeah, I have this privilege, I would say, to see this movie actually.

45
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:22,311
We bought the tickets for cinematic premiere one time and the saddest part of that story is that right before screening of the movie they showed us trailer to Lords of the Rings.

46
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:29,217
Fellowship of the Ring and so basically we did watch kick-ass three minutes long trailer of awesome stuff

47
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:33,321
And then we were presented with almost two hours long movie with Robert Dragons

48
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:36,043
So you can imagine how sad we were after that

49
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:40,047
Actually the subtitle of this of this movie was The Witcher and Robert Dragon

50
00:03:40,964 --> 00:03:44,428
So, after that, TV series, really?

51
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:50,474
I didn't know about TV series because I was already in America, but if it was one, then

52
00:03:50,474 --> 00:03:54,098
it just shows that Polish people don't give up.

53
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:57,621
They fight even if they know they'll die.

54
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:06,461
But luckily they fought and the Witcher, the first video game, came to the surface in 2007.

55
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:12,309
Then there was 2011, which I believe Marcin had already his musical contribution in.

56
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:13,711
Yes, exactly.

57
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,115
And finally, happy year of 2015.

58
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:21,030
where The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt came about,

59
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,831
which we are here to talk about.

60
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:29,733
Now, as you see, The Witcher has already been present

61
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,534
in film, TV, books, comics.

62
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:34,415
and video games.

63
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:40,859
And the fan base of Witcher had already certain expectations

64
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:43,661
about what the soundtracks should sound like.

65
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:45,922
And we had to meet them.

66
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:49,644
We had to choose whether we're going to go the easy route

67
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:52,626
with generic music, which could have been done.

68
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,646
But we chose not to.

69
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:56,768
We chose to go a challenging route to take risks.

70
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:57,488
And it paid off.

71
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:09,152
In our case was similar to this of Batman, Superman, or other heroes that already existed in other media.

72
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:15,355
And we needed to decide what we're going to do with the music because of that.

73
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:17,676
So what did we do?

74
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:20,597
We decided to redefine musical style for The Witcher 3.

75
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:27,860
The following points that you see in the picture all affected our soundtrack.

76
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:33,346
The Witcher universe is heavily grounded in Slavic folklore.

77
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:38,450
Yes, a lot of characters, a lot of stories and substories

78
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,272
present in the game are directly taken from legends,

79
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,474
from that region.

80
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:47,656
It's a fantasy game, so that's, which is naturally,

81
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:52,900
which is a genre directly connected

82
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,101
to specific kind of music as well.

83
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:03,791
Games main feature, the long engaging story with its sub-stories as well, that also had

84
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,413
to be reflected in our soundtrack.

85
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:12,958
Nothing is good or bad in the game as well, even if something evil happens, even if there's

86
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:19,422
an evil character, there always seems to be some sort of justification of his or her actions

87
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:22,704
and therefore everything is kept in a grey zone.

88
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:25,667
Again, another element that had to be kept in mind while doing the music.

89
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,451
There is a lot of choices and a lot of consequences

90
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:32,792
that players are exposed to.

91
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:36,512
And there is the element of non-linearity.

92
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:39,773
Sorry, difficult word for me.

93
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:43,974
Which is connected with the fact that it's an open world.

94
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,975
You know, players can go wherever they want.

95
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:52,836
But everything had to be done under the linear.

96
00:06:55,348 --> 00:07:00,612
music, under the umbrella of film-like music, which help tell the story.

97
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:03,174
We're going to continue on that later on.

98
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:07,296
And now Marcin will tell you more about the pre-production process.

99
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:13,380
Yeah, so once we know what we are up with, we are ready to actually start working on the game itself.

100
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,322
So first stage of production is obviously pre-production.

101
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:19,924
We had to figure out how to deal with issues and challenges that were ahead of us.

102
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:26,408
The most important thing was to do as much preparations as possible to basically save time,

103
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:29,430
and so production phase would be as easy as possible.

104
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:37,475
Obviously, not every time happens that a lot of planning translates to complete success

105
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:41,217
and something didn't work out quite good along the way.

106
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:42,718
We're going to address that issue also.

107
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:49,603
But basically all those sets of those words you can see here on the slide

108
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:55,587
basically can give you some impression of what we aimed for with planning our soundtrack.

109
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:59,609
So first of all we decided to mix Slavic folk with big contemporary sound.

110
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:07,651
Normally in fantasy games people expect big, broad orchestral sounds with choirs, percussion, strings, and so on.

111
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:13,972
Because the Witcher franchise is so heavily grounded in Slavic folklore, Slavic mythology,

112
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:19,494
that was kind of obvious for us we would have to also reflect that somehow in music.

113
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,574
So, Slavic folk.

114
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:27,395
Then, that was when we started working on Witcher 3, that was...

115
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:33,456
really important moment for us regarding technical stuff because we were just

116
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:39,958
finished with the Witcher 2. We decided to leave FMOD, Game Audio Middleware, to Wwise,

117
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,739
so that opened up quite new possibilities for us regarding how we would deal with game audio

118
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:51,580
systems and stuff like that. And that also goes to another thing that Miko already

119
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,901
talked about briefly. So our main

120
00:08:56,341 --> 00:09:03,523
focus on soundtrack was to make music feel like it was composed for every single player separately.

121
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:08,904
So we wanted to achieve that effect that when someone plays the game,

122
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:14,066
he or she can feel that music was, you know, tailored just for him.

123
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:22,732
One thing to, one way to achieve that was to make sure that music would feel like basically a film, like a long story.

124
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:24,533
So linear in non-linear environment.

125
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:32,339
We need to remember that we're not only dealing with a video game, but that particular one was a very complex one.

126
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,302
That was open world RPG with nonlinear story, which

127
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:38,223
was branching on multiple levels.

128
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:41,364
So music system had to also address those issues

129
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:44,526
and handle the music itself in a way

130
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:46,067
that basically that could be done.

131
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:49,729
Another thing is obviously budgets and costs

132
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:51,270
of live recordings.

133
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,233
We knew we had a very big game ahead of us to score.

134
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:59,595
And doing this with the live orchestra

135
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:01,496
would cost tons of money.

136
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:09,483
And we knew we wouldn't probably get as much budget as we wanted to, so we had to think how to be clever about that,

137
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:15,889
and how to basically do what we aimed for, but, you know, make it cost less, right?

138
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,412
So, if the game was big...

139
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:19,993
amount of music was big.

140
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:22,655
Another question pops in, how to not kill ourselves

141
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,236
with that big amount of music?

142
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:26,497
So again, we would have to come up

143
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:31,100
with some clever approach to composition process,

144
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,162
then implementation, production phase, and so on.

145
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:37,744
One of the ways we decided to do that

146
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:40,726
was to have a greater use of leitmotifs

147
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:42,327
compared to our previous games.

148
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:49,871
And the next slide briefly shows you how much of those thematic work we actually did throughout the whole game.

149
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:56,354
Obviously, we have our main theme along with two other themes that are from previous games.

150
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:57,714
These are our legacy themes.

151
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:00,017
And apart from that, you can see we

152
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:03,601
have a bunch of specially composed custom made themes

153
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:04,942
just for The Witcher 3.

154
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:07,565
Those themes obviously served as a bridge

155
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:11,589
and help the vast amounts of music sound cohesive,

156
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,734
because that was one of the exactly challenges

157
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:19,538
and one of the most important things we wanted to maintain.

158
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:24,268
So OK, we know what we're going to do.

159
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,109
Now we have to answer the question,

160
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:26,710
how are we going to do it?

161
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:33,494
Since we are about to do some Slavic folk music,

162
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:36,816
we need to think, OK, how are we going to approach that?

163
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:46,928
We had a really big database of folk music from Poland, Ukraine, Hungary, Germany, Slovakia, Russia, you name it.

164
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:53,555
At some point, it struck us, actually, that maybe we shouldn't just treat it as a point of reference.

165
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,236
Maybe we should...

166
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:59,099
you know, reach out for some bands, some performers maybe,

167
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:01,361
and get in touch with them.

168
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,562
Invite them to cooperation, not to work for us,

169
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:08,225
but work with us and try to work on something

170
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:12,088
completely new and original.

171
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:14,369
Our choice was the band Percival,

172
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:17,971
and I'm sure most of you are already familiar with them.

173
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,033
Of course, other great musicians as well.

174
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:23,335
We're going to introduce them later on.

175
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:24,075
And...

176
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:28,060
about those things that didn't work out very well.

177
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,907
I need to admit that the beginning of our work

178
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:36,135
was quite difficult because it turned out that.

179
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:41,395
We didn't get along, actually, at the very beginning.

180
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:42,296
Why is that?

181
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:46,860
I'm a trained musician, trained composer, just like MikoÅ‚aj.

182
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,864
And it so happened that we were about to deal with people

183
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:52,245
who are self-taught.

184
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,166
What does it mean?

185
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,729
That means they do not know how to read musical notation.

186
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:59,072
That means they taught themselves

187
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:00,333
how to play instruments.

188
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:08,149
their playing techniques would be much different than, for example, playing techniques I was learning when I was at musical academy.

189
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:17,458
That meant also that they quite didn't understand what I was talking to them because I was using musical terminology.

190
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,792
To be honest, the first day of the recording session,

191
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,174
we were basically wasting money, burning money,

192
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:27,916
because time flies.

193
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,858
Time is money, and we didn't get any stuff recorded.

194
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:32,298
We just struggled.

195
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:32,939
We tried.

196
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:36,381
We discussed.

197
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,663
And one thing I discovered, they weren't even

198
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:40,444
able to record to click track, which

199
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,245
is pretty standard procedure when

200
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:45,827
you go to a recording studio and you are about to do music.

201
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:47,849
So at some point, we realized we have

202
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:48,009
to.

203
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:51,989
figure out a way to basically communicate with each other,

204
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:53,871
to find some common ground,

205
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:56,194
some common line of communication,

206
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:57,636
and follow that line.

207
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:57,856
So...

208
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:07,047
At some point I decided to just ditch this whole stuff I prepared, and I was prepared very, very well.

209
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:14,150
I presented them sheet music, mocaps, spreadsheets with themes written down, broken down to tempos, time signatures, key signatures.

210
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:21,594
I was really, really well prepared, and believe me, I wasted so much time on that to basically not suck during the process.

211
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:29,053
That all went to trash, and we had to figure out what to do.

212
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:32,637
So we thought, OK, so maybe.

213
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,435
If we cannot communicate with each other on language level,

214
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:38,457
maybe we can communicate on musical level.

215
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:41,040
So instead of just doing recording sessions,

216
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,642
maybe we should organize a jam session.

217
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:44,344
Let's improvise a bit.

218
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:45,765
So pick that instrument.

219
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:46,586
Pick that instrument.

220
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,687
Just play me four chords.

221
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,150
Just play me some riff on top of that.

222
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,812
Maybe we could try improvising some vocals on it.

223
00:14:52,812 --> 00:14:54,794
And suddenly, magic happened.

224
00:14:56,948 --> 00:15:00,894
they started to play and they started to play with the way I wanted them to play.

225
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:07,844
They started to be happy about it. I started to be happy about it because, you know, we were progressing.

226
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:14,881
I could say the rest is history because we end up having the quickest material after

227
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:20,803
what 7 or 8 days of recordings and that was 12 hours a day so you know pretty long time

228
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:26,145
and then we were able to actually take away this material, go to our studio, edit it and

229
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:26,905
work on it.

230
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:38,190
Once you know that story, maybe we can now talk you through the process of selection of instruments we pick.

231
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:43,074
Since the core of our soundtrack will be on solo performances, we picked our instruments very carefully.

232
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:49,139
We looked for unique sound, obviously, but also what we cared about was the history behind each instrument,

233
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:55,705
because we believe that if you pour a lot of soul into the music, people will hear it and basically love it.

234
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,986
So, the first one.

235
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,913
So this is baglama, or called saz, if you like.

236
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:24,375
This is basically the same instruments.

237
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,436
This is our primary plucked instruments

238
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:29,619
for the whole musical palette of the Witcher 3 soundtrack.

239
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:33,642
And the fun fact is that's not even Slavic instruments.

240
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:36,224
The country of origin is Turkey.

241
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:39,186
And you're going to see that we have a lot more examples

242
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:40,107
of that later on.

243
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:45,551
Second one also, as I could say, a signature instrument

244
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:46,331
to the Witcher sound.

245
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:53,339
Thanks for watching!

246
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,771
That one's also not Slavic.

247
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:10,412
That comes from Eastern Mediterranean, so Greece

248
00:17:10,412 --> 00:17:11,532
and Turkey.

249
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:15,033
An interesting story behind it is

250
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,874
that Percival actually built that instrument themselves.

251
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:22,056
The design was based on original medieval iconography,

252
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:25,377
so they looked for proper wood, proper strings,

253
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,818
proper materials, and proper craftsmen, basically,

254
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:29,678
to make that instrument.

255
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:31,859
The next one is really interesting.

256
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:49,150
Thank you.

257
00:17:55,307 --> 00:18:04,450
This is Hardigurdy and this is, to spice up things a little bit, this is the most Slavic instruments you can get.

258
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,853
That instrument comes from Eastern Europe, its origins are in Poland, Hungary, Belarus and Ukraine.

259
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:18,336
That particular one is very very special because it was custom built for Robert Jaworski,

260
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:20,477
folk virtuoso from Poland.

261
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:24,218
Regular Hardigurdy has three strings, that one has seven.

262
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:33,044
Thanks to that, the instrument has much broader scale compared to regular ones and also the sound of the Kerdigordi.

263
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:38,688
That one particular is much more darker, grittier and probably you could say more devilish.

264
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:45,732
If I may say something, it's worth noting that the name Kerdigordi was invented by a Swedish cook from a Muppet show.

265
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:50,916
LAUGHTER

266
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:51,316
Next one.

267
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:58,025
Yeah, Renaissance Fiddle, so as you can hear...

268
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,565
You can hear it very well for a reason.

269
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:02,486
Yeah, the quality of this recording is very crappy.

270
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:07,528
When I took that clip, I didn't know I would be presenting my stuff on GDC,

271
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:11,630
so you have to forgive me that.

272
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,111
But basically, this is another custom-built instrument just for Robert.

273
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:22,674
It's based on original Renaissance design and the special thing about it is that it has a pickup like a guitar or a bass guitar.

274
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:33,039
So you can basically plug a cable into it, amplify it with the speakers, apply some guitar effects and achieve really, really crazy sound.

275
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,161
And how does it sound? Well, I have a short clip for you.

276
00:19:49,216 --> 00:19:49,396
Sorry.

277
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:56,238
Yeah.

278
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:59,779
Next one is also very special.

279
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:12,222
So basically, a piece of wood with a few strings attached to it with a big hole in it, and

280
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:13,482
you have another instrument.

281
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:21,721
It's a Bowet Gusli and the Polish name is GÄ™Å›le GdaÅ„skie, another very difficult word for you, so don't bother with that.

282
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:29,109
I'm just mentioning that because basically this is a replica built especially for Robert,

283
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:34,875
based on archaeological remains found in GdaÅ„sk, Poland, hence the name GÄ™Å›le GdaÅ„skie, in 1940s.

284
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,278
Original designs, experts say...

285
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:44,862
was from 12th century, so probably that's the only instrument from 12th century built

286
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:51,245
with the original design, so that's also very special thing for us that we were able to

287
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:54,386
you know incorporate that instrument into our palette.

288
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,467
Another ones?

289
00:20:56,104 --> 00:21:05,419
Yeah, so while Marcin recorded Percival in Warsaw, I took care of some recordings in Los Angeles and recorded some wonderful musicians.

290
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:10,447
One of them was Amir Yagmai. He's a multi-instrumentalist from Iran.

291
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:14,923
I should say, and he plays guitar, he plays violin,

292
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:20,164
he plays oud, he plays this wonderful instrument

293
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:23,765
which is called yali tambur.

294
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:28,087
It originates from Turkey and what it means

295
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,527
is basically it's Turkish guitar.

296
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:31,628
By adding yali in front of it,

297
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:34,048
it makes it Turkish bass guitar.

298
00:21:34,048 --> 00:21:36,209
It can be bowed, it can be plucked,

299
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:38,190
it has a bright sound.

300
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,131
and the semitones are on the frets,

301
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:45,654
and the frets are movable.

302
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:47,135
Yeah, it sounds really cool.

303
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:48,837
I'll show you in a minute.

304
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:50,538
Now, this particular one doesn't have

305
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:52,540
any amazing story behind it.

306
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,982
However, the next one,

307
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:56,264
being a combination of a violin and a zombie,

308
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:58,466
it looks great.

309
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:02,249
It sounds more or less the way it looks.

310
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:10,935
It originates from India, it made its way to Nepal and Iran.

311
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:16,098
And this particular one was found by Amir's grandfather

312
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:20,420
50 years ago in some forgotten village in the south of Iran.

313
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,403
And it served as a decoration on a tavern wall.

314
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:27,704
Back then it was 100 years old, so you know.

315
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:30,736
Now it's even older than that.

316
00:22:30,736 --> 00:22:34,097
Fun fact about it, that it's carved out of one piece of wood.

317
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:36,058
And as you see, it has two hollow chambers.

318
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:39,700
I'm going to show you the example of how

319
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,901
both of them sound.

320
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,542
There's a call and response coming.

321
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:45,724
The call comes from yali tambur being bowed.

322
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:47,105
I think it's a great sound.

323
00:22:47,105 --> 00:22:49,766
And the response is coming from gai chak.

324
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:52,307
Yeah, it's gai chak, gay chak.

325
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:52,588
I'm not sure.

326
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:56,169
There's probably a wrong way to pronounce it.

327
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:56,470
But yeah.

328
00:22:57,578 --> 00:23:06,380
Here it comes.

329
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,061
One more time?

330
00:23:09,061 --> 00:23:10,361
Yeah.

331
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:12,381
You sure?

332
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:13,222
Yeah.

333
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:15,062
Okay.

334
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,082
â™ª Do the L. â™ª

335
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:26,793
All right, so those are the two instruments.

336
00:23:26,793 --> 00:23:31,495
One more instrument that I want to tell you about is viola.

337
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:35,177
That's not any viola, because this one was made in 1610.

338
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:38,678
So actually, very close to when Gerald was alive.

339
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:43,000
It's McGuinea, which is the viola equivalent

340
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,481
of Stradivarius, and it was discovered

341
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:52,223
in a closet in Germany in bombed-down Dresden city,

342
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,124
and it was in pieces, torn.

343
00:23:54,284 --> 00:23:58,866
I'm not sure how the player, Andrew Duckles, got hold of it, but he did.

344
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:03,908
And he restored it in Los Angeles. It took a year, it took a whole year to restore it.

345
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:04,829
A lot of money as well.

346
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:09,631
A guy named Michael Fisher restored it.

347
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:14,773
He had to find exact kind of wood that was originally in the instrument.

348
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:16,914
So it turned out to be, you know, like a Frankenstein.

349
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:24,098
Viola, it's very large back in 17 back in 17th century people didn't play viola like this

350
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:26,660
They play it on lap like a like a cello

351
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,461
vertically

352
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:34,684
It was much bigger now Andrew duckles is a big guy, and he can play it like this. He's a virtuoso

353
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:40,708
So but and it sounds amazing. I don't have an example here, but it's in the soundtrack

354
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:45,631
So yeah, that's that's Andrews viola there are more instruments

355
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,293
One more time.

356
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:52,617
Okay, more instruments, as you see, that we will not have time to talk about.

357
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,839
They were all live, recorded.

358
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,961
Thank you for that.

359
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,302
And you ruined that.

360
00:24:58,302 --> 00:24:58,882
Yeah, this is to...

361
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:02,545
Okay, so to talk you briefly.

362
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:07,510
Bazooki, Lyra, vocals, violin, electric cello, acoustic cello.

363
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,051
And vocals, lots of them.

364
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,352
Yes, a lot of them.

365
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:17,976
So yeah, the stuff we recorded has influenced our approach to music composition and our implementation choices.

366
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:29,281
So one thing you need to be aware of if you are dealing with medieval or period instruments is that their natural tunings can basically set the tone for your work.

367
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:37,484
Most of our instruments were in D natural, so that was some clue for us what to do with them.

368
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:41,986
As you know already my story with Percival and recording sessions,

369
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:48,348
you already know that great amount of improvised performances happened along the way.

370
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:51,589
We did it a lot and because of that also partially we...

371
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,471
as you already also know, decided to focus our soundtrack

372
00:25:57,471 --> 00:26:00,212
on more of those solo performances

373
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:03,074
instead of standard palette.

374
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:05,955
So if you take those choices,

375
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:08,816
you also have to deal with consequences.

376
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:13,377
Yeah, and the consequences are, yes,

377
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:14,538
five hours of D minor.

378
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:19,521
After that, it was really challenging to me

379
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:22,305
to compose any other key, even C major.

380
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:24,709
Even C major was a challenge.

381
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:25,490
But D minor is nice.

382
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,293
It has a nice topography.

383
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:29,537
It has a nice sound.

384
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:29,637
So.

385
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:36,202
Yeah, so that's one consequence of those recorded instruments.

386
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:38,424
Another one is improvise staff transport

387
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:39,924
into great tavern queues.

388
00:26:39,924 --> 00:26:41,966
Now it's probably worth mentioning

389
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:45,027
that when Marcin was doing jam sessions with Percival,

390
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:48,950
I'm sure there was a lot of alcohol and cigarettes

391
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,490
involved.

392
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,392
But there are no photos to prove that, though.

393
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:53,693
But it's for a good reason.

394
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:55,153
It's for tavern queues.

395
00:26:55,153 --> 00:26:55,614
So you know.

396
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,735
I have my own click truck.

397
00:26:57,735 --> 00:27:00,256
So it worked.

398
00:27:01,096 --> 00:27:03,057
He had to edit it, so, you know.

399
00:27:03,057 --> 00:27:06,640
It's all to serve the art, right?

400
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,881
Yes, yes, yes.

401
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,490
worth the pain.

402
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,411
And yeah, those solo parts became

403
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:15,871
the core of the soundtrack.

404
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:18,052
And the songs.

405
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:20,253
Songs, Marcin will tell you more about them.

406
00:27:20,253 --> 00:27:21,993
It turned out that songs happened

407
00:27:21,993 --> 00:27:25,014
to be an important part of our soundtrack.

408
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:29,795
We had three brilliant vocalists from Percival,

409
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:32,836
and we used their talents a lot.

410
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:34,476
And I think the most

411
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:42,623
Bright and shiny example of how much love and care we took about songs is a Priscilla song case.

412
00:27:42,623 --> 00:27:46,506
If you played The Witcher, you already know that at some point of the game,

413
00:27:46,506 --> 00:27:51,750
Geralt is attending a pretty awkward concert for him,

414
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,574
because Priscilla is singing a song about his love to Yennefer.

415
00:27:57,562 --> 00:28:03,847
Interesting musical story behind it is that this song has been translated to all seven languages we did.

416
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:09,491
So Polish, English, German, Russian, French, Japanese, and Brazilian Portuguese.

417
00:28:09,491 --> 00:28:16,357
That was kind of a technical challenge for us to not only compose the beautiful song, beautiful ballad,

418
00:28:16,357 --> 00:28:20,260
but also to make it work in all those seven languages, to translate that song,

419
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,502
to, you know, fit the number of syllables within the phrase,

420
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,424
to sync it perfectly with the lute track.

421
00:28:25,964 --> 00:28:29,727
That took us some time to figure out how to do it.

422
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:34,131
And I think that's a good example to actually prove that

423
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:37,094
basically we care about songs very much.

424
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:37,254
Yes.

425
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:37,474
My turn.

426
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:46,302
So musical direction, don't focus on the game.

427
00:28:46,302 --> 00:28:47,783
Do you?

428
00:28:47,783 --> 00:28:48,303
Yes, good.

429
00:28:48,303 --> 00:28:48,824
OK, it works.

430
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:51,981
set of mechanics under player's disposal.

431
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,024
What this complicated sentence means

432
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:58,247
is that some other games have implementation

433
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:00,670
down to almost every step of the player.

434
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,352
This approach, however, might not serve best

435
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:05,134
in terms of telling the story

436
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:07,276
and the overall narration of the game.

437
00:29:10,773 --> 00:29:11,073
Well, yeah.

438
00:29:11,073 --> 00:29:14,375
So if you take the music away from any medium

439
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:18,697
that it accompanies, it has its own emotions.

440
00:29:18,697 --> 00:29:19,838
It has its own pacing.

441
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:25,200
And we really loved how the natural pacing of music

442
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,502
dances and intertwines with the pacing of the game,

443
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:31,704
how it kind of dictates it, rather than the other way

444
00:29:31,704 --> 00:29:32,324
around.

445
00:29:32,324 --> 00:29:35,286
And so, yes, we could have done the implementation.

446
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,507
in a more detailed way.

447
00:29:37,507 --> 00:29:42,891
There are games that have the audio implementation done

448
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:44,332
more technically.

449
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:48,075
However, we chose not to do that.

450
00:29:48,075 --> 00:29:51,218
We chose to let the music sing.

451
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:53,700
And that was a risk.

452
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,121
And I think it paid off well.

453
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:03,008
Like I said, the story and its pacing comes from music as well.

454
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,410
This approach also makes the music matter.

455
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:11,293
It gives its own voice and story to tell,

456
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:16,196
and it lets the emotions shine as well from the music,

457
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:18,498
not being interrupted by, you know, little...

458
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:23,174
little sync points that go to the sound engine.

459
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:26,837
And scoring with songs.

460
00:30:26,837 --> 00:30:29,478
Yes, songs is just everything.

461
00:30:29,478 --> 00:30:32,460
It's on top of everything.

462
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,703
This approach just makes the music even more important.

463
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:42,363
Yeah, as you probably know, we use a lot of songs throughout the whole game.

464
00:30:42,363 --> 00:30:47,349
And obviously, one might ask the question,

465
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:52,476
OK, but what about the correlation between songs and spoken dialogue, for example?

466
00:30:54,218 --> 00:31:02,427
We don't obviously want to draw the player's attention out of the dialogue because of, you know, some chick is saying some words with song, right?

467
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:09,434
So, we decided we would basically use songs in gameplay situations. What gameplay situations?

468
00:31:10,095 --> 00:31:16,938
It turned out, once we started to test our game at our headquarters with the music,

469
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:24,262
that slaying monsters and casting spells feels much more awesome when you have kicking rock riffs

470
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:27,904
and wailing vocals basically, you know, supporting you.

471
00:31:27,904 --> 00:31:35,308
You can actually feel like kick-ass monster slayers, so that was really a no-brainer for us

472
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:39,130
to decide that, okay, so our combat encounters...

473
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,212
would be scored with songs.

474
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:46,457
And no matter if the song would be sung in Polish, Ukrainian, Hungarian,

475
00:31:46,457 --> 00:31:48,459
because we have all of those, really.

476
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:49,640
But that doesn't matter.

477
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,884
It's all about emotions and the way the song makes you feel about yourself

478
00:31:53,884 --> 00:31:57,929
and feel you as Geralt, a monster slayer.

479
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:01,492
So that's why I think our songs shine.

480
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:03,454
in the soundtracks, shining in the game,

481
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,576
and are one of the ways we are actually

482
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:10,259
pushing the music towards the front of a player.

483
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:14,702
To summarize that part of the presentation,

484
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:16,503
we have a short video clip for you,

485
00:32:16,503 --> 00:32:20,486
which I hope presents all of those thoughts

486
00:32:20,486 --> 00:32:21,967
we presented for you.

487
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:23,228
So take a look and hear.

488
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:39,392
We knew someone special was to arrive.

489
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:42,634
We read beast entrails, saw the omens.

490
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:46,096
We would glimpse her likeness.

491
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:47,697
A mirage in a puddle.

492
00:32:47,697 --> 00:32:49,838
She came from the lower swamp.

493
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:54,761
We knew not at first it was her the omens had spoken of.

494
00:32:56,628 --> 00:33:05,731
A child of the Elder Blood, the sown seed that will burst into flame.

495
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:07,672
She's there, to our hands.

496
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:11,594
Elder Blood!

497
00:33:11,594 --> 00:33:23,318
Mmm, the blood of the treacherous!

498
00:33:42,006 --> 00:33:45,849
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

499
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:45,909
Yes.

500
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:49,031
Not the kind of briar you would see on Fox TV.

501
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:53,794
OK, so we're going to tell you a few words about implementation.

502
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:54,675
So how-

503
00:33:55,673 --> 00:34:03,541
did we make it all work. You already know we decided to pick Wwise, Game Audio Middleware,

504
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:10,267
to handle all the audio music stuff and within Wwise we decided to build our own adaptive music

505
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:15,813
system. The goal was simple, we wanted to have responsible fast adaptive music system that would

506
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,474
would work in non-linear quest structures.

507
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:22,116
Obviously, we use layers, parameters, and states,

508
00:34:22,116 --> 00:34:24,117
but I guess that's obvious for all of you.

509
00:34:24,117 --> 00:34:26,858
Here, the important thing regarding our system

510
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:30,180
is that it's based on two pillars.

511
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,442
First one is location-based exploration and combat music.

512
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:38,324
So whenever Geralt is visiting some place, the Novigrad,

513
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:42,426
some forest, swamps, whatever, that particular location

514
00:34:42,426 --> 00:34:43,147
has its own.

515
00:34:45,714 --> 00:34:46,655
Is that okay?

516
00:34:46,655 --> 00:34:49,136
Yeah, I thought I finished for a second.

517
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:54,958
A set of exploration music and paired combat pieces with that.

518
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:57,279
Second pillar, also important,

519
00:34:57,279 --> 00:35:00,881
is all the tailored music we did for quests.

520
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:04,543
So that means all the cutscenes music, dialogue,

521
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:07,064
quest-specific segments,

522
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,545
or some custom gameplay situations,

523
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:11,986
like, for example, when we have to chase someone

524
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:13,567
or stuff like that.

525
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:14,247
One of the aim...

526
00:35:14,747 --> 00:35:21,430
that Mikolaj already briefly talked about when we designed our music system was not to sacrifice

527
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:27,513
music artistic value and essence to perfect implementation solutions

528
00:35:27,513 --> 00:35:30,975
we decided to

529
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:31,975
at first be

530
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:33,836
at first try to

531
00:35:33,836 --> 00:35:34,516
How do I say that?

532
00:35:35,557 --> 00:35:43,920
think about narration of music and what kind of story music has to tell itself rather than just

533
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,783
you know thinking about it as a set of assets and just divide it mathematically.

534
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:53,589
This is one of the examples of one of the locations

535
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:55,211
in Prologue by Torchart.

536
00:35:55,211 --> 00:36:00,716
And each of those green blocks represents one queue.

537
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:03,318
These are standard exploration and combat queues here,

538
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:07,783
as well as that tailored music I mentioned for quest events

539
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:08,323
and cut scenes.

540
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:11,946
And this is how they work together.

541
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:16,911
So even though we did try to.

542
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:26,100
maintain this artistic beauty of music and have the music its own voice, we try to do as

543
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:33,843
sophisticated system as possible and that little spider web is showing you how basically that

544
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:39,825
translates to technical side. Don't be confused about the visuals, this is F-mod and I just use

545
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:44,447
that to sketching because I like sketching in F-mod but we are still on Wwise, okay?

546
00:36:46,111 --> 00:36:51,157
So to summarize briefly what we just told you.

547
00:36:51,157 --> 00:36:52,980
Yes.

548
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,923
So how did our music turn out exactly?

549
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,706
Well, players seem to like it a lot.

550
00:36:57,706 --> 00:36:58,186
But why?

551
00:36:58,186 --> 00:37:02,392
One of the reasons, we believe, is pitch tuning imperfections.

552
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:07,642
As you heard in examples that we showed you,

553
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,823
a lot of music was quite out of tune.

554
00:37:10,823 --> 00:37:14,984
For this particular project, it worked out very well.

555
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:17,325
But in general, imperfections are

556
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:22,987
what make music beautiful.

557
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:27,729
You can try to make the sound perfect down to the beat,

558
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:33,170
but we believe it would happen at a certain cost.

559
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:37,372
Very important sentence today is the second one.

560
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:38,612
Don't be afraid to experiment.

561
00:37:38,612 --> 00:37:40,272
Go wild with ideas.

562
00:37:40,272 --> 00:37:44,854
And this is what we want you to take away from this lecture

563
00:37:44,854 --> 00:37:45,574
today.

564
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:48,375
We chose to go wild.

565
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:52,236
We chose to risk, and the risk paid back.

566
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:56,657
And vocals, as Marcin said, are very important.

567
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:59,157
Push the music towards the foreground.

568
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:01,578
And our formula is to.

569
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:13,350
It's a generally good formula to take something that people are accustomed to and on top of that introduce something that they don't expect.

570
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,533
That's good on every level, we think.

571
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:20,986
Yeah, a couple of closing thoughts for you.

572
00:38:20,986 --> 00:38:27,533
We have read numerous amounts of reviews for our game,

573
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:32,197
and almost everyone highlighted music

574
00:38:32,197 --> 00:38:33,818
as a strong part of the game.

575
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:35,240
That means a lot to us.

576
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,583
We read a lot of those, so that, I think,

577
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,686
also represents that.

578
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:44,915
correlation between pouring your soul into a project and

579
00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:51,037
You know having the love back from the players as we described before

580
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:59,321
The Witcher 3 soundtrack has spawned lots of fan covers including YouTube celebrities like Maluk Ahor or Taylor Davis

581
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:05,423
I think that's another example of how our music turned out to be and how likable it turned out to be

582
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:12,388
We would like to encourage you, if there are composers out there in the room,

583
00:39:12,388 --> 00:39:17,972
to do not be afraid of experiment and sometimes take controversial decisions,

584
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:25,257
because in the end, if you are really dedicated to your work and you love what you are doing,

585
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:29,761
that can really pay off and basically you can receive lots of love from people.

586
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:35,703
I know that the second to last sentence about staying true to yourself and loving your world

587
00:39:35,703 --> 00:39:42,706
is the most clichÃ© thing you will probably hear today, but it kind of summarizes our

588
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:49,168
journey through the Witcher soundtrack and basically tells everything you need to know

589
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:50,869
about our work.

590
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:56,671
And last but not least, don't be afraid of vocals, because I personally believe that

591
00:39:57,052 --> 00:40:02,455
Today, nowadays, in video games, music, we could use vocals a lot more.

592
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:05,797
Let me just add to this clichÃ© sentence that Marcin had.

593
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:07,698
When you work on a project for a long time,

594
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:12,441
you know, after a couple of weeks, it's easy to stop, to really stop loving it.

595
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:16,083
But the longer you maintain this loving attitude to your art,

596
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:19,865
to your, you know, musical childhood, the better it will turn out.

597
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:21,066
For everybody.

598
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:22,086
That's it, people.

599
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,287
That's it. Thank you.

600
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:39,131
Are there any questions?

601
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:40,073
Microphone.

602
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:43,077
Or shout very loudly.

603
00:40:44,072 --> 00:40:45,512
Hi there, my name is Isabella Nessa.

604
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:46,973
I'm a composer and a sound designer.

605
00:40:46,973 --> 00:40:49,935
And I have one quick question about your theming,

606
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:53,356
specifically with Song of the Sword Dancer and the Vagabond.

607
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:56,438
The melodic theme is the same in those,

608
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:58,119
but the rhythm is very different.

609
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,540
And did you pay very careful attention

610
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,082
to how you made it out the rhythmic displacement?

611
00:41:04,082 --> 00:41:06,323
And did you have any ideas about how

612
00:41:06,323 --> 00:41:08,784
you wanted that to affect the player experience?

613
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:10,845
Vagabond and second?

614
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:11,866
Song of the Sword Dancer.

615
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,867
Uh, okay. Oh, wow.

616
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:16,187
Oh.

617
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:19,189
Okay, I haven't expected that.

618
00:41:19,189 --> 00:41:20,090
Yes, is the answer.

619
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,612
Yes, we had to experiment with rhythm a lot

620
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:24,133
because we were in the same key.

621
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,414
That's one reason.

622
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:29,197
You picked very different pieces

623
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:32,740
because the Vagabond is an exploration piece

624
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,143
and the song of the sword dancer is a shining example

625
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:38,544
of wailing vocals during combat, right?

626
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:45,202
God damn it, I don't even know how to respond to your question, really.

627
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,445
I'm confused.

628
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:57,414
They have the same melody, the theme is exactly the same between them.

629
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:00,297
Yes, that's because we tried to recycle the material.

630
00:42:00,297 --> 00:42:02,039
That doesn't sound good.

631
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,480
It was very effective.

632
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:07,777
There was this slide about thematic work.

633
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:10,759
So that was important for us to basically use themes

634
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:13,781
as some sort of glue with the whole soundtrack

635
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,344
because of the distribution of regions

636
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:20,607
and musical influences we have among those.

637
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:24,306
So that was pretty obvious for us.

638
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:28,910
We had to, or we wanted to, use some pre-existing themes

639
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,773
or themes we composed throughout the whole game.

640
00:42:31,773 --> 00:42:33,795
But regarding arrangement and rhythms,

641
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:38,099
I don't think there's that much of a theory

642
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,620
or ideology behind it.

643
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,443
I think it just happened by itself

644
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:44,785
during the process of composition,

645
00:42:44,785 --> 00:42:47,327
and yeah, basically that's it.

646
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:47,828
Thank you.

647
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:56,252
Hi, you talked about how you tried to look into the history of each instrument in

648
00:42:56,252 --> 00:43:00,415
order to work with it and create this sort of Slavic experience, but then you

649
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:04,977
described how all these instruments come from Italy and Greece and Turkey and Iran.

650
00:43:04,977 --> 00:43:10,741
Were you surprised by how multicultural your instrumentation that you

651
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:12,282
use as kind of the core of this was?

652
00:43:12,282 --> 00:43:17,846
Uh, but also the Slavic part came from the performances as well.

653
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:18,206
Yeah.

654
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,432
Yeah, it's also not only...

655
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:24,235
The instrument is obviously the important part of the process,

656
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:29,179
but if you just strip it out of the awesomeness,

657
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:30,620
it's just a tool, right?

658
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,282
Just the object you are using to create music.

659
00:43:33,282 --> 00:43:37,406
So it's all about the way you use that instrument.

660
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,127
So when you, for example,

661
00:43:39,127 --> 00:43:43,110
listen to traditional Turkish performances of kemenÃ§e,

662
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:45,332
so that little fiddle thing, right?

663
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:47,694
The kasha played, the red-haired girl.

664
00:43:48,174 --> 00:43:56,758
It sounds very different compared to what we did with Kemenche in our soundtracks.

665
00:43:56,758 --> 00:44:04,542
So it's how you use it, what kind of sound you produce out of that instrument, what kind of scales you use, for example.

666
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:07,424
So that, I think, also...

667
00:44:14,507 --> 00:44:28,172
with our influences. Influences the way the music sounds in the end.

668
00:44:28,172 --> 00:44:31,474
Okay, thank you.

669
00:44:35,557 --> 00:44:37,518
that are all associated with that.

670
00:44:37,518 --> 00:44:41,702
My question regards, when you're working with musicians,

671
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:42,842
like as you were saying, that come

672
00:44:42,842 --> 00:44:44,023
from very different backgrounds.

673
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:47,566
They come from a sort of a self-taught or a by-ear route.

674
00:44:47,566 --> 00:44:48,887
And you're trying to work with them.

675
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,189
You're working to develop certain types of motivic

676
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,650
material that you can then use.

677
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,973
You're coordinating with musicians in Poland,

678
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:58,775
musicians in Los Angeles, all of which

679
00:44:58,775 --> 00:45:02,218
are kind of working in different spheres, I guess.

680
00:45:02,218 --> 00:45:04,500
Like, how do you bring that all together?

681
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,801
for the final product, or did you find it,

682
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:09,442
or what kinds of difficulties did you find

683
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:10,562
as you were doing that?

684
00:45:10,562 --> 00:45:12,963
Did we find difficulties?

685
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:14,464
Well, you did at the beginning, I didn't.

686
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:19,666
It was, you know, partially the improvisation

687
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:21,827
that was done on both continents,

688
00:45:21,827 --> 00:45:26,088
and partially it was, you know, playing the themes

689
00:45:26,088 --> 00:45:28,729
that were pre-composed already.

690
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,150
I don't know, Marcin, by the way,

691
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,251
how you made these guys from Percival

692
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:33,771
to play the themes if they didn't.

693
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:34,311
Did you sing?

694
00:45:34,962 --> 00:45:37,005
La, la, la, la.

695
00:45:37,005 --> 00:45:40,892
I was actually trained in singing.

696
00:45:40,892 --> 00:45:42,054
So just don't ask me to sing.

697
00:45:42,054 --> 00:45:42,215
OK.

698
00:45:42,215 --> 00:45:43,156
No, I'm not.

699
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:46,342
And then we swap files.

700
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:49,803
And that's what made it cohesive.

701
00:45:49,803 --> 00:45:54,165
Yeah, the bottom line was that with all those recording

702
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:58,006
sessions in LA, in Poland, the plan

703
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:03,068
was to build our own musical library we would use

704
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:06,029
to build our soundtrack around it.

705
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,231
So we ended up with hours of recordings.

706
00:46:09,231 --> 00:46:10,971
We edited it up.

707
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:12,692
We chopped to, you know.

708
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:17,159
lakes, musical sequences, riffs, loops, drum patterns,

709
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:19,222
because we also did record chants,

710
00:46:19,222 --> 00:46:23,569
but we forgot about it when we did presentation.

711
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:23,650
So.

712
00:46:24,936 --> 00:46:29,039
Think about it as your new sample library you buy,

713
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:29,880
for example.

714
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,025
So that was our base set of sounds

715
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,806
we wanted to use in that project.

716
00:46:36,806 --> 00:46:40,149
And whenever we felt that, for example, oh, that's

717
00:46:40,149 --> 00:46:43,652
Bagrama part or that Yalitambur Lake or reef

718
00:46:43,652 --> 00:46:47,055
would feel useful in that piece, we just used that.

719
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:51,779
So it was all about having additional firearms

720
00:46:51,779 --> 00:46:53,240
under our sleeves, basically.

721
00:46:54,154 --> 00:46:54,994
Cool, thanks.

722
00:46:54,994 --> 00:46:55,314
Hey, guys.

723
00:46:55,314 --> 00:46:57,875
Great talk and also amazing music in the game.

724
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:01,777
Thank you very much for giving me hours of enjoyment.

725
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,618
I have two quick questions.

726
00:47:04,618 --> 00:47:07,939
And the first one is, what kind of direction

727
00:47:07,939 --> 00:47:12,240
did you give the musicians to get the best results in terms

728
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,481
of, did you say this is a battle scene,

729
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:16,222
just be angry with your instruments?

730
00:47:16,222 --> 00:47:17,342
What kinds of direction?

731
00:47:17,342 --> 00:47:20,483
Or this is a romantic scene or this is a romantic piece.

732
00:47:20,483 --> 00:47:22,424
What kind of direction did you give the musicians?

733
00:47:23,176 --> 00:47:38,071
Well, I believe that, and I also work with my supervisors in the same way, that if you are well briefed, you're going to deliver the best possible work.

734
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:46,420
So my responsibility as music director was to brief them as much as possible and to provide them all the necessary information they had.

735
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:50,101
When we did recording session, we had already working game.

736
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:53,963
So we were able to present them some gameplay videos,

737
00:47:53,963 --> 00:47:57,204
some concept art, renders, game art,

738
00:47:57,204 --> 00:48:01,426
and also tons of scripts, spoken dialogue lines.

739
00:48:01,426 --> 00:48:05,587
And just my imagination working with, for example,

740
00:48:05,587 --> 00:48:08,648
saying them, OK, now we're going to play tavern piece.

741
00:48:08,648 --> 00:48:11,530
So imagine that we're in this wooden medieval tavern.

742
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,890
There are lots of dwarves.

743
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,071
So you know the dwarves.

744
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:17,252
kicking each other's asses, for example.

745
00:48:17,252 --> 00:48:21,213
There is some bum in the corner, drunk and sleeping.

746
00:48:21,213 --> 00:48:27,175
There's some courtesan or prostitute, for example,

747
00:48:27,175 --> 00:48:28,495
looking for customers.

748
00:48:28,495 --> 00:48:31,316
So imagine that thing.

749
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:34,877
And we need to come up with some musical mood for that.

750
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:37,058
Also, you can put the players into certain moods

751
00:48:37,058 --> 00:48:39,639
by telling them how to feel.

752
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:42,399
Like, you've got to make this more angry, feel more anger.

753
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:43,100
You cannot really.

754
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:51,983
put this on paper, you know, you describe a certain situation like, I'm sorry to say it, but maybe, you know, imagine like someone died in your family, you know.

755
00:48:51,983 --> 00:48:58,305
So it's horrible, but this evokes extreme emotions, you know, which you want to catch.

756
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:02,547
One more thing that also worked in my case, that...

757
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:09,705
surroundings. So if you are in the studio environment, you have very limited options of adjusting your space, but

758
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:10,526
even

759
00:49:10,526 --> 00:49:13,909
small things like for example

760
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,972
toning down the light can do wonders with

761
00:49:16,972 --> 00:49:22,657
you know, adjusting them, toning them into right emotional mood you want to achieve. So

762
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:23,498
that can also work.

763
00:49:24,176 --> 00:49:26,939
Wonderful and great job on that and getting the emotion out.

764
00:49:26,939 --> 00:49:31,624
The second question is in the WISE implementation of your adaptive music system,

765
00:49:31,624 --> 00:49:34,407
how long did that take and how many people did you have working on it?

766
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:42,921
It took us, I guess, half a year to finally figure out what do we want and what do we

767
00:49:42,921 --> 00:49:45,042
need for The Witcher 3.

768
00:49:45,042 --> 00:49:52,988
And regarding manpower, we did prototype the system with two guys, so audio programmer

769
00:49:52,988 --> 00:49:55,110
and senior quest designer, my friend.

770
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:58,072
But all the implementation was done by me.

771
00:49:58,072 --> 00:49:59,233
So just one man army.

772
00:49:59,233 --> 00:49:59,313
Wow.

773
00:49:59,313 --> 00:50:01,015
Good job.

774
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:01,996
Thank you very much.

775
00:50:01,996 --> 00:50:02,276
Thanks.

776
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:05,897
Hello, thank you very much for the talk.

777
00:50:05,897 --> 00:50:07,598
I had two quick questions as well.

778
00:50:07,598 --> 00:50:09,158
The first one is about percussion,

779
00:50:09,158 --> 00:50:12,539
because you talked a lot about your melodic instruments

780
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:14,239
and voices, but what about percussion?

781
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:15,999
Did you record them as well?

782
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:21,720
Did you record performances, or maybe more individual strokes,

783
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,760
and then put them in a contact instrument?

784
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,241
And how did you handle the fact that probably

785
00:50:26,241 --> 00:50:29,862
some performances weren't really like very, very

786
00:50:29,862 --> 00:50:31,542
regular in terms of tempo?

787
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:32,502
Percussion?

788
00:50:32,502 --> 00:50:33,702
Yeah, for percussion.

789
00:50:35,314 --> 00:50:38,095
Well, two ways, I guess.

790
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:42,317
When Percival was recorded, they were recorded in cues,

791
00:50:42,317 --> 00:50:46,419
you know, like songs, so there was already

792
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:49,640
like a natural accompaniment from some sort of a drum

793
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,623
to the song, so both files would naturally go well together.

794
00:50:54,623 --> 00:50:58,585
However, the majority of sounds would come from samples, I'm afraid.

795
00:50:58,969 --> 00:50:59,289
OK.

796
00:50:59,289 --> 00:50:59,489
Yeah.

797
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:03,670
Yeah, for that amount of music, you want to have flexibility,

798
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:07,071
which we didn't get from those recordings, I guess,

799
00:51:07,071 --> 00:51:08,412
in terms of percussion instruments.

800
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:11,112
That's why they didn't brag about them, by the way.

801
00:51:11,112 --> 00:51:11,312
Yeah.

802
00:51:11,312 --> 00:51:13,573
And so that leads to my second question,

803
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:16,474
is that how did you manage to handle well

804
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:20,095
the mixing between all these recordings, which

805
00:51:20,095 --> 00:51:23,536
have lots of imperfections, I would say,

806
00:51:23,536 --> 00:51:27,196
and that's what makes them so great with more?

807
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:34,304
super produced elements that we usually use in our DAWs with virtual instruments.

808
00:51:34,304 --> 00:51:40,231
So how did you manage to really mix that and come out with a successful music?

809
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:46,552
I think that begins with the very first stage.

810
00:51:46,552 --> 00:51:52,153
So setting up the right microphones and picking up the right recording studio.

811
00:51:52,153 --> 00:51:57,554
I was fortunate enough to have a brilliant recording engineer as my friend.

812
00:51:57,554 --> 00:52:02,175
So the moment I knew I'm going to have several days recording session,

813
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:07,456
I just phoned him, asked if he's available.

814
00:52:07,456 --> 00:52:08,396
Fortunately, he was.

815
00:52:10,854 --> 00:52:17,323
I need to admit that he basically did most of the hard work, so proper microphone setup

816
00:52:17,323 --> 00:52:25,376
was the very important process because I didn't even know their instruments.

817
00:52:26,137 --> 00:52:30,699
could sound in their raw, unedited form that good.

818
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:33,060
So later on, when we took those recordings,

819
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:36,342
we had a very good source material we could work on.

820
00:52:36,342 --> 00:52:38,783
So that was obviously much, much easier for us

821
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,425
to apply all those effects, compressors,

822
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:45,627
and all the stuff we are using during the process of mixing

823
00:52:45,627 --> 00:52:46,388
and producing music.

824
00:52:46,388 --> 00:52:51,510
The stuff was also mastered in Los Angeles, which helped.

825
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,232
Thank you very much.

826
00:52:54,232 --> 00:52:54,872
Sure.

827
00:52:57,892 --> 00:52:59,252
Hi, really quickly.

828
00:52:59,252 --> 00:53:02,893
I remember you guys mentioned that the initial onset

829
00:53:02,893 --> 00:53:06,154
of your success in this was allowing the musicians

830
00:53:06,154 --> 00:53:08,395
to kind of have a jam session instead of going strictly

831
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:09,555
off of what you wrote.

832
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:13,956
I imagine that might create some mess

833
00:53:13,956 --> 00:53:16,117
with intellectual property.

834
00:53:16,117 --> 00:53:19,378
Is that something you guys had to deal with?

835
00:53:19,378 --> 00:53:20,638
Or how did you deal with it?

836
00:53:20,638 --> 00:53:23,299
Well, they sold it all to CD Projekt.

837
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:23,759
There you go.

838
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:23,839
Cool.

839
00:53:26,484 --> 00:53:27,246
Okay, I guess that's it.

840
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,609
Thank you very much for listening.

841
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:29,491
Thank you very much.

842
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:29,691
Thank you.
