1
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:17,419
Hello and welcome to my talk. Great level design is a studio-wide effort. My name is

2
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:23,625
Dana Nightingale. I was born in the US, in the United States, and very shortly after

3
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:26,387
that began gaming on an Atari 800.

4
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:33,700
In the 90s, I absolutely fell in love with games like System Shock and Thief, which awakened my

5
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:43,047
passion for game design. I contributed to immersive sim fan sites for years. Excuse me, I've been

6
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:49,791
practicing so many times today, my whole mouth is messed up. I earned a master's degree in

7
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:55,375
architecture in 2008. Two years later, I joined Arkane as a level designer in Austin.

8
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,420
I moved to France five months later, where I remain to this day.

9
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,462
Finally, I became the campaign designer of Deathloop in 2020.

10
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,684
But what's my game dev experience?

11
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:18,128
As a modder, I worked on a bunch of missions for Thief 2, The Metal Age, and a few quest and location mods for Skyrim.

12
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:24,371
As a level designer, I worked on Dishonored's flooded district, The Loyalists, and Eminent Domain.

13
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:29,817
I worked on the Clockwork Mansion of Dishonored 2 and Death of the Outsiders Pink Job.

14
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:36,759
I did some map layouts for Wolfenstein Youngblood, and finally, I worked on a part of Deathloop's

15
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:40,641
prototype, Alexis Dorsey's Mansion, which is featured in the trailers.

16
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:46,863
As a campaign designer, I am currently working on Deathloop's infamous murder puzzle.

17
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:52,405
That said, I've had a very focused career, working almost exclusively in level design.

18
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,566
I've only worked at one studio. Two if you count Arcane Austin, which you should, so

19
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:04,932
two studios. This presents a challenge. I do not have the broadest experience.

20
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:13,503
So I've researched. I've interviewed people from other disciplines with more diverse backgrounds.

21
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:18,304
Before I get started, I'd like to explain who this talk is for

22
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:20,246
and the presentation's goals.

23
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:23,388
It's for people who love great level design,

24
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:25,049
even if they're not level designers.

25
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,332
And it's for teams making games which have levels in them.

26
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:30,133
It's also for my friends.

27
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:34,316
I'm going to discuss the role many disciplines have

28
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,557
in making great levels.

29
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,540
I'll explain how Arcane Lyon does it,

30
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,682
or the lofty goals we try to reach and ways

31
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:42,723
we could be doing it better.

32
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:48,030
but I also want to put a spotlight on everyone who's helped me make levels,

33
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,952
places that players enjoy and talk about.

34
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:55,756
All of that while trying to go as in-depth as I can in 60 minutes.

35
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,719
I should define what I mean when I say a level,

36
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:04,682
what a level designer at Arcane Lyon does and what I feel makes a

37
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:07,884
level great. Yes.

38
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:14,312
When I say a level, I mean one of many segments that the game is divided into,

39
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:18,556
or a location in the game world, or a moment in the player's journey.

40
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:24,221
At Arcane Léon, a level designer is defining the layout and flow of the map,

41
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:28,444
crafting encounters and vignettes with all of the scripted logic that powers them,

42
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:32,248
but most importantly, are part of the creative process.

43
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:34,930
Level designers have authorship of their maps.

44
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:41,783
From my perspective, a great level brings the most out of the game's narrative and systems.

45
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:46,408
It captures the imaginations and desire to engage with the content.

46
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:52,113
It feels like a place or a moment that matters either to the game itself or to the player.

47
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:57,518
And in those truly great cases, it's something that stays with them after they finish the

48
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:57,798
game.

49
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,420
They remember and talk about it.

50
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:04,669
Arcane, as a whole, has a bit of a reputation

51
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,172
for our level design, which a few people think

52
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:09,013
is pretty good.

53
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:11,976
I happen to be a big fan, too.

54
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:15,679
I'm extremely proud to be a part of this team

55
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,041
and admire their work to bits.

56
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:26,169
So what's the plan?

57
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:34,103
Okay, it's not this.

58
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:37,405
The talk is divided into two parts,

59
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:39,506
your team and processes.

60
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,828
In each part, we'll look at four challenges

61
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:45,170
you're going to face and look at solutions to each one.

62
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,251
Part one is your team.

63
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:50,754
The first challenge is an evolving level design team.

64
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:54,476
Undishonored, we begin with four level designers

65
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:57,718
who had been working with us since Dark Messiah

66
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:01,320
and also Unravenholm, LMNO and The Crossing.

67
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,563
with eight new level designers, mostly joining from Arcane Austin.

68
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:06,964
This is where I started.

69
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:08,986
I was here.

70
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:14,129
In Dishonored, we brought in six new level designers to Arcane Léon

71
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,412
because Arcane Austin's LD team began to work on Prey.

72
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:21,034
Death of the Outsider saw three new level designers join,

73
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:22,876
and Deathloop added five more.

74
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:28,107
Over this decade, many team members became leads or specialists.

75
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:31,689
Some changed to other disciplines while others moved to other studios.

76
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:35,071
We had an influx constantly of new talent.

77
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:39,133
But how do you keep your work consistent if your team keeps changing?

78
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:43,775
It comes down to a clearly defined studio culture,

79
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:46,876
and that's not something that you can just conjure up.

80
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,936
The ideal is to build a level design team with a foundation and certain design values.

81
00:05:53,457 --> 00:05:58,883
Above all, we are a studio that makes a certain type of game, and we recruit along those values.

82
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:01,767
Level designers come here to work on that type of game.

83
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:07,734
Good level design can't just be a value for the LD team. It must extend to the entire studio.

84
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:10,463
And almost everything in our games

85
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:12,604
is expressed through the level design.

86
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,965
The whole studio considers level design

87
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,045
as one of the most powerful tools

88
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:19,486
to deliver the experience that we are all after.

89
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:23,828
At Arkane, we never shut up about our design values.

90
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:25,649
We talk about them constantly.

91
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:27,470
We have posters about them.

92
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:32,212
I'm sure people are sick of having one brought up

93
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:35,573
as an argument in meetings, but everyone knows them

94
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:36,693
and no one forgets them.

95
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,815
I could talk for an hour about Arkane's design values, and many people have, but that's not

96
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:44,837
the point of this presentation.

97
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:49,702
The point is that your studio has its own values, and you are the ones defining them.

98
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:58,526
Our second challenge is leadership bottlenecks. What do I mean by bottleneck? In this case,

99
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:03,771
it's when an idea doesn't move forward until it works its way up the bottle. A level designer

100
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:08,655
creates an idea which is reviewed by their lead, who will give feedback, help them iterate,

101
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,576
and ultimately validate it or not.

102
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:15,136
If validated, the producer will evaluate the impact

103
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:16,056
on other teams.

104
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,077
Even validated at this stage, which, again,

105
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:21,839
isn't a given when the creative director gets involved,

106
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,460
who may be reviewing it without the LD present,

107
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:28,722
they may not feel it fits with the vision of the game

108
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:29,522
and kill it.

109
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,324
Not only does this weed out a diversity of ideas,

110
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:34,765
but it could also take weeks.

111
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:37,186
So what's our solution?

112
00:07:38,606 --> 00:07:40,167
Eliminate the validation process.

113
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:49,309
No, it's probably not a good idea. Instead, we have a team of leadership.

114
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,415
Our level design team does not have a flat hierarchy, but we have several leaders who

115
00:07:55,455 --> 00:08:00,860
work together. In addition to the lead, there's the campaign designer. Hi, that's me.

116
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:03,482
And the lead technical level designer.

117
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:10,869
Together, we sit down with the level designer and review their ideas.

118
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:16,094
with the campaign producer and the creative director. If one of us can't be present,

119
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:22,756
the process happens anyway. We keep things moving. We involve the LD so they can defend their ideas,

120
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:28,818
which then don't have to be validated over and over. Sometimes we disagree, and that's the point.

121
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:35,000
We have different tastes and areas of expertise. We talk it out. We try to find a consensus or

122
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,942
a compromise. And sometimes we just trust the person who's the most qualified to make that call.

123
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:45,117
This means a bigger variety of ideas can make it into the game.

124
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:48,819
OK, so what's each of our areas of expertise?

125
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,680
Who is the most qualified for what?

126
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,623
The lead level designer defines the level design objectives

127
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:55,764
and guidelines.

128
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:59,006
They work closely with system design and level art.

129
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,988
The campaign designer crafts the backbone

130
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:03,188
of the player's experience.

131
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,951
They work closely with narrative and UI and user experience.

132
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,529
The lead technical level designer is all about the team's tools and processes.

133
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:16,050
They work closely with tools development and tech art.

134
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,492
As you can see, we have a pretty balanced load in terms of what other

135
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:25,414
disciplines we work with, leading each of us focus on our particular area and

136
00:09:25,794 --> 00:09:28,255
trusting each other to have our backs for the rest.

137
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,390
In a nutshell, discuss ideas together as a group,

138
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,431
not as rungs in a ladder where each rung could break.

139
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,671
We have a variety of leaders with different areas

140
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:46,592
of expertise and different tastes.

141
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:50,613
Include the level designer in the validation process.

142
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:52,213
Let them defend their ideas.

143
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:55,234
Some people can present their ideas better on paper

144
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,414
and some can do it better in a discussion.

145
00:09:57,734 --> 00:10:00,675
Give them a chance and keep the process moving.

146
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,996
Deference and trust are required.

147
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:08,178
Challenge three is masters of none.

148
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,140
There is a huge variety of thing

149
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,882
a level designer has to be good at.

150
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:15,846
You know, jack of all trades.

151
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,989
A level designer creates the maps layout,

152
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:22,392
the challenges, the logic of events, and so much more.

153
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:24,654
Every choice a level designer makes

154
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:26,777
can impact or define the narrative.

155
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:30,549
Every vignette involves a UI or user experience element,

156
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,109
whether it's an interaction prompt

157
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:33,930
or an objective notification.

158
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,051
Many game systems happen inside the level design.

159
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,991
How does the map's design get the most out of those systems?

160
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:43,492
Does the gray box layout match the architectural intentions

161
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:46,373
with the right proportions, scales, and rhythms of spaces?

162
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,794
Is the map following all metrics and constraints

163
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:50,374
and optimization guidelines?

164
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,875
Is the level designer an expert on every tool,

165
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:55,556
including scripting logic and various forms of markup?

166
00:10:57,713 --> 00:11:03,958
This is a lot and no one person can be an expert at all of it. I know I am not.

167
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:07,301
So what can we do to mitigate it?

168
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:15,088
The diversification of level design specializations. This is dividing level designers into two types

169
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:17,930
map owners and specialists.

170
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:25,897
Specialists ease the burdens on map owners. A narrative scripter.

171
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:30,530
is part of the narrative team, but with a level designer's skills, this allows them

172
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,052
to autonomously carry out narrative setup in the maps.

173
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:42,640
The campaign designer makes sure the UI is in sync with what the level designers are doing and guides the LDs on how to best take advantage of it.

174
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,662
A level systems designer can be one or the other, but has the skills in both.

175
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:56,766
They provide an LD's insight into the development of some systems and assist LDs in getting the most out of those systems.

176
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:01,162
Level artists work directly with level designers

177
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:02,202
on the geometry.

178
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,642
So LDs don't also have to be masters

179
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:07,523
of the fundamentals of architecture,

180
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:10,784
needing to create gray boxes that transition beautifully

181
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:12,164
into realistic buildings.

182
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:14,844
That's not the point of our gray boxes.

183
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:18,065
Tech LDs assist in tools development,

184
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,266
but also work with level designers

185
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:21,926
on highly technical tasks.

186
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:25,107
This has helped Arkane so much.

187
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:29,767
It is not necessary for map owners to be experts at everything.

188
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:33,348
There are people on other teams who have level design skills.

189
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:34,649
Let them contribute.

190
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:39,370
But most importantly, be sensitive to what each member of your team needs.

191
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,092
They don't all have to be map owners.

192
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:45,833
Let one focus on technical tasks and another work on narrative.

193
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,074
Let them focus on their strengths.

194
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:52,267
Challenge four is overwhelming dependencies.

195
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:54,728
No discipline works in isolation,

196
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:57,049
and game development has many moving parts.

197
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:00,250
The whole design must work with nearly all of them.

198
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:02,931
But what does that look like?

199
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:06,053
What are a level designer's key partnerships?

200
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:13,456
First, what is the work that happens

201
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:15,276
before level designers begin?

202
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:17,037
What allows them to do their work?

203
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:22,307
In defining the shape and scope, many questions have to be asked.

204
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:25,988
The broadest one is, what does a level even mean in our game?

205
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,028
Are the levels connected by ellipses,

206
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,129
or are they contiguous?

207
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,549
How big are the maps?

208
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:31,869
How dense are they?

209
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,710
Do several maps make a level, like we had in Dishonored?

210
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,450
Or is it something else entirely,

211
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,270
like we're currently doing in Deathloop?

212
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:43,772
It's critical that the technical director and level designers

213
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:46,952
are in sync with creative direction and art direction.

214
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:50,010
If they're not, be careful.

215
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,812
What feels like the final decision can change,

216
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:56,293
and it will be painful if it does.

217
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,615
Engine and tools developers have a hand

218
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:03,036
in laying the foundation for the ways LDs and level artists do

219
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,038
their work, or what work is even possible at all.

220
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:09,940
To ensure that these tools fit the needs and processes

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,962
of both teams, tech LDs and tech artists are involved early.

222
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:15,382
Tools are created.

223
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:17,118
Workflows are mapped out.

224
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:18,959
Best practices are defined.

225
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,901
Now LDs and level artists have exactly what they need,

226
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:23,843
tools that are concretely designed

227
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:26,065
for the exact work they're doing.

228
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:29,667
Now and then we try to do something wacky,

229
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:32,790
like this honor to time travel mission,

230
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,372
crack in the slab or the clockwork mansion.

231
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:39,215
Our engine and tools teams have the flexibility

232
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:40,696
to make our dreams come true.

233
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:44,417
But we don't just use tools to build maps.

234
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:46,738
We also need to implement game systems.

235
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:50,499
Technical LDs will work alongside the systems designers

236
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,800
in a mix of engine developers and gameplay programmers.

237
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,461
The work done by these teams is critical

238
00:14:58,501 --> 00:14:59,801
to making immersive Sims.

239
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,162
Void Studio is built from the ground up

240
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:04,762
for exactly this type of game.

241
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,063
We've created a visual scripting language called Kiskul,

242
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,724
tailored exactly to our needs

243
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,284
and the needs of the games we're making.

244
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:19,566
We have a modular component system that ensures behaviors are consistent game-wide, which is a key to systemic game design.

245
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:24,490
We have external tools like a content integration system or performance monitors,

246
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:32,455
but we sometimes like to give them funny names like Octung that delivers warnings or Tintin, our bug reporter.

247
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:44,722
but narrative and gameplay are one. What the story is and what the player can or

248
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:50,086
must do are intertwined. This forms the campaign. The campaign designer will

249
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:54,430
collaborate closely with narrative team, lead level design, and creative direction

250
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,333
to form the high-level outline of the player's goals.

251
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:02,859
They then collaborate with the LDs to turn this outline into detailed scenarios, challenges, and vignettes.

252
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,102
The game world is fleshed out from a collaboration between level design, narrative, and art direction.

253
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:12,465
A level design problem can lead to a solution that makes the game's world richer.

254
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:17,848
Once narrative and art get a hold of it, what was a problem now fleshes out the world.

255
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,633
In Dishonored, we wanted urban maps, which implies streets,

256
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:24,415
but we also didn't want to put up invisible walls.

257
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:27,837
So art and narrative invented massive street blockers,

258
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:30,860
which fictionally controlled the spread of the plague,

259
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,261
but also enclosed the gameplay space.

260
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:38,405
A narrative designer may propose something surprising.

261
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,250
A concept artist runs with it, exciting everyone,

262
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,612
leading to a level designer creating a vignette,

263
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:45,773
or maybe an entire level around it.

264
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,435
But this can only happen if each team member is attentive

265
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,736
to one another and feels free to collaborate.

266
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:54,517
Now we're in the thick of it.

267
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:59,200
What keep partnership come into play while the level geometry

268
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,960
is being made?

269
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:06,563
The crafters of the maps may be our most important partnership.

270
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:10,690
The level designer and level artist will begin work at the same time.

271
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:15,654
The LD creates the layout and flow of the maps in Graybox,

272
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:20,097
which establishes the size, scope, paths, basically what the level is.

273
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:24,340
The level artist creates the visual DNA of the map.

274
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,543
This proof of concept establishes the scale and proportions, the style and the mood.

275
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:40,178
forces. The level artists are not doing an art pass on the maps. They're creating a new map

276
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,461
from scratch based on the LD's layout but with the visual DNA of their proof of concept.

277
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:50,704
Pairs of level designers and level artists will work together until the end of the project,

278
00:17:51,184 --> 00:17:53,965
collaborating to bring their combined vision to reality.

279
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:57,628
Level artists work closely with environment artists

280
00:17:57,668 --> 00:18:00,409
to establish a modular system called a breakout kit

281
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:01,850
that can be snapped together.

282
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,791
These are intended to be replaced with authored assets

283
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:06,692
late in production during the polish stage.

284
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:09,613
Level designers also work with environment artists

285
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,114
to create unique props.

286
00:18:11,854 --> 00:18:15,115
This can be a complicated process involving concept art

287
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:16,436
and level art as well,

288
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,456
and can require a lot of iteration

289
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:20,837
since this piece may be part of a puzzle

290
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:23,438
that players need to understand just by looking at it.

291
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:28,523
The moving bank vault in Death of the Outsider was constructed by someone who could do both

292
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:30,425
concept art and environment art.

293
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:36,072
Concept artists will absolutely become involved to visualize the spaces,

294
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:40,733
doing paint-overs of the gray box or the level artist's rough blockout.

295
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,434
Sometimes this can bring out new ideas, with the concept artist

296
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,254
providing a vision neither map owner had anticipated.

297
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:52,216
Practically speaking, it is useful to define the details that the environment

298
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:55,576
and lighting artists will use. Other times it's just exciting.

299
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:59,377
You get to see what the map could look like in the finished game, possibly years

300
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,798
before the art and rendering are ready to make it possible.

301
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:06,721
It can be an inspiring moment that invigorates the passions of everyone involved.

302
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:09,582
But we require illumination.

303
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:12,844
Our level design and level art wouldn't mean much without lighting.

304
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:15,606
How would the players see?

305
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:24,211
Once a map's layout is stable, a lighting artist steps in and the three will work together.

306
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:29,435
A map's lighting could be subtle and functional, there but never thought about.

307
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:34,139
or it can be emotional, heavily pushing the desired mood, or it can be directional,

308
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:37,381
giving the player critical information, guiding them forward.

309
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:41,404
Delighting artists will use all of these methods to make the map shine.

310
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:43,025
Pun intended.

311
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:49,630
Environmental storytelling is the multitude of stories that exist in all spaces in the game.

312
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:57,518
expressed either explicitly or left to inference. It has two forms. High level is, why does this

313
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:04,663
space exist? Why is this place like this? It is often conceived by the narrative team, creative

314
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:11,487
direction, and level art leadership. This forms the core concept of a location. Low level is,

315
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:15,570
what happened here? What do these objects communicate to the player?

316
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:18,293
Low level comes from all directions,

317
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:20,434
often proposed by the narrative team,

318
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,476
but just as often from the level designers

319
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:23,617
or the level artists.

320
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,400
Constructing the level geometry is now well in progress,

321
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,941
but we're making games.

322
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:31,222
What about the gameplay?

323
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:33,504
What about taking a drink?

324
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,185
Because my throat is getting worn out.

325
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:41,910
Just as we have emergent gameplay,

326
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:44,051
we have emergent level design.

327
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:48,064
R-level designers have a lot of freedom to invent wild bullshit.

328
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:52,327
The work done by the systems designer and gameplay programmers

329
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:57,471
allows LDs to invent novel, weird, or just plain game-breaking stuff that

330
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:01,514
they create new uses for everything.

331
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:02,995
It's not uncommon.

332
00:21:03,848 --> 00:21:05,929
for an LD to push the envelope with our tools

333
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:08,451
and create a spaghetti pile of logic

334
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:09,611
just to get it working.

335
00:21:10,232 --> 00:21:12,473
Yes, I am very guilty of this.

336
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:16,115
I think it's great, but we still must be careful.

337
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:20,017
This is when tech LDs and gameplay programmers

338
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:21,558
and systems designers get involved.

339
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:25,010
It could be coded into a fully supported new feature.

340
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,531
This is a best case scenario for everyone,

341
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:29,012
and it happens very often.

342
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:32,414
It could be cleaned up and optimized by the tech LDs.

343
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:34,536
Even without code support, a specialist

344
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:37,998
can do a lot with our tools in either outcome.

345
00:21:38,638 --> 00:21:40,540
It can become a nightmare for QA.

346
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,362
This is especially true if they come across what

347
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,083
looks like a new feature, but there's

348
00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:47,264
no documentation and no metrics.

349
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,806
And the only person who even knows it exists

350
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:52,007
is the level designer who cobbled it together.

351
00:21:54,932 --> 00:21:58,072
Player affordance is near and dear to our hearts at Arkane,

352
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:02,174
expressed simply, if it looks doable, let the player do it.

353
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,254
But also, if we can't let the player do it,

354
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:07,435
don't let it look doable.

355
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:10,936
This is expressed through a union of environment art,

356
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,757
level art, and systems design.

357
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,797
Level designers will define rules

358
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,898
about what looks interactive or what looks traversable.

359
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,399
Can I fit into that tunnel?

360
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:22,899
Can I open this door?

361
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,811
It looks like I can.

362
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,312
Systems design will set the player's expectations

363
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,372
for combat tactics.

364
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:33,213
Like how big of a gap can an enemy see through,

365
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:35,154
or what counts as cover and what doesn't?

366
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:38,075
Environment artists interpret these guidelines,

367
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:40,075
but they're often the start of the conversation.

368
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:42,316
They may want to make a certain type of asset,

369
00:22:42,356 --> 00:22:43,836
like a box of fireworks.

370
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:48,138
Well, if the player shoots it, he'll expect it to explode.

371
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,612
We achieve a narrative rooted in gameplay

372
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:56,354
through level design, systems design, and narrative design,

373
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:59,236
bouncing ideas off each other, letting them evolve.

374
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:00,677
Here's one example.

375
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:03,038
Narrative decides that the protagonist

376
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:04,519
should have a personalized weapon

377
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,000
that expresses their themes.

378
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:08,242
And Death of the Outsider, Billie Lurk,

379
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:10,724
had a voltaic gun that represented

380
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:13,626
her unconventional methods and pragmatic ingenuity.

381
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:18,829
Systems design devises a unique ammo type,

382
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,371
pencils and pens.

383
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:26,083
Level design could then have you visiting locations where pens and pencils are laying around.

384
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:27,904
Say, why not a bank?

385
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,225
It can move in the other direction.

386
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:32,926
Level design creates a puzzle.

387
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:35,747
There's a button that you have to shoot.

388
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:41,209
Systems design invents a rubber bullet that can impact silently and then be recovered.

389
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:46,511
Narrative design, oops, narrative design brings a tool into the games world.

390
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:48,732
I think it was part of a fish.

391
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:51,579
but players can't read our minds.

392
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:55,341
The game has to communicate possibilities in play,

393
00:23:55,921 --> 00:23:58,143
what is allowed and what is needed to progress.

394
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:01,504
The campaign designer will work with level designers

395
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:03,966
to transmute their designs into communication

396
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:05,647
via the user interface.

397
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:09,209
This can take a lot of forms like objective texts

398
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:12,871
or markers on the HUD, a quest journal or failure states.

399
00:24:13,891 --> 00:24:15,953
The narrative team is involved from the start,

400
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:17,774
weaving story through objectives

401
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:19,194
and doing the final writing pass.

402
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:27,491
So now the map exists. What happens next? A static map is not an immersive map. What brings the maps to life?

403
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:37,918
Sound designers, VFX artists, and animators work directly in our maps to create vibrant,

404
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:41,960
reactive, living places using the same tools as the LDs.

405
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:45,862
These team members are artists and designers and may see a way.

406
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,043
to do something a bit differently than what the LD asked for, who doesn't have the same eye for this kind of work.

407
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:57,068
In the Clockwork Mansion, the electro-shock sequence was pitched as being quite subtle.

408
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:01,171
These three teams punched up the intensity over and over,

409
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:07,116
both trying to reward the player with a dramatic outcome and drive home the horror of what you were doing.

410
00:25:08,017 --> 00:25:13,661
This couldn't happen if these teams just had a list of assets with no context and no say in how they're used.

411
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:18,440
There's a deep symbiosis between systems design and animators.

412
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:21,043
Together they bring the NPCs to life.

413
00:25:21,544 --> 00:25:25,129
But shit gets real when L-level designers are involved.

414
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,573
The level design could be causing trouble for NPCs.

415
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,395
The player could often be crouched inside a low tunnel,

416
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:34,858
leaving enemies baffled, even though they're within reach.

417
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:38,080
Animators could step in and create a new set of animations

418
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,861
to solve this.

419
00:25:39,642 --> 00:25:41,804
Level designers could need to convey something

420
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:42,844
about the area.

421
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:44,426
Maybe a dust storm has started,

422
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,267
which is hazardous to the player.

423
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,910
The animators have the NPCs bracing themselves

424
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,071
and shielding their eyes,

425
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:52,373
making it clear without exposition.

426
00:25:53,793 --> 00:25:56,214
Animators can push hard on certain behaviors,

427
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:58,194
taking it beyond what was proposed.

428
00:25:58,795 --> 00:26:00,815
Our games have a feature we call distractions,

429
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:04,357
where NPCs move off their patrols to do a trivial action.

430
00:26:05,137 --> 00:26:06,257
A handful of them would do,

431
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:08,738
but our animators create dozens and dozens.

432
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,759
In a vivid and tactile world,

433
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,220
so much is communicated through sound.

434
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:16,921
A button is modeled and animated.

435
00:26:17,462 --> 00:26:19,882
The sound is what makes it feel like you pressed it.

436
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:20,903
There's that click.

437
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:22,766
and then the machine roars to life,

438
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:25,448
or maybe it gives a dull, empty sound and a crackle.

439
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:27,510
Maybe there's something about the sound

440
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,031
that tells you the machine needs power or is broken,

441
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:33,774
or if it does turn on, it will only stay on for a short time.

442
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:37,376
Sound can communicate in intuitive ways,

443
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:41,519
instinctive ways that are faster and more intuitive

444
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,001
than a UI prompt or the player character explaining things.

445
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:48,497
So much of what you see can also be heard.

446
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:52,280
Atmosphere is equally visual as auditory.

447
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,782
Tech artists and rendering engineers

448
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:57,904
create visceral experiences with the sound designers.

449
00:26:58,465 --> 00:27:01,667
The gentle hum in the background perfectly matching

450
00:27:01,727 --> 00:27:05,070
the haze surrounding you, the crunching under your feet

451
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,332
letting you feel the shaders on the ground.

452
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:09,533
The player will feel like they're there.

453
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:11,235
The map is now a place.

454
00:27:12,636 --> 00:27:14,177
Details tell a story.

455
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:19,511
A light touch of VFX can deepen the player's involvement in what the LDs and level artists

456
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:20,011
have built.

457
00:27:20,612 --> 00:27:24,454
You could add flies over a trash can next to a door to tip the player off that that

458
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:27,795
house isn't abandoned and something fishy is going on in there.

459
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:32,538
Beams of light through cracks in the ceiling signal that your long journey back to the

460
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:33,759
surface has come to an end.

461
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,341
Maybe this is an exciting moment of relief or a weary, somber moment.

462
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:41,943
The way the beams of light move can push either feeling.

463
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,163
A cloud of dust could appear when moving an object, deepening the feeling of intruding

464
00:27:47,504 --> 00:27:48,665
upon a forgotten place.

465
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:52,469
Details like these aren't just immersive, they carry information.

466
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,773
The player can learn or understand without realizing that they have.

467
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:57,375
And finally...

468
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,455
How does all of this work?

469
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,136
How do you get this work into the player's hands?

470
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:04,356
How do we get there?

471
00:28:05,336 --> 00:28:06,837
Someone has to keep the ship afloat,

472
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:08,517
and eventually you need to ship.

473
00:28:09,237 --> 00:28:11,638
Our testing teams are divided between quality assurance

474
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:12,818
and dev testing.

475
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,939
Typically, QA testers will be assigned maps

476
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,219
or parts of the campaign,

477
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:20,040
and switch every few months to keep ideas fresh.

478
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,561
A dev tester will attend each weekly level design meeting,

479
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:26,301
so their dev team always has the latest info

480
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:27,461
on what the LDs are up to.

481
00:28:28,662 --> 00:28:34,607
big complex features that are tied deeply to level design make a special focus from a dev tester who

482
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:41,232
attend the kickoff meeting and provide feedback. Players usually like all of the frames per second.

483
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:47,131
Optimization is both the first and last thing our technical teams work on in a production.

484
00:28:48,012 --> 00:28:53,994
Our game systems are CPU heavy, so from day one everything is designed with optimization in mind.

485
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:59,537
This impacts the scope and density of our maps. If you run afoul of this, you may need to split

486
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:05,760
your map in two or three or four. And that's harder than it sounds. It will define how many

487
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,281
active AI can be at a location at once.

488
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:13,396
We have to do all sorts of tricks to limit this invisibly without making the maps feel empty.

489
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:18,437
Sidelines are one of the fundamental tools of level design and rendering metrics determine

490
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:23,779
everything that we can do. Our systemic world and complex AI don't leave much CPU power left

491
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:28,541
for our scripted logic. We can only use two percent of the CPU's power per frame.

492
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:35,003
As production draws to a close, level designers and artists often must hand their maps over to

493
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:37,183
the optimization gods and pray.

494
00:29:38,795 --> 00:29:44,260
To recap, a clearly defined studio culture can give level designers a consistent quality and style,

495
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,785
in style, no matter how your team evolves. A team of leadership with unique roles can open

496
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:53,668
wide the creative potential of the level designers to keep their ideas flowing.

497
00:29:54,429 --> 00:30:00,214
The diversification of LD specializations means not every map owner has to be great at everything.

498
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:04,318
Specialists can strengthen the entire team by being very good at one thing.

499
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:09,077
Key partnerships are essential to this deeply collaborative process.

500
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:12,819
Every team has a part to play in making the mobile design great.

501
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,042
And the more everyone understands everyone else's part, the clearer these interactions become.

502
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,810
Okay, we're exactly at the halfway point.

503
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,431
We're at 30 minutes, 31 minutes.

504
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:31,493
At this moment, I have to stop recording the video

505
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:34,534
and start the next section.

506
00:30:35,014 --> 00:30:37,395
So I'll see you on the other side of that.

507
00:30:37,915 --> 00:30:42,137
Okay, we're back for part two, processes.

508
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:47,459
Challenge five is determinism in design.

509
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:50,898
This challenge is about metrics.

510
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,780
When I say metric, I am talking about the dozens

511
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,382
of design constraints that allow every part of the game

512
00:30:56,802 --> 00:30:58,503
to work with every other part.

513
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:01,705
Game development is often the march of metrics

514
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:04,686
from their inception to the implementation

515
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:07,428
with strict adherence to the inevitability

516
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:10,850
of rigid, clear-cut gameplay experiences.

517
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,151
There's a determinist quality to it.

518
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,981
Why can metrics lead to this kind of design determinism?

519
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:23,963
First, sorry, I get my hair in my mouth.

520
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,764
It happens.

521
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:28,365
There it is again.

522
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,587
What does the life cycle of a metric look like?

523
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:36,408
Gameplay metrics are born from the work

524
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,949
between systems designers and gameplay programmers.

525
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:42,091
These are things like how fast can the NPC move?

526
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:43,871
Or how far can they see?

527
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:45,612
What's their attack range?

528
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,834
The gameplay metrics mature into character metrics

529
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,438
as they're handed over to the animation team,

530
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:54,140
character artists, and riggers.

531
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:56,964
What is the size of an NPC?

532
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,766
How wide is their collision?

533
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:00,869
How far off the ground is their vision cone?

534
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,703
Next, bringing the metrics into adulthood, level artists work with the environment artists to give

535
00:32:06,723 --> 00:32:12,967
the world a scale that was defined by the character metrics. This asks and answers questions like,

536
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:18,791
how wide is the doorway? How tall is a handrail? What's the floor-to-floor height of a building?

537
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:24,714
What's the smallest room? What's the smallest room can be so that X number of NPCs can still

538
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:30,358
move around? Now it's ready for the metrics, which are all grown up to arrive in the hands

539
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:31,178
of level designers.

540
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:34,954
They follow the metrics to the letter and job's done, right?

541
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:37,614
Job's done, right?

542
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:40,055
I'm not going to do their voices.

543
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:50,357
You could wind up with a team of level designers

544
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:53,298
whose job is heavily restricted by the metrics.

545
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,799
And they wind up just robotically constructing maps

546
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:59,099
that are defined by the metrics alone.

547
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:02,082
We don't want that and we don't do that.

548
00:33:02,163 --> 00:33:04,564
We can't work that way with the type of games we make.

549
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,387
We make messy games with systems

550
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:08,708
that are crashing into each other

551
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:12,330
and a passionate dedication to immersion and world building.

552
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:14,592
There's a balance that has to be reached

553
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:17,154
between what feels best for the player

554
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:21,037
and strict adherence to the metrics that are still needed

555
00:33:21,397 --> 00:33:23,439
to make any of our game systems even work.

556
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,501
We need flexible metrics.

557
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:32,658
you can't know how any of the metrics will work in gameplay until the level designers are using

558
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:41,001
them and testing their limits. The metrics for enemy vision range may not work with the sight

559
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:45,983
lines the level designers need. The level geometry may require many iterations with

560
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:51,745
gameplay programmers to find the correct metrics for enemy pathfinding. Your tools could be

561
00:33:51,785 --> 00:33:54,886
displaying warnings when the metrics are broken, which is good,

562
00:33:55,774 --> 00:33:58,016
but this can also stifle experimentation.

563
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,719
Designers like to go off the rails when trying a new idea.

564
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,282
The engine will often put strict limits

565
00:34:04,382 --> 00:34:06,604
on how many NPCs can be near the player,

566
00:34:06,704 --> 00:34:08,506
but level and narrative design

567
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,287
have the player crashing a party.

568
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:14,672
Oh no, the engine says you can only have five NPCs

569
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:15,713
at the party.

570
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:19,036
The interaction range on pickups.

571
00:34:19,612 --> 00:34:21,913
may be too large for the object density of the maps,

572
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:23,533
making it difficult for the player

573
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:25,434
to target one item over another.

574
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:28,855
Metrics on audio propagation say that sound can't

575
00:34:28,896 --> 00:34:30,316
travel more than 20 meters.

576
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:32,797
But level and audio designers are

577
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,798
placing diegetic music in the maps, which

578
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:36,259
now cuts off awkwardly.

579
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:40,360
Everything the level artists and environment artists planned

580
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,181
could fly to bits when it crashes

581
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:43,602
into what the LDs have done.

582
00:34:44,122 --> 00:34:45,503
These metrics are a starting point.

583
00:34:46,063 --> 00:34:47,463
But for the collaboration to work,

584
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,064
both teams need to be flexible.

585
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:53,841
The complexity of the objectives may be too great for the space on the UI.

586
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:58,643
Three words to explain the next goal may work in 90% of the cases,

587
00:34:58,743 --> 00:35:00,363
but sometimes you need more room.

588
00:35:01,324 --> 00:35:01,764
To be clear.

589
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:04,198
be as flexible as possible.

590
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,218
But something simply can't change.

591
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:08,679
Character limits on UI elements have

592
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,459
to take into account localization.

593
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,160
Some languages will need twice as much space.

594
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,721
If level designers experiment forever,

595
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:18,542
expecting systems and gameplay programmers to keep up,

596
00:35:18,922 --> 00:35:20,622
they won't be able to stabilize the game

597
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:21,723
into a shippable state.

598
00:35:22,543 --> 00:35:23,843
As annoying as many of the warnings

599
00:35:23,903 --> 00:35:25,784
a level designer will butt up against are,

600
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:28,345
they exist for a reason and build management.

601
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:33,380
will pay the price in hours and sanity for every warning a level designer ignores.

602
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:40,022
A level designer may want to go wild with massive VFX and sounds that propagate across the entire

603
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:45,904
map, but eventually they'll hit a limit on what the engine can do if the level designer requests

604
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:51,686
something as innocent as changing the height of a table. This can cause a domino effect.

605
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:55,330
with hours of rework for animation and character art.

606
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,572
These changes must be requested with extreme caution.

607
00:35:58,612 --> 00:36:01,954
You probably won't get a second chance if you're wrong.

608
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:04,915
It's a difficult process, but there's

609
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,077
some things the team can do to make it go more smoothly.

610
00:36:08,938 --> 00:36:10,739
Environment artists can get a hold

611
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:14,561
of the metrics created by systems design and animation

612
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:14,961
early.

613
00:36:15,516 --> 00:36:21,066
and make a modular grey box kit that will match the breakout kit they'll later make for the level artists.

614
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:26,297
If the metrics change, this kit can easily be tweaked, updating the entire game.

615
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:33,397
Tools can be created to help level designers visualize the more abstract metrics like audio

616
00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:34,377
propagation limits.

617
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:38,980
You can try to find a balance between the performance cost of some of the rendering

618
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,403
engine's fancier features with what the level designers are doing.

619
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:48,426
If there's a poison gas feature and the LDs use it everywhere, it could tank your framerate.

620
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,088
Since you can't see the future.

621
00:36:50,648 --> 00:36:54,892
Give LDs a cheap temp version so they can place it in their maps,

622
00:36:55,372 --> 00:37:00,056
and then you can see how much that temp version costs, and now you have a target to aim for.

623
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:08,083
Oh, and now it should go without saying, level designers, yes, please do follow the metrics.

624
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:14,228
But when they aren't working, say something.

625
00:37:16,357 --> 00:37:18,338
This may sound all over the place.

626
00:37:19,118 --> 00:37:20,358
So what point am I trying to make?

627
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:23,119
If your level design and level art teams

628
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:25,899
are forced to strictly follow the metrics

629
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:27,900
and have no say in what those metrics are,

630
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,401
you'll wind up with rote, predictable, samey maps.

631
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:35,262
Metrics must be iterated on like anything else.

632
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:36,802
And you need wiggle room.

633
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,763
If cover has to be exactly one meter high,

634
00:37:39,783 --> 00:37:43,944
your map will lose believability.

635
00:37:44,144 --> 00:37:44,904
Give them range.

636
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,151
It's a balanced give and take.

637
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:50,871
Sometimes a metric must be strictly followed,

638
00:37:50,891 --> 00:37:53,112
know when to give and know when to hold firm.

639
00:37:54,492 --> 00:37:56,893
If you set up processes around the idea

640
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:58,413
that metrics will be flexible,

641
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:01,394
everything will be easier and ready to change.

642
00:38:02,254 --> 00:38:05,214
But most of all, if the metrics aren't working

643
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:08,255
or too restrictive, you have to speak up.

644
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:10,996
And when LDs speak up, please listen.

645
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:14,637
Challenge six, pivots happen.

646
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:18,619
Things change during development for whatever reason,

647
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,521
and the reason is user research.

648
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:22,501
I'll get to that later.

649
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:25,143
And you may need to react quickly.

650
00:38:25,563 --> 00:38:28,465
The problem is every team works at a different pace.

651
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:30,626
Some may be finished and are polishing

652
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:32,107
while others are just getting started.

653
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:33,988
When your project must pivot,

654
00:38:34,368 --> 00:38:37,450
how do you minimize wasted time and work?

655
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:41,712
So level design and level art teams work together

656
00:38:42,012 --> 00:38:44,133
until they stabilize their work and hit a milestone.

657
00:38:44,774 --> 00:38:45,354
At this point.

658
00:38:46,215 --> 00:38:48,237
After you get user research, the level design team

659
00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:51,519
gets some feedback, digests it, pivots, and resumes work.

660
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:55,961
On the level art team, however, they didn't get the feedback.

661
00:38:56,782 --> 00:38:58,443
It was about the level design, after all.

662
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,224
They polish up their work, stabilize it,

663
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:02,405
and call it finished.

664
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:06,027
But inevitably, the changes made to the level design

665
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,369
are going to need changes to the level art, too.

666
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,430
But it was communicated too late.

667
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:14,872
The level art team has polished up their work.

668
00:39:15,293 --> 00:39:15,513
And it's

669
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:16,866
They change things now.

670
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:19,267
Not only is it going to waste the polish time,

671
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:22,069
but polished work is much harder to change.

672
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:25,250
So level design changes are now blocked,

673
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,871
and the game may ship without.

674
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:30,112
Some teams can't begin their work

675
00:39:30,192 --> 00:39:32,253
until another team's work has stabilized.

676
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:34,074
And every time the first team pivots,

677
00:39:34,614 --> 00:39:36,475
this gets pushed farther and farther ahead.

678
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:40,856
There's no way for sound in VFX to realistically work on a map

679
00:39:41,357 --> 00:39:42,837
while it's still deep in production.

680
00:39:43,478 --> 00:39:45,318
The layout and contents need to be stable.

681
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:50,681
Every time the level design pivots, this pushes that moment further down the timeline.

682
00:39:51,201 --> 00:39:55,163
When the LD work is finally stable enough, these teams have barely enough time to do

683
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:58,525
the work and almost no time for their own polish and stabilization.

684
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:02,165
The structure of some teams work can be radically different,

685
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:04,586
making syncing up iteration impossible.

686
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:07,387
Features are often developed one at a time

687
00:40:07,547 --> 00:40:10,248
and can be delivered to level designers very late.

688
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,970
Game systems can be the biggest impacted

689
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,810
by pivots from user research, which

690
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,851
means new and revised features can

691
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:19,432
come long after the level design work has

692
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:20,833
shifted to stabilization.

693
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,694
It can be a complicated and risky process

694
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:26,035
to integrate them this late, throwing the stability

695
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:27,236
of the maps into question.

696
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:30,038
and features may not be implemented correctly in the end.

697
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:33,400
To be clear, many of these features

698
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,821
are requested by level designers themselves,

699
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:38,943
but the problem is they can impact the entire game,

700
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,005
and not every map may be in a good state to receive them.

701
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:46,548
These issues have to be solved on a case-by-case basis.

702
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:53,352
And I don't have the solution to everything.

703
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,749
But there's two guiding principles behind reducing

704
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:57,670
the negative impacts.

705
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,251
And that's to de-silo and empower.

706
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,792
The type of siloing I'm talking about

707
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:07,934
is when one team has information but doesn't share it

708
00:41:07,974 --> 00:41:08,634
with other teams.

709
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:12,916
Give the level artists the same feedback

710
00:41:12,976 --> 00:41:14,357
the level designers were given.

711
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,458
Let the two teams iterate as one.

712
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:19,659
Level artists can be empowered to react to the feedback

713
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:22,460
as well, rather than being given tasks weeks later.

714
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:28,092
After the level design is already well in motion, it is not easy.

715
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:33,136
It takes tremendous amount of coordination to keep teams this size and sync.

716
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:37,980
Ask any producer. Miscommunication and wasted work will still happen,

717
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:41,183
but iterating together is always worth the effort.

718
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:46,667
The level design team can be empowered to populate their maps with sound and VFX early.

719
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,607
through a library of placeholder assets.

720
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:53,830
This can help level designers get their ideas validated

721
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,712
by presenting them more concretely.

722
00:41:58,153 --> 00:42:01,195
If needed, more temp assets can be created

723
00:42:01,315 --> 00:42:02,936
as the LD team reacts to feedback.

724
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:04,497
But of course, remember,

725
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:08,000
a placeholder must be unshippable or it may ship.

726
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:13,560
When the time comes for VFX and sound designers to work directly in the maps,

727
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:18,985
the maps are already populated by temp assets, which dramatically decreases the workloads on

728
00:42:19,265 --> 00:42:24,430
all of these teams and gives them a much clearer idea of the scope and variety of work ahead.

729
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:29,695
Kickoff meetings at the start of a features development keep everyone in the loop.

730
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:36,601
Tech LDs and stakeholders on the LD team can be involved early, desiloing this information.

731
00:42:37,826 --> 00:42:41,848
They can start working with the map owners to prepare for each feature's arrival.

732
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:46,851
The level design team is then empowered to have their maps ready as soon as the

733
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:49,113
feature arrives. Ideally, of course,

734
00:42:50,594 --> 00:42:53,496
you can't anticipate everything and many features come very late.

735
00:42:53,896 --> 00:42:57,278
You do what you can. On top of all of that,

736
00:42:57,298 --> 00:43:02,041
a powerful tool to help the whole team, my slice foils,

737
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:05,203
pivot, desilo and empower our strike teams.

738
00:43:09,858 --> 00:43:11,559
The critical disciplines are all present.

739
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,222
In my example, I use a recent onboarding strike team.

740
00:43:17,102 --> 00:43:19,084
You have to keep it light and agile for it to work.

741
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,945
If the entire studio is on the strike team,

742
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,246
it's not a strike team.

743
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:25,808
The team members have autonomy.

744
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:27,469
Leads and directors are in the loop,

745
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:30,310
but team members have the authority to make decisions.

746
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,552
If every plan must be validated,

747
00:43:32,952 --> 00:43:36,014
then you need eight team leaders to validate everything,

748
00:43:36,094 --> 00:43:38,055
and it cripples the team's authority.

749
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:46,017
agility, sorry, and it must involve a producer. Empowerment of autonomy means increased

750
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:49,720
accountability and everything you decide will impact other teams.

751
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:54,524
There's no single solution, it's just communication.

752
00:43:55,145 --> 00:43:57,026
No team's partnerships are identical.

753
00:43:57,086 --> 00:43:59,027
The challenges to each will be unique.

754
00:43:59,247 --> 00:44:00,807
You need custom solutions.

755
00:44:01,468 --> 00:44:02,728
If you de-silo your work,

756
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:05,650
you can empower other teams to be ready to receive it

757
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,150
as soon as it's available,

758
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,631
to get their work in a much better state

759
00:44:10,852 --> 00:44:12,093
to begin your pass on it.

760
00:44:13,253 --> 00:44:16,474
And of course, trust in the power of strike teams.

761
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:19,116
But remember, it has to be lean and autonomous.

762
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:23,618
Challenge seven, markup and sunk cost.

763
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:26,547
Features that require markup.

764
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:33,530
That is, to be implemented by hand,

765
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,631
in every instance, are very common.

766
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:38,692
And it's common across the industry.

767
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:41,393
It's something many development teams will face.

768
00:44:42,574 --> 00:44:45,055
Arcane works very hard to require

769
00:44:45,175 --> 00:44:46,456
as little markup as possible,

770
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:48,717
but it's extremely complicated to achieve.

771
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:53,382
That is because in some cases, markup is design work.

772
00:44:53,502 --> 00:44:57,424
Like if you're defining a zone, a certain enemy cannot exit,

773
00:44:58,164 --> 00:45:00,505
so they won't chase the player across the entire map.

774
00:45:01,085 --> 00:45:04,786
But in others, it is simply telling the game what exists

775
00:45:04,906 --> 00:45:07,347
so it can interpret the data in a certain way,

776
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:11,188
like marking spaces as under a table

777
00:45:11,348 --> 00:45:14,449
so that enemies can shout, she's hiding under the table.

778
00:45:16,149 --> 00:45:19,370
What does markup or lack of markup do to level design?

779
00:45:20,362 --> 00:45:26,103
In Dishonored 1, sorry I'm getting tired. In Dishonored 1, we had a blink power, a short-range

780
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:31,425
teleport. It required basically no markup. We occasionally needed to tweak the collisions a bit

781
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:37,147
by hand to get it to work perfectly on a critical path, but for the most part it just worked.

782
00:45:38,307 --> 00:45:42,788
By blink requiring no markup, that's time the level designers can design.

783
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:49,193
Death of the Outsider had the displaceability, which allowed our protagonist to place potential

784
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:53,817
versions of herself representing alternate realities and then switch between them at will.

785
00:45:54,618 --> 00:46:00,604
Yeah, it was complicated. Because an NPC was involved, we had to put navmesh everywhere

786
00:46:00,644 --> 00:46:06,068
the player could potentially go. This represented a small markup cost, but it wasn't design work.

787
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:08,471
It was just dropping data in where it fit.

788
00:46:09,874 --> 00:46:12,055
Well, it's something that requires a massive amount

789
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:13,737
of markup, but straddles the line

790
00:46:13,777 --> 00:46:16,799
between interpreting existing data and design work.

791
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:19,840
Enemies don't take cover during combat

792
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:22,242
unless there's data telling them where they can go

793
00:46:22,602 --> 00:46:24,023
and what they can do when they're there.

794
00:46:25,184 --> 00:46:27,525
You can build tools to have the LD hand place

795
00:46:27,645 --> 00:46:30,247
each cover point, which gives them absolute control

796
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:32,168
over every combat encounter.

797
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,870
But this is incredibly time consuming

798
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,291
and it makes it very difficult

799
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:37,812
to change the map's layout later.

800
00:46:39,222 --> 00:46:47,764
systemic cover that operates either by AI rules or procedurally generated cover points has pros

801
00:46:47,844 --> 00:46:54,906
and cons. The cons are a much higher reliance on strict metrics, but if we consider this adherence

802
00:46:55,186 --> 00:47:00,868
to extra metrics as markup time, it's still way less than if it all had to be done by hand.

803
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:03,689
That's the pro. Iteration is feasible again.

804
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:07,673
Here's a perfect example, a personal example.

805
00:47:08,313 --> 00:47:10,133
In Dishonored 2, I was level designer

806
00:47:10,373 --> 00:47:12,554
of the clockwork mansion, which was this house

807
00:47:12,674 --> 00:47:15,255
that could transform in all sorts of ways

808
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:16,595
if the player pulled levers.

809
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:19,736
This is how I spent my time working on it.

810
00:47:24,257 --> 00:47:28,057
Okay, not really, but I imagine this is how it might look

811
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:28,998
from the outside.

812
00:47:30,438 --> 00:47:32,859
This, what I'm about to show you, is closer to reality.

813
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:34,499
The clockwork mechanism is...

814
00:47:35,282 --> 00:47:35,722
Excuse me.

815
00:47:36,822 --> 00:47:39,204
The clockwork mechanisms and basic level design

816
00:47:39,244 --> 00:47:42,065
took maybe half of the development time

817
00:47:42,385 --> 00:47:43,646
of about three years total.

818
00:47:45,227 --> 00:47:47,268
Jindosh, the antagonist, had voiceovers,

819
00:47:47,828 --> 00:47:49,209
which reacted to your behavior.

820
00:47:49,889 --> 00:47:52,991
Setting up the unique logic for each line was time consuming.

821
00:47:53,611 --> 00:47:56,393
The navmesh deformations for all the transforming rooms

822
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:59,955
was a monumental task, even though the static navmesh

823
00:48:00,015 --> 00:48:01,375
was procedurally generated.

824
00:48:02,516 --> 00:48:04,577
Making the audio propagation work at all.

825
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:08,433
took maybe as much time as setting up the transformations themselves.

826
00:48:08,713 --> 00:48:13,715
It was 100% markup, and the tools I needed to use were tricky to handle.

827
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:15,595
Could it have gone differently?

828
00:48:16,736 --> 00:48:19,877
Sure, but at that moment, this is what I had to work with, so I worked with it.

829
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,897
I'd like to clarify what I mean by sunk cost.

830
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:22,777
Usually it means time or money that you can't get back.

831
00:48:22,797 --> 00:48:24,418
If the team must pivot, all the time spent doing the markup may be lost.

832
00:48:24,438 --> 00:48:25,978
Alright, thank you for listening.

833
00:48:26,018 --> 00:48:27,159
We'll see you in the next video.

834
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:28,919
And do me a favor and go watch your favourite show on Netflix.

835
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:29,039
Bye!

836
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:30,760
Or go watch this one.

837
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,100
See you soon!

838
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,180
Bye!

839
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,300
Peace.

840
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:31,420
Peace.

841
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:31,540
Peace.

842
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,020
Peace.

843
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,140
Peace.

844
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,260
Peace.

845
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:32,500
Peace.

846
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:32,620
Peace.

847
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:32,840
Peace.

848
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,140
Peace.

849
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,280
Peace.

850
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:33,401
Peace.

851
00:48:33,421 --> 00:48:33,521
Peace.

852
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:33,641
Peace.

853
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:33,761
Peace.

854
00:48:33,781 --> 00:48:33,941
Peace.

855
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:34,121
Peace.

856
00:48:34,141 --> 00:48:34,261
Peace.

857
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:34,441
Peace.

858
00:48:34,461 --> 00:48:34,621
Peace.

859
00:48:34,641 --> 00:48:34,741
Peace.

860
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:34,861
Peace.

861
00:48:38,387 --> 00:48:43,668
And it can be really lost because it's possible that nothing at all was gained by having done it.

862
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:46,829
It's not like cutting features or throwing away design ideas.

863
00:48:47,409 --> 00:48:50,250
Those can always come back later and you could have learned something,

864
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,591
but the time you lost on the markup is gone.

865
00:48:55,192 --> 00:48:56,532
But in more human terms.

866
00:48:57,638 --> 00:48:59,859
Markup can go on for months and months.

867
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:01,740
It's thankless, tedious work.

868
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,162
If you combine it with long hours,

869
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:05,863
this can have a serious consequence

870
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,084
for the mental health and morale of your team.

871
00:49:08,685 --> 00:49:11,967
I have experienced this myself at different times in my life,

872
00:49:12,107 --> 00:49:14,048
and it can take years to recover from.

873
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:18,230
If the tools a level designer is using to do the markup

874
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,232
are particularly unergonomic.

875
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:23,725
it can cause repetitive strain injury like tendonitis.

876
00:49:24,485 --> 00:49:26,345
I have tendonitis in my left hand

877
00:49:26,646 --> 00:49:28,786
as a result of work similar to what I've described.

878
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:30,466
It is kind of a pain.

879
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:33,207
This is really important to consider

880
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:35,768
because RSI can have long-term effects

881
00:49:35,888 --> 00:49:39,049
and honestly, so can wearing down the mental health

882
00:49:39,149 --> 00:49:40,269
and morale of your team.

883
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:43,650
For this, I have two solutions

884
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,630
and a process for choosing which one to use.

885
00:49:46,769 --> 00:49:51,896
The first is to prioritize tool ergonomy. By prioritize, I mean they are designed that way

886
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:58,003
from the conception of the feature, not at some time later. The second is procedural features,

887
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:06,033
that is, features that require little to no markup at all. Here's the process.

888
00:50:07,261 --> 00:50:09,422
First, you have to start with the question,

889
00:50:10,182 --> 00:50:12,543
does the feature potentially require LD work?

890
00:50:12,984 --> 00:50:13,964
We're gonna go with yes,

891
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,665
because that's the whole point of this topic.

892
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:18,866
Is it conceptually possible to design the feature

893
00:50:18,946 --> 00:50:20,587
so no markup is needed?

894
00:50:21,468 --> 00:50:24,029
Let's play it safe right now and say no, it's not.

895
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,790
This feature requires a designed implementation.

896
00:50:28,331 --> 00:50:30,412
Is there an existing and ergonomic tool

897
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:31,652
to implement the feature?

898
00:50:32,653 --> 00:50:34,894
Best case scenario, yes, you already have one.

899
00:50:35,214 --> 00:50:36,855
Use the tool and prove it if you can.

900
00:50:37,532 --> 00:50:38,272
But what if you don't?

901
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:41,913
You should develop the tool in parallel

902
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:44,914
with the feature with input from the level designers.

903
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,575
But what if markup isn't needed?

904
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:49,596
There's two things you have to determine.

905
00:50:51,336 --> 00:50:54,677
Would the time it takes to code and maintain the feature

906
00:50:55,058 --> 00:50:57,098
be less than the level design cost?

907
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,299
I feel that in most cases, it is.

908
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:00,960
Here's the tricky one.

909
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:03,871
Do you have someone on your team

910
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:06,073
who is capable of writing this code?

911
00:51:06,613 --> 00:51:08,474
This can be a much more complicated task

912
00:51:08,534 --> 00:51:10,435
than creating a tool to do the markup.

913
00:51:10,495 --> 00:51:12,977
You could pour weeks into the work and still fail.

914
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:14,277
It's a risk.

915
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,339
If not, we're back at the tools question.

916
00:51:17,499 --> 00:51:21,882
But if yes, create a system to procedurally implement

917
00:51:21,962 --> 00:51:25,844
the feature across the game and you're done, sort of.

918
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:28,866
You must still keep the LDs in the loop from early on

919
00:51:28,926 --> 00:51:31,347
because now there's going to be metrics involved.

920
00:51:32,837 --> 00:51:37,859
No matter the outcome, the goal is to get the feature into the game as designed or give

921
00:51:37,879 --> 00:51:39,699
the level designers a way to do it.

922
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:43,940
You must do it in a way that allows for iteration and flexibility.

923
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,801
You need to avoid wearing down your level design team on repetitive tasks that take

924
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:51,562
months to complete and blocks their ability to pivot.

925
00:51:52,062 --> 00:51:56,784
And you need ergonomic tools that protect the mental health and the tendons of your

926
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:57,864
level designers.

927
00:51:58,924 --> 00:52:00,825
Last challenge, number eight.

928
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:06,870
and my clock has stopped so I have no idea how much time I have left. Oh well, let's keep going.

929
00:52:08,271 --> 00:52:09,952
Game development is too much information.

930
00:52:09,972 --> 00:52:21,280
The solution is documentation. Too bad the solution is also a challenge. We can do better

931
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:26,705
than that, but some details first. A lot of information flows through level design.

932
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:34,952
From the start, you have the game's concept coming from creative direction, narrative, or both.

933
00:52:35,692 --> 00:52:41,898
The lead level designer and campaign designer will serve up a list of the draft of the campaign overview,

934
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,161
which they've worked out with level art leadership and the narrative team.

935
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:50,633
Tech LDs working with tools developers will be drafting up tools and process specs.

936
00:52:51,193 --> 00:52:56,474
The systems designers will begin to produce vast quantities of writing about features,

937
00:52:56,514 --> 00:53:01,195
details, and metrics. The level and environment art teams will also begin to lever metrics

938
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:05,536
about the sizes and shapes of everything they're going to be using. From there,

939
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:10,937
level designers must document their brainstorms and prototypes, and then as the LDs build their

940
00:53:10,957 --> 00:53:14,458
maps, they need to begin to write down all of the map details. And then,

941
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:17,692
They should also write up the question vignette details,

942
00:53:18,013 --> 00:53:18,873
but there's more.

943
00:53:20,054 --> 00:53:22,075
Different stages of a project's life

944
00:53:22,135 --> 00:53:24,216
require different types of documentation.

945
00:53:24,256 --> 00:53:26,537
During the brainstorming phase, docs

946
00:53:26,597 --> 00:53:28,398
can and should be loose and messy.

947
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:29,899
It's the designer's notebook.

948
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:31,160
It's also an archive.

949
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,901
Nothing here should be thrown away.

950
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:36,003
Browsing through your old ideas is a great way

951
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,464
to get new ones or find one to resurrect.

952
00:53:39,204 --> 00:53:40,685
Documentation for production.

953
00:53:41,627 --> 00:53:45,609
is a massive library of detailed specs for every topic in the game.

954
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,691
I've heard it described as the single source of truth.

955
00:53:49,512 --> 00:53:53,114
It has to be rigorously guarded against redundancy

956
00:53:53,274 --> 00:53:58,216
and obsolete information. Cut content must be clearly labeled or deleted.

957
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,678
Out-of-date specs must be updated or deleted.

958
00:54:02,805 --> 00:54:08,030
Documentation suitable for shipping is an entirely different beast and often not written by the

959
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:13,994
designers but requires their help to do so. It must be lean and holistic with information

960
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:20,880
pertinent to QA, to producers, to external organizations. So in addition to all of the work

961
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,904
discussed in the last seven sections, level designers also need to take time

962
00:54:26,324 --> 00:54:30,788
out of their week on a regular basis to create and maintain their docs.

963
00:54:32,212 --> 00:54:32,913
So what do we do?

964
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:37,457
We're going to treat documentation as game development.

965
00:54:38,017 --> 00:54:40,279
Writing and maintaining docs is a task

966
00:54:40,779 --> 00:54:43,041
like any other task in the Teams to-do list.

967
00:54:43,301 --> 00:54:46,024
I am talking about the entire development team,

968
00:54:46,504 --> 00:54:47,685
not just the level designers.

969
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:51,848
Level designers need up-to-date documentation on metrics.

970
00:54:52,729 --> 00:54:55,552
Getting out-of-date information is a hazard.

971
00:54:56,634 --> 00:55:01,839
Working on docs should not be treated as an additional thing to maybe get to if you have time.

972
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:05,583
It's a task with a workflow and reviews like everything else.

973
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:12,771
If you include update the docs as a footnote in a bigger task, it can be tempting to mark the task

974
00:55:12,911 --> 00:55:18,377
as complete, trusting yourself that you'll get to the docs later. On the other hand, if you complete

975
00:55:18,537 --> 00:55:18,937
the work

976
00:55:19,302 --> 00:55:24,543
but haven't yet updated the docs. The task can still be marked in progress, and this can give

977
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:29,545
leads and producers an inaccurate view of the team's progress towards the milestone.

978
00:55:30,486 --> 00:55:36,988
If documentation is its own task, we ease these problems. Time is allotted to it. People can see

979
00:55:37,088 --> 00:55:41,850
more clearly what is and isn't done. A team member who is blocked until your work in the

980
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:45,391
game's data is finished will be happy to see that that task

981
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:51,726
is now complete and your lead producer in QA will be happy to see when the docs task is complete.

982
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:58,109
A few miscellaneous points are rather my personal advice as someone who spends a lot of time of her

983
00:55:58,129 --> 00:56:04,113
day writing docs. You can tell I'm very passionate about this topic. Docs should always know who the

984
00:56:04,253 --> 00:56:10,816
owner of what is. No doc can cover everything. People with questions need to know who to ask.

985
00:56:11,937 --> 00:56:13,838
Even if someone is maintaining the docs, you

986
00:56:14,308 --> 00:56:17,611
need tasks to review them and point out errors.

987
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:21,814
I do a lot of doc work for the campaign.

988
00:56:21,994 --> 00:56:23,475
I have a pretty clear overview,

989
00:56:23,896 --> 00:56:27,239
but it's extremely helpful to have level designers

990
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:29,340
come in, look at the details,

991
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,302
and know where I've made a mistake.

992
00:56:33,384 --> 00:56:33,584
Yes.

993
00:56:35,136 --> 00:56:38,657
Redundancy is a surefire way to get misleading docs.

994
00:56:38,918 --> 00:56:42,359
You need things like data boxes that exist on multiple pages

995
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:44,120
and only need to be updated once.

996
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,641
Old stuff is often good to keep,

997
00:56:48,402 --> 00:56:50,502
but it should be moved to an archive.

998
00:56:51,043 --> 00:56:52,703
It is a pain when you search

999
00:56:53,164 --> 00:56:55,204
and half the results are from cut features.

1000
00:56:56,065 --> 00:56:59,226
Know when to collate certain types of information

1001
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:00,487
into a single doc.

1002
00:57:01,247 --> 00:57:01,867
It's mind-numbing.

1003
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:06,492
to have to search through 50 features pages to find the metrics you need.

1004
00:57:07,593 --> 00:57:13,098
And the most critical point, do you want good bugs? Bugs that are

1005
00:57:13,238 --> 00:57:18,962
accurate, relevant, and thorough? Testing teams cannot do this without good

1006
00:57:19,163 --> 00:57:23,426
documentation. Okay, we're almost done.

1007
00:57:25,948 --> 00:57:29,711
Flexible metrics can save you from determinism in game design.

1008
00:57:30,216 --> 00:57:33,520
freeing outcomes through an attentive give and take between teams.

1009
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:38,026
Key partnerships must be empowering one another to pivot,

1010
00:57:38,407 --> 00:57:41,250
rather than siloing work and racing to the finish line.

1011
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:45,436
Tools creation can focus on procedural solutions when possible

1012
00:57:45,736 --> 00:57:48,820
and develop ergonomic tools alongside the feature when not.

1013
00:57:49,561 --> 00:57:54,543
Documentation should be treated as a game development task, not something that's tacked on

1014
00:57:54,863 --> 00:58:01,006
to existing tasks. It needs as much production guidance as anything that will go into the game

1015
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:09,550
itself. So that's the plan. Nine solutions to eight challenges. As I think you've noticed,

1016
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:13,152
it's a lot of hard work and involves nearly everyone on the team.

1017
00:58:13,686 --> 00:58:16,429
And I couldn't even get into topics like recruitment,

1018
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:18,971
the impact of marketing, user research,

1019
00:58:19,592 --> 00:58:22,234
all the ways that we depend on producers

1020
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,295
and build management.

1021
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:25,998
And I barely scratched the surface concerning QA.

1022
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:30,442
But I think this is a good start and can lead to discussions

1023
00:58:30,483 --> 00:58:34,386
your team can have on how your entire studio can work together

1024
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:36,048
to create great level design.

1025
00:58:36,974 --> 00:58:40,777
But GDC Talks are a studio and friendships wide effort.

1026
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:45,161
So thank all of you for taking the time to help me with this,

1027
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:48,404
especially while we're trying to get Deathloop out the door.
