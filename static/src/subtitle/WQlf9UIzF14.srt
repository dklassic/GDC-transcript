1
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:15,462
turn off everything that makes noise and reply to the survey when you get it in

2
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:17,605
the mail. Wow that's super loud.

3
00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:25,100
All right, I'm going to talk about technical direction.

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,481
Some of you may have heard that if we say that if you're

5
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,442
expecting a programming talk, you will be disappointed,

6
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:35,904
because that's not at all what we'll be talking about today.

7
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:36,604
So my name is Mike Acton.

8
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:39,566
I'm the engine director at Insomniac Games.

9
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:42,187
You can tweet me there, Mike underscore Acton.

10
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:50,189
So, what am I talking about? Why am I talking about this? I'm not going to be really saying anything new.

11
00:00:50,189 --> 00:01:03,133
I don't know of a real breakthrough in technical leadership or human communication that's happened in, say, the last 5,000 years.

12
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:08,995
So, I'll really only be talking from my experience and my perspective on the problems.

13
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:12,336
This is what I've learned and the things that I think are important.

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,981
So, what is my experience?

15
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:21,265
In this particular case I've been the Indian Director at Insomniac Games for a little more

16
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:27,970
than 10 years, which I think is long enough to have both have seen the problems, tried

17
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,194
to tackle them and seen them through to the end, which means that I've seen the results

18
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:33,335
of the things that I've done.

19
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:36,037
I've seen the mistakes that I've made, I've seen the impact of what I've done.

20
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:43,641
I've been able to see how all that stuff has either fallen apart or worked or not.

21
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:46,443
So I think that's valuable experience.

22
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:50,626
I've had to live with those decisions.

23
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:53,067
So why am I talking about this?

24
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:56,029
I think this is a very hard subject to talk about.

25
00:01:56,029 --> 00:02:00,071
I don't know, in terms of us sitting here and discussing this topic, I don't know if

26
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:04,934
we're on the same page, when we mean leadership, when we mean technical direction, when we're

27
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:05,695
talking about teams.

28
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:12,598
So it's hard to even have the sort of the same, the shared vocabulary on the subject.

29
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,960
And there's a lot of things that are, you know, that I might say that sound like cliches,

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,220
you know, super obvious.

31
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,582
You should, you should spend time with your team.

32
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:22,502
You should have one-on-ones.

33
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:26,944
Like this is all stuff I think everybody knows, but the gap between knowing something and

34
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,605
the practice of doing it every day.

35
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:30,706
is often very, very wide.

36
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:33,789
And that's partially what I'm going to be talking about,

37
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:35,651
is just that practice, that day-to-day practice.

38
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:37,852
This is the stuff that I've learned,

39
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:40,595
and sort of dealing with that gap

40
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:42,516
between the obvious and the practice

41
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:44,218
is what, really, what I want to talk about.

42
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:48,521
So, when I proposed this talk...

43
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:55,463
last year, one of the pieces of feedback that I got from the GDC committee is, often when

44
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:59,224
you talk about leadership, you're not giving a clear takeaway.

45
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:04,806
The audience wants something clear to take away from your talk.

46
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:05,446
Here you go.

47
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:10,668
Here's your easy to remember takeaway from my talk today.

48
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:11,448
Hex 999990.

49
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:14,449
Moving on.

50
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:18,510
So what does it mean to me to manage technical direction?

51
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:31,889
In an unnecessary form, we will say the five C's.

52
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:38,696
Confidence, cost, commitment, conflict, cooperation, and all those things depend on context.

53
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:44,741
So I'll be talking about what it means to me to manage each one of these things.

54
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:49,555
In terms of context, this is really what I want to talk about.

55
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:54,436
And that's, I want to start with providing an example of what I mean by each one of these

56
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:54,556
things.

57
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:55,836
What does confidence mean to me?

58
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:56,796
What does cost mean to me?

59
00:03:56,796 --> 00:04:00,657
I want to talk about the risk profile and how I evaluate that.

60
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:06,058
What about each one of these things is hard for me personally, what may be hard for you

61
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:10,319
is different, and what I focus on in terms of training each one of these things.

62
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,179
So let's get right into it.

63
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:16,470
So we'll go through the examples of each one of these,

64
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,692
what it means to me, and my personal rules of thumb.

65
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,153
Confidence.

66
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:25,815
So in terms of confidence, what I mean

67
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:28,296
is you've certainly heard this at some point in your career.

68
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:31,578
Somebody has said PM, or the producer, or somebody,

69
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:35,000
or my manager is making unrealistic schedules.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,921
And he's been really upset about that.

71
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:41,243
I want to talk about schedules and how I view them.

72
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:45,565
The only thing that schedules are for is about building confidence.

73
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:47,225
That's the purpose of a schedule.

74
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:50,607
Schedules are one tool to build confidence.

75
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:54,148
So what we need to be doing is focusing on managing confidence.

76
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:59,612
not managing a schedule. The only reason I make a schedule, the only reason that I

77
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:03,074
am asked for a schedule, if I'm dealing with a publisher or whatever,

78
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:06,236
is that somebody somewhere can have confidence that we can build the thing

79
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,717
that we say that we're going to build.

80
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:11,299
That's the purpose of the schedule. That's the tool. So

81
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:15,642
instead of focusing on the schedule, focus on confidence. Where are you not confident?

82
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:19,504
Where are you confident? What do you need to do to be confident?

83
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:23,394
One of the things that helps me to build confidence

84
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:25,156
is what I call the 80-50 rule,

85
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:28,859
which is if you are not 80% of the way done,

86
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:31,061
if you do not feel like you are 80% of the way done,

87
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:33,804
when you have used 50% of your resources,

88
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:35,225
you are way behind.

89
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:39,128
And I find this true the vast majority of the time,

90
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:46,155
and it's super helpful in terms of practice for me.

91
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:47,156
Talking about cost.

92
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,281
You almost certainly said or heard somebody say,

93
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:55,484
you can't know how long it's going to take to solve a problem

94
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:57,648
that you haven't solved before.

95
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:02,695
So we can't possibly estimate the cost of solving this.

96
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,278
I'd like to suggest that it's not the.

97
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,322
that's so much the problem, it's the value.

98
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:11,684
If you don't know how much it's worth solving,

99
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:13,925
knowing how much it's going to cost to solve

100
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:15,926
is not a meaningful number.

101
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:17,848
So you have to start here.

102
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:20,189
You want to start by sitting down with any particular problem

103
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:21,010
that you want to solve and say,

104
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,111
how much is this worth solving?

105
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:25,812
If I spent two weeks on it, would it be worth solving?

106
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:27,153
If I had to spend two years on it,

107
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,674
if I spent five years on it,

108
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:30,475
if it took me 20 man years to solve this problem,

109
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:31,376
would it still be worth it?

110
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:35,850
Whatever it is, that's the number you have to start with, or the cost is completely meaningless.

111
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:45,305
So along those lines, I feel it's important to have a cost profile for things like development

112
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,346
versus research in general.

113
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:51,927
So for me, for instance, right now at this point in time, it's about an 80-20 mix.

114
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:55,447
You have about 80% focused on development and about 20% focused on research.

115
00:06:55,447 --> 00:07:02,589
And by research, I mean problems in which you don't know what the value or cost profile

116
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:02,949
is.

117
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:05,850
You're saying, maybe this is going to be valuable.

118
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,370
I don't know.

119
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,790
I'm not going to explore this space.

120
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:16,852
And about 20% of your time mixed in with various individuals or various projects spent on those kinds of problems.

121
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:19,693
In terms of development problems,

122
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:24,554
I feel it's important to have a rule of thumb on what your expected return is. So for me that rule of thumb is 5 to 1.

123
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:27,995
If we invest a day

124
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:32,776
into a development problem, I expect five days in return.

125
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,964
And that may be five days of production time, that may be five days of that individual's

126
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:44,428
time saved through maintenance over the course of the next two years, whatever.

127
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:47,090
But a five to one return is a good rule of thumb for me.

128
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,492
Building versus buy.

129
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:53,152
This is always the perennial question.

130
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:56,293
And not just on the engine scale, but on the individual systems

131
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,014
or individual feature scale.

132
00:07:58,014 --> 00:08:01,555
How do you decide when you're going to build or when you're going to buy?

133
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:05,597
And I suggest that this is always going to come up.

134
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:07,778
You're always going to have to deal with this question.

135
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,079
So you should have a function for dealing with this question.

136
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,620
It's not going to be a surprise that at some point

137
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,260
you're going to have to answer this question.

138
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:25,185
So for me that function is about answering the question of whether or not we can create as a team a competitive advantage by knowing our context better than anyone else.

139
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:30,667
I think, you know, we look at ourselves as an engine team and as a tools team.

140
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:34,669
What we should be able to do is solve all problems better than anyone else.

141
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,349
We know what our production teams are doing.

142
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,930
We know what kind of games we're making.

143
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:41,533
our studio better than anyone else.

144
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,795
And in fact, if we cannot solve our problems

145
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:46,836
better than you could solve them

146
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:50,198
by taking something off the shelf that's generic

147
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:53,000
and doesn't have that context, we fucked up.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,442
Like that is, we should have that competitive advantage.

149
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,543
But look in terms of your studio and your problems,

150
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:59,785
like could I create a competitive advantage

151
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:02,587
by knowing my studio better or knowing our problem better?

152
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:03,628
If I can't do it, then yeah, buy it.

153
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:04,548
That's the point.

154
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:06,510
That's where the value is.

155
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:10,186
Commitment.

156
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:13,248
So what I mean by this is, starting with,

157
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:16,029
like somebody asked, can we do x, whatever x is?

158
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:20,532
And you have either said or heard somebody said,

159
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:21,793
well, it depends.

160
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:24,474
It depends on what the art's doing, animation's doing.

161
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:26,575
There's a lot of variables.

162
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:28,476
It totally depends on all this stuff.

163
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:32,099
Or you may answer, well, anything is possible, right?

164
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:38,091
And I want to point out that there are always lots of variables.

165
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:44,659
Like you will never, ever be dealing with a problem where there isn't lots of variables.

166
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,421
So that's not an excuse to hedge.

167
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:51,127
You cannot hedge in terms of, or I find that it's, it's problematic to hedge.

168
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:53,303
People don't want a probability table.

169
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,725
They don't want to say, all right, what's

170
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:57,047
the percentage chance of each one of these options happening

171
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:58,428
and sort of go through a probability cloud

172
00:09:58,428 --> 00:09:59,609
to figure out whether or not they should

173
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:00,811
read how they should be responded.

174
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:02,492
They just want to know what they can plan around.

175
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:06,056
So you give them, as a director, your best guess, right?

176
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,178
And you say, this is what's going to happen.

177
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:10,500
It's understood that there's a lot of variables.

178
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,223
You do not have to excuse that every single time you speak.

179
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:19,205
But you want to ask yourself, in terms of those probability tables,

180
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:20,887
in terms of that probability cloud,

181
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,409
what are you willing to stake your reputation and your job on?

182
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:25,631
Because every single thing that you say,

183
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:27,633
every time you say, every time I say,

184
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:31,537
where this will happen, you're staking your reputation on that thing happening.

185
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:32,457
So be confident.

186
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:35,100
To going back to schedules,

187
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,602
figuring out a way to increase and improve your confidence

188
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:38,943
is the thing that you're focusing on.

189
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:43,704
And I find it helpful to ask this question.

190
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:46,105
What would you be proud to say you did five years from now?

191
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,706
Thinking forward, these are the things that I want to do.

192
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:49,388
These are the things that are important to me.

193
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:51,649
These are the things I'm willing to stake my reputation on

194
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,011
because this is what I really want to accomplish.

195
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:57,533
And to ask the same things of your team, right?

196
00:10:58,227 --> 00:11:00,129
Also know that choices aren't forever.

197
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,932
You're going to make a decision, and that decision is going to stick.

198
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:06,255
But choices last way longer than you hope they will last.

199
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:08,698
And I think, I find that 10 years is a pretty good bet.

200
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:12,742
You make a fundamental choice, and it's going to get spread around,

201
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:15,025
and it's going to get into the code, and it's going to get into the data,

202
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,866
and it's going to, you're going to have tools or whatever,

203
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:18,728
and you're going to build stuff on top of it, and all kinds...

204
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,511
There's no way you're going to unravel, like, whatever.

205
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:25,874
You're going to live with that choice for 10 years, on average.

206
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:29,657
Some things last a little longer, some things you can rewrite and fix,

207
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:33,920
but the ramifications of choices last way longer than you hope they will.

208
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,582
But they aren't forever.

209
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:40,806
Within that 10 years, you should have a chance to fix it, if you screw it up.

210
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:41,086
Conflict.

211
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:49,880
It's hard to talk about conflict these days without talking about Uber, right?

212
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,644
So the question you can start with asking yourself is, how do you not be like Uber?

213
00:11:56,644 --> 00:12:03,409
And that's a question that I've been asking myself over the last few weeks, right?

214
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:09,432
Is you have this sort of very toxic environment, and you do not want to replicate that in your

215
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:09,973
environment.

216
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:11,113
Or at least me personally.

217
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:12,614
It's not an environment that I want to replicate.

218
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:13,915
That's not the kind of thing that I'm looking for.

219
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,910
Or, let's say on a much smaller scale,

220
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,632
you have the kind of response where

221
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:22,594
you have an individual that just doesn't want

222
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:25,376
to work with somebody else because they feel that they're just

223
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:29,380
too abrasive, or they're just not working well together.

224
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,502
So how do you deal with these kinds of situations?

225
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,163
Or how do you deal with these conflicts?

226
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:34,064
How do I deal with it?

227
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:53,210
So for me, it's important to put process in place to protect people on my team from my personal biases when they when they conflict with my values. Ultimately, my values are are what's going to be driving my team as a technical director. These are my values. This is how it's going to be, but when.

228
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:58,436
Things that I do conflict with my values.

229
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:02,459
I want some process to stop me from doing that.

230
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,083
So I put things in place like the leads are in charge of

231
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,624
telling me when this is not working.

232
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:11,707
And they can basically outvote me on things like.

233
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:15,768
hiring practices, right? When my bias is showing through and I'm saying, like,

234
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:18,669
this is not, you know, I don't think this is the right person, but they're saying,

235
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:19,129
no,

236
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:22,350
you're wrong, this is the right person. Put that process in place. Or that

237
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,551
I don't think this person is ready to be a senior engine programmer and they're

238
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,431
gonna tell me, no, you're wrong

239
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,452
because of this. And they have the opportunity to outvote me

240
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:31,352
in that process.

241
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:40,787
I also feel like in order to solve for this kind of thing, I need to represent the company

242
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:41,347
well.

243
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:44,970
In order to do that, I need to know what the company stands for.

244
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,493
I think in terms of, if we're going to sort of harken back to Uber, it's the same sort

245
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:49,653
of thing.

246
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,054
What are the values of the company?

247
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:52,575
What is it that I'm trying to represent?

248
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:58,576
And for Insomniac in particular, one of the things that's important to us is this phrase,

249
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:02,057
to be a force for good.

250
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:07,839
And so I have to think about this when I think about the process I'm putting in place for

251
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,519
my own team.

252
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,400
And in terms of the smaller conflicts, it's important for me to remind myself that if

253
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,722
there are, you know, if someone thinks there's a problem, think, there's a K, imagine there's

254
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:20,022
a K there.

255
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:21,762
If someone thinks there's a problem.

256
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:25,041
There is a problem.

257
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,642
It is a real problem.

258
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:28,742
Even if it's just a perception problem.

259
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,264
And I put just in quotes there because that's a real problem.

260
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:35,124
And it's something that has to be dealt with immediately.

261
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,525
So anytime somebody says there's a problem,

262
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:39,506
you don't dismiss it just because they're technically wrong.

263
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,947
They said, this person did this, and I feel bad about it.

264
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:45,588
That person actually didn't do that.

265
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:46,628
It doesn't matter.

266
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:48,689
It doesn't matter that the reality is different.

267
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,110
It matters that they feel a certain way

268
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,210
and that they're having trouble with that,

269
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,651
and that needs to be resolved.

270
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:57,092
A question often comes up,

271
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:58,593
and I think in terms of technical direction,

272
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,813
you need to answer this, about what is accountability?

273
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,694
You'll hear lots of people say,

274
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,715
people need to be more accountable.

275
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,515
Okay, well, what do you mean by that?

276
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:07,376
I don't know.

277
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:08,456
We should fire somebody.

278
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,313
So, as a technical director, right, you need to have an answer for what accountability

279
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,114
means to you.

280
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:21,037
And for me, it means you have to be prepared to accept the cost to fix mistakes that affect

281
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:22,458
others.

282
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:26,840
So when you make a mistake and it affects somebody else, it affects other people, the

283
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,742
studio, whatever, what's the cost you're going to pay for that?

284
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:36,066
And that may be the time I'm going to spend to unravel this and fix this and to work with

285
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:38,227
people to make sure that it doesn't happen again.

286
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:41,468
Whatever, there is a cost and I'm willing to pay it.

287
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:48,912
In terms of conflict, one of the things to watch out for constantly, I find what I call

288
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:50,053
conflict cockroaches.

289
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:54,295
These sort of insidious, stubborn, and very, very hard to kill conflicts.

290
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:59,926
when you have people just sniping at each other over time,

291
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:04,468
or people just being maybe passive aggressive over email.

292
00:16:04,468 --> 00:16:07,290
When you see these sort of small things,

293
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,491
this is the point in time when you really have to jump in

294
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:12,113
and you have to kill it at its root as fast as possible,

295
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:14,434
or it's only going to get worse

296
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:18,836
and it's only going to last even longer.

297
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:19,377
Cooperation.

298
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:28,251
So you may have heard or said, it's just not working because they're not using the tool

299
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,753
or engine or system correctly.

300
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:33,680
Or I had to rewrite it because they couldn't tell me what they wanted.

301
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,341
Stuff like that.

302
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:42,199
So, I know that people will often say surprise is good.

303
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:45,943
Like, we want to over deliver, so we want to offer a surprise.

304
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:49,426
And I'm here to say that in my experience surprise is very bad.

305
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,408
Surprise is the enemy.

306
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:55,012
You want things to be as boring as possible.

307
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:59,459
You want it to be clear, you want it to be obvious and evident what you're doing,

308
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:03,444
you want to communicate, you want people to know what's happening.

309
00:17:03,444 --> 00:17:07,970
So every day, I'm focused on trying to find a way to make something even more boring.

310
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:12,938
To find a way to eliminate surprise.

311
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:16,301
Nobody can say, I didn't know that that was happening.

312
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,162
No matter what, you cannot eliminate surprise.

313
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,983
There's always going to be things that people don't know.

314
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:22,144
There's always going to be things that didn't work out.

315
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:26,687
Communication pathways that you didn't know about, whatever.

316
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,849
But just that constant vigilance

317
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:31,911
and looking for ways to eliminate surprise,

318
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:33,412
I personally find a helpful approach.

319
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:42,074
One of the big lessons I learned, say over the last 10 years, is that about 80% of the

320
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,356
thing is selling the thing.

321
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:45,677
It's not doing the thing.

322
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:46,517
It's not working on it.

323
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:47,838
It's not building the feature.

324
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:49,379
It's selling the feature.

325
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:54,063
And by that I mean, you know, working with the team to, you know, that this is the right

326
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:58,846
thing that we should be doing, working with the production team to, you know, that they

327
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:01,288
understand how it works, that they want to use it.

328
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:08,809
that it will be built into the design, that you can design around it,

329
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:10,572
whatever the situation is.

330
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:14,197
You're going to spend most of your time selling the things

331
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:17,442
that either you're going to be doing or you've already done.

332
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,321
And I think it's important to, when you're doing this,

333
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:23,242
is to one, know what people say they want,

334
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:24,822
which is not the same thing as what they want,

335
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:27,764
but you should absolutely know what they say they want.

336
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:31,405
And you should be able to paint a picture of the future.

337
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:33,406
So you say, this is what it's gonna look like

338
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:34,807
when we can do this thing.

339
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:36,428
You should be able to articulate that,

340
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:39,649
and that helps people to see where this is going.

341
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:40,950
In terms of the super boring.

342
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:51,318
and making things super boring, I find it helpful to have a quarterly, two-yearly, and

343
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:57,524
five-yearly roadmap, at least a sketch out, for people to know where things broadly are

344
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:57,985
going.

345
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:06,200
I've also found it, in terms of cooperation, super useful for every feature to have a user

346
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,541
side champion.

347
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:13,084
So when you're building something, find somebody who's among the people that will use it that

348
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:16,566
will champion for that while you're building it, while you're, you know, you can work with

349
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:19,848
them while you're building it, and then we'll go out and help other people learn that thing.

350
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:23,550
but always have a champion for the thing that you're building.

351
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,951
And again, you can't over-deliver in this scenario, right?

352
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:28,772
You're completely eliminating surprise.

353
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:35,994
You're working with somebody who will be the primary user of the thing that you're developing,

354
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:39,716
but you're going to be developing the correct thing because you're working with them.

355
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:42,017
So let's talk about risk profile.

356
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:47,138
And this is all about how I approach trade-offs in general.

357
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:51,048
for confidence.

358
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:55,050
So the question is, okay, if you have too much confidence, what happens? If you have

359
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,331
too much confidence, you're not doing anything interesting.

360
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,051
I know how to do all the things.

361
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:04,553
All these things that we're doing, in terms of real confidence, not fake confidence, right?

362
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:07,614
I'm actually confident that we can do all these things.

363
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:11,776
So if I'm confident 100 percent, we can absolutely do this, we can do it in time, we can do it on budget,

364
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:15,437
you're not doing anything interesting, because the only way you have that level of confidence is if you've done

365
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:16,157
all this before.

366
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:21,912
And if you have too little confidence, I'm not sure that we can do any of this,

367
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:24,538
then you're not going to be getting anything done in that process.

368
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:27,123
So how do you strike that balance? How do I strike that balance?

369
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:30,907
So for me, it's about three things.

370
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:33,109
One is, like I said, having that R&D profile.

371
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,631
So how much I'm focused on things

372
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:38,393
where I know the cost value is worthwhile,

373
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:39,554
and how much am I focused on the things

374
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,175
where I just don't know what the value is.

375
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:43,937
So for me, that's about 80-20 right now.

376
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:46,098
For others, it might be a different mix.

377
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,921
The second thing is shifting things to learning opportunities.

378
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:53,244
So finding things where an individual is supremely confident

379
00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:54,404
in the thing that they're working on,

380
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:58,628
and finding somebody who would be much less confident in the same task

381
00:20:58,628 --> 00:20:59,468
and giving them that.

382
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:04,452
So shifting the confidence profile down

383
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:07,594
just by giving to somebody else who has a chance to learn that thing,

384
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:09,275
which then opens up the first person

385
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:14,099
to do something potentially more interesting or something new.

386
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:15,940
And a focus on commoditization.

387
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,443
which is to say that find the things that we're always confident that we can do

388
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:21,564
and let's get them completely off the table.

389
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:24,767
Let's stop working on them forever.

390
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,969
If we're always confident, it's essentially rote at that point,

391
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:29,850
then let's get this completely off the table.

392
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,932
Let's figure out how we can get rid of this from our profile.

393
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:38,360
So that may be, okay, we're going to buy middleware for this

394
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,441
because we never want to deal with this again.

395
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:44,564
Or it may be that we're just going to build this into a sandbox system

396
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:46,445
that doesn't have a lot of dependencies,

397
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:50,127
so that it's essentially bulletproof for the next two years or whatever,

398
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:51,548
and we never have to look at it.

399
00:21:51,548 --> 00:21:52,348
Whatever the plan is.

400
00:21:52,348 --> 00:21:52,908
What's the cost-risk profile?

401
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:00,929
So in terms of, you know, we're spending too much money,

402
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:03,170
you're, well, obviously losing money.

403
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,951
You're not spending enough money,

404
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:07,252
you're losing an opportunity to make things better.

405
00:22:07,252 --> 00:22:09,433
Now, granted, I'm kind of making up the part

406
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:12,954
where I have more money than I know how to spend.

407
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:16,295
That's not an experience that I've ever actually had,

408
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:17,856
but I assumed when I was making these

409
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,477
that somebody, maybe somewhere, had had that experience.

410
00:22:22,478 --> 00:22:24,680
So in terms of balancing cost,

411
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,203
what are the things that I find most useful?

412
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:29,925
One is triage.

413
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:32,107
And that's focused on everything on triage.

414
00:22:32,107 --> 00:22:33,908
Everything that comes across my desk,

415
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:36,070
everything that comes on the team that I'm aware of,

416
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,533
everything goes through a triage process.

417
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:40,554
Which is to look at it and decide,

418
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:42,076
first of all, is this worth solving at all?

419
00:22:43,357 --> 00:22:44,918
And that's often not true, right?

420
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:47,479
It's often true that you don't need to solve a problem.

421
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:51,082
Somebody may say, look, this is sort of annoying.

422
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:53,304
If I have to go through these three clicks,

423
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,485
let's say a tool, I have to go through these three clicks

424
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:57,326
and it would be really great if I could only do two, okay?

425
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:59,348
And we say, great.

426
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:02,337
you do that process once a week,

427
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:07,999
and you and three other people do that process once a week,

428
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:13,041
we could save you approximately two seconds.

429
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:13,641
And so if we add that up.

430
00:23:14,474 --> 00:23:17,516
And over the course of the next five years,

431
00:23:17,516 --> 00:23:19,717
we could save five minutes.

432
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:21,257
So unless we can make that bug,

433
00:23:21,257 --> 00:23:23,719
unless we can solve that issue in less than one minute,

434
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,760
which seems super unlikely,

435
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,360
we're just not going to do it, right?

436
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,222
That's a sort of process of thinking through things

437
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:31,622
when we do triage.

438
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:33,483
Or it may be just how much it's worth

439
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:34,704
comparatively to other things, right?

440
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,385
We have all these things that are higher value,

441
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:39,046
we're gonna, this is gonna fall off the,

442
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:40,026
this is gonna fall to the floor.

443
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:43,631
And this is harder, I think, than people think.

444
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,075
The ability to say, no, we're not going to do this

445
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:49,900
because we have other things that are more valuable is hard.

446
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,124
It's hard to say and it's hard to hear.

447
00:23:52,124 --> 00:23:55,348
But it's absolutely necessary

448
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:56,610
if you want to get the right stuff done.

449
00:23:57,931 --> 00:24:07,194
Another high value item I find, process I find in balancing cost is in measuring the user experience.

450
00:24:07,194 --> 00:24:10,756
So measure workflows, measure how long people spend doing things, you know,

451
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:17,819
to give you a sense of what the value and cost of various things in production are,

452
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:19,320
what's worth solving.

453
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:25,220
It's also super valuable for me in terms of just, as I mentioned before, ruthless editing.

454
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,842
And sort of saying, this is not going to happen.

455
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:28,802
We need to get rid of this.

456
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,163
This needs to be off the table.

457
00:24:30,163 --> 00:24:33,866
We need to, you know, we need, or we absolutely do need to do this.

458
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:36,047
And as I said, that's really hard, right?

459
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:37,648
People have a hard time hearing that.

460
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:40,390
And how to give that feedback to people to say,

461
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:45,152
No, we're not going to fix the feature that you are really excited about because to be

462
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:49,253
honest whenever somebody submits an issue, it's important to them, right?

463
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:52,494
It's always important to them or they wouldn't have submitted it in the first place.

464
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:57,896
And so they do want it solved and they're committed, you know, they have an investment

465
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,877
at this point in that problem.

466
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:04,878
So you don't want to dismiss it out of hand and you don't want them to feel like, you

467
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,959
know, they wasted their effort in terms of submitting an issue.

468
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:18,175
So you do need to figure out how to communicate that to them well, but at the same time it

469
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:20,978
does need to be cut.

470
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:21,538
Commitment.

471
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:29,085
So if you overcommit, right, you're likely to burn yourself out.

472
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:34,750
Or if you're not successful in your overcommitment, you're just going to be a long-term failure

473
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,232
in whatever it is that you're trying to do.

474
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,193
If you under commit, no one can work with you, right?

475
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:40,994
Because they don't know what you're going to do.

476
00:25:40,994 --> 00:25:41,975
You're not committing to anything.

477
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:43,576
They have no idea how to work with you.

478
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:46,477
Or they're going to fill the gap of the things

479
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:47,938
that you're not committing to with their own

480
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:48,818
implicit promises.

481
00:25:48,818 --> 00:25:50,399
They're going to say, since you didn't say anything,

482
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:52,120
I'm just going to assume you're going to do all the things

483
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,461
that I think you, you know, that you're going to do.

484
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:58,163
Which is often dangerous assumption, right?

485
00:25:58,853 --> 00:26:01,295
So how do I balance these two things?

486
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:03,437
One, for me, as much as possible,

487
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,759
it's about steady pressure on the team.

488
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,822
Constant, steady pressure, not waves of pressure.

489
00:26:09,822 --> 00:26:12,284
And that comes back down to that 80-50 rule, right?

490
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:14,025
Just sort of constantly reevaluating things.

491
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:15,106
Are we at the right stage?

492
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,087
Are we spending enough time?

493
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:18,889
Are we where we think we should be?

494
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:25,087
Letting the team drive their commitments,

495
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:27,188
so this is about every individual on the team

496
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:28,929
saying what it is that you want to commit to,

497
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:31,750
what it is that you feel that you can commit to,

498
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,352
and having that be driven and not be given to the team.

499
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:38,233
But still going through that process

500
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:40,875
and reviewing all those commitments

501
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:43,296
and ultimately vetoing them if they don't work

502
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:45,477
for either our direction or what's,

503
00:26:45,477 --> 00:26:46,898
you know, either that our direction

504
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:49,099
or our cost value ratio or whatever.

505
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:51,817
but having all those always be driven up on the team.

506
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:57,346
And the third thing that I find most helpful is always, from my point of view, providing

507
00:26:57,346 --> 00:27:02,411
problem and the value to solving that problem to the team, and never just the solution.

508
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:03,632
Never just do this task.

509
00:27:03,632 --> 00:27:07,395
But here's the problem that we want to solve, and here's the value for solving it, so it's

510
00:27:07,395 --> 00:27:10,638
worth solving it if we can solve it in less than two weeks.

511
00:27:10,638 --> 00:27:13,880
It's worth solving it if we can solve it in less than a month.

512
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,823
It's not worth solving it if it takes it longer than that.

513
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:18,725
So if you can come up with a solution in that space, great.

514
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:20,206
If you can't, we're going to put it aside.

515
00:27:22,816 --> 00:27:23,877
Conflict.

516
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:24,537
So, too much conflict, right?

517
00:27:24,537 --> 00:27:25,177
You have a toxic environment.

518
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:32,242
Nobody can work with each other, everybody hates each other.

519
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:35,324
Not enough conflict, you have no creative energy

520
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:37,665
and no critical review.

521
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:40,907
Everybody trying to be super nice to each other,

522
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:43,229
walking on eggshells, and you can't,

523
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,150
you're not actually getting any critical review.

524
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,051
And the first time you hear about a problem

525
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:49,093
is probably going to be on Neo Gas

526
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:51,474
somewhere after you ship the game.

527
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,852
So how do I try to balance these two?

528
00:27:54,852 --> 00:27:58,974
One, I try to survey the team constantly,

529
00:27:58,974 --> 00:28:00,715
as often as I possibly can.

530
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:01,976
How do you know, what do you think?

531
00:28:01,976 --> 00:28:02,937
How are you feeling?

532
00:28:02,937 --> 00:28:05,178
What are the issues that you're dealing with?

533
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:07,559
That's both in literal surveys,

534
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,240
so emails and things like that,

535
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,181
and in one-on-ones.

536
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:13,563
Just keep constantly questioning

537
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:14,743
what the environment is like

538
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:16,064
and what you're dealing with.

539
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:19,546
The second thing that I find helpful

540
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:23,077
is intra-team, so inside of our team,

541
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,219
trying to get the team comfortable as much as possible

542
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:26,980
with reviewing each other inside the team.

543
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,363
So that may be, I mean, on smaller groups,

544
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:32,524
dealing with change lists on smaller groups

545
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:34,526
and talking about their designs

546
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:35,567
and being super comfortable

547
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,668
and being honest about those things.

548
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:39,029
Or maybe in a broader sense,

549
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:41,191
and sort of the whole core team,

550
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:43,173
is us standing up once a week

551
00:28:43,173 --> 00:28:45,514
and doing a change list review in front of the whole team

552
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:47,576
and having people be able to hear

553
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:49,117
and talk about other people's work.

554
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:55,020
every week. A third thing that I think is critical, at least for our team,

555
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,402
is having a totally unfiltered feedback

556
00:28:58,402 --> 00:29:02,164
firehose from the whole studio. This is what everybody thinks of everything that

557
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:03,825
we're doing.

558
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,407
That's not always good, right? I'll tell you right now.

559
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:10,169
In reality, there's stuff that people really don't like about

560
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:14,932
the choices we make and about the things that we do and their frustrations

561
00:29:14,932 --> 00:29:17,093
and maybe bugs in the tools or whatever.

562
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:20,894
But that fire hose is totally unfiltered.

563
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:25,236
Everybody can see it and everybody can get comfortable

564
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:28,457
with the fact that in fact we want all that feedback.

565
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:31,278
We want to know what people feel

566
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:33,038
and what they're thinking.

567
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,719
And that's super helpful for us as a team.

568
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,360
And I think it helps people relate

569
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,020
to the rest of the production.

570
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,400
Cooperation.

571
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,221
Too much cooperation.

572
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:46,281
uh... and what you know you and it was on the committee

573
00:29:46,281 --> 00:29:46,381
uh...

574
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:48,684
and i know some people think that's probably a good thing but

575
00:29:48,684 --> 00:29:50,346
i'm not a mechanic

576
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:55,352
uh... not enough cooperation and you have a bunch of pieces that

577
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:58,836
don't fits together right uh... you have a bunch of a billion independent things

578
00:29:58,836 --> 00:30:00,258
they don't fit they're not working together

579
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:05,882
So how do I try to balance these things?

580
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:08,462
One is the practice of leadership.

581
00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:10,623
And I think that's not just sort of the,

582
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:11,663
in terms of technical direction, right,

583
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:13,964
it's not just the lead of the team,

584
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:15,184
but it's everyone on the team.

585
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:18,125
Everyone on the team, in my opinion, needs to be a leader.

586
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,525
You need to be leading something.

587
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:22,205
So focusing on that as a practice.

588
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:23,666
What is it that you think is important?

589
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,326
What is it that you are, you know,

590
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:28,387
being the champion of on our team?

591
00:30:28,387 --> 00:30:29,587
From the most junior programmer

592
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:30,607
to the most senior programmer,

593
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:32,308
everyone needs to be leading something.

594
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:39,470
So, from my point of view, for every feature we have both a champion for and a champion

595
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,530
of every feature.

596
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:44,711
Somebody on our team really wants to do this and they found somebody in production who

597
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:46,192
really wants it, ideally.

598
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:51,413
And they can help work together to see it through all the way to the end into use.

599
00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:00,034
In terms of cooperation, as much as possible, and while again this may seem super obvious,

600
00:31:00,034 --> 00:31:03,217
I try to work backward from the production schedule.

601
00:31:03,217 --> 00:31:05,879
And that may not just mean our game schedule, right?

602
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:10,503
But it does, often. I look at the game and say, what does the game want to accomplish when,

603
00:31:10,503 --> 00:31:14,926
and so how can we provide the right thing for the game at the appropriate time?

604
00:31:14,926 --> 00:31:20,070
So the better the schedule out the game is, the better that I can schedule.

605
00:31:20,997 --> 00:31:23,879
And it's often true that those things change over time, so I doubt.

606
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:28,061
But it's also other production schedules, so looking at,

607
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:31,062
say, hardware releases and new consoles and whatever,

608
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:34,584
there's always some sort of synchronization points that you need to be working from.

609
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:38,886
And just paying attention to those things in the future, over the next year,

610
00:31:38,886 --> 00:31:42,428
the next two years, the next five years, what are these points that are going to happen

611
00:31:42,428 --> 00:31:46,330
that I need to deal with and start working backward from them.

612
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,527
Now I'm going to talk about the things that are hard for me in this spectrum.

613
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:57,958
And so what are my weaknesses in each one of these areas and how do I try to shore them

614
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:57,998
up?

615
00:31:59,706 --> 00:32:05,529
So, in terms of being confident about the production and what we're doing, for me,

616
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:10,072
the thing that's hardest is the scale of communication.

617
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:15,755
And by that I mean, when you look across the studio, I want every single person in the

618
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:17,757
studio to have confidence in what we're doing.

619
00:32:17,757 --> 00:32:21,719
To be able to say, yes, I believe that they can get done what they say they can get done.

620
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:26,166
But the problem with that is that every single person,

621
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:28,747
how to give that person confidence

622
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,867
is unique to every single person.

623
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:34,168
This one animator with this much experience

624
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:36,369
with these particular systems wants

625
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:39,469
to have different information than this environment artist

626
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:41,050
over here.

627
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,790
And so figuring out how to scale communication appropriately

628
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,831
and how to get the individuals confident

629
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,552
is hard for me personally.

630
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:48,792
So what do I do?

631
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:57,447
So the one thing that I do is make sure that the leads on my team know the messaging.

632
00:32:57,447 --> 00:33:01,312
These are the things that I think are important for people to know.

633
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,779
So that when they're out and about and they're talking to various teams that they can communicate

634
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:06,380
those things.

635
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:10,836
And they often do that better than I do.

636
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:13,877
So having people prepared to give the same message

637
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:16,699
that I would give, but in a way that's better

638
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,439
than I might give it, helps me to,

639
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:20,660
so delegation, basically, helps me to shore up

640
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,781
some of my weaknesses there.

641
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:24,082
It's also, I found, in practice,

642
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:25,763
that it's way easier for people to react.

643
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:30,244
So if I say, you know, should we talk about this design now?

644
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:33,785
People are going to say, yeah, I'm really busy, I can't really talk about the design

645
00:33:33,785 --> 00:33:35,145
now.

646
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:35,765
Maybe next week.

647
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,086
And the next week comes along and I say, should we talk about this design now?

648
00:33:38,086 --> 00:33:41,087
No, look, I've got a demo, I've got these things, I can't really talk about the design

649
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:41,407
now.

650
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:42,447
Maybe next week, right?

651
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:42,807
That happens.

652
00:33:42,807 --> 00:33:44,708
And people are really busy.

653
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,888
But if I say, here's the design.

654
00:33:47,822 --> 00:33:49,944
Or, we're going to do X. This is what we're going to do.

655
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,306
I say that, people all of a sudden are like,

656
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:53,206
no, you can't do X.

657
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:54,647
I got this, I'm going to stop right now,

658
00:33:54,647 --> 00:33:55,788
we're going to talk about this, right?

659
00:33:55,788 --> 00:33:59,491
So I found that if you make commitments loud and early,

660
00:33:59,491 --> 00:34:03,154
people are much more willing to talk about those things

661
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:04,855
because they'll see clearly, concretely,

662
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:06,016
what it is that affects them.

663
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:09,599
So it's not a trick as much as it is the reality, right?

664
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,860
The reality of the situation.

665
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,861
You want to be loud and you want to be early

666
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:14,743
so people have the chance to react.

667
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:16,984
And just all the one-on-ones.

668
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:21,326
So talking to everyone on my team as much as possible

669
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:24,408
to share the messages of what I think is important.

670
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:25,509
But also across other teams.

671
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:28,791
I spend time on one-on-one with other people in other departments

672
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:32,173
to try to spread the individual messages as much as I possibly can.

673
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:35,524
What's hard for me in terms of cost?

674
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:40,986
For me, the hardest thing are subjective measures of value.

675
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:45,088
How much is one millisecond of time worth in the game?

676
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:49,430
If we spent a week to reduce GPU by one millisecond,

677
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,531
would that be worth it?

678
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:53,992
If we spent five weeks to do it, if we spent six months doing

679
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:54,673
it, would it be worth it?

680
00:34:54,673 --> 00:34:57,814
Figuring out what that number is,

681
00:34:57,814 --> 00:35:00,235
in terms of how much is a millisecond worth,

682
00:35:00,235 --> 00:35:01,196
is really hard.

683
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:03,638
for me personally.

684
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:06,640
And in terms of individual frustration, right,

685
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,761
I'm just frustrated.

686
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:12,245
I just, you know, I'm frustrated by this extra third click

687
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:14,246
that I have to do for no good reason, right?

688
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,869
It doesn't cost us anything really in terms of workflow,

689
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:18,210
but I'm just frustrated by it.

690
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,472
So how much is that frustration really worth solving for?

691
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:24,404
So how do I battle this?

692
00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:26,606
Personally, I start with, again, lots of surveys.

693
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:28,347
Always asking questions.

694
00:35:28,347 --> 00:35:31,169
Send these out to production, send these out to our team.

695
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:34,552
Just keep constantly querying people

696
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:36,974
about how they feel about things.

697
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:39,756
And then I can sort of try to turn a subjective measure

698
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:41,757
into an objective measure.

699
00:35:41,757 --> 00:35:44,199
Well, the general feeling has been this for a while,

700
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,320
but now it's getting worse.

701
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,062
So we should probably do something about that.

702
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:52,166
But I think the broadest approaches that I have for this

703
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:55,049
are one is just to block out time and say,

704
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:57,431
here's a bunch of time we have for low-hanging fruit.

705
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:58,832
This is like, here's, you know,

706
00:35:58,832 --> 00:36:01,334
we're gonna spend two weeks on this stuff

707
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:03,215
that was essentially low-value,

708
00:36:03,215 --> 00:36:05,157
but is super, super frustrating for people.

709
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:07,679
So how are we gonna get this stuff off the table?

710
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,802
And a similar block of time for things like optimization.

711
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,883
Like, let's just make it as fast as we can

712
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:15,946
in the next two weeks, or whatever.

713
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:19,779
Commitment.

714
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:21,420
What's hard for me in terms of commitment?

715
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,065
I think we would all agree that autonomy is important.

716
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,586
It's important for people on the team,

717
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:32,109
your whole team, to be as autonomous as possible.

718
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:37,548
The problem is you have people, you almost certainly have people who will burn themselves

719
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:41,010
out given the opportunity.

720
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,034
And you will have people that will probably over commit given the opportunity.

721
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:47,956
They'll say, oh, well, you know, somebody will ask them, can you do this thing?

722
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,718
They'll say, yeah, that's probably easy.

723
00:36:49,718 --> 00:36:51,679
We can probably do that.

724
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,383
So you have to, I feel, I find that you do have to manage that autonomy.

725
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:01,908
So for me, the things that, you know, I find that difficult,

726
00:37:01,908 --> 00:37:06,452
and the things that I do to balance that are,

727
00:37:06,452 --> 00:37:09,574
one, I strongly encourage time off as much as possible.

728
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,976
So try to get people to take vacations.

729
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:14,358
That's hard, that's often harder than you would think.

730
00:37:15,663 --> 00:37:17,686
But you just keep encouraging people.

731
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:19,168
It's your time.

732
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:23,494
Okay, I'm going to take a second to rant here, real quick.

733
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:31,326
On our software that we use, which I won't call it by name, for managing vacation requests,

734
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:35,347
One of the things that it has are exactly that.

735
00:37:35,347 --> 00:37:38,007
It says vacation requests, right?

736
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:40,168
That language pisses me off.

737
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:42,908
Because it's not requesting, it's not a request.

738
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,589
It's your time, it's already your time.

739
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:46,689
You already earned it, it's in your pile.

740
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:50,630
You're informing me that you're going to take a vacation.

741
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,350
I assume that you are going to handle all,

742
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,251
that you're a professional, you're an adult,

743
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:55,571
you're gonna handle all the issues

744
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:56,691
related to not being here.

745
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,492
You're gonna make sure things are.

746
00:37:57,972 --> 00:38:00,912
done, that people know that you're not going to be there, we can talk about whether or

747
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:04,533
not this is a good time, whatever, but you're not requesting it, it's already yours.

748
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,074
So just the language behind that is super annoying.

749
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:12,235
Anyway, that had nothing to do with anything.

750
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:17,817
We don't want to, it's important in the terms, I don't want heroism on the team.

751
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:22,318
I don't want the guy going in at the last minute and spending all the hours trying to

752
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:23,918
get this gold disc out the door.

753
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:27,219
That's exactly the process that I do not want on the team.

754
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:29,280
Again, back to surprise.

755
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,861
That's a surprising result and I would like things to be as boring as possible.

756
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:37,422
And every time that that happens, it represents a mistake for our team.

757
00:38:37,422 --> 00:38:39,523
It represents something that went horribly wrong.

758
00:38:39,523 --> 00:38:44,744
So every time that this happens, that's how it has to be represented.

759
00:38:44,744 --> 00:38:48,625
I have to be talking about the team, what went horribly wrong that you had to be doing

760
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,146
this?

761
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:52,446
And represent it as a problem to be solved.

762
00:38:52,446 --> 00:38:52,906
It's not...

763
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:57,694
Look how, you know, thank you for doing, well, yes, thank you, but it's not look how great

764
00:38:57,694 --> 00:38:58,035
a job you did.

765
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:01,898
It's something went horribly wrong and you were forced to do such a great job in order

766
00:39:01,898 --> 00:39:03,359
to solve for it.

767
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,362
So the language around this is really important.

768
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:12,792
And, you know, talking to people about, constantly talking to people about examples of implied promises.

769
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:15,533
It's not always obvious to people when they imply something.

770
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:21,876
And when they say something like, oh, that might be easy, not realizing that as soon as you say that,

771
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:23,877
somebody's going to assume that you're going to do it.

772
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:29,921
And, or you say, yeah, you know, we could probably do that.

773
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:32,782
It's the same as saying, I absolutely will do that, and I will do it right now,

774
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:36,224
and it'll be on your plate by tomorrow, you know, on your desk by tomorrow, whatever.

775
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:41,209
So, just constantly looking at what people are saying and letting them know when they

776
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:44,473
are in fact implying things that they may not have realized.

777
00:39:44,473 --> 00:39:48,457
What's hard for me in terms of conflict?

778
00:39:48,985 --> 00:39:53,788
uh... i it's fair for me to say that i'm not naturally a warm person

779
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:56,790
uh... my first my instinct

780
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:01,153
which my daughter will happily tell you my first instinct is to say suck it up

781
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:01,193
uh...

782
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:05,536
i absolutely know that my first instinct

783
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,757
is almost always wrong

784
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:10,739
uh... so this is a battle that i personally have to fight constantly

785
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:11,420
so what do i do?

786
00:40:12,805 --> 00:40:14,888
One, I think it's just time.

787
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:16,870
It's time with the team, it's time with individuals,

788
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,234
it's time for them to know and build that trust

789
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:23,118
that they believe that I actually do care.

790
00:40:23,118 --> 00:40:25,040
Ultimately, over time, people hopefully see

791
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,082
that I do actually care.

792
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:29,065
And I actually do wanna make things better

793
00:40:29,065 --> 00:40:30,686
and wanna make a difference to them personally.

794
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:40,687
And I stop myself from saying anything before I ask if that person is looking for suggestions or advice, right?

795
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:44,410
Sometimes people just want to rant, sometimes people just want to bitch, get stuff off their chest.

796
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:48,970
Is there any, you know, are you looking for anything from me in this, right?

797
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,331
Before I say anything.

798
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:52,171
Certainly before I say, suck it up.

799
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:53,772
Um...

800
00:40:53,772 --> 00:40:58,614
And a reminder both to myself and to other people that perception problems are real problems.

801
00:40:58,614 --> 00:41:02,136
If somebody feels like this is a problem, it is in fact a real problem.

802
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:08,378
And that constant reminder to me that that is true is helpful.

803
00:41:08,378 --> 00:41:09,038
Cooperation.

804
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:18,958
It's true, I think, in our studio and probably true in most studios that the next thing is

805
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,059
always the most important thing ever.

806
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:24,101
This is the most important demo we have ever done ever.

807
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:26,203
It's always true.

808
00:41:26,203 --> 00:41:28,204
That's true by necessity, right?

809
00:41:28,204 --> 00:41:28,984
And it should be true.

810
00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:29,705
It should be.

811
00:41:29,705 --> 00:41:31,186
Hopefully you're not saying...

812
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:34,509
Yeah, whatever we did two years ago, that was the most important thing.

813
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:37,752
This is way less valuable than whatever we were doing two years ago.

814
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:39,114
Like, that's kind of dumb.

815
00:41:39,114 --> 00:41:40,975
Hopefully, it's always ratcheting up.

816
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:43,578
It's always the most important thing, right?

817
00:41:43,578 --> 00:41:45,139
But you can't crank it beyond 11.

818
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:47,261
Like, you're always at 11.

819
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:50,244
That's not a meaningful statement, right?

820
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:54,078
So in terms of dealing with that timing,

821
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,100
and dealing with that issue,

822
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,642
for me I find best practices personally

823
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:00,403
is one to stay out of the way

824
00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:04,206
of whatever the next thing is as much as possible.

825
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:05,887
So especially in our particular case,

826
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:07,188
in terms of an engine team,

827
00:42:07,188 --> 00:42:10,371
like prep people, get whatever they need there,

828
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:12,372
there in front of them so they have a chance

829
00:42:12,372 --> 00:42:14,234
to solve those problems that they wanna solve,

830
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:16,015
but don't get in the way.

831
00:42:16,015 --> 00:42:17,836
People are under a lot of pressure

832
00:42:17,836 --> 00:42:19,057
to do whatever it is that they're trying,

833
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:20,078
whatever the next big thing is.

834
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:22,862
Don't make it harder.

835
00:42:22,862 --> 00:42:28,109
I also find it super, super helpful to build reference targets. Again, I know it seems really obvious,

836
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:33,697
but it's easy to forget. Not just art reference targets either, but also things like audio reference targets.

837
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:37,342
What do you want this to sound like? Before we begin building this,

838
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:39,775
Let me see what you want this to sound like.

839
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:40,556
So we can all hear it,

840
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:42,016
and we can see how this is supposed to react.

841
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:44,917
Always, as much as possible, build reference targets.

842
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:50,339
And to having dedicated resources to immediate concerns.

843
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:53,120
So resources that are absolutely dedicated to

844
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,721
whatever it is that's happening right now,

845
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:58,422
this minute, this issue, somebody's gonna jump on that.

846
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:01,103
And not spread that across the whole team.

847
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:02,503
Training.

848
00:43:06,675 --> 00:43:09,575
So what do I want to make sure the team knows

849
00:43:09,575 --> 00:43:11,176
in all these individual areas?

850
00:43:11,176 --> 00:43:14,597
So in terms of confidence,

851
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:17,397
the thing that I think is most important

852
00:43:17,397 --> 00:43:20,338
for my team to know is how to pitch.

853
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:23,178
Again, I think that 80% of the thing is selling the thing.

854
00:43:23,178 --> 00:43:28,040
So knowing how to pitch an idea is super, super important.

855
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,080
So I can answer the question of what do I personally

856
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,901
need to know in order to be most confident?

857
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:38,523
And this is the thing that I want to teach the team.

858
00:43:38,523 --> 00:43:41,444
And I think these things should be included in any pitch.

859
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:43,885
You want to paint a picture of where it is that you're trying to go.

860
00:43:43,885 --> 00:43:46,547
I want to be able to imagine that future.

861
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:48,568
You want to identify the cost, the value.

862
00:43:48,568 --> 00:43:53,410
You want to identify, if it's there, whatever the opportunities to learn are.

863
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:56,731
We're doing this partially because we will learn these other things.

864
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,032
Super, super importantly, what's the strategy for transition?

865
00:44:01,032 --> 00:44:02,934
If you're pitching a change,

866
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,715
I want to do this thing that we're, you know,

867
00:44:04,715 --> 00:44:06,096
differently from what I'm doing now.

868
00:44:06,096 --> 00:44:09,158
Great. How are we going to get from where we are now to that?

869
00:44:09,158 --> 00:44:11,559
And often that cost is much bigger than the

870
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,841
doing the thing in the first place

871
00:44:13,841 --> 00:44:14,902
or whatever you're doing now.

872
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,383
That transition is a super expensive and lengthy process,

873
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:19,124
often, that's an important part of the pitch.

874
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:19,244
Cost.

875
00:44:19,244 --> 00:44:20,385
What do I want to train the team?

876
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:26,868
in terms of cost.

877
00:44:26,868 --> 00:44:28,989
Dealing with cost value metrics,

878
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:31,710
even if this is at a very high level

879
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:36,033
back of the napkin kind of approach,

880
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:38,934
you should be able to articulate

881
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:41,676
what the return on investment is

882
00:44:41,676 --> 00:44:45,158
for whatever it is that you're proposing.

883
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:48,408
And that may be in general high-level terms,

884
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:50,068
but the things that you should be able to point out

885
00:44:50,068 --> 00:44:51,169
are the development cost,

886
00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:52,349
this is how long it's gonna take us to do,

887
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:54,770
the maintenance cost, this is how much maintenance

888
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,191
I think this will take over time,

889
00:44:57,191 --> 00:45:00,433
the cost of entry, we're just doing this

890
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:04,194
because it's the bar, like we need to hit this bar.

891
00:45:04,194 --> 00:45:07,536
And this is most often true in terms of, say, graphics

892
00:45:07,536 --> 00:45:09,056
or something like that, we just need to hit this bar.

893
00:45:09,717 --> 00:45:12,819
And then we'll talk about what's above and beyond that bar.

894
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:16,761
Efficiency return, so again I'm doing a feature here

895
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:20,143
and I'm trying to make production more efficient,

896
00:45:20,143 --> 00:45:22,645
so what's my return there?

897
00:45:22,645 --> 00:45:24,886
Player value, often we're talking about,

898
00:45:24,886 --> 00:45:26,347
less often, but it still comes up,

899
00:45:26,347 --> 00:45:28,588
that we're talking about this is just going to be cool

900
00:45:28,588 --> 00:45:30,589
for the player.

901
00:45:30,589 --> 00:45:32,911
So what's that value, can we identify it?

902
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:35,652
And learning value for the team, as I mentioned.

903
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:38,094
We're doing this partially because we're gonna be able

904
00:45:38,094 --> 00:45:39,355
to learn about this other thing.

905
00:45:41,262 --> 00:45:43,943
commitment.

906
00:45:43,943 --> 00:45:50,124
So there's this very webby kind of appropriate for San Francisco phrase, right?

907
00:45:50,124 --> 00:45:55,925
Minimum viable product, which is not a phrase we use internally to the team.

908
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:58,666
But conceptually I think that we have this kind of thing.

909
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:04,747
Which is just to be clear, concretely, on what you're actually providing.

910
00:46:04,747 --> 00:46:05,527
Minimally, right?

911
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:06,947
What is it that you're promising?

912
00:46:07,527 --> 00:46:12,028
Do you want to be able to say concretely, you will be able to do this, right?

913
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:14,749
And that's what you're promising will happen.

914
00:46:14,749 --> 00:46:20,010
You want to separate those sort of would-be-nice things from the absolute guarantees that you're

915
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,490
trying to make as part of the pitch.

916
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,011
So these things should be part of your commitment, right?

917
00:46:25,011 --> 00:46:28,971
You want to propose, say clearly what those concrete changes are.

918
00:46:28,971 --> 00:46:32,092
What are you going to be able to do that you can't do now?

919
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:32,932
State those clearly.

920
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:36,855
state the problem and the part of the problem that you've solved.

921
00:46:36,855 --> 00:46:38,535
This is the problem that I'm trying to solve,

922
00:46:38,535 --> 00:46:40,896
this is the part of that problem that I've solved.

923
00:46:40,896 --> 00:46:43,336
But also be super, super clear about what you're not solved,

924
00:46:43,336 --> 00:46:44,377
what you haven't provided.

925
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:47,578
I haven't solved this part of the problem yet, we'll get to that.

926
00:46:47,578 --> 00:46:49,418
Or I'm not providing this feature X, Y, and Z,

927
00:46:49,418 --> 00:46:51,018
we'll get to that later, or not.

928
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:54,519
But if you don't state clearly what you're not providing,

929
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:58,160
people often infer that it's going to be there.

930
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,861
So it's as important to say what you're not providing

931
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:03,242
as it is stating what you are.

932
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,064
Conflict. For me, the most important part in terms of training related to conflict is

933
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:18,611
setting clear expectations in terms of values. And one of the things that comes up, especially

934
00:47:18,611 --> 00:47:25,737
when this hits home for somebody individually, is, you know, somebody might say, I don't

935
00:47:25,737 --> 00:47:30,381
want to change my personality. Right? I'm just like that. I don't want to change my

936
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,002
personality. But it's.

937
00:47:32,823 --> 00:47:35,385
For me, it's not about changing your personality, right?

938
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:36,426
That's not the issue here.

939
00:47:36,426 --> 00:47:38,367
Nobody's asking anyone to change their personality.

940
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:42,651
But it's about the realization that you need to be effective.

941
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,273
And to be effective, you need to communicate well.

942
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:47,995
And you need to communicate in a way that's

943
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:49,236
effective for each person.

944
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:51,237
But it's also about what's right.

945
00:47:51,237 --> 00:47:53,499
And the fact is, you should say, well,

946
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:54,600
who's to say what's right?

947
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,921
I'm to say what's right.

948
00:47:55,981 --> 00:48:01,008
that ultimately, right, my values are driving what this team is,

949
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:04,794
and I am saying that these are the values that are important to us.

950
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:07,277
So, yeah, fair or not, I do get to say what's right,

951
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:10,061
and these are the values that are important to me.

952
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:16,206
And I think that the time for, say, corporate neutrality is over.

953
00:48:16,206 --> 00:48:18,188
We are ultimately taking sides.

954
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:22,310
We're saying these are the things that are important to us as a company,

955
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,872
these are the things that are important to us as teams,

956
00:48:24,872 --> 00:48:29,015
and those values help to drive the people that we work with,

957
00:48:29,015 --> 00:48:30,996
it helps to drive the things that we do.

958
00:48:30,996 --> 00:48:33,078
Stating those values super clearly and making sure that

959
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:35,499
everybody's on the same page with them is important.

960
00:48:38,703 --> 00:48:41,644
things that, you know, that should be part of setting clear values.

961
00:48:41,644 --> 00:48:47,246
One, what's being able to say, what do you believe? These are the things that I believe.

962
00:48:47,246 --> 00:48:49,687
I often find it useful to connect to

963
00:48:49,687 --> 00:48:52,808
news and current events. This is what's happening. Here's an example of what I'm

964
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:53,688
talking about.

965
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:57,349
So that people can just over time get a sense

966
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:01,791
of those values. Because just saying something like people are important,

967
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:05,652
connecting that to the reality, what you mean to it, is very difficult.

968
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:13,260
Constantly setting part of the sort of review process and the one-on-one process that, you know,

969
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,805
you're comparing those values and your expectations and how people, you know,

970
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:21,529
how people met those expectations over time as part of your review process

971
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:23,552
and part of your one-on-one process is important.

972
00:49:25,134 --> 00:49:29,320
And whenever there is a conflict, small or large,

973
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,865
knowing who will take action next is an important part of the process.

974
00:49:32,865 --> 00:49:35,789
Immediately, who will do something about this?

975
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:38,492
Cooperation.

976
00:49:40,646 --> 00:49:46,411
For me, the thing that I want to teach most to the team about cooperation is just being

977
00:49:46,411 --> 00:49:51,455
able to champion a solution, which means being willing to say that I'm going to lead in this

978
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:57,239
area, being willing to say that I want to make this happen and follow through from end

979
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:57,419
to end.

980
00:49:57,419 --> 00:50:02,443
And that's just not once the feature's out, you're out, but working with production, working

981
00:50:02,443 --> 00:50:06,026
with the game, making sure that the thing that you imagine, the future that you imagined

982
00:50:06,026 --> 00:50:07,347
would happen, happens.

983
00:50:07,907 --> 00:50:13,451
And that means you keep babysitting this thing as long as it takes to see that future happen.

984
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:20,295
And I find it helpful practice to give for everyone, including myself, to find other

985
00:50:20,295 --> 00:50:23,157
people to sign off on that process.

986
00:50:23,157 --> 00:50:27,260
To say, if you're building something for animators, find animators that are going to be willing

987
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:31,543
to sign off on whether or not you met those expectations.

988
00:50:31,543 --> 00:50:35,125
And don't let yourself off the hook until they're willing to sign off on it.

989
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,503
So the things that should be part of championing solutions,

990
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:43,486
one, being able to articulate how the studio or game

991
00:50:43,486 --> 00:50:45,087
or whatever it is that you're trying to accomplish

992
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:46,368
will be radically different.

993
00:50:46,368 --> 00:50:48,149
Sort of the part of that telling,

994
00:50:48,149 --> 00:50:49,270
painting that picture of the future.

995
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:53,716
Articulating why this is important to you personally, I think is important.

996
00:50:53,716 --> 00:50:58,700
To say, I want to change this because it's meaningful to me because whatever.

997
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,163
And knowing how to gather support. I think this is an important part of the training process.

998
00:51:02,163 --> 00:51:05,405
Like, how do you get other people involved? You can never do things in...

999
00:51:05,405 --> 00:51:09,168
You're not doing things in a vacuum. You're doing things with a team, for a team.

1000
00:51:09,168 --> 00:51:12,871
So how do you gather support? Especially if you're not the lead on that team.

1001
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:18,855
How do you get other people to know what it is? And I think part of that is that being able to pitch properly

1002
00:51:18,855 --> 00:51:19,636
helps to gather support.

1003
00:51:22,222 --> 00:51:29,945
So, to review, these are the things that I find most important to deal with in terms

1004
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:30,785
of technical direction.

1005
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:36,747
That's managing cost, managing confidence, managing commitment, managing conflict, and

1006
00:51:36,747 --> 00:51:38,068
managing cooperation.

1007
00:51:38,068 --> 00:51:41,930
The things that I've talked about here are the context behind those things, the things

1008
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,710
that I think drive those individual things.

1009
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:48,492
I did mention that I had an easy-to-remember takeaway.

1010
00:51:49,273 --> 00:52:04,640
999-990. If you remember, we have, which should be no surprise to any of you.

1011
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,762
Thank you.

1012
00:52:08,762 --> 00:52:10,023
I'll take questions if you have any.

1013
00:52:28,997 --> 00:52:30,458
Okay, I guess we're done.

1014
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:31,959
Quick question.

1015
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:40,025
What do you think about work-life balance for yourself and then how do you think about

1016
00:52:40,025 --> 00:52:42,307
it for other people on the team as well?

1017
00:52:42,307 --> 00:52:46,750
The question is what do I think about work-life balance for myself and what do I think about

1018
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,490
that for...

1019
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:51,853
Yeah, you talked a little bit about it in terms of vacation but like more on a daily

1020
00:52:51,853 --> 00:52:52,554
basis.

1021
00:52:53,567 --> 00:52:57,909
What kind of hours do you expect from yourself and then other people on the team?

1022
00:52:57,909 --> 00:53:02,571
So, okay, what kind of hours do I expect from myself and for other people on the team?

1023
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:06,892
I mean, I think that the expectation is that what we're talking—

1024
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,974
the expectation is that I'm working with adults.

1025
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:12,475
Professional people, professional adults, right?

1026
00:53:12,475 --> 00:53:13,815
That's the base expectation.

1027
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,396
I'm not counting hours. I don't care.

1028
00:53:16,396 --> 00:53:18,657
What we're talking about are problems.

1029
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:19,837
You know, here's the problem.

1030
00:53:19,837 --> 00:53:21,278
Are you willing to commit to it?

1031
00:53:21,278 --> 00:53:22,298
How much are you willing to commit?

1032
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:27,422
That sort of thing. We're talking about these things, right?

1033
00:53:27,422 --> 00:53:29,023
So, I don't want people to burn out, right?

1034
00:53:29,023 --> 00:53:30,944
I don't want people there all night, every night.

1035
00:53:30,944 --> 00:53:32,165
That's not the thing that I want, right?

1036
00:53:32,165 --> 00:53:33,946
So again, we're looking to say,

1037
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:36,287
you need to take time off, you need to go home,

1038
00:53:36,287 --> 00:53:37,968
you need to deal with those things.

1039
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:38,909
But I'm also not counting hours.

1040
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:44,154
So I think fundamentally, the question is, the answer is about just treating everybody

1041
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:47,998
like adults and talking about the problems and solutions and letting them work those

1042
00:53:47,998 --> 00:53:50,100
details out for themselves.

1043
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,805
That's not a detail that I, you know, that's not a problem that I need to be solved.

1044
00:53:54,805 --> 00:54:00,731
I'm not, I'm neither forcing them to stay or, you know, worrying about it unless I see

1045
00:54:00,731 --> 00:54:02,813
a problem with them, they're too long, right?

1046
00:54:03,793 --> 00:54:05,754
Does that answer your question?

1047
00:54:05,754 --> 00:54:07,695
I mean, I realize it's a tricky kind of space.

1048
00:54:07,695 --> 00:54:09,195
Don't want people to crunch.

1049
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:12,516
I mean, if that's the bottom line, the question

1050
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:15,557
that you want to ask, like, no, yeah, crunch is bad.

1051
00:54:15,557 --> 00:54:16,657
We don't want to do that.

1052
00:54:16,657 --> 00:54:18,358
You want to follow up?

1053
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:23,679
So I guess one thing I've seen on my team

1054
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:28,581
is one person that worked way less hours than other people

1055
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:30,101
definitely got stuff done.

1056
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,902
But I think overall, culture was like.

1057
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:39,180
I don't know how I felt about it and that person left and I like the culture better without that.

1058
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:43,901
But again, if it's a high performer, maybe just live with it.

1059
00:54:43,901 --> 00:54:55,584
So one person got stuff, was getting stuff done and a high performer and worked slightly less than everybody else and that was a problem?

1060
00:54:55,584 --> 00:55:00,525
It's more like he would hit 100% and everybody else was knocking at 110-120% all the time.

1061
00:55:01,305 --> 00:55:06,369
Yes, it was solid all the time, but compared to the rest of the team, including myself,

1062
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:07,870
who was putting in...

1063
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:11,713
So you have a guy who's knocking out 100%, and another guy who's doing 110 or 120%...

1064
00:55:11,713 --> 00:55:12,494
We could say 90 to 100.

1065
00:55:12,494 --> 00:55:13,775
And that's a problem.

1066
00:55:13,775 --> 00:55:16,978
First, our percentages are kind of fucked up here.

1067
00:55:16,978 --> 00:55:17,338
Yeah.

1068
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:23,923
But I think, again, this isn't about time, right?

1069
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:26,185
And if it's about time, you're wrong.

1070
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:28,383
It's not about time.

1071
00:55:28,383 --> 00:55:31,865
What it is about the commitments that that team is making,

1072
00:55:31,865 --> 00:55:34,146
and the expectations that you're setting.

1073
00:55:34,146 --> 00:55:36,968
It's like, this is what I think that we need to commit to.

1074
00:55:36,968 --> 00:55:40,450
This is the expectations I have for the problems that we're willing to solve.

1075
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:43,572
If he's not meeting those expectations, you're not solving hard enough problems.

1076
00:55:43,892 --> 00:55:46,812
You're not solving problems in terms of cost value.

1077
00:55:46,812 --> 00:55:49,373
You're not providing enough value over time here.

1078
00:55:49,373 --> 00:55:49,993
That's fine.

1079
00:55:49,993 --> 00:55:51,193
That's a separate question.

1080
00:55:51,193 --> 00:55:53,834
That question is about, are you solving the problems

1081
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:55,694
that we need you to solve?

1082
00:55:55,694 --> 00:55:58,095
And are you solving them in a way that's valuable for us?

1083
00:55:58,095 --> 00:56:00,615
It's worth doing if you can solve this within two weeks.

1084
00:56:00,615 --> 00:56:01,215
Great.

1085
00:56:01,215 --> 00:56:03,156
I don't care if you spend three hours a day doing it

1086
00:56:03,156 --> 00:56:04,996
if you've solved it in a way that's valuable to me.

1087
00:56:04,996 --> 00:56:06,296
We've already talked about the ROI.

1088
00:56:06,837 --> 00:56:09,419
Like, that's cool.

1089
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:15,324
If you're not having those conversations, if you're not

1090
00:56:15,324 --> 00:56:17,827
talking about those expectations in terms of

1091
00:56:17,827 --> 00:56:18,788
value, and you're counting hours, you're

1092
00:56:18,788 --> 00:56:19,348
just doing it wrong.

1093
00:56:19,348 --> 00:56:19,388
OK.

1094
00:56:19,388 --> 00:56:24,413
Out of your 10 years, have you had people that stuck with you?

1095
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:31,039
And how did you deal with fatigue or like renewing their

1096
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:31,759
experience?

1097
00:56:32,153 --> 00:56:34,897
that stuck around with you for that 10 years?

1098
00:56:34,897 --> 00:56:37,900
Sure. Do I have people that stuck with me for that whole 10 years?

1099
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,562
Yeah, we have people on the team, for sure.

1100
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,125
Oh, that people on the team that have been there the whole time.

1101
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:42,646
Yeah.

1102
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:44,969
And how did you deal with fatigue or, you know,

1103
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:47,331
renewing their experience or keeping it fresh?

1104
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:50,713
All right, how do I help them keep things fresh?

1105
00:56:50,713 --> 00:56:51,534
Yeah, exactly.

1106
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:51,814
Sure.

1107
00:56:51,814 --> 00:56:55,998
I think that's individual, right?

1108
00:56:55,998 --> 00:56:58,641
But often you'll find that, again,

1109
00:56:58,641 --> 00:57:00,843
sort of that commoditization process

1110
00:57:00,843 --> 00:57:03,546
or the process of making something a limited opportunity.

1111
00:57:04,126 --> 00:57:06,528
So you take something that they have invested in, like,

1112
00:57:06,528 --> 00:57:08,630
OK, look, you've been working on this.

1113
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,952
You've been working on collision for two years, right?

1114
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:11,932
Or three years, or whatever.

1115
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:13,454
This has been your baby this entire time.

1116
00:57:13,454 --> 00:57:13,874
You know what?

1117
00:57:13,874 --> 00:57:15,835
It's time to give this to somebody else

1118
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:17,477
so that you can focus on a new problem.

1119
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:20,279
And that transition is super, super hard.

1120
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:28,144
People get super invested in the problem space and maybe they want to dedicate their whole

1121
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:28,944
future to that.

1122
00:57:28,944 --> 00:57:33,187
And they want to say, look, this is the domain that I want to be expert in.

1123
00:57:33,187 --> 00:57:37,129
Great, and then we can just keep focusing them being an expert in that domain.

1124
00:57:37,129 --> 00:57:40,691
But often it's, I've been working on some area and I want to work on something fresh

1125
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,952
and renew and whatever.

1126
00:57:41,952 --> 00:57:43,233
And so we help them transition.

1127
00:57:44,614 --> 00:57:49,396
So, I mean, I think that we have a group of really dedicated people and professionals

1128
00:57:49,396 --> 00:57:53,158
who really are, you know, they are focused themselves on training and growing and learning

1129
00:57:53,158 --> 00:57:53,679
new things.

1130
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:59,421
Like, that's not something I have to drive, because they're all curious, fundamentally

1131
00:57:59,421 --> 00:58:01,403
curious and growing people, right?

1132
00:58:01,403 --> 00:58:05,765
But helping them to be able to take a step back so they don't get overwhelmed by these

1133
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:09,267
things that they've been working for so long on and giving that opportunity to somebody

1134
00:58:09,267 --> 00:58:10,367
else is important.

1135
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:12,008
Does that answer your question?

1136
00:58:12,008 --> 00:58:12,248
Yes.

1137
00:58:12,248 --> 00:58:12,548
Thank you.

1138
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:20,349
Oh, sorry, I didn't see that through your head.

1139
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:20,469
Hi.

1140
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:21,390
I have two questions.

1141
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:25,333
The first one is about the size of your team.

1142
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:30,097
How many engineers you have in Insomniac?

1143
00:58:30,097 --> 00:58:34,181
And what is the split, like tools render, core?

1144
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:38,158
All right, so how big is the team and what's the split?

1145
00:58:38,158 --> 00:58:40,539
So the short answer is we have approximately 20 people

1146
00:58:40,539 --> 00:58:41,179
on the team.

1147
00:58:41,179 --> 00:58:44,041
We've had approximately 20 people on the team for 10 years.

1148
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:46,282
We don't really change size.

1149
00:58:46,282 --> 00:58:47,643
We hopefully just get better at what we do.

1150
00:58:47,643 --> 00:58:49,564
It's just the engine team, right?

1151
00:58:49,564 --> 00:58:51,645
Well, it's just the engine team, yeah.

1152
00:58:51,645 --> 00:58:56,608
But engine also includes tools and all those things, right.

1153
00:58:56,608 --> 00:59:00,190
So we're divided into five groups

1154
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:02,671
with approximately three or four people, or five people

1155
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:03,332
on each group, depending.

1156
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:09,979
Okay, uh, and, uh, the second one is, uh, so I'm sure you

1157
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:14,303
encountered problems, uh, like that, uh, you have some legacy

1158
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:19,007
big, uh, something that developed for years and, uh, you

1159
00:59:19,007 --> 00:59:22,070
really want to rewrite it to make it simpler to support

1160
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,713
better, but it really doesn't work the rule like five to one.

1161
00:59:26,953 --> 00:59:31,516
uh and uh but at the same time you have one two engineers constantly

1162
00:59:31,516 --> 00:59:37,220
distracting on fixing something uh in this like legacy system. What do you do in this case?

1163
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:39,912
You have a legacy code that you want to ultimately get rid of,

1164
00:59:39,912 --> 00:59:45,574
and it's really hard to see the practical value in doing that.

1165
00:59:45,574 --> 00:59:45,934
Right?

1166
00:59:45,934 --> 00:59:47,415
Yeah.

1167
00:59:47,415 --> 00:59:49,456
So I think that where you're looking for

1168
00:59:49,456 --> 00:59:51,017
is the practical, where you're still,

1169
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:53,358
if there is in fact no practical value in doing that,

1170
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:54,358
you don't do it.

1171
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:54,879
Full stop.

1172
00:59:54,879 --> 00:59:56,139
Stop thinking about it.

1173
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:57,240
This is never going to happen.

1174
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,881
We're going to live with this forever.

1175
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:01,342
Ultimately, you're going to wait for some other excuse that

1176
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:02,102
forces you to do it.

1177
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:03,643
And that will eventually happen.

1178
01:00:05,283 --> 01:00:07,184
Or you say, there is a value, we're just

1179
01:00:07,184 --> 01:00:08,445
having a hard time articulating it.

1180
01:00:08,445 --> 01:00:11,026
It just may be this sort of constant maintenance cost

1181
01:00:11,026 --> 01:00:13,067
over time, and things are getting harder and harder

1182
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,888
to change, and harder and harder to fix.

1183
01:00:15,888 --> 01:00:17,629
And so at that point, you can evaluate it.

1184
01:00:17,629 --> 01:00:19,990
You can say, look, over the course of the next five years,

1185
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:22,411
this is going to be impossible for us to work with.

1186
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:24,231
So we need a strategy out from under this.

1187
01:00:24,672 --> 01:00:31,016
And that happens, and we had to have our two-year strategy for getting out from under these

1188
01:00:31,016 --> 01:00:34,599
particular things, or our five-year strategy for getting out from under these particular

1189
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:35,159
things.

1190
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:36,420
So you just create a long-term roadmap.

1191
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,762
You don't stop and say, how are we going to do this right now?

1192
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:43,105
You paint a picture for the future, and then you build a roadmap for that, right?

1193
01:00:43,105 --> 01:00:46,587
It doesn't have to happen today.

1194
01:00:46,587 --> 01:00:50,210
So we're out of time, but I will be outside.

1195
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:50,550
Thank you.
