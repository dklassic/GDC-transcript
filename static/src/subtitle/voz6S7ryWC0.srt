1
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:07,568
Hi.

2
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:10,851
Do I have any friends here at all?

3
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:13,793
One or two.

4
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:16,356
As long as there's just one or two, that's all.

5
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:20,459
You'll keep my heart alive throughout this very, very,

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,801
very boring talk.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,272
I tried, normally I think, maybe I'll put some jokes in.

8
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:28,933
Wouldn't it be cool to have jokes?

9
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:30,814
And this time, there's no jokes.

10
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:32,895
There's just data and information.

11
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:37,218
I'm just going to try to pour whatever's

12
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:38,699
in this head into your heads.

13
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:40,920
And hopefully, things don't dribble out too much.

14
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:43,942
They'll probably dribble out of my head.

15
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,701
Couple things, turn off your devices that make noise.

16
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,784
Fart machines, just turn those off right now.

17
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,326
Also, there's evaluations.

18
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,048
There's data that is collected on you

19
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:01,569
and shared with the global internet.

20
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:07,693
So no, fill out your questionnaires and stuff.

21
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,955
Let me know how I could be a better human being.

22
00:01:13,637 --> 00:01:13,977
All right.

23
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:16,407
So I'm Daniel Cook.

24
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:19,109
I've been a game designer for a bunch of years now.

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,530
They keep going up.

26
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:22,452
I'm trying not to update that number anymore.

27
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:27,556
It's kind of like it's the 39 of 20 is the 39

28
00:01:28,197 --> 00:01:29,618
of game developer years.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,422
I've been writing on lostgarden.com,

30
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,764
a whole bunch of game design writings.

31
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,065
I like to think about.

32
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:45,546
tools that we can use as game designers to stop making so many. How to put it

33
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:46,706
stupid mistakes.

34
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:51,349
Like we tend to make the same mistakes over and over again and wouldn't be cool

35
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:56,251
to actually have like mental tools that we can approach a problem and solve it

36
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:01,354
in a smart way versus like flailing around and then going and like blowing

37
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:02,834
up a few million dollars here and there.

38
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:08,798
Co-founded a company called Spry Fox, a small game studio.

39
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,821
We've been going for about eight years now.

40
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,903
We've made games like Triple Town.

41
00:02:14,744 --> 00:02:16,926
Initially I got interested, like I kind of did the thing

42
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,108
that game designers do, which is like,

43
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:21,270
you know it's all about the game mechanics

44
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,532
and we want to do small, elegant, tight games

45
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:25,954
that have deep, you know, evergreen gameplay.

46
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,837
And so I did that sort of thing for a while.

47
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:36,147
But then I got into MMOs and I realized that people are actually kind of important.

48
00:02:36,793 --> 00:02:41,855
like people are are cool people are interesting and you can build games with

49
00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:46,096
people that make people's lives better and so this is a cooperative.

50
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:53,019
Shoot them up online game and people couldn't really grief each other so

51
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,761
there was there was a there was something nice about a game where it's

52
00:02:57,801 --> 00:03:02,402
not about betrayal or negative emotions it's about trying to build community and

53
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:05,083
that kind of got that that idea seated in my head.

54
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:08,286
We're working on another one.

55
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:11,829
So we've been making more and more online games.

56
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:16,592
We made a sort of a multiplayer Animal Crossing

57
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:17,733
called Bear-topia.

58
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,334
We make a lot of cute games as well.

59
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:24,557
Like our games are played by men, women, all ages.

60
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:29,380
We're really interested in the whole spectrum of humanity

61
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,402
out there and how can you make games for them.

62
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:35,945
And one of our sort of slogans is making happiness.

63
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:42,689
Like, as opposed to making money, which is also nice, but that's, you know, like, this

64
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:46,292
is sort of this, can games contribute to humanity?

65
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:53,780
So I don't build games because I love games.

66
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,761
Like, that's not...

67
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:56,367
That's not what I do.

68
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:58,889
I mean, games are cool, don't get me wrong.

69
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,471
But games are a tool.

70
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:04,093
As a designer, I think of games as a tool

71
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:08,517
that can help us bring happiness to the world,

72
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:11,279
a tool that can make people's lives better.

73
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,284
So I'm always looking for things that can improve happiness.

74
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,447
So it's not enough to just design a game.

75
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:22,468
Oh, we made a game.

76
00:04:22,508 --> 00:04:22,988
That's great.

77
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:24,749
It's like, it's like.

78
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:29,973
driving in a parking lot the first time you get your driver's license.

79
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:35,619
It's a super cool thing, but it's even better when you're going on a date night and you're

80
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:40,885
driving to the movie with your date and you're excited and the car empowers you to have this

81
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:42,286
wonderful life experience.

82
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,649
That's what games should be.

83
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:50,988
So looking at like, okay, well, what improves people's lives?

84
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:52,909
Did a bunch of research, looked around,

85
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:54,450
looked at things for years,

86
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,551
and this is like one of the big findings

87
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,453
that keeps coming up again and again and again

88
00:04:58,493 --> 00:04:59,813
in social psychology.

89
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:01,935
A small number of deep friendships

90
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,317
leads to greater happiness in life.

91
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:07,358
People have fulfillment in their lives.

92
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:10,500
They start thriving when they have lots of,

93
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,662
a small number of very deep friendships.

94
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:16,084
And then there's a flip side to that.

95
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:22,919
which is large numbers of shallow status-based friendships

96
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,722
are actually really bad, especially for teenagers.

97
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:28,425
If you are a teenage girl and you are basically

98
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:30,968
your entire social network is people sharing images

99
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:32,369
of each other, how cute you look,

100
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,272
you may be on the road to depression.

101
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,515
It's not a healthy thing to have that.

102
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:44,350
And so given that sort of finding, I asked myself,

103
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,270
well, what can online games do?

104
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,591
Like, what can games do to increase

105
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,292
this sort of meaningful relationships?

106
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:56,413
And we all have a fantasy.

107
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,093
I think we all sat around the table

108
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:01,314
and played games with our family or friends,

109
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:04,255
and we have this sort of like, oh, you know,

110
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:06,856
we're hanging out in this face-to-face interactions.

111
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:11,833
And if someone does something, we all laugh because it's a joke.

112
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,296
It wasn't meant to be mean.

113
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:14,880
And everything's nice and wonderful.

114
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:25,548
But the reality is instead we're mostly interacting with strangers, mediated by this very, very

115
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:32,473
thin pipe of the Internet, where all sorts of nuance is lost, all sorts of miscommunication

116
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:32,974
happens.

117
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:38,078
And then we put on top of this, we put on top of that systems and algorithms that are

118
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,420
immensely dehumanizing, that kind of strip.

119
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,506
our ability to act as authentic human beings away from the interaction, from the reciprocation

120
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:49,046
process.

121
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:52,409
And bad things happen.

122
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,255
So you get match-based systems, which are this very common thing where we have relationships,

123
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:00,576
but they're totally throwaway.

124
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:03,718
We interact with a person and we're like, oh, we're never going to see them again.

125
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:04,899
Of course I'm going to swear at them.

126
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,801
Because it's like, why not?

127
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:13,375
Friendship systems that, you know, again, it turns people into a number in some sort

128
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:14,916
of viral marketing campaign.

129
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:16,517
Again, dehumanizing.

130
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:21,140
And we just do these things because they make numbers go up, they make metrics go up, and

131
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,601
that seems like a nice idea.

132
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:26,784
And those KPIs that are really important to somebody and we made them go up so our salary

133
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:27,284
might go up.

134
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:32,346
But we do also things that are just naive.

135
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:36,148
We are like, chat, chat, people seem to like chat.

136
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:38,288
So let's just give people chat.

137
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,709
And so you have these things like Twitter,

138
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,670
where you're basically taking people

139
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,191
and firing them at each other at super high velocity.

140
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:49,993
And some of those people turn into friends.

141
00:07:50,313 --> 00:07:52,254
And you're like, see, Twitter is justified.

142
00:07:52,574 --> 00:07:55,876
And then there's all these sort of mangled heaps of bodies

143
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,417
that are like lying in the gutter someplace

144
00:07:58,497 --> 00:07:59,858
because they didn't form friendship.

145
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:02,899
They were damaged by this sort of naive implementation

146
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,700
of social systems.

147
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:10,043
So, can we do better?

148
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:14,645
I think we know games build friendships.

149
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:15,345
We know this.

150
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,906
Like there are many people here

151
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:19,788
who have probably made friendships in games.

152
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:23,150
Who here has made a friendship in a game that's lasted?

153
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,512
Look at that, look at that.

154
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:29,554
Games build friendships, so we know that is a fact.

155
00:08:30,295 --> 00:08:31,616
So how can we do that better?

156
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:36,759
So I went looking again,

157
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:37,980
because I like

158
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,146
sort of tying together different groups,

159
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:43,527
different ideas from different fields.

160
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,068
And I'm like, I wonder if anyone's thought

161
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:49,409
about friendship formation before.

162
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,052
And I found in the 1950s, there were two folks.

163
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:58,493
This is Schachter, which is an amazing name.

164
00:08:58,613 --> 00:08:59,894
I wish my name was Schachter.

165
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,916
And Festinger, which is also an amazing name.

166
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:06,397
If I could go by Schachter Festinger,

167
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,678
and like have it in a big like.

168
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:14,442
name tag, I would do that. That would be pretty cool. So in the 1950s, have you ever heard

169
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:22,147
of cognitive dissonance? That is Schachter. So these are big names that have done fundamental

170
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,089
research in cognitive psychology, social psychology.

171
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:50,940
And like I was doing a search on one of their terms and it's still like there's like it since 2010. There's been like 4000 research papers on this topic so they came up with a theory that is actually still super validated. There's immense quantities of research. It's been studied. You name it any field any sort of organization. Their ideas have been applied and validated.

172
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:53,441
Maybe we should do that for games.

173
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:56,748
So this is the proven model.

174
00:09:58,409 --> 00:09:59,010
This is what it is.

175
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,811
It's really pretty simple, right?

176
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:03,493
It's like, how do friendships form?

177
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:05,515
And it says, well, you need these

178
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,577
you need these four things

179
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,538
for friendships to form.

180
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:11,360
And if your game doesn't, isn't

181
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,301
designed to cause

182
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,642
these things to happen

183
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:18,524
friendships are going to form at a dramatically lower rate.

184
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:21,565
I mean, you may have some people that escape into chat channels

185
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,526
and still form friendships through there.

186
00:10:23,886 --> 00:10:26,487
But in general, if you don't have these things in your game,

187
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:29,008
your game's not going to be good at forming friendships.

188
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:34,050
So the rest of this talk is the super boring part.

189
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,510
I've used up all my jokes.

190
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:38,631
We're going to go through each one of these.

191
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:41,788
and we're going to say like what is this thing

192
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:45,351
and then we're going to say here's some examples

193
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,692
in games, some practical

194
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:50,355
boring game examples, mechanics,

195
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,977
systems that sort of thing that are doing

196
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:55,659
it and doing it well that we can just say why

197
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,801
don't we do that and do more of it.

198
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:02,184
Okay proximity.

199
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:05,527
This is your cool word of the day for pretty.

200
00:11:06,843 --> 00:11:09,066
You can practice that in the bathroom mirror.

201
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:13,173
Proprinquity, which is essentially social distance.

202
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:16,438
How far apart are people from one another?

203
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:22,026
And propinquity is all about,

204
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,189
there's a couple reasons why you want,

205
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,512
the rules of this proximity thing.

206
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,875
You want repeat serendipitous interactions.

207
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:31,857
So let's assume there's a bunch of people in a room

208
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,960
and they are walking along and they're ignoring each other

209
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,442
but then they happen to face one another

210
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:38,504
and see one another and they bump into each other

211
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:39,205
and they say hello.

212
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:41,526
That's a serendipitous interaction.

213
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:42,687
They weren't planning on it.

214
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,048
It was just sort of the shape of the room,

215
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:46,548
the number of the people in the room,

216
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:48,829
and they saw each other and said hi.

217
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,011
So you need serendipity in your system.

218
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:57,533
And you need to have repeat interactions.

219
00:11:57,613 --> 00:11:59,254
If those people bump into each other

220
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:00,894
and then never see each other again,

221
00:12:01,915 --> 00:12:03,135
then they're never gonna become friends.

222
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,456
It's just not gonna happen.

223
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:07,137
It's logistically impossible for them to become friends.

224
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:11,822
But if they see each other again and they actually have multiple repeat interactions,

225
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:13,749
then slowly over time maybe they'll become friends.

226
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,727
And you can sort of combine those ideas together and say,

227
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,669
well, there's this thing called density,

228
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,973
where the number of people in a room probably matters,

229
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:30,855
or the number of people in an environment probably matters.

230
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,477
Like if you're living in the desert,

231
00:12:34,498 --> 00:12:37,500
and the only things around you are cactuses,

232
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,202
cacti, cacti,

233
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:40,182
then...

234
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:43,405
you will probably not make any friends.

235
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:47,169
I think of, what was it, was it Joe from Snoopy?

236
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,333
He lived in a desert and he was always alone and sad.

237
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:53,876
Like, you can make games like that if you really want,

238
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,358
but nobody will become a friend.

239
00:12:56,907 --> 00:12:58,729
You can also do the opposite, you can make it too noisy,

240
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:00,390
you can have people jam-packed in.

241
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,752
We actually had this problem in Realm of the Mad God

242
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:05,173
where we would have the hub area

243
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,394
and there were so many people in the hub area

244
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:09,515
that it just became, like, people shut down,

245
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,876
they're like, it's dehumanizing,

246
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,038
I wanna, like, ignore everybody and not pay attention.

247
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,500
So there's a certain density you need.

248
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,383
Now, what I love about this,

249
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:23,404
this is the sort of thing that just gets me

250
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:24,665
incredibly excited.

251
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:29,329
we were talking about social psychology,

252
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:31,770
and now we're talking about logistics.

253
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,251
And as game designers, we are excellent at logistics.

254
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:40,072
That's numbers and people and pacing and timing and placement

255
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,652
and all those sort of things.

256
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:46,413
So if friendship for this factor is just a logistics problem,

257
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,334
we have all sorts of tools to solve that.

258
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:52,435
So.

259
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:55,584
This is an example of logistics thinking.

260
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:58,866
So a lot of people ask, say, well, why not just play

261
00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:00,007
with my existing friends?

262
00:14:00,147 --> 00:14:02,088
I should just be able to play with my existing friends.

263
00:14:02,228 --> 00:14:03,409
I like my existing friends.

264
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,490
I don't want to form new friends,

265
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,991
because that's kind of scary.

266
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:10,093
Why not just play with existing friends?

267
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,065
So let's look at the logistics.

268
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:18,607
There's a thing in online games called the concurrency ratio,

269
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:21,028
where there's a certain number of monthly active users

270
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,249
that you have, there's a certain number of concurrent users,

271
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:26,650
and there's a certain number who are online at any one time.

272
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,831
So let's say, in the best case, the best case,

273
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:32,693
10% of your audience is online at any one time.

274
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:33,873
That's wonderful.

275
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:37,518
uh... all right let's let's crunch the numbers uh...

276
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,347
so i assume that less than a concurrency ratio of twenty five to one and you have

277
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:43,489
ten friends

278
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,517
This is a secret, not very many people know this,

279
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:49,018
but most people do not actually have 10 good friends.

280
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:52,179
Most people have maybe five to seven.

281
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:55,060
In online games, it's really, really common

282
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,461
to see friends lists with one or two people

283
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:58,421
in your friends list.

284
00:14:58,801 --> 00:15:00,322
So 10 is being generous.

285
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,764
You come online and there's only a one in three chance

286
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,464
that someone is actually going to,

287
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:07,665
your friend is going to be there.

288
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:10,285
So most of the time, you come online,

289
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:11,306
you're not gonna know anyone.

290
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:18,612
And this is in a generous, good situation that doesn't actually occur for the vast amount of humanity in real life.

291
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:23,855
So we can take some takeaways from that sort of thinking.

292
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:26,696
We can say, OK, well, it turns out

293
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:33,317
that old friendships rarely translate to new context,

294
00:15:33,437 --> 00:15:35,998
particularly when you've just launched an online game,

295
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:39,199
in part because the numbers don't work out.

296
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,279
Like, the friends won't be there.

297
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:43,480
It's just mathematically not going to happen.

298
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,042
So then the design problem starts to be,

299
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:51,023
well, I would love to have real friends in there,

300
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,623
but they're not around yet,

301
00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:54,644
so I need to create an environment

302
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:57,786
where people can form new friendships from strangers.

303
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:01,007
And that's a completely different design problem

304
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:03,628
than hanging around the table at a board game

305
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,569
and playing with people you know.

306
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,150
Because it turns out that the psychology

307
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,811
of interacting with strangers is totally different

308
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:12,851
than the psychology of interacting with friends.

309
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:23,619
Okay, so theory's awesome.

310
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:26,820
I like theory, but let's do some tools.

311
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:29,021
Does anyone here own a hammer?

312
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:31,682
Aren't hammers awesome?

313
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:33,783
I think they're great.

314
00:16:33,803 --> 00:16:38,505
Oops.

315
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:41,426
Screwed up there.

316
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:44,495
Okay, so here are your basic tools.

317
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:47,677
You've got things like persistent identity.

318
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:48,837
If you don't have identity,

319
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,839
if it shifts from game to game

320
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:54,340
because you're randomly assigning usernames,

321
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,762
people are not going to have repeat encounters.

322
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:57,782
You can't have friendships.

323
00:16:58,603 --> 00:16:59,983
Events, if you do an event,

324
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:02,985
you can increase the density in time,

325
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:05,126
so therefore more people will show up.

326
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:06,987
So you escape the desert.

327
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:10,029
you know problem and you can actually have people there if

328
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,570
you have a low concurrency environment daily

329
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:15,092
incentives encourage people to come back so again you're

330
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:17,674
trying to get people into your game so you can play

331
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:21,156
and then offline communities like OK

332
00:17:21,236 --> 00:17:24,118
what if you had an asynchronous community that existed side

333
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:26,740
by side with your synchronous community such

334
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,542
that people could connect up that way so this is parallel

335
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:30,622
path that you can do.

336
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:34,305
So these are all super good basic tools

337
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:35,025
that work well.

338
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,660
And then you've got anti patterns with that as well.

339
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,021
Anonymous players.

340
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:43,563
Well, if people are completely anonymous,

341
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:47,707
they can't make friendships because they don't know

342
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,269
who each other are and they can't have repeat interactions.

343
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:56,751
The desert huge empty areas. This is when you're getting into competitive

344
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:02,734
games you're like oh I know I'm gonna have lots of gameplay modes now space is

345
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:07,477
not simply spatial it's not it's not a problem geography but you can have

346
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:11,620
abstract space as well when you take your population and you split them

347
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,223
across multiple modes where you're doing is you're basically reducing density.

348
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,266
you're making it so that people, those little molecules of people

349
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:23,409
don't bounce into each other and interact nearly as often.

350
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,390
The same thing goes with skill.

351
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:29,294
When you have an MMO and you have the newbies and the experts

352
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:32,216
and there's this spread of people across either a power

353
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:34,698
gradient or a skill gradient, what you're doing

354
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:38,961
is you're actually changing the density equation

355
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:42,144
in your game of people who can interact with one another.

356
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:44,757
And it's really easy to do that.

357
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:47,118
You're like, oh, no, this isn't a social system.

358
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,499
This is merely the leveling system.

359
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:51,040
It has nothing to do with social.

360
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,601
But by changing these systems,

361
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:56,762
they actually impact the experience and hurt,

362
00:18:56,882 --> 00:19:00,423
and it can utterly destroy your ability to create friends.

363
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:08,967
This is sort of the whipping boy of making French matches.

364
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:12,049
This comes from board games and sports,

365
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:15,331
it's super popular, it's super problematic.

366
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:18,913
So matches are, you start a match,

367
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:21,074
everyone has to be in there at the same time,

368
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:22,895
you play a game, and then you end a match,

369
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:23,935
and it ends at the same time,

370
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:25,837
and you move on to the next match, hopefully, maybe.

371
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:33,141
So this was a recent recent game that failed they simply didn't have enough

372
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:37,463
concurrent population to support their matchmaking structure so people would

373
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:41,286
have to wait too long which kills the retention the retention drops which

374
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:44,528
makes the problem even worse you get a death spiral.

375
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:48,771
So you know made millions and millions and millions of dollars of gameplay

376
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:50,632
screwed up by logistics.

377
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:56,434
And that's a that's an architectural issue right that's a structural issue

378
00:19:56,774 --> 00:20:00,776
to their game that requires that sort of initial starting conditions for players

379
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:01,556
have fun.

380
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:07,618
It does work matches do work matches are super effective

381
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:12,460
if you have a mega hit if you have a mega hit you have a huge population

382
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,722
matchmaking is easy wait time is easy it all works out so

383
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:21,423
if you have a mega hit keep doing this I'm not going to argue with you.

384
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,300
But it also sort of locks people away in these rooms

385
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,420
and they don't interact as much.

386
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:35,461
It's kind of, if you're anyone who has any sort of soul

387
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,802
for risk mitigation and you have a chance

388
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,702
that you might not make a mega hit,

389
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:47,383
do away with this pattern, consider something else.

390
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:50,484
Certainly we can do better.

391
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,756
So this is one that I really like.

392
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:56,097
This sort of comes from MMOs.

393
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:58,619
This is instead of matches, you do rooms.

394
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,540
And this is a solution that has density management.

395
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:05,882
You can do repeat encounters and very, very low wait times

396
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:08,403
so you get less churn, which keeps your concurrency up.

397
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:14,565
really simple sort of like diagram how I think of rooms and rooms could be a huge

398
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:20,310
open world they could be like you know an intimate abstract session, you know

399
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,533
there's there's tons of ways to do rooms, but the basic idea is you have people

400
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:28,737
playing a game there's a certain number of slots for people to play the game in

401
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:33,181
the room and then ideally you have these 2 other sort of things which is this

402
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:37,224
idea that you can join in progress in pop in at any point you want to start

403
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:38,525
playing the game, let's start playing.

404
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,186
And you can leave in progress.

405
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,307
You can leave at any point.

406
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,448
So it's very friendly.

407
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:47,431
It's respectful of people's time.

408
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:49,232
It's respectful of their schedules.

409
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:52,094
It's a nice, nice pattern.

410
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:57,137
This is one, Slither.io.

411
00:21:57,217 --> 00:22:01,299
So .io games are massively popular right now.

412
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,802
Everyone here should be building one in case you're not.

413
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:13,999
And there's no matchmaking wait like in order to play the game even including loading the game and entering the URL pressing enter

414
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:18,985
It took me six seconds to get into a game, and I was instantly playing with a whole bunch of other people

415
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:21,128
So very effective

416
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:27,630
In a bigger context, you look at something like Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2, and they have

417
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,951
an interesting pattern, which is an extension of rooms.

418
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:33,272
So you can take this very simple concept of rooms.

419
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:36,054
Does anyone here from ArenaNet?

420
00:22:38,015 --> 00:22:39,075
Maybe one or two people.

421
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:40,216
I see one.

422
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,696
He's wearing the shirt.

423
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:51,352
You can take the simple room concept and you can extend it and you can start building things

424
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:55,717
like a Lego block, a social Legos you're building these architectures out of.

425
00:22:58,101 --> 00:23:00,322
So this one, they have a problem where,

426
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:04,723
what if you pop into a room and there's no one else there?

427
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:07,084
Well, the typical thing that you do is you leave.

428
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:08,704
You're like, this is boring, a big empty room,

429
00:23:08,724 --> 00:23:09,265
I'm gonna leave.

430
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:12,286
So instead, they do, they build out this lovely map

431
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:13,826
and they have little checkpoints on it

432
00:23:13,886 --> 00:23:15,066
and little quests that you can do.

433
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:17,847
So those little hearts are like little activities

434
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:18,908
that you can do if you want.

435
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,789
And they say, why don't you just do these little activities?

436
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:22,949
And so that's what people do.

437
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:29,335
And but what that does is that keeps them in the room until other people start to accumulate

438
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:29,835
in there.

439
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:36,060
And once the other people are in there, they now have sufficient concurrency to do a much

440
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,023
more engaging, much more social interaction.

441
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:40,904
So that's when they hit you with a public event.

442
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:46,108
And now, oh, now we're all playing together when we were just hanging out in a room together.

443
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,374
I think doctors' waiting rooms should totally do this.

444
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:52,175
This would be awesome.

445
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,898
Like, you're sitting there in the waiting room, there's some magazines to keep you going,

446
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:59,140
you know, there's like a sticky note and you're like, I wonder what the sticky note is, and

447
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,243
you put on the sticky note, you say, secret, loot, you know, or something on the sticky

448
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:05,044
note people are looking through and they're like, oh, what's that?

449
00:24:05,384 --> 00:24:07,246
And then all of a sudden, boom, a dragon spawns.

450
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,510
That would be, I think that would make them better.

451
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:19,578
Now see there's your simple pattern, you know waiting room going to event and

452
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:20,899
again going back to the theory it.

453
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,864
It's a in create you have you've got you're managing serendipity you're

454
00:24:25,884 --> 00:24:29,767
managing density, you've got this idea of this ideal density that you're aiming

455
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:32,550
for and so you can you can create that in your game.

456
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:37,010
We did this on we made a cooperative game,

457
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,770
Rumble of the Mad God,

458
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,491
and we did the same thing here.

459
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:41,953
This was a slightly different pattern.

460
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:46,595
This was how do we get to that ideal density?

461
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:48,656
Is there any mechanism we can do,

462
00:24:48,776 --> 00:24:50,657
sort of like where,

463
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,759
imagine again this idea of these people

464
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,340
bouncing around like air molecules in a space.

465
00:24:56,381 --> 00:24:59,726
Is there any way we can sort of increase the density or shrink the density?

466
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:03,231
And if you think of a balloon, that's exactly what happens in a balloon, right?

467
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:05,974
You can kind of increase the balloon and shrink the balloon.

468
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:11,242
Can we do that sort of managing of density with game servers?

469
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,073
And so here we have these little instant servers that are running,

470
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:16,994
and you can jump into one.

471
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:18,995
And you can look up there, and you can say, oh, wait,

472
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:21,277
there's 14 of 80 people in that room.

473
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:23,339
So there's 14 slots filled in that room.

474
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:27,602
And then we've got another one with another number of people in that room.

475
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:31,325
And then there's a hub area here where everyone's gathering and saying

476
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:32,686
whether they'll join those things.

477
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:41,395
Now this is really cool because now we can just go and create the number of instances that we want

478
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:44,057
to make the ideal density.

479
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:49,602
And so you kind of have a hub area and then people freely flow back and forth between the hubs and the instances

480
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:54,245
and then you just add as many instances as you need to create the amount of space you need

481
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:56,627
for the number of concurrent users.

482
00:25:58,448 --> 00:26:00,990
Math! Right here.

483
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,171
Really simple, right?

484
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:05,593
Simple load balancing.

485
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:12,341
Then what happens when the population shrinks?

486
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:15,444
So we have this idea of garbage collection.

487
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,627
Like, okay, we need to shrink the thing,

488
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:19,569
but if we just go and shrink it,

489
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:20,851
maybe people will get upset.

490
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:22,613
So in Roman The Get Mad God,

491
00:26:22,693 --> 00:26:24,054
we made a gameplay reason for this.

492
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:32,704
what the each instance has a big bad big bad evil person and the God of that that

493
00:26:32,844 --> 00:26:37,827
area and if you kill him the whole thing gets destroyed in the whole whole world

494
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:42,330
gets destroyed, but that gives us a nice narrative excuse to just delete that

495
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,893
instance and now we send everyone back the hub and now we can load balance the

496
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:49,115
sort of like how many how many instances we need.

497
00:26:52,366 --> 00:26:55,207
Guild Wars has a slightly different they were kinder in

498
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:58,349
some ways than we were we just we just have people in a

499
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:01,470
permadeath game fight a giant monster they decided.

500
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,352
Maybe we should ask them and give them something nice.

501
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:08,493
Which is nice so here they bribe people to leave the

502
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:10,334
server they're like hey.

503
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:13,416
We're going to like it's kind of boring in here you want to

504
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:16,477
go someplace else we will give you stuff to go someplace

505
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:16,717
else.

506
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,900
And if that didn't work they kick you out.

507
00:27:23,616 --> 00:27:27,496
So, the carrot and the stick.

508
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:31,417
So as I was thinking about this stuff,

509
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:32,877
I'm like, okay, that's all good.

510
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:35,798
But the density systems, what they are all doing

511
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:39,079
is they're basically increasing serendipity.

512
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,999
But what I'm really interested in,

513
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:45,820
because I want those meaningful relationships,

514
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,041
how can we increase that repeat interaction?

515
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:52,341
So we worked on this MMO which nobody has played,

516
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,061
I guarantee.

517
00:27:53,582 --> 00:27:55,622
It was on a platform that doesn't,

518
00:27:56,862 --> 00:28:00,104
doesn't travel as well as some of these other ones.

519
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:08,267
And so this was a this is a multiplayer animal crossing like game and you had little bears and they were running around.

520
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:21,833
And they were all part of a the same cohort what we do is we stick 40 players together in a village and we say you're going to live in each other's sweat and bile for the next.

521
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:25,164
3 months, year, doesn't matter.

522
00:28:25,264 --> 00:28:27,326
You're just going to live together in this place,

523
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:28,887
and you have to get to know each other.

524
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:31,209
And you've seen this in schools.

525
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,353
Many schools do this, where you have a class, a cohort,

526
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:37,675
and you stay with the same cohort,

527
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:41,498
and you either become lifelong enemies or lifelong friends.

528
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,622
And it's this really wonderful, intense, repeat interaction

529
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,404
and increasing pattern.

530
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:54,267
And we had this whole system for like managing this, you know,

531
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:56,728
like what if villages fail and how to migrate

532
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,149
and what's the narrative behind it.

533
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:01,130
And so when you build these things, you think of the flows.

534
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,592
Think of the flows of people and think of how to maximize.

535
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:10,194
How do you maximize the opportunity

536
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:11,415
for people to stay together?

537
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:17,410
Yeah, you can do this in first-person shooters.

538
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:20,512
So first-person shooters, simple thing.

539
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:23,054
Like when you're going from one match to the next match,

540
00:29:23,154 --> 00:29:25,075
why don't you keep the same players together,

541
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:26,816
especially if they're on the same team.

542
00:29:27,077 --> 00:29:28,818
It's the same idea, same exact idea.

543
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:35,615
So here you know you you start to get tools right you start to get a list of

544
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:40,660
tools for sort of managing your population of players across servers and

545
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,543
now when you build your game you're thinking about this stuff you're

546
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,685
building all these things in like.

547
00:29:48,067 --> 00:29:53,149
But, Beartopia had all these systems going on simultaneously in the game, and it was

548
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:56,111
a fundamental part of how we designed the game.

549
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,333
It wasn't something that we thought of naively later.

550
00:29:59,553 --> 00:30:03,075
It was like, oh, wait, we're building this game and we want to encourage friendship.

551
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:07,359
Let's make sure that every piece of the game, the idea of villages,

552
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,981
the idea that you're staying together,

553
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:11,202
the idea that you're going to leave.

554
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:15,085
Like every once in a while, people wander off on a boat adventure to go someplace else,

555
00:30:15,725 --> 00:30:17,146
to explore the old country,

556
00:30:17,507 --> 00:30:20,629
and they come back and then the land is changed afterwards.

557
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:22,751
So we're building these ideas,

558
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:26,954
these concepts, these logistical concepts narratively into the gameplay.

559
00:30:26,974 --> 00:30:30,437
Similarity.

560
00:30:33,382 --> 00:30:35,173
This is a short and horrible one.

561
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:49,005
So first first rule of similarity is people make friends with people like them if you have a group

562
00:30:50,405 --> 00:30:55,306
and you randomly mix up a bunch of different people and they have some sort of attributes to

563
00:30:55,346 --> 00:31:01,467
them people look around the room and they will instinctually make friends with people like them

564
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:07,809
and this has been studied in all sorts of situations and this is an incredibly powerful

565
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:08,089
thing.

566
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:14,313
So, like, oh, those orange things, like, anyone else wearing orange, I'm instantly your friend.

567
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:15,274
Just like that.

568
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,476
Like, I want to become friends.

569
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:26,743
Now, what's happening here is we perceive that similar people

570
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:33,062
are going to be like us, and then as we build friendships, it's going to be cheaper to negotiate

571
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:36,044
with them and figure out how we could work together.

572
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:41,187
It's like, oh, if you're like me, we're already talking the same language, we already probably

573
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:48,431
have the same ideals, the same norms, and we sort of project these benefits to similarity.

574
00:31:51,683 --> 00:31:53,724
This is not always positive.

575
00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:58,465
In many, many, many, many cases, it's incredibly negative.

576
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:02,346
And it's also a wildly strong filter.

577
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:05,847
Like, there'll be someone with a piece of cake

578
00:32:06,368 --> 00:32:08,528
sitting there saying, would you like some cake?

579
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:10,569
And it's obviously amazing cake.

580
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:12,249
And there'll be someone next to them

581
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:14,090
with a knife who wants to stab them,

582
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,151
but looks like them.

583
00:32:16,231 --> 00:32:17,871
And they'll go up to the person with the knife

584
00:32:17,911 --> 00:32:20,452
and they'll say, wow, we should become friends.

585
00:32:21,212 --> 00:32:26,996
Like, it's a brutal, brutal thing that has been repeated in thousands of studies.

586
00:32:29,237 --> 00:32:38,983
So this game, which I always mispronounce, Agario is my attempt at it, another one of

587
00:32:39,003 --> 00:32:40,063
these .io games.

588
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:45,987
So they said, heck, like, people really like this nationalism thing.

589
00:32:46,795 --> 00:32:54,061
And so they allowed people to put stickers basically, skins on their characters of national flags.

590
00:32:54,481 --> 00:33:01,307
And for a while there, what was happening is there was these massive nation versus nation battles going on in this game.

591
00:33:01,928 --> 00:33:04,330
And along with it came all the baggage.

592
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:12,435
all the baggage of nationalism like it's like you know slurs just just there were denial of service

593
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:18,519
attacks that's just horrible horrible things because you you took in this like tribal identity

594
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,240
and you applied it within your game.

595
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:25,795
So how the heck do you use this thing?

596
00:33:26,315 --> 00:33:29,678
This is like, it's really, really strong

597
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:31,639
and it exists in all of our communities

598
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:34,761
and if we ignore it, we basically import

599
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:39,785
the worst elements of modern society into our games

600
00:33:40,146 --> 00:33:42,707
and people create these poisonous communities

601
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:44,169
based off bad ideals.

602
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:48,811
And so and the diversity of our population drops,

603
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:50,831
our populations become like,

604
00:33:51,832 --> 00:33:53,432
we basically start doing gatekeeping

605
00:33:53,472 --> 00:33:55,953
where you're not like us, you don't belong here.

606
00:33:56,654 --> 00:33:58,915
It's harder to acquire players.

607
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:01,035
It's just a miserable thing.

608
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:03,036
It's like one of these dark secrets

609
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:04,337
at the heart of humanity

610
00:34:04,597 --> 00:34:07,078
that makes designing online games really difficult.

611
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,135
You know, you can put people in factions,

612
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:14,836
you can design these factions,

613
00:34:15,857 --> 00:34:18,880
you can have people have sort of shared experiences,

614
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,421
positive shared experiences,

615
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:23,064
you can have them do shared goals,

616
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:27,228
and these things help a little.

617
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,129
They sort of work,

618
00:34:31,231 --> 00:34:34,154
but they're not that effective in general.

619
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:44,123
The one thing I've seen goes back to the fundamental reason why similarity is so strong.

620
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:50,833
And the fundamental reason why similarity is so strong goes back to that idea of shared

621
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:51,714
social norms.

622
00:34:52,535 --> 00:34:53,236
We are

623
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:57,391
deeply, deeply pattern matching creatures.

624
00:34:58,171 --> 00:35:02,035
And we're not that smart most of the time as individuals.

625
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:06,079
What we do is we look around us and we say,

626
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:08,061
what are other people doing?

627
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:10,003
Particularly people like us.

628
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:12,245
And then we copy those behaviors.

629
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:13,886
We start to mimic those behaviors

630
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:16,649
in this new unknown social context.

631
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:17,950
We start doing that.

632
00:35:19,048 --> 00:35:23,211
So you can use that to set up positive fictional identities.

633
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:27,193
You can create a tribe for your players

634
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,614
that is actually super positive.

635
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:31,695
So in Bear-topia, there was this,

636
00:35:31,935 --> 00:35:33,796
we're like, this is a happy little village

637
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:35,377
where people are nice to each other.

638
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:37,818
Everyone's an immigrant, so there's vast diversity.

639
00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:40,560
That's actually a similarity that you're all immigrants.

640
00:35:42,221 --> 00:35:43,882
And you're building things together

641
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,803
and you're working towards these common goals.

642
00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:48,004
And everyone's just really nice.

643
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:52,258
And what we've noticed is...

644
00:35:54,307 --> 00:35:56,167
it actually works really, really well.

645
00:35:57,527 --> 00:36:00,928
People don't get angry at each other

646
00:36:01,648 --> 00:36:04,869
because that's not the tribe that they're in.

647
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,670
They're not in the get angry at each other tribe.

648
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,971
They're not in the wear black and beat each other

649
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:14,011
over the head with a stick tribe, right?

650
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,371
That's not this game.

651
00:36:15,952 --> 00:36:18,112
And so by creating these positive identities,

652
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:20,353
these pro-social player roles,

653
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:25,457
you end up sort of setting the norm for this is what this place is.

654
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,660
And people will share that identity,

655
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,643
and they'll adopt people into that identity,

656
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:34,185
and they'll be like, oh, you're like me,

657
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:35,747
so therefore we should be friends

658
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:38,810
because we're all in this very strong pro-social identity.

659
00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:45,020
So some some rules there do not reference real strong real world

660
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,701
identities directly like keep that out of it if there's a strong real world

661
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:52,121
identity sort of separate that from your game.

662
00:36:54,122 --> 00:36:55,742
The yeah and and

663
00:36:56,983 --> 00:36:57,823
it's really effective.

664
00:36:57,843 --> 00:37:05,925
What so we make another game called alpha bear which is a game where you

665
00:37:05,985 --> 00:37:07,945
collect cute bears and.

666
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:13,350
It's funny because you should read the support emails we get.

667
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:19,677
The support emails are like, I'm playing this with my child

668
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,138
and I just wanted to let you know.

669
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,503
Or I think I found something that horribly

670
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:28,546
deletes all my data and I wanted to apologize.

671
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:39,479
And it's just the sort of game that attracts and presents a viewpoint on the world that

672
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:40,699
is pleasant and nice.

673
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,041
And we can build those sort of games.

674
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:44,862
We can make that sort of game.

675
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:51,007
There's nothing about games that say it has to be about ultraviolence and the fall of

676
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:53,108
man as we turn into animals.

677
00:37:54,149 --> 00:38:00,093
What if we make games for real human beings being the best that they can be?

678
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:02,271
I like that.

679
00:38:05,354 --> 00:38:05,714
All right.

680
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:07,516
Reciprocity.

681
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:09,998
Anyone asleep yet?

682
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:11,199
No.

683
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:12,380
This guy.

684
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,420
Wake him up.

685
00:38:15,322 --> 00:38:16,523
So this is reciprocity.

686
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:17,664
All right.

687
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:20,246
We're going to do a simple thing here.

688
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:22,668
He's fallen asleep.

689
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:25,830
You're going to punch him in the shoulder gently.

690
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:27,592
All right.

691
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:28,913
And then he's going to look at you.

692
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:31,179
And he's going, what the heck?

693
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:31,699
Right.

694
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:32,999
That was reciprocity.

695
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:33,399
Right there.

696
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,120
Tit for tat.

697
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,140
Right there.

698
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,240
He could have punched you back.

699
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,561
That would have been an extension of that.

700
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:41,922
But you make a friendly gesture or offer.

701
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:45,063
And then in return, the other person

702
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,263
gives a positive response.

703
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:49,184
And you've got a nice little reciprocation loop right there.

704
00:38:50,302 --> 00:38:55,364
It doesn't have to be material, it can be attention, recognition, two people walking

705
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:59,745
across the room, one person looks at the other person, the other person responds by meeting

706
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:02,566
their gaze, that is reciprocity right there.

707
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:05,127
That is a reciprocation loop.

708
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:13,590
Now what's interesting about reciprocity is every time you do that interaction loop, you

709
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:17,091
build this magical resource known as trust.

710
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:19,416
You're building trust with each other.

711
00:39:19,936 --> 00:39:21,197
It may be just a little bit.

712
00:39:21,457 --> 00:39:23,098
Like, when you meet glances,

713
00:39:23,138 --> 00:39:24,439
you're not building very much trust.

714
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:27,481
You're building a tiny, tiny little amount,

715
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:29,582
like, oh, this person seems okay.

716
00:39:29,622 --> 00:39:32,984
They seem to be following basic social norms.

717
00:39:33,144 --> 00:39:34,845
Maybe we can continue this later.

718
00:39:37,546 --> 00:39:43,488
But trust, trust is interesting because it goes back to trust is shared social norms.

719
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:51,511
Trust is, I know, I can predict what you're going to do in any sort of social situation.

720
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:56,733
I know what you're going to do and I know how I'm going to react and you know how I'm

721
00:39:56,793 --> 00:40:03,396
going to react and therefore if there's a complicated task or a risky task, I know I

722
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:04,376
can rely on you.

723
00:40:05,157 --> 00:40:09,084
That's sort of the economic underpinnings of trust.

724
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:16,045
And if you don't have trust, then there's just a limit to the complexity of things that

725
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:17,847
you can do in life.

726
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:20,929
GDC could not have been put on without trust.

727
00:40:21,189 --> 00:40:25,252
There needed to be trust that there would be people here, that we would meet each other,

728
00:40:25,332 --> 00:40:26,593
that we would have good talks.

729
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:33,518
And if that's broken in any way, then the whole large organized culture just falls apart.

730
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:36,480
So trust is wildly important.

731
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,741
And reciprocation is how you get it there.

732
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:43,349
Now, trust is hard.

733
00:40:43,629 --> 00:40:44,670
Trust is super hard.

734
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,011
Trust grows very slowly.

735
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:52,032
It can take years for people to trust one another.

736
00:40:52,272 --> 00:40:54,013
I come from Maine.

737
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:58,654
Maine is a cold weather climate, which basically

738
00:40:58,694 --> 00:41:01,195
means that every time winter comes,

739
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:04,896
there's a 110% chance you are going to die.

740
00:41:07,433 --> 00:41:09,815
That's just fundamental to the culture.

741
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:10,876
It's going to happen.

742
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:13,960
And you have limited resources.

743
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:18,204
And every day is like survival of the most brutal kind.

744
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:20,626
And it may not actually be like that,

745
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:21,928
because we have stoves and stuff.

746
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:24,831
But that's what we're all thinking deep down.

747
00:41:25,893 --> 00:41:34,222
And so trust is like, wait, anytime I ask someone over to dinner, or ask a favor of

748
00:41:34,302 --> 00:41:40,849
somebody, or someone asks a favor of me, I'm giving up scarce resources that could have

749
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:42,450
been essential to my survival.

750
00:41:44,097 --> 00:41:46,659
And so trust grows very, very slowly.

751
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,522
We slowly say, okay, I suspect that person

752
00:41:50,582 --> 00:41:52,644
is not going to steal my awesome wood pile.

753
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:56,827
And eventually, over years, you might get to the point

754
00:41:56,907 --> 00:41:58,048
where you wave hello.

755
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:04,653
That's cold weather climates, trust growing slowly.

756
00:42:05,073 --> 00:42:07,415
But then, the horrible thing about trust

757
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:10,117
is if someone betrays that trust,

758
00:42:10,437 --> 00:42:12,159
it goes away super, super fast.

759
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:17,251
Like, if I see that guy taking wood from my wood pile,

760
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:19,832
he, it's over.

761
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:22,133
I'm never going to talk to him again.

762
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:24,594
I'm going to spread rumors to everyone else.

763
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:27,075
I'm gonna like, this guy, he takes wood from the wood pile.

764
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:28,135
That's my wood pile.

765
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:29,756
Eh, right?

766
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:31,256
And it's like one moment,

767
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:33,357
and maybe he really needed that wood, whatever.

768
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,498
It's like, trust can drop quickly.

769
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:41,280
Trust also.

770
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:46,647
allows us to increase the stakes of each interaction.

771
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:49,450
Like maybe we get to the point where we're like,

772
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,471
I'm letting him take stuff from my wood pile.

773
00:42:52,132 --> 00:42:54,594
Awesome, that's good, we're trusting each other.

774
00:42:55,715 --> 00:42:58,117
But it's expensive for me to like make dinner

775
00:42:58,297 --> 00:42:59,919
and have the fellow over for dinner.

776
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:02,701
That's like, what if we don't get along?

777
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:05,443
What if we're only good at the like saying hi level

778
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:06,925
and we probably should have kept it there?

779
00:43:08,227 --> 00:43:14,368
So trust, like, as you start interacting and as you build up that history of interactions.

780
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:19,752
you start being willing to do more for the other person.

781
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,333
You start being willing to take greater risks.

782
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:25,835
But the flip side of this is deep friendships

783
00:43:25,955 --> 00:43:27,376
are incredibly expensive.

784
00:43:28,096 --> 00:43:31,998
So the end result is you can only end up investing

785
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:34,079
in a handful of deep friendships.

786
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:36,420
So we have a lot of shallow friendships

787
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,062
and then a very, very few number of deep friendships.

788
00:43:42,123 --> 00:43:44,845
Okay, so trust.

789
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,151
Source of civilization, very important.

790
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:50,072
You can tattoo that someplace.

791
00:43:50,192 --> 00:43:51,793
Trust is the source of civilization.

792
00:43:52,854 --> 00:43:55,235
I have many tattoos on the bottom of my feet.

793
00:43:55,795 --> 00:43:57,396
That way, it's like private.

794
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:03,299
Okay, now there's a downside to this.

795
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,581
We are social creatures and we are wired to reciprocate.

796
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:13,743
So there's this wonderful experiment where you go and you give a person $1 and then you

797
00:44:13,903 --> 00:44:18,885
ask them to buy like a $20 thing from you and they're total strangers and they absolutely

798
00:44:18,945 --> 00:44:20,045
do not want this $20 thing.

799
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,066
but because you gave them the $1,

800
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,687
they're like, oh, I'm biologically wired to reciprocate.

801
00:44:27,287 --> 00:44:28,828
And then they go and boom,

802
00:44:28,988 --> 00:44:30,988
they'll go and they'll complete the sale with you.

803
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,349
So you can create these reciprocation systems,

804
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:36,430
but they end up being,

805
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,411
they can actually be kind of manipulative

806
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:43,572
if you're not doing it with good intent.

807
00:44:45,593 --> 00:44:46,173
Some tools.

808
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:48,619
Okay, anti-patterns.

809
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,301
Anything that reduces trust.

810
00:44:53,662 --> 00:44:55,282
If you're building a trade system

811
00:44:55,403 --> 00:44:56,963
and people can scam one another,

812
00:44:57,103 --> 00:44:58,824
you're actually actively reducing

813
00:44:59,184 --> 00:45:01,085
the global trust in your community.

814
00:45:02,006 --> 00:45:04,207
If there's hacking that's going on,

815
00:45:04,247 --> 00:45:06,568
you're reducing trust and you're causing people

816
00:45:06,608 --> 00:45:08,789
to not want to become friends with one another.

817
00:45:09,029 --> 00:45:10,470
They start to become defensive,

818
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,911
they start to become like Mainers,

819
00:45:13,552 --> 00:45:14,432
and you don't want that.

820
00:45:18,464 --> 00:45:19,345
power differentials.

821
00:45:20,505 --> 00:45:22,227
Like I think of the nation right now

822
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:24,748
with the extreme income inequality going on,

823
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:28,290
and there starts to create this system of mistrust

824
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:31,732
where people like, you are thinking in a way

825
00:45:31,752 --> 00:45:33,834
you have access to resources that I don't,

826
00:45:33,894 --> 00:45:35,095
you're taking them from me,

827
00:45:35,495 --> 00:45:38,056
and you start to get this sense of distrust.

828
00:45:41,729 --> 00:45:48,932
Now, what's fascinating, this is one of my absolutely favorite things about reciprocation

829
00:45:48,952 --> 00:45:49,173
tools.

830
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:53,175
We have built an immense number of reciprocation tools.

831
00:45:53,695 --> 00:46:00,199
If you are a startup in this area and have taken VC money, you have engineered reciprocation

832
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:00,459
loops.

833
00:46:01,379 --> 00:46:05,640
And you just try to get them out there and you try to get people using them as much as

834
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:10,722
humanly possible because damn they're cool and they have high engagement and people love

835
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:14,523
them and they're socializing and interaction and all your numbers are going up and it's

836
00:46:14,543 --> 00:46:15,263
super exciting.

837
00:46:15,544 --> 00:46:17,024
Like chat, let's do chat.

838
00:46:17,204 --> 00:46:21,567
let's let's have friends lists let's go and have checklists where we're like

839
00:46:21,868 --> 00:46:24,910
trying to like compete on the number of things that were selling and we're

840
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:29,453
comparing that with each other in games we can do guilds we can do gifting like

841
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:37,899
all these things we can dump into a game or app if you're an app person and we

842
00:46:37,939 --> 00:46:41,022
can just do that and then the question is wait wait but

843
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,842
But like we talked about Twitter.

844
00:46:44,463 --> 00:46:49,184
Twitter is the case study of throwing random crap

845
00:46:49,825 --> 00:46:52,306
into a thing and trying to get as many people

846
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:55,147
to use it as possible and then watching the wreckage

847
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:58,408
fall out, the human wreckage.

848
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:05,871
And that's, maybe we could be smarter about it.

849
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:08,172
I have a, I think we can.

850
00:47:09,252 --> 00:47:09,752
I think we can.

851
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:20,895
So it turns out that if we go back to that idea of like trust builds up slowly

852
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:27,480
and there's low-cost interactions early on and then high-cost interactions later on,

853
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:36,346
maybe we can structure the way we interact, introduce tools to people based off levels

854
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:36,846
of trust.

855
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,302
This is, sorry that's more than I like to put on the slide,

856
00:47:46,562 --> 00:47:53,044
but this is different levels of friendship in a game.

857
00:47:54,945 --> 00:47:59,567
And you can think of the absolute lowest level of friendship

858
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:02,908
as someone playing by themself.

859
00:48:03,368 --> 00:48:06,669
Single player games, not commonly known

860
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,630
for their friendship formation capabilities.

861
00:48:10,627 --> 00:48:12,249
The next one is what kids do.

862
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:15,953
If you ever watch kids play games next to one another,

863
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:18,957
they'll do this thing called parallel play,

864
00:48:18,977 --> 00:48:21,019
where they'll play next to each other,

865
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:22,942
they'll kind of glance at each other

866
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:24,744
out of the corner of their eye to see what they're doing,

867
00:48:24,804 --> 00:48:26,506
but they won't actually interact.

868
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:30,783
Then you've got ambient co-op.

869
00:48:31,323 --> 00:48:32,444
We're helping each other.

870
00:48:32,825 --> 00:48:34,947
It's like, oh, like in Steambirds.

871
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:36,808
Here, I'll do some examples here.

872
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:39,791
But ambient co-op, we help each other without meaning to.

873
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:44,355
Soft co-op, we're intentionally benefiting others,

874
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:46,918
but there's no requirement to do that.

875
00:48:46,938 --> 00:48:49,540
There's no requirement to actually help each other,

876
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,062
but you can do it if you want.

877
00:48:52,122 --> 00:48:54,524
And then hard co-op, the Nintendo puzzle,

878
00:48:54,904 --> 00:48:58,647
where someone has to step on the pressure plate

879
00:48:58,687 --> 00:48:59,887
before the door opens.

880
00:49:00,248 --> 00:49:02,189
And if you don't step on the pressure plate,

881
00:49:02,229 --> 00:49:03,170
the door will never open,

882
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,831
the other person won't be able to go through.

883
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:08,393
And that's that sort of locking key hard co-op.

884
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:10,034
If you do not co-operate, you will fail.

885
00:49:12,896 --> 00:49:17,901
And then finally we get all the way up to friends where we're spending time together,

886
00:49:17,961 --> 00:49:23,246
we're trusting each other, and we're willing to collaborate and communicate and solve.

887
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:29,973
We're able to actually interact at all these different levels, but we can do hard cooperation

888
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:30,974
without backstabbing.

889
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:34,618
And so that's friendship levels.

890
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:40,738
This is sort of like a very simple interaction on Discord.

891
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:42,539
Why is Discord so popular?

892
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,121
They do a lot of smart things, believe it or not,

893
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:46,322
in terms of friendship formation.

894
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:49,465
So one of the things they do is they actually pay your bill

895
00:49:50,045 --> 00:49:52,667
when you join a new server.

896
00:49:52,707 --> 00:49:55,349
They pay your social cost of joining the new server

897
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,551
by making you seem funny and witty.

898
00:49:58,937 --> 00:50:00,097
So they introduce, they're like,

899
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:02,899
oh, this person's here to kick butt and chew bubble gum.

900
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:05,821
You know, and they make up a little witty thing.

901
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:08,062
And so they're doing this very simple thing

902
00:50:08,082 --> 00:50:10,483
to sort of like ease you in

903
00:50:10,644 --> 00:50:12,925
and introduce you to the community in a nice way.

904
00:50:13,285 --> 00:50:16,127
And I see people actually respond to these.

905
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,888
Not always, but sometimes they'll respond

906
00:50:18,908 --> 00:50:20,889
and they'll reciprocate to this little thing.

907
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:25,731
And so at the very lowest end of the friendship ladder,

908
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:28,332
you can do these things to automate

909
00:50:28,773 --> 00:50:32,875
like the suggestion of how people should interact.

910
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:37,918
In our MMO Steambirds Alliance,

911
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,200
we do this thing where

912
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:46,424
if people kill an enemy on the screen,

913
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:49,786
everyone around them gets the XP.

914
00:50:51,092 --> 00:50:55,575
So it's a form of super ambient co-op, right?

915
00:50:55,956 --> 00:50:58,418
Like we're happening to benefit each other,

916
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:00,239
we're happening to play together

917
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,241
just by being on the same screen

918
00:51:02,581 --> 00:51:04,583
and someone shoots an enemy.

919
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:07,806
Now that can move into soft co-op

920
00:51:08,066 --> 00:51:10,688
where we're both actively shooting the same enemy

921
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:12,570
because then we're like, we're thinking,

922
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,092
oh wait, I'm being totally selfish here.

923
00:51:15,652 --> 00:51:17,373
This is a totally selfish activity,

924
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:20,055
but by shooting that thing while you're shooting the thing,

925
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:24,198
we'll kill things faster and get loot and XP faster.

926
00:51:24,979 --> 00:51:29,322
So it's a totally like very low cost interaction

927
00:51:29,742 --> 00:51:32,804
that results in us doing something together

928
00:51:32,984 --> 00:51:35,006
and completing reciprocation loops

929
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:37,307
and having a shared experience

930
00:51:37,548 --> 00:51:39,469
and now suddenly we have shared goals

931
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:43,452
and all that is sort of just sort of naturally happening

932
00:51:43,932 --> 00:51:45,013
just by playing the game.

933
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,324
I really love this quote on Destiny 2.

934
00:51:55,065 --> 00:51:56,247
So they have a thing where they have

935
00:51:56,607 --> 00:51:58,530
non-zero-sum guild rewards.

936
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:02,595
So if someone goes and gets a reward in the game

937
00:52:02,935 --> 00:52:03,997
and they're part of the guild,

938
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:05,919
then everybody gets a reward.

939
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,584
and the designer on this, Emmy Chung,

940
00:52:11,065 --> 00:52:14,149
is saying, like, the Super Bowl ring philosophy.

941
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:17,594
When someone wins the Super Bowl ring,

942
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:21,299
they don't just give it to the people who are on the field.

943
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:25,241
and who played in that game they give that ring to everybody

944
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:28,722
and it becomes this sort of like shared like

945
00:52:28,942 --> 00:52:31,403
hey everyone helps do this I'm going

946
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:33,604
to reward everyone along with us

947
00:52:34,424 --> 00:52:36,925
and even if you're what's nice about that is even

948
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:39,686
if you were actually in the sort of hard

949
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:42,426
co-op environment

950
00:52:42,446 --> 00:52:45,227
you were in the hard co-op match where you had to work

951
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:47,928
really really hard together this is something that benefits

952
00:52:48,188 --> 00:52:48,808
every level.

953
00:52:49,965 --> 00:52:56,049
And there's one of the challenges with degrees of friendship is you've got a mixed audience.

954
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:01,453
You've got people who are casual friends, people who are deep friends, people who don't

955
00:53:01,513 --> 00:53:05,895
know each other all that well, people who are like amazingly good friends and are probably

956
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:07,497
going to get married inside your game.

957
00:53:09,638 --> 00:53:10,158
Which happens.

958
00:53:10,618 --> 00:53:13,660
Who here has had a game where someone's married somebody else inside the game?

959
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:15,001
Yeah?

960
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:15,622
Yeah.

961
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:16,862
So that's the level.

962
00:53:16,942 --> 00:53:18,263
You can get pretty intense here.

963
00:53:20,249 --> 00:53:28,195
And you need game mechanics that work for that entire spectrum.

964
00:53:28,395 --> 00:53:31,197
You're not necessarily just developing game mechanics

965
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:33,319
for one group at a time.

966
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,040
You're looking for game mechanics

967
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,763
that are flexible enough to work for all different levels

968
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:42,966
of friendship that enable the super, super deep friendships

969
00:53:43,247 --> 00:53:46,269
as well as the more casual ones.

970
00:53:49,925 --> 00:53:52,108
This is a pattern that I love, rolls.

971
00:53:52,948 --> 00:53:54,350
Rolls exist in a lot of things,

972
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:56,472
but I just like talking about Puzzle Pirates

973
00:53:56,952 --> 00:53:58,053
because it's super cool.

974
00:53:58,474 --> 00:54:00,736
It's a game where you're a pirate and you play puzzles.

975
00:54:01,096 --> 00:54:04,319
I mean, I don't know how you can beat that.

976
00:54:06,401 --> 00:54:07,162
That's what it looks like.

977
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,643
Look at that, pirates playing puzzles.

978
00:54:09,244 --> 00:54:11,506
I just want to take a moment and appreciate that.

979
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:16,830
You fail if you don't work together.

980
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:18,292
Everyone's got a different role.

981
00:54:18,352 --> 00:54:20,035
They start relying on one another.

982
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:23,640
There's a differentiation of roles and capabilities.

983
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:31,578
There's, as I was building this talk, another talk came out that talks all about trust.

984
00:54:31,998 --> 00:54:33,640
I highly recommend you go check it out.

985
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,784
This is the spectrum of trust, Raf Koster has a copy of this up on his website.

986
00:54:39,345 --> 00:54:41,287
And this is his slide on roles.

987
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:47,833
So it's this idea that, like, low trust environment, you don't have differentiated roles very much.

988
00:54:49,194 --> 00:54:51,414
like I can do pretty much anything you can do.

989
00:54:52,074 --> 00:54:53,495
In high trust environment,

990
00:54:53,535 --> 00:54:55,775
you allow those roles to spread out.

991
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:58,456
Now, I need to rely on you.

992
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:01,017
Again, this goes back to the soft and hard co-op idea.

993
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:07,619
All right, disclosure.

994
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,860
This is a pretty simple one.

995
00:55:18,867 --> 00:55:23,048
In order to make deep relationships,

996
00:55:23,308 --> 00:55:24,368
you've worked your way up,

997
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:26,749
you're doing more expensive interactions with another,

998
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:32,610
you have to become vulnerable to the other person

999
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:37,231
to reach those maximum levels of trust.

1000
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:40,572
You need to have riskier trust building going on.

1001
00:55:43,301 --> 00:55:47,804
The problem here is by revealing things about yourself,

1002
00:55:48,424 --> 00:55:51,626
it's actually like, what if the person rejects you?

1003
00:55:51,866 --> 00:55:53,967
Everyone here has a fear of rejection.

1004
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,228
Someone's going to look at them and say like,

1005
00:55:56,668 --> 00:56:00,010
oh, if they tell me about this intimate detail of my life,

1006
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:03,372
that all this work building up this relationship

1007
00:56:03,452 --> 00:56:04,312
is going to go away.

1008
00:56:06,803 --> 00:56:13,468
But it's the only way it's the only way to get that next level and we need to make games that safely support

1009
00:56:14,189 --> 00:56:15,850
vulnerability and disclosure

1010
00:56:16,651 --> 00:56:19,513
Because if we don't bad things happen like

1011
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:26,159
If we reveal things too soon you get all sorts of stuff that happens here

1012
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:35,445
So the way I think about it is there's opt-in disclosure

1013
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:36,706
at the right time and place,

1014
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:38,748
and there's premature disclosure.

1015
00:56:39,728 --> 00:56:42,590
And if your game causes premature disclosure,

1016
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,972
then you get all the negative impacts.

1017
00:56:45,252 --> 00:56:47,013
You get horrible, horrible things.

1018
00:56:47,313 --> 00:56:48,474
Like this is an example of that.

1019
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:51,836
This is a woman who is playing Overwatch,

1020
00:56:52,537 --> 00:56:55,219
and she can't use voice chat

1021
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:57,200
without getting marriage proposals.

1022
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,883
Because voice chat reveals that she is a woman,

1023
00:57:01,524 --> 00:57:02,985
and it's a premature disclosure,

1024
00:57:03,245 --> 00:57:06,148
and it turns out there are a lot of sexist jerks out there

1025
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:08,910
that she didn't actually want to be friends with,

1026
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:12,273
but because she's forced to disclose this information,

1027
00:57:12,694 --> 00:57:17,558
they're able to go and put all their horrible nature to work,

1028
00:57:17,878 --> 00:57:19,179
making her feel unwelcome.

1029
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:22,503
And so she wants to, like, here he...

1030
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:27,050
I mean, this is a very clear, like, critique of the system that says,

1031
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:32,059
hey, you forced me to disclose something I didn't want to disclose.

1032
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,371
And what happens is people turn off chat at that point.

1033
00:57:40,932 --> 00:57:42,913
And now your opportunity in the future

1034
00:57:43,313 --> 00:57:46,294
for a meaningful moment of vulnerability is lost.

1035
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:49,876
You've killed the opportunity to become friends

1036
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:51,057
at an early point.

1037
00:57:52,098 --> 00:57:55,219
And that your community as a whole suffers

1038
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,881
because of the systemic things you put in place

1039
00:57:58,221 --> 00:58:00,502
with your naive social systems

1040
00:58:01,122 --> 00:58:05,225
that caused people to defend themselves, to turtle up.

1041
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:12,167
OK, real names are a horrible idea.

1042
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:16,152
Identity and persistent identity is a good idea.

1043
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,894
Real names are a miserable idea

1044
00:58:17,934 --> 00:58:21,357
because it forces premature disclosure.

1045
00:58:22,558 --> 00:58:24,539
Voice chat, also a bad idea.

1046
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,441
Location is a bad idea.

1047
00:58:26,781 --> 00:58:29,003
Even if someone's purchased a particular item

1048
00:58:29,063 --> 00:58:29,904
is a bad idea.

1049
00:58:30,364 --> 00:58:33,467
Like, be very, very careful about what people can share.

1050
00:58:34,247 --> 00:58:36,989
And if they want to share, give them tools to share,

1051
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:38,811
but make it an opt-in activity.

1052
00:58:42,984 --> 00:58:48,648
So this is where I kind of put things on like where you should start introducing various

1053
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:50,048
interactions.

1054
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:56,973
And you want those private spaces where people can talk to each other so that they can have

1055
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,113
those vulnerable moments.

1056
00:59:00,115 --> 00:59:03,797
And anyone who says like, oh, no, we can't do chat because chat is risky.

1057
00:59:04,117 --> 00:59:05,318
Chat is actually essential.

1058
00:59:05,478 --> 00:59:07,199
You need people to be able to talk to one another.

1059
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:15,286
This is the cone of silence idea that we did in rum, mad God.

1060
00:59:15,306 --> 00:59:18,387
We have secrets and people can't hear

1061
00:59:18,427 --> 00:59:20,208
each other outside the cone of silence.

1062
00:59:20,828 --> 00:59:24,269
There's ways of creating these very simple opt-in systems

1063
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,850
that the players don't even think about this,

1064
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,352
but this is a super simple thing you can do that like

1065
00:59:30,432 --> 00:59:33,193
totally changes the ability

1066
00:59:33,233 --> 00:59:34,934
for people to control their experiences.

1067
00:59:34,974 --> 00:59:37,255
They can watch someone coming towards them and say like,

1068
00:59:37,335 --> 00:59:38,815
oh, I'm going to stop talking about that right now.

1069
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:46,759
And of course, you need to give real friends,

1070
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,919
which will come up, a way to skip this.

1071
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,460
You need people to opt in to skipping this.

1072
00:59:56,021 --> 00:59:59,942
Okay, so those are the basic things, you know,

1073
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:03,003
and that's how you design for friendship formation.

1074
01:00:04,679 --> 01:00:07,382
This is sort of like where those things map.

1075
01:00:07,402 --> 01:00:09,644
So you've got these four sort of like tools

1076
01:00:10,264 --> 01:00:13,427
and then where they map onto sort of the level of trust.

1077
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:16,610
And like certain things, like if you're dealing

1078
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,532
with like parallel and solitary play,

1079
01:00:18,552 --> 01:00:20,634
you probably shouldn't be thinking about disclosure.

1080
01:00:20,934 --> 01:00:23,416
In fact, that's a negative thing to have in your game.

1081
01:00:23,917 --> 01:00:26,338
but by by the time you're dealing with the hard

1082
01:00:26,398 --> 01:00:29,200
co-op and friends that's an important thing and so you

1083
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,801
can kind of like think of your game as this

1084
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:35,563
sort of like funnel of like people becoming friends

1085
01:00:35,623 --> 01:00:37,465
and how do you support it at every stage.

1086
01:00:43,377 --> 01:00:48,519
If you've ever built a match-based game with a large number of people

1087
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:52,301
where the social identity is beating the crap out of one another,

1088
01:00:53,081 --> 01:00:57,203
you may have noticed that getting people to be nice to one another

1089
01:00:57,523 --> 01:00:58,643
is a hard problem.

1090
01:01:01,505 --> 01:01:07,327
This is just hindsight, but it may have been a good idea.

1091
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:12,207
to actually build a positive social structure

1092
01:01:12,688 --> 01:01:14,869
into your game from the very beginning.

1093
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:18,572
Because it's crazy hard to retrofit.

1094
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:21,635
I will call out League of Legends here

1095
01:01:22,195 --> 01:01:24,437
because they have done heroic work

1096
01:01:25,658 --> 01:01:29,861
trying to fix the experience of a really bad architecture.

1097
01:01:31,502 --> 01:01:32,383
Heroic work.

1098
01:01:32,843 --> 01:01:34,465
I mean, I think we should applaud them

1099
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:36,786
for the work that they've done.

1100
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:45,475
But at the same time, you don't have to live their life of making that mistake, right?

1101
01:01:46,757 --> 01:01:48,098
So build it in from the beginning.

1102
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:53,959
This is a design process.

1103
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:58,800
Social is not something that is a separate pillar.

1104
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,360
It's not something that's an adjacent system.

1105
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,341
It's not tacked on at the end.

1106
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:05,681
It is fundamental to your game.

1107
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:08,582
And you should be thinking about social,

1108
01:02:08,922 --> 01:02:10,462
you should be thinking of it honestly

1109
01:02:10,882 --> 01:02:12,723
as the reason you're building your game.

1110
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:16,683
You should make games so that people make friends.

1111
01:02:19,707 --> 01:02:21,389
Some resources, you can look this up.

1112
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:22,511
I'm totally out of time.

1113
01:02:23,252 --> 01:02:29,863
I apologize to all the people who really care about that.

1114
01:02:31,265 --> 01:02:31,806
And that's it.

1115
01:02:32,467 --> 01:02:34,330
I got no time for questions, but I'll.
