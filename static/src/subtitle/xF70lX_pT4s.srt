1
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:06,453
I'm Claudio.

2
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:10,697
I work with interaction design and AI.

3
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:13,260
But today I'm going to talk to you about a VR game I worked

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:13,900
on last year.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,744
And we're going to talk about UX.

6
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:22,248
For this game, I cover the role of principal UX designer.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,114
Just for clarity, it's not going to be about UI, UX,

8
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:30,478
but it's more like the type of experience that's around

9
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:34,383
how the user, how the player is going to use their hands

10
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:36,746
around the environment and playing the game.

11
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:44,207
So it's a concept which is more akin to what some people saw like like calling spatial computing and things like this

12
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:44,287
and

13
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:52,354
So like I was going to talk about how to use some theories from cognitive science

14
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:56,638
To actually make these interactions and those experiences more engaging and more compelling

15
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:00,525
So the game is called In Death.

16
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:01,905
It's a VR game.

17
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:03,046
It's an Icelandic production.

18
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:07,048
It's been produced in Iceland by a studio called Solfar.

19
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:10,829
And with the help of RVX Special Effects Studio, we're

20
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:12,770
all based in Iceland.

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,212
And it's been released across the major VR platforms, like

22
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:20,094
Rift, Vive, and PlayStation VR.

23
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:24,236
It's a dungeon crawler, classical concept.

24
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:26,616
It's based in the afterlife.

25
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:27,877
So you are in this environment.

26
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:31,097
There's a lot of creatures that try to get rid of you.

27
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:36,338
And you've been equipped with a weapon, a shield, to make

28
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:37,739
your way through it.

29
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,039
There's no specific goal.

30
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,519
You just have to survive.

31
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:43,340
And you have to go through the game until you reach the

32
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,460
final boss.

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,280
And eventually, you win it.

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,400
And then you start the game again.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,141
But this time, it's more difficult.

36
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:49,241
So.

37
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:53,940
you have to survive it, the concept is like pretty classical.

38
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,743
What makes it different, what makes it unique is the fact that it's immersive.

39
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,225
It's using VR, so you are immersed into this action.

40
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:01,146
What does that mean?

41
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:05,350
It means, for example, that you don't have a button for strafing and dodging projectiles.

42
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,735
You literally have to lean left or right with your body to avoid incoming threats.

43
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:15,299
Or you can use like part of the environment to hide yourself, get cover.

44
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:18,200
and like, you know, get some tactical advantage.

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,921
It also means that you don't move the camera smoothly.

46
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:23,421
Like we rely on teleportation,

47
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:26,722
like many other like VR titles for comfort reasons.

48
00:02:26,722 --> 00:02:29,103
What we did here though, like for this game

49
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,724
was to try to fit the teleportation

50
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:32,524
into the narrative of the game

51
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:35,365
and like giving the player a special harrow

52
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,206
that you can shoot with the bow

53
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:40,086
that like it's gonna teleport you to a certain destination,

54
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:42,047
which is the point where the harrow landed.

55
00:02:42,835 --> 00:02:46,719
The game is designed to be very hard.

56
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,662
So there was a conscious choice of design, which is

57
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:52,604
good because it allows a certain amount of

58
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:55,066
replayability of the game if the player really gets into

59
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:55,546
the challenge.

60
00:02:56,499 --> 00:03:02,744
But most importantly, I think it's pushing the player to actually achieve mastery of the weapons.

61
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:08,850
Mastery of like marksmanship into using the bow and become really good at handling the weapon

62
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,353
and becoming better and better since like the game is so hard, the only way to make it through

63
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:14,315
is to become like really accurate with the shooting.

64
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:28,330
But also understanding architecture and understanding what could be a way to actually gain a tactical advantage by leveraging on the shape of buildings and how things are laid out in the environment.

65
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,933
Also by using teleportation in a smart way.

66
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:37,424
So this idea of mastery of the weapons

67
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:40,405
requires an attentive design of the interaction

68
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:41,945
of how the person, of how the player

69
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:44,446
interacts with this object.

70
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:46,406
So as I said at the beginning,

71
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:49,627
I worked on designing the hand interactions

72
00:03:49,627 --> 00:03:52,268
for this VR game, which in a game like this

73
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:55,049
mostly means the way in which the player

74
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,069
handles the weapons.

75
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,996
because this is a type of like hand manipulation that the person's going to go through very often,

76
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:08,724
like on a second-to-second basis, especially in combat situations the action becomes really

77
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:13,469
frantic and has to actually be able to control those weapons and handle those weapons accurately

78
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:14,911
and have a sense of control.

79
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:19,333
So definitely like the functionalities of these weapons have to be there.

80
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,134
You have to have like the player, like we wanted to have the player

81
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:28,076
experience a sense of becoming better and better at using those objects.

82
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:31,897
But was also important to me like a certain kind of fun.

83
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:36,219
So an engagement, like designing the interactions that were like engaging

84
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:39,760
and they were like an intense experience of like combat

85
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,721
like visual experiences.

86
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:47,519
Designing weapons for VR is different than designing weapons for games.

87
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,584
And it's important to understand why. It's important to understand where really lies the difference here.

88
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:57,389
So if you go on YouTube and you search for a video of a game or a VR game,

89
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,311
you hardly see the differences between the two.

90
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:03,475
If you're looking at what's happening in the virtual world, they kind of almost look like the same.

91
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:08,660
But the big difference really lies when you actually look at the people.

92
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:12,505
What people do when they actually play these experiences,

93
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:13,809
it's completely different.

94
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:16,737
In games, the posture is like quite static.

95
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:19,217
And usually I see it.

96
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:22,300
But what's important there is that you're holding a device

97
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,802
with buttons, and what you actually move is just your

98
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:27,904
thumbs, and that's the beginning of your interaction.

99
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:32,027
Something meaningful happens when you move your thumbs on

100
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:34,209
the button, and whatever is meaningful, it's a feedback

101
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,930
that gets bounced back to you through the screen.

102
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,733
So the person keeps looking at the screen continuously.

103
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,014
So the head is fixed.

104
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:41,054
In VR instead,

105
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:49,341
There's like a way larger set of movement that a person do when it's inside these experiences.

106
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:53,825
People can be standing or moving around.

107
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:56,227
But most importantly, there is no screen.

108
00:05:56,227 --> 00:06:01,151
The display is attached in your head, and you can literally move your head around.

109
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:03,393
That plays a big difference in the interactive experience.

110
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:10,959
And also like you like move your hands for performing certain interactions in

111
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,963
environment around you. So there's a big, big difference in terms of experience

112
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:22,590
here. So like, like, like what's what's like the real difference? What's really

113
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,614
different about it too, if we think about it, is the motion space that we

114
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:28,515
allow to the person.

115
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:33,870
So, like in games, which are interactive experiences,

116
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,393
we have a very small motion space

117
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:37,734
that's allowed to be played.

118
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:39,376
It's like you move the times over the buttons

119
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:40,357
and things are happening.

120
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:44,601
Compared to other type of interactive experiences,

121
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:47,424
for example, like face-to-face social interactions,

122
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:49,346
not the kind of social interactions we do on Facebook,

123
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:50,207
but face-to-face.

124
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:56,512
It's still an interactive experience. It's still like something interactive that we do with others which is meaningful

125
00:06:56,512 --> 00:07:02,096
But it requires the use of our entire body. I think you know body language for example you can rely on

126
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:06,479
like entire spectrum of movements that your body allows to actually

127
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,741
to actually like like make meanings with others

128
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:14,916
What does VR lies in these pictures like something in the middle so they're

129
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:19,699
like the movement space is like larger compared to the one of games but you

130
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:24,522
know is this is this actually like lending itself to the same experiences

131
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:30,245
like having having having like like the player being able to move more doesn't

132
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:34,608
mean that we can actually think of those game in VR in the same way in which

133
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:36,549
within games in the screen.

134
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:40,668
So the practices and the guidelines are really the same.

135
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,811
VR games tend to be more kinesthetic because of this.

136
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:49,715
And the fact that we have a larger box

137
00:07:49,715 --> 00:07:53,558
is not obviously a better or an increment in the experience.

138
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:56,040
It needs to be leveraged in the proper way.

139
00:07:57,445 --> 00:08:02,247
So like back to weapons like if we now we have those type of

140
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:06,289
like larger space of body movements which allowed to

141
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:09,731
player and can manipulate things.

142
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:11,271
We like with their hands.

143
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:17,794
Like how are we going to design those weapons like off like

144
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:19,935
obviously the guidelines that we use for games might not

145
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:23,216
actually quite fit here because we have like you know the

146
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:25,637
player moving hands and manipulating handling those

147
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:26,418
weapons correctly.

148
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:29,699
So, like, how can we do that?

149
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,640
We need to think differently.

150
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,001
We need to think about affordances.

151
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:36,564
We need to think about how those objects are shaped

152
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:37,645
and what kind of forms they have

153
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:41,027
so that they can actually inform a person

154
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:42,869
how to use them properly.

155
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:44,069
So affordances are important.

156
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:45,791
Like, good design is invisible,

157
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,112
but bad design is pretty obvious.

158
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,794
When the affordance is not working for us,

159
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:51,695
you can see it right away.

160
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:55,883
So affordances are important to actually

161
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:58,143
name the functionalities of those objects,

162
00:08:58,143 --> 00:08:59,964
for us are the weapons that we focused on.

163
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:03,105
But how can we connect this to the fun?

164
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:06,887
And that's where it came to quantity science.

165
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:09,448
Like central to the design process,

166
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,709
that I'll follow on, was the idea of embodied condition.

167
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,197
So it's typical to think that the mind affects the body.

168
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:20,399
With embodied cognition, we allow ourselves to think

169
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,821
that body movements affects our thinking.

170
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:29,685
So for example, we can look at what happens with dancers.

171
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:38,566
Like dancers, they learn choreographies to actually perform and make a performance.

172
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:41,227
Learning a choreography takes a long time.

173
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:44,668
It's quite complex in terms of model coordinations and everything.

174
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,149
But they actually develop a trick.

175
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:48,569
They have a technique called marking.

176
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:52,526
that they used to learn choreographies much faster.

177
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,988
So marking, it's not doing the choreography,

178
00:09:54,988 --> 00:09:57,289
it's kind of like sketching the choreography,

179
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:00,391
like performing movements that kind of mimics

180
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,612
the choreography without really putting

181
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:03,533
the full energy into it.

182
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:05,734
And that's like the way in which they learn

183
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:07,355
choreographies like much faster.

184
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:10,337
By moving their body, they actually influence

185
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:11,377
their learning.

186
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:15,974
We can actually see some research done by David Kirsch

187
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:20,015
that's been looking at the way in which dancers

188
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,156
are performing those markings

189
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:22,656
and performing those movements

190
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,077
for facilitating their learning.

191
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:26,777
And that's exactly what I found out,

192
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:29,218
that by mimicking the choreography,

193
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:32,138
they were able to actually learn it much faster

194
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:35,819
than doing the choreography full out, full force,

195
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:37,880
or even just thinking about the choreography.

196
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:42,210
Like what turned out that was helping them was like mimicking the movements,

197
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:49,318
help them like to actually build a temporal model or a mental image of what the choreography

198
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:54,864
would have been, like kind of like lay itself out in time and space and how to coordinate with others.

199
00:10:55,874 --> 00:11:00,198
So the idea here that we had was to leverage the same concept

200
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:04,441
and think about what is the choreography that the player is

201
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:08,044
doing when he's actually moving her hands around his weapons?

202
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:12,727
What is the performance that the player is actually doing?

203
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:17,291
And the idea here is that the performance is a role model.

204
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:17,791
It's a hero character.

205
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:27,953
So the player is not only just operating those weapons,

206
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,713
but it's also kind of like, as it does that,

207
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:37,175
it moves in ways, if you design the weapons in a certain way,

208
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:38,935
you make, the player moves in ways that,

209
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:40,375
it's kind of like enacting a character,

210
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,976
enacting a certain hero role model.

211
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:47,798
Which is like an idea akin to this marking that dancers do.

212
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:50,160
And role-playing, it's fun.

213
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,543
So central to our design process really was like,

214
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:57,728
how can we make role-playing out of hand movements?

215
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:01,832
How can we design or think of the way in which the player

216
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:04,134
moves his hands around those objects in such a way

217
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:05,736
that that becomes an act of role-playing?

218
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:09,459
So overall, the picture was something like this.

219
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:14,903
Design affordances for those objects that makes move,

220
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:20,707
like a person operate those weapons in the best way.

221
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:27,142
And the interaction with the weapons elicits the movements.

222
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:29,324
The movements is acting out.

223
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:31,365
It's similar to acting out the hero characters,

224
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:33,466
but at the same time, it reinforces the idea

225
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,728
of performing really well,

226
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:38,810
or performing on top of certain,

227
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,312
like out of the ordinary, through those weapons.

228
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:51,013
So, making the affordances for the objects, it was really important, we needed to make

229
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:53,776
those affordances really well.

230
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:57,401
The first approach, the first temptation would be to actually copy the affordances from the

231
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,605
real objects and translate them into the virtual world.

232
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:02,614
that doesn't work out of the box.

233
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:05,637
Like the reason why it doesn't work out of the box

234
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:08,280
is because we all kind of understood this,

235
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,861
like you know, the vision of VR,

236
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:12,464
this idea of a vivid dreaming,

237
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:14,346
like some kind of like manufactured reality

238
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:16,828
where we impact the senses.

239
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:20,312
But like, the reality, like this reality we have now,

240
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:21,413
the essence we have now,

241
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:23,395
that allow also to do like a minor reality,

242
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:24,876
a minor version of this vision.

243
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:27,949
So the question really becomes like,

244
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:32,370
how do you project real objects into this minor reality

245
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,291
that we have at our disposal?

246
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,572
But because objects and affordances

247
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:39,432
are really meant for the human body,

248
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:40,732
the deeper question becomes,

249
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,973
how do you see the human body

250
00:13:42,973 --> 00:13:44,473
projected into this minor reality?

251
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:46,754
Because we need to understand that

252
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:48,335
in order to make affordances for this.

253
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:55,035
And that's the way in which we look, that's the way in which the human body looks inside

254
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,235
like a man of reality.

255
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:00,637
It's a VR monoculus with a head and two ears and not even eyes.

256
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:04,178
They're actually kind of binocular holes, which are quite different.

257
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:06,617
And we don't even have hands.

258
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:08,958
We have some kind of punching gloves in there.

259
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,599
And that's what makes a big difference

260
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,040
in terms of affordances, because not having fingers

261
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,481
and having palms, it uses a lot of our ability

262
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,042
to explore our surroundings.

263
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,563
So the real question becomes, when

264
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:21,224
you think about making anything that's

265
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:23,925
like hand interactions in VR, how do you design

266
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:25,025
an object for this creature?

267
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:29,248
Because if you think about objects that we in real life,

268
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:30,569
those are designed for our body,

269
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,290
but now we have an embodiment which is different.

270
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,271
How do you design an object for this creature?

271
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:34,972
How do you find out?

272
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:38,514
But the only way for us, or at least in our approach,

273
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:41,616
the way that we actually move forward

274
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:43,197
was surprise prototypes.

275
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:46,038
You just have to fast prototypes as fast as you can,

276
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:51,820
like make as many prototypes as you can to actually get a sense of what responds,

277
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,281
what works for this VR homunculus.

278
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:56,682
But also very important to use user testing as soon as possible,

279
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:59,763
like prototypes alone, like that's only up to a point.

280
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:02,965
You need to see other persons like jumping on board with those prototypes

281
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:04,565
and see how far they go with that.

282
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:05,926
It's important to prototype.

283
00:15:07,345 --> 00:15:12,130
I experience it is important to prototype as soon as possible,

284
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,171
but not too early.

285
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:15,974
Like, you know, bad ideas, it's like,

286
00:15:15,974 --> 00:15:16,935
better we adjust them.

287
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:19,757
So our approach was like to kind of like user test internally

288
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:21,639
and then like open up to other user testers.

289
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,522
But like fast prototyping, it's been instrumental.

290
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:28,005
It's been important for us also to think

291
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:29,387
of these weapons like props.

292
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:37,108
in the same way in which stage designers or people that work in theater think about props

293
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:42,753
for actors, objects that are not really meant to work in certain ways but to suggest or

294
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,655
elicit a certain way to act around them.

295
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:49,443
And what also we found out was tremendously valuable.

296
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:52,786
The prototypes became a communication tool

297
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:53,986
inside the team.

298
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:58,009
It was the best way to talk about VR interactions for us.

299
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,871
Sometimes it's kind of complicated to talk about what

300
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:02,172
will happen in VR.

301
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:04,433
And you might write down, you might have

302
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:05,854
pictures of animations.

303
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:07,235
Sometimes nothing really works.

304
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:11,077
You just have to have actual prototypes within the actual

305
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:13,639
VR space where you see how things are unfolding.

306
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:19,969
So let's look at the bow and let's look how the real bow translates into a bow for the

307
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:20,049
B.R.

308
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:20,470
Moleculus.

309
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,330
How does the object change?

310
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:27,852
So a real bow, it's an elegant, minimal design, but it's also quite sophisticated.

311
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:32,734
There's a number of parts which are important for us to actually handle it properly.

312
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,134
There is a grip.

313
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:38,276
There is a harrow rest, which is where you place the harrow.

314
00:16:38,276 --> 00:16:40,197
More importantly, there is a serving,

315
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:41,898
that area that you see over there.

316
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:43,719
I don't know if you can see the pointer,

317
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:47,021
but there's an area there where you can actually grab

318
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:50,063
the string, pull it back.

319
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:53,925
That part, which is actually quite thin in reality,

320
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:57,227
in visual reality it became thick and really, really long,

321
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:58,448
as long as the string.

322
00:16:58,448 --> 00:16:59,768
So it became kind of bulked up.

323
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:05,986
Instead of having like a grip, we have to replace that with an attach point, something that gets attached to your hand.

324
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:13,931
And something really important, because the VR Monocle doesn't have really eyes, they have like two binocular holes,

325
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:21,616
we have to cut short and make the arrow appear as soon as you grab the knocking area.

326
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:26,037
Because that was helping the person to have a straight line of sight.

327
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:30,158
Because we wanted to actually have the person to actually achieve this idea of becoming better

328
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:32,878
and becoming a master of shooting accurately.

329
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:38,859
So that really helped to keep this straight line of sight.

330
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:43,980
As much as it was helping, the other idea that we had to do

331
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,321
was constraining certain worst orientations.

332
00:17:47,017 --> 00:17:52,298
like, like, there are ways of twisting your, like, your hands that, like, have been disabled

333
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:58,379
where you actually control the bow, so that, like, the arrow get placed into line of sight,

334
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:02,180
which is constant. So you constantly get reminded of what's, like, your line of sight. You can

335
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:08,261
actually get into flow of using this bow quite fast and quite quickly. The final result was

336
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:14,302
something that lends itself to be used in combat situations, also, like, when there's

337
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,442
kind of, like, a frantic moment.

338
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:20,098
And like, the player can actually shoot accurately,

339
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,759
can get a sense of like becoming better,

340
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,940
a bit more accurate.

341
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,401
But it comes to do like stuff that you wouldn't do

342
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,582
with a real bow, for example, shooting horizontally.

343
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:29,803
That's something that like, it's connected,

344
00:18:29,803 --> 00:18:32,725
this idea of like enacting the use of an object

345
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:34,326
so that you think like you are a hero.

346
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:41,110
And that was pretty much what we did for the bow.

347
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,013
It was important also to keep a consistent interaction,

348
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:48,977
like design the object so that the player

349
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:52,380
could keep a consistent rhythm of the interaction.

350
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,423
And that's pretty much what we did for the bow in short.

351
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,262
For the crossbow, it's a little bit more complicated because the crossbow is more recent as an object.

352
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:10,627
There are many different variants, so we went into archives of museums and some other connections I have in Italy

353
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:14,690
to actually study different variants, different crossbows and understand the various mechanics

354
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,192
and what was the advantage of others compared to others.

355
00:19:19,012 --> 00:19:25,735
In general, the idea of the crossbow was to be able to load a bolt fast, so fast firing

356
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:30,897
was the reason why they were invented.

357
00:19:30,897 --> 00:19:33,579
In my research I also find something...

358
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:39,991
Quite interesting, I discovered that Leonardo da Vinci

359
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:42,573
prototyped a crossbow, but just on paper.

360
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:46,536
It was never realized, but it was like an automatic,

361
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,577
like kind of like something you could load quickly.

362
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:52,821
So there's this artisan in Italy who actually made it,

363
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:54,722
this following the blueprint of Leonardo da Vinci.

364
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:59,086
And it's a crossbow that is cut in half, so you can open it and it loads automatically.

365
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:01,908
So the idea was really rapid firing.

366
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:05,952
What we did for the crossbow was to think about how to fuse all these characteristics

367
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:11,516
of different crossbows from different eras and try to fuse it into one object that we

368
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:14,799
thought could be representative and different from the bow.

369
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:17,715
in the way to use it.

370
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:19,357
So we went through a number of prototypes,

371
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:21,880
like modular prototypes that we build quite quickly

372
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,263
out of gray boxing and like modular parts

373
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:25,725
that you can interact with.

374
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,908
We started by having like an handle on top

375
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:30,130
and then looking at people and how they were responding

376
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,933
and how much they were getting into the flow.

377
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:33,995
And then we moved the handles to the side.

378
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,091
just to see what's the difference,

379
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:37,572
if it was better for aiming or not.

380
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,932
And then we even went as far as putting

381
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:43,333
some kind of lever type of interaction here

382
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,294
and kept looking at how people were moving

383
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:46,354
and what we're doing.

384
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:51,215
And the final version is this one over here,

385
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:53,936
where you can grab the string and pull it backwards

386
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:55,116
and it loads immediately.

387
00:20:55,116 --> 00:20:57,677
So if you become really good at doing this movement,

388
00:20:57,677 --> 00:21:00,157
you can actually shoot and reload it very fast.

389
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:01,678
And then you can also grab it with two hands

390
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,678
and do some more precision shooting.

391
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:06,910
So that's what concerned looking at those objects

392
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,131
in the virtual world.

393
00:21:08,131 --> 00:21:10,372
But it's interesting to look, as I said in the beginning,

394
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:13,835
to look at how people responded in terms of movement.

395
00:21:13,835 --> 00:21:19,619
And this is actually the marking of the people mimicking

396
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:23,081
like a certain character through the use of that object.

397
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,103
So design the object so that people can move in certain ways

398
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:27,024
when they were actually using it.

399
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:31,507
And it's also important here to actually think about

400
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:32,548
fatigue profiles.

401
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,902
Like, since you design an object that gets used,

402
00:21:36,902 --> 00:21:38,904
that kind of like, you know, make people move

403
00:21:38,904 --> 00:21:40,345
in certain ways, you need to think about

404
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:42,366
what kind of muscles get involved in there,

405
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,047
and try to actually make fatigue profiles

406
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:47,490
which are orthogonal between these two different objects.

407
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:53,534
You can also see how the movements are not

408
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:56,816
necessarily the same movements that we would do

409
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,117
with the real objects.

410
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,118
They're like sketched.

411
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:06,959
But nevertheless, they are enough to actually build a mental model of what's happening inside the virtual world

412
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,682
and what's happening when they are enacting into those objects.

413
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,701
Another thing that we did that was very important was to parameterize the affordances.

414
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:19,662
That was key for us because we didn't have much time to do user testing or formal user testing,

415
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:24,523
so we had to go fast, try to iterate as fast as possible.

416
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:29,664
So what we did was to organize the affordances into a number of parameters

417
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:32,745
that we could actually tweak and change right after every user testing.

418
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:46,470
So user testing was an occasion to observe people, but also to mold those values around what we found out was more or less comfortable, more or less easy to actually get working for the players when they were trying this.

419
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:53,581
Also, once again, those parameters helped a lot as a communication tool, because it

420
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:57,904
helped us to have a meeting where we were focused on certain ideas and certain concepts,

421
00:22:57,904 --> 00:23:04,129
so they really worked as a form of information architecture, provide us a vocabulary to talk

422
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:10,435
about what we saw during these user experiences, during user testing.

423
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:18,933
Something that was also very important that sometimes get overlooked was active feedback.

424
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:22,858
They put a lot of effort into trying to actually get it right.

425
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:29,067
Why it's important? Because active feedback is a way to highlight a rhythmic pattern of the interaction.

426
00:23:29,748 --> 00:23:32,711
Also, VR tends to be very loaded on the vision.

427
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,055
It tends to be visually very loaded.

428
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:39,339
So to actually provide feedbacks in a subtle way

429
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:41,721
through vibrations is actually a good thing.

430
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:45,646
It reduces the current load on the person.

431
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:49,308
But for example, let's look at the bow,

432
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:52,710
at the act of shooting the bow,

433
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,954
and how the active feedback comes into play

434
00:23:57,954 --> 00:23:59,595
to actually define or reinforces

435
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:02,497
the idea of a tempo of the interaction.

436
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:07,019
Reinforcing the idea of a certain rhythm,

437
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:09,741
and getting into a rhythmic pattern as using this object.

438
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:14,844
That's achieved by providing an active feedback

439
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,265
in key moment of the interaction.

440
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:20,488
like when the player touches the string,

441
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:21,868
first you get a first impulse,

442
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:23,829
then you get a longer one when you grab the strings,

443
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,270
then you get a progressive one

444
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,831
when the string gets pushed backward,

445
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:28,511
and then you get a shake.

446
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:30,292
So all of those active feedback

447
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,473
are there to actually mark a tempo in time,

448
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:34,975
that in turn gets the person

449
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,356
into a repetitive flow of movements

450
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:40,657
and getting into the repetition of those movements

451
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:42,538
like in a form of a static of interaction.

452
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:49,750
Something we didn't realize early on when we started working on the two weapons,

453
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,977
especially because the crossbow, as an idea, came further down into the game,

454
00:24:55,977 --> 00:25:00,502
was that the two, like these two weapons, like in games when you add a new weapon,

455
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:03,665
it's like adding more to what you already have.

456
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:10,250
But here it was really about adding an extra object.

457
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:17,316
And also demanding the person to actually re-learn a new set of movements.

458
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:20,078
Because the handling of the two objects is different.

459
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:24,822
The bow is something that, let's say you hold with your left hand and you operate it with your right hand.

460
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:26,603
The crossbow is the other way around.

461
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:28,905
You hold it with your right hand and you operate it with your left hand.

462
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:36,229
So, like, when you tend to use one object, you build up the muscle memory of that object,

463
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:39,831
and when you switch to another weapon, the muscle memory doesn't work anymore, you have

464
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,552
to relearn it.

465
00:25:41,552 --> 00:25:46,514
And that's, you know, it's a bit different, like, from games, where, like, ultimately

466
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:50,556
all the weapons really, like, you know, it boils down to pressing buttons, like, at least

467
00:25:50,556 --> 00:25:52,176
like a sensory motor level.

468
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,257
But here it's different.

469
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,512
So having new weapons required new conditioning and effort.

470
00:25:58,512 --> 00:26:01,373
Something has to be considered that we did not consider first,

471
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:03,294
but then we kind of like crashed onto it

472
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:06,175
and we had to work around it.

473
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:09,277
But the good news was that we found a way

474
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:10,977
to interpret these differences.

475
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:13,258
And instead of looking at them as two different weapons,

476
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:15,199
we started looking at them as two different classes,

477
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,240
two different ways of playing the game.

478
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,341
So they were like two different gameplay styles.

479
00:26:20,935 --> 00:26:23,036
And when we actually started looking in that way,

480
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:26,618
everything became like, in a way, like more productive

481
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:30,080
in a sense that we could see how we could imagine

482
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,002
two different communities of players forming out there,

483
00:26:33,002 --> 00:26:33,962
one that prefers the bow,

484
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,823
another one prefers the crossbow,

485
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:38,545
and start kind of like competing each other out

486
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:42,007
in performances around the idea of like designing,

487
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:45,228
like designing objects like in a different way.

488
00:26:47,165 --> 00:26:52,129
So here's where we had to go through a very intense user

489
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:54,611
testing session that was done remotely.

490
00:26:54,611 --> 00:26:56,613
Because at that point, the game was already in early

491
00:26:56,613 --> 00:27:01,216
access, so we got a few very dedicated players on board.

492
00:27:01,216 --> 00:27:03,498
They really wanted to test the new additions, one of which

493
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:04,779
was the new weapon.

494
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:07,982
And at the beginning, they hated it, because they were

495
00:27:07,982 --> 00:27:09,103
super good at playing the bow.

496
00:27:09,103 --> 00:27:11,084
And then suddenly, they have to relearn the things from

497
00:27:11,084 --> 00:27:13,306
scratch, and they didn't like it.

498
00:27:13,606 --> 00:27:18,271
But there wasn't really a way to be able to operate the crossbow the same way in which

499
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:18,812
you operate the bow.

500
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:20,674
It's like they're two different objects.

501
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:23,016
You can't really manipulate them in the same way.

502
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,300
So by doing something I've never done before, like some...

503
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:31,221
like remote user testing through Slack,

504
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:33,885
we were able to actually like work really well.

505
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,748
They were like incredibly passionate about the game,

506
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:38,610
so they start like commenting and talking to each other

507
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,612
how it works and what not, and that was like

508
00:27:40,612 --> 00:27:43,776
very good for me to keep a track of all those conversations.

509
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:48,737
And also what was really important was asking them to send me

510
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:51,678
video recording of their play sessions because it was

511
00:27:51,678 --> 00:27:56,099
really hard to understand, or it was really hard to read through what they were actually experiencing.

512
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:00,760
It was important to see what was happening really in the game.

513
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,141
So that was something I didn't expect to work out.

514
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:07,462
It could have worked out, but it worked out pretty well.

515
00:28:07,462 --> 00:28:09,103
So just to conclude...

516
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:12,460
forget any rules about like practical,

517
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:17,602
practical like trigs or practical like rule of thumbs here.

518
00:28:17,602 --> 00:28:18,502
Technology is changing.

519
00:28:18,502 --> 00:28:20,643
As the technology is changing,

520
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:23,024
the VR monoculus will look more and more like a person.

521
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:25,045
So the affordances will be different.

522
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:30,870
Like what's really a takeaway is not about how to do things in the details,

523
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:37,075
but to keep looking at people and keep looking at how people move.

524
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:40,417
So not only focus on what's happening on the screen and what's happening in the virtual world,

525
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:43,140
but look what people do, because that's where part of the fun is coming.

526
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:49,425
Part of the fun is coming from making an experience which is kinesthetic and fun in a kinesthetic way.

527
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:52,368
So in a sense, like practice dancing, in a sense,

528
00:28:52,368 --> 00:28:54,851
like reconnect to your body, like rediscover

529
00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:56,853
what's fun to do with your body, in a sense,

530
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:59,036
because that allows you to connect

531
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:01,779
to this idea of making beautiful experiences

532
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:02,900
through body movement.

533
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,667
And that concludes my talk, and I'm open for questions.

534
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:08,887
Thanks.

535
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:26,428
Yeah.

536
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:29,290
I have a lot of trouble using haptics in VR,

537
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,452
and especially when doing the up and down modulation

538
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:35,293
that you showed in a graph.

539
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:38,575
Can you share your technique with making that happen?

540
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:38,956
Technique.

541
00:29:39,672 --> 00:29:44,717
Yes, so the graph I showed is a very crude representation,

542
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:49,802
because haptic is like frequencies and amplifications.

543
00:29:49,802 --> 00:29:54,627
But what I did was basically having a similar approach

544
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,508
to motion design.

545
00:29:56,508 --> 00:30:00,813
So I made a way to actually modulate the haptics

546
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:02,414
through a couple of parameters.

547
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:08,097
And then I tweaked them until I was getting a response that I thought was actually good.

548
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,338
And then I also created different categories.

549
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:16,140
There's something that I call the haptic click, that mimics a click,

550
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:22,263
or it's kind of like a soft, rhythmic feedback.

551
00:30:22,263 --> 00:30:25,084
And then another one which is thicker and longer.

552
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:28,865
I don't really know a better way to describe it. It's a bit like describing sounds.

553
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:36,426
like taking it longer. And then like I remember something that worked really well. It was

554
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:41,371
like the shake on the bow. Like it's an up to feed, but it just like shakes like this.

555
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:44,855
Like it kind of like gives you the idea of like.

556
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,162
like energy that gets released into the object.

557
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:51,644
But the main concept really that I wanted to show

558
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:54,726
was really try to place it into key moments

559
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:55,446
of the interaction.

560
00:30:55,446 --> 00:30:57,467
Like try to imagine the interaction

561
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:59,408
almost like a dramaturgy.

562
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:01,770
And try to imagine what could be the point

563
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,711
where you want to make an emphasis in the tempo.

564
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:09,412
And that's at least what I found out was the most effective way to do it.

565
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:11,433
And then of course the user testing.

566
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:15,896
Sometimes I overdid it, I put too much of it and it was getting confusing.

567
00:31:15,896 --> 00:31:21,841
So as a little term, like in music, it's better to just be conservative and not add too much

568
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:22,301
on it.

569
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:25,443
Thank you very much.

570
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:29,772
How closely did the design of the UX elements

571
00:31:29,772 --> 00:31:32,194
that you were just demonstrating tie in with the UI elements?

572
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,835
For instance, the little bar that you can see on the bow,

573
00:31:34,835 --> 00:31:35,655
on the other hand.

574
00:31:35,655 --> 00:31:40,197
Did you guys experiment with using UI elements that were,

575
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:43,039
I guess, more attached to the camera?

576
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,341
Or was it an immediate thought that we're just

577
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:50,422
going to have diegetic UI design and have that as part

578
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:51,242
of the props themselves?

579
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:51,743
Yeah.

580
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,003
Thanks.

581
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:56,105
That's how to recap on this.

582
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:04,307
This, it's been like, we didn't want to have UIs on the camera at the beginning, even though

583
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:09,613
I was one of those pushing for it, like, to have some of this information on, you know,

584
00:32:09,613 --> 00:32:11,695
attached to the camera.

585
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:17,620
So the health specifically ended up to be, like, in the bow, because we kind of wanted

586
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,422
to have it visible as you were shooting.

587
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:24,522
Other type of UIs maybe, that I never thought to go over here,

588
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:26,324
was how you actually select the arrows.

589
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:26,805
Because...

590
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:31,442
I didn't mention that you can have like power up arrows and all these kind of things.

591
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:35,564
And like you can carry those arrows with you in some form of inventory.

592
00:32:35,564 --> 00:32:39,566
And that was kind of like a more challenging UX UI type of thing.

593
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:46,811
Because at some point we tried to work it out in a way that was user friendly.

594
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:48,232
Let's put it in that way.

595
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,893
Try to have it like with smooth animations and everything.

596
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:56,638
But then it really broke against the fast-pacedness of the game.

597
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:58,939
When it was getting really fast-paced,

598
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:02,522
and when it was getting really just intense,

599
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,163
that was just in the way.

600
00:33:03,163 --> 00:33:07,026
So we stripped it down to something much more basic

601
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,067
that literally appears and disappears.

602
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:12,690
But what we did was to play with time.

603
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,672
And actually, we did time dilation.

604
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:18,395
because the action can be so frantic,

605
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:21,436
and you might feel actually so overwhelmed

606
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:22,657
with everything that happens around you,

607
00:33:22,657 --> 00:33:26,398
which is kind of threatening.

608
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,960
We basically slow down time every time you open

609
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,442
any of those UI for selecting arrows.

610
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:38,283
It was thought out to be a way to help the people

611
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,024
to actually select the arrows properly,

612
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:42,305
but then it became a trick the players exploited

613
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:43,706
to actually do better.

614
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,522
you know, the game. So, you know, it turned out in those ways.

615
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:50,264
So there wasn't like, just to recap,

616
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:54,108
like we didn't really did like a very intense thinking

617
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:56,229
about like where to place, like the UIs,

618
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:59,192
we knew that we wanted to minimize it as much as possible

619
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:01,794
and really just make it about like the action.

620
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:06,157
And in fact, we, like the only kind of like UI augmentation

621
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:09,760
we did were the one that you see there,

622
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,263
like the health plus, like the selection of the arrows.

623
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:14,188
Thank you.

624
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:15,349
Thanks.

625
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:19,232
I have a follow up question about the Haptecs.

626
00:34:19,232 --> 00:34:22,374
So did you design them as audio waveforms

627
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:25,296
that are parameterized so that they change procedurally?

628
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,197
Or did you do something else for that?

629
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:29,419
No, I wanted to design them as sound waves.

630
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:32,041
There was no time for that.

631
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:35,823
So I designed them as animation curves.

632
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,625
that they were just like bound between zero and one.

633
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,506
So they were like normalized,

634
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:43,388
but then you could add parameters to them

635
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:46,230
to kind of change them in terms of like length, amplitude.

636
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,171
So those are the kind of parameters that I was changing.

637
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:51,233
So probably there was like a better way

638
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:54,876
to make it like more refined in terms of active feedback.

639
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:57,217
I'm pretty sure like if you talk to someone

640
00:34:57,217 --> 00:34:59,018
which is very expert of active feedback,

641
00:34:59,018 --> 00:35:00,579
can tell you like a much better way to do it.

642
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,461
For me, from the point of view of the interaction design and the general UX,

643
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:08,362
it was important to nail that concept of rhythm.

644
00:35:08,362 --> 00:35:10,462
Like, when do we want to have them?

645
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:13,043
At what point of the interaction do we want to have them?

646
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,984
And it's like, what types of active feedback do we want to have?

647
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:17,964
How long it is, how intense it is?

648
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:20,225
As I said before, to classify them into things.

649
00:35:20,225 --> 00:35:24,866
But I was really keen to actually try the sound waves

650
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:27,007
and see what would come out of it.

651
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:35,093
I don't even know if the controllers that we have at the moment are actually responding

652
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:37,855
very deeply to this kind of sine wave optics.

653
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:41,857
So I was actually wondering about that too because I've been struggling with the same

654
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:44,979
kinds of things in optics right now.

655
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:51,303
And Oculus controllers versus the Vive controllers have very different haptic profiles.

656
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:54,507
Did you do custom curves for both of those?

657
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:57,010
And do you actually have amplitude up and down

658
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,833
kinds of stuff in your animation curves?

659
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:02,017
Because if you just drive a single animation curve,

660
00:36:02,017 --> 00:36:03,840
it doesn't really feel like anything,

661
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,222
at least in the experiments I've done.

662
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:07,104
Yeah, we did.

663
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:08,907
Mostly, they are the same.

664
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:12,989
like optic curves, let's call them that way.

665
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,829
Mostly they are the same, but in a few occasions

666
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:16,690
I remember we have to actually make them different

667
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,110
for platforms.

668
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,591
So, because like the vibe is very different.

669
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:22,012
The Oculus was much better from this point of view.

670
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,512
It like give you a much better response.

671
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:25,713
Also like in terms of kind of like identifying

672
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:27,454
a different type of optic, you know,

673
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:30,555
in terms of like, you know, how long was the optic click

674
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,256
or the intensity of it, that really was better.

675
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:38,258
But yeah, all in all, we actually kind of like moved

676
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:42,983
kind of carefully around it because we didn't want to overdo it, but also like we didn't

677
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:45,366
know how far we could go with the platforms we are in.

678
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:52,435
So we took it like little by little, adding like, you know, little by little every now

679
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:54,137
and then and see like if it was improving.

680
00:36:54,137 --> 00:36:54,778
Thank you so much.

681
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:54,998
Thanks.

682
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,390
Hi.

683
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,791
Thank you so much for your talk, by the way.

684
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:02,051
Yeah.

685
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:04,972
So I found it really interesting.

686
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,534
You know, you mentioned the remote user research.

687
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:09,634
I found it really interesting how

688
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:12,216
you were able to get your users to collaborate

689
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:14,677
within their group.

690
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:17,438
Can you talk to how you were able to set that up

691
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:21,060
and how you found the users, how you facilitated the channel?

692
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,240
Yeah.

693
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:25,605
About the collaboration, I have to say we were lucky.

694
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,967
They were just talking, they were out of passion,

695
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:30,289
they were just talking about themselves.

696
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,772
We set it up as internal beta testers,

697
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:37,255
officially they were internal beta testers.

698
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,657
But then I recruited them into the user testing

699
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:41,678
of the crossbow.

700
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:44,661
The way we did it was simply by releasing

701
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:46,302
the prototype of the crossbow into the game.

702
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:49,579
And tell them, like, okay, that's a new thing.

703
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:52,301
Like, just go, like, go wide with it.

704
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:54,344
We did not anticipate anything, really.

705
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:56,326
I wanted to get, like, the most kind of, like,

706
00:37:56,326 --> 00:37:59,209
pure, in a sense, environment possible.

707
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:00,230
And, um...

708
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:03,768
And then what we did was like,

709
00:38:03,768 --> 00:38:05,709
we didn't really think that through

710
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:08,010
because I wasn't even thinking that was a good idea

711
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,211
to do it remotely.

712
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:12,193
But what we did was just to have a channel on Slack

713
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,673
and they were like talking.

714
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:14,734
They were like in the channel

715
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:17,476
and they were like talking out each other in the channel.

716
00:38:17,476 --> 00:38:19,237
And that allowed me to listen a lot.

717
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:20,557
They were like talking so much

718
00:38:20,557 --> 00:38:22,318
and they were like typing so much.

719
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:24,039
How many people were there?

720
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:24,880
Many people?

721
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,162
We got like, I think it was like four or five beta testers

722
00:38:29,162 --> 00:38:29,362
on board.

723
00:38:29,762 --> 00:38:34,784
And they were like, you know, by the time they got into the beta testing,

724
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:37,525
they already had like hundreds of hours on their shoulders.

725
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:43,068
So they were really, really, like, they really built a lot of muscle memory for the boat.

726
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:45,909
So the beginning was like, we did something crazy.

727
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:50,050
Like we switched a teleportation device from one end to another one

728
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,991
and they couldn't play the game anymore.

729
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:55,052
So that was like the thing that we did.

730
00:38:55,052 --> 00:38:59,134
But then I have to say, very, very important was to actually get the video playback.

731
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:04,075
from them like the video recording to send them on Slack and just like to send them on Slack

732
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:08,558
and then like kind of like organize as a forum like free to comment on it and that was giving

733
00:39:08,558 --> 00:39:12,141
me a lot of information in the back lines. Awesome, thank you. Thanks.
