1
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:11,471
I'm Carol Shaw. I've been a producer for a long time. I'm going to talk like years, like 15 years or something.

2
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:16,072
I'm going to talk about different specializations in production today.

3
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:21,734
And specifically, I'm going to give you, it's a more pragmatic and practical presentation about

4
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:25,355
the seemingly endless new and different types of production roles

5
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:27,436
and how to match up a particular role.

6
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,938
with your skills and interests.

7
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:30,959
So this is more about,

8
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:34,061
you don't wanna just be a general producer,

9
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,663
but you have maybe something special to grade at,

10
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:39,045
and you wanna figure out how to leverage that

11
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,047
into a specialized production role.

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,450
It's also a talk about how to adapt your production style,

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,551
this is all about style,

14
00:00:47,652 --> 00:00:49,173
to different situations before

15
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:51,255
and during and after development.

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,302
And it's also a talk about production methodologies

17
00:00:56,503 --> 00:01:01,225
and how to work with them when you start a new project

18
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:02,666
or join a project that's already in.

19
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:04,687
So this one represents Agile.

20
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:07,529
And we're also going to talk a little about Waterfall.

21
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:10,370
I'm going to adjust one thing really quick.

22
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:15,613
Or I'm not.

23
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:16,754
But that's cool.

24
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,240
In larger projects, we're going to dig right in.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,165
In larger projects, producers end up supporting many different disciplines.

26
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:29,829
In smaller projects, they can support many multiple areas.

27
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:34,894
When I joined Spore as a producer, I was managing different parts of the project.

28
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:38,597
But by the end of the project, after we'd ramped the team up, I had, you know,

29
00:01:38,617 --> 00:01:42,040
moved my interests into the two areas where I had more expertise.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,740
So I had some time while the project was spinning up

31
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,081
to work on lots of different areas.

32
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,401
But by the end of it, I was fairly specialized

33
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:50,322
and working mostly with the online components

34
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:52,803
and working with PR and marketing.

35
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,763
So I was a producer that was a little bit more focused

36
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:56,544
looking outward from the project

37
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:58,184
rather than looking inward at the project.

38
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:01,365
The four primary areas we're gonna talk about

39
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,026
regarding disciplines in game development

40
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:04,646
are gonna be art.

41
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:08,848
And that includes both external outsourced art,

42
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:10,908
internal art, and UI.

43
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:13,330
We're going to talk a little bit about engineering.

44
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,331
Oh, there it goes.

45
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:17,174
That's what engineers look like when they code.

46
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:18,696
Producers didn't know that.

47
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:21,719
We're going to talk a little bit about design and production

48
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,541
for design, specific production for design.

49
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,302
And we're going to talk about online.

50
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:26,884
And it's kind of hard to see that slide,

51
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:30,528
but it's a slide of available servers for an online game.

52
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,375
Before we jump into all that though, I want to talk

53
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:37,240
about the different gradations of game development

54
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,525
within organizational structures.

55
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:43,172
So initially you, whoa, hey guy.

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,701
Initially, you have a game.

57
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,263
It's a single game or a single project based around one IP.

58
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:54,384
And that's kind of the most fundamental project

59
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:55,985
that would need some sort of production help.

60
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,526
A good example, I mean, there's a million of them,

61
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:01,308
but like Gone Home is one game by one studio

62
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:02,608
that is about one IP.

63
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:05,293
But then you start adding in other things,

64
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,134
and you have a franchise.

65
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:09,855
So this would be multiple games or products

66
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:12,396
that are related to one specific franchise.

67
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:14,357
So this is a good example.

68
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:16,557
I like to use this The Sims, which I worked on as well.

69
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:18,618
And that one's a game where there's

70
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,079
multiple iterations of The Sims.

71
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:23,940
There's Sims 1, and Sims 2, and Sims 4, and maybe a Sims 7.

72
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,961
And then there's all of the content packs

73
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:26,841
that come along with it.

74
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:28,202
Franchise.

75
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:31,243
that's gonna be a franchise, so that's gonna be

76
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:34,385
multiple products that are based around one IP.

77
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:36,426
When you add a bunch of those together,

78
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:39,668
what you end up with is a studio.

79
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:41,409
So that's gonna be multiple games or projects

80
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,570
based around multiple IPs.

81
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,311
So a good studio that's an example of that,

82
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:47,332
I think, is Double Fine.

83
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:49,753
So they released Psychonauts 1 years ago.

84
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:51,975
They're working on Psychonauts 2.

85
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:53,956
They just released a VR product

86
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:56,437
that's Psychonauts and the Rhombus of Ruin.

87
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:58,638
So, you can look at them and say, like, they have,

88
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,478
and then they have other one-off games,

89
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:04,719
like Broken Age and Headlander that they made that,

90
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,980
sorry, I have a little bit of a sore throat

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
because it's GDC, so hang on.

92
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:15,302
So, you can look at them and understand

93
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:18,603
that they're more of a studio with different IPs

94
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:19,763
with different products around them.

95
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:21,123
And then next...

96
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,791
you end up, if you have lots of different studios

97
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:25,831
that are all grouped together,

98
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,732
that's more of a corporate entity.

99
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:29,192
That's gonna be something like an EA.

100
00:04:29,673 --> 00:04:32,013
So within EA, there's a lot of different studios.

101
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:33,194
One example is Visceral.

102
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:37,075
But Visceral has many projects that have multiple games

103
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:39,436
based around individual franchises,

104
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:41,037
but also do multiple franchises.

105
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:42,918
So Visceral does Dead Space,

106
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,158
and there's multiple Dead Spaces.

107
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:46,139
They did Godfather, there was multiple Godfathers.

108
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:48,639
But they also, BioWare is also part of EA,

109
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:51,221
and they have Mass Effect and all the Mass Effect products,

110
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:54,544
and then they have Dragon Age and all the Dragon Age products.

111
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:57,026
So that's what you kind of get up to the corporate level.

112
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:02,598
And then next, this is supposed to represent publishing,

113
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:04,219
which I had a really hard time figuring out

114
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,960
how to represent a publishing producer.

115
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,342
But publishing, a video game publisher is a company

116
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:10,763
that publishes video games

117
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:12,304
that they've either developed internally

118
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,265
or they publish those created

119
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:16,206
by an independent video game developer.

120
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:19,127
So they might draw in games from other studios

121
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,008
that they help publish.

122
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,709
And typically they manage the marketing.

123
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:23,750
Sometimes they help out with the QA

124
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,271
and user experience testing.

125
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:28,392
And they often handle distribution.

126
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,754
So, you know, Sony and Microsoft have big publishing arms.

127
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:34,895
So, they're big corporate entities

128
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,397
that have multiple internal game studios typically.

129
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:40,098
They also make hardware, but they also have a publishing arm

130
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:41,819
and you'll see stuff published by Sony

131
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,319
like Journey was published by Sony.

132
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,620
If you play that game, you should.

133
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,521
It's a great game.

134
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:53,718
Now that you have a good overview of what the different corporate structure of all the

135
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:57,319
different game development opportunities that are out there, what I want to start doing

136
00:05:57,359 --> 00:06:01,320
is talking about the different specializations that you'll find within some of those different

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,780
companies.

138
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:06,762
And basically I'm going to go through it the way I talked about those disciplines, so art,

139
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,023
engineering, design, and online.

140
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:13,864
We're going to talk about the different specializations of producers within those different disciplines.

141
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:16,902
So we're gonna start with Art Outsourcing Producer,

142
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:19,423
which is a very specialized version of an art producer.

143
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:23,584
Typically, art can be produced in lots of different ways,

144
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:25,885
and very few, unless they're very small studios,

145
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:27,566
produce all their own art anymore.

146
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:33,088
Often they outsource art to cheaper overseas organizations.

147
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:34,428
Doesn't matter where you live,

148
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,229
somebody is always going to be overseas from you.

149
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:41,471
And basically, they need somebody who's going to run that part of the business.

150
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,753
So the things that you're going to spend your time in,

151
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:47,215
if you do an art outsourcing producer job, you're going to be in email a lot.

152
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:50,757
You're going to be in Excel a lot, both to keep organization of your project,

153
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:54,959
Excel or Google Docs, because you're also going to be worried about the budget.

154
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,400
You're going to have to work in all different time zones,

155
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,262
because you're going to be having calls and meetings to review stuff

156
00:07:00,302 --> 00:07:01,243
at all different times.

157
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:04,585
But you're also going to need to have somewhat of an art eye.

158
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:06,626
So you're going to need to be able to give the art director.

159
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:08,927
feedback on the art that you're receiving,

160
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:11,388
whether it hits his or her quality bar

161
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:12,148
that you're looking for.

162
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:16,530
Because basically, the art outsourcing producer might say,

163
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,651
okay, we're gonna do all the concept art internally,

164
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,612
and then we're gonna outsource the modeling and the rigging,

165
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:23,173
and then we're gonna get it back

166
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,014
and do all the texturing and animation.

167
00:07:25,114 --> 00:07:28,155
So coordinating all of that isn't gonna be an artist's job.

168
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,216
That's gonna be an art outsourcing producer's job

169
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:31,777
to make sure that everything kind of

170
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,077
goes down along that path.

171
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:39,293
The skills that you're going to want to bring to that are going to be like a very,

172
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:43,534
very highly attuned attention to detail because stuff can just get lost,

173
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:46,675
particularly when you're dealing with outsourcing houses that don't

174
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:50,056
necessarily have English as their first language if English is your first language.

175
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:53,617
But you need to be able to manage that and keep things in order.

176
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:58,523
There's some good and bad things about each one of these,

177
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:00,045
and I talk to a lot of different people.

178
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,309
I've never personally been an outsourcing producer,

179
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,672
but I have a friend named Sarah,

180
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:08,017
who was one for me at another game company

181
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:09,199
that I worked at called Njimoko.

182
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,583
And I asked her what she liked about it, and she said her favorite thing about it was managing

183
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:18,126
the relationships, because she got to meet people from all over the place and help manage

184
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:20,608
the relationship to get something done together as a group.

185
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,031
And working with people and understanding their needs and what fulfills them, that was

186
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:27,092
her reason for wanting to do that job.

187
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:29,754
But for her, the negative was that she felt

188
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:31,415
really external to the game team.

189
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:33,437
Like, she was often isolated in her work.

190
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:35,818
She didn't really work on the game itself.

191
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,200
And that felt somewhat isolating to her,

192
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,081
and it wasn't an ideal career path for her.

193
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:42,182
But if you're somebody who's maybe a little bit

194
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:43,703
more introverted, and you like art,

195
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,185
but you're not an artist, it could be a pretty good role

196
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,025
for you to think about.

197
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:52,069
Next is sort of an art-adjacent producer.

198
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,412
You're not an art producer, but UI is a type of art.

199
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,522
So you're not doing environment art, you're not doing character art.

200
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:05,686
The UI art's a really important part of the game development process as anybody who's

201
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:09,548
made a game, unless you've made one that had no UI, which there are some of those that

202
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:09,788
work.

203
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:11,490
But it's really challenging.

204
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,370
It's a good challenge.

205
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:16,873
You're going to focus on both 2D and 3D art typically.

206
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:19,656
You're gonna have some experience working

207
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:21,117
with user experience design,

208
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:23,359
and you're probably still gonna work with engineers.

209
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,160
So I did this job a little bit

210
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,541
when I was working at Telltale Games,

211
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:30,625
and I found that it was a really interesting role for me

212
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:32,566
because I liked working with both artists,

213
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:34,928
the UI artists and the developers

214
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,330
who were actually doing the UI engineering.

215
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:41,692
And I really enjoyed my time there and my background

216
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:44,313
in doing user experience was super helpful there.

217
00:09:44,393 --> 00:09:48,013
So if you've done some user experience learning

218
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:50,794
at some point in your career, this is a really good area

219
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:52,994
because the first time user experience is an extremely

220
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:57,175
important part of the UI process and I loved working on that.

221
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,775
Like for me, I worked with a producer for a while

222
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:02,516
and she always said like the first five minutes of the game.

223
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:05,676
This was more for AAA games or it's more compact

224
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:06,577
for mobile games now.

225
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:08,218
But the first five minutes of the game

226
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:09,078
were the most important,

227
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:10,019
because that was when the player

228
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,341
was gonna either play the game or quit the game.

229
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,802
So the first time user experience

230
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,003
is a really important part of the game to develop.

231
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:18,065
And the UI team is typically in charge

232
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,786
of that entry tutorial.

233
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:21,968
And for me it was really interesting

234
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,809
because I got to mediate a lot of discussions

235
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:26,652
between a UI artist who wanted something beautiful

236
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:29,354
and really cool and really interesting,

237
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:30,675
and the UI engineer who said,

238
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:33,717
yeah, we don't have time and our engine doesn't do that.

239
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:38,362
So you kind of become that person who is the mediator between those two things.

240
00:10:38,882 --> 00:10:41,565
And that's the production role you fill there and

241
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:44,728
you facilitate some sort of an understanding between those two groups.

242
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:48,913
So that you get the best thing that you can for your customers.

243
00:10:48,953 --> 00:10:50,474
And it's a really customer focused role.

244
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:51,696
I think that's what I liked about it.

245
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,472
Again, sort of staying in that UI and customer appreciation area,

246
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,074
I like to put localization producers here, too.

247
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:05,676
That's another very specific specialized production role.

248
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,698
It's really good if you already know multiple languages.

249
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:13,100
It's definitely a role where there's a lot of opportunities.

250
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,641
Like I haven't met the game company yet.

251
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:17,903
that said, if I could find a good localization person,

252
00:11:17,963 --> 00:11:18,823
I just wouldn't hire them.

253
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:20,404
Like, everybody wants them.

254
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:22,505
They're not easy to come by.

255
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,826
Your focus is really going to be working

256
00:11:24,886 --> 00:11:27,868
on getting the translations created for the games,

257
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:30,149
probably working with an outsourced house to get that done.

258
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,571
And localization integration testing,

259
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,651
which is everything from,

260
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,733
is the translator giving me stuff that is...

261
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:40,356
appropriate for the language of the country.

262
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:42,877
So, if it's translated, does it still make sense?

263
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:44,939
And if it's a funny game, does it still funny?

264
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:47,701
If it's a serious game, is the translation still serious

265
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,182
and does it get the same point across?

266
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:53,805
Having a background in QA or working for one

267
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:55,427
of these translation companies that's out there,

268
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,389
both good areas for you to have

269
00:11:58,449 --> 00:11:59,810
if you want to go down this road.

270
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,252
Although, if you can get a job as an associate producer

271
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:05,554
and tell someone, you know, I also speak Spanish

272
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:07,035
and I'm really interested in localization.

273
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:09,259
you're gonna be fine.

274
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:11,521
Like, people are always looking for localization folks.

275
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,503
Again, it's another one of those where attention to detail

276
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:16,384
is probably the most important thing

277
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,365
that you can bring to the table,

278
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,107
because you're typically gonna be managing anywhere from,

279
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:22,908
if you're just doing e-figs,

280
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:26,190
you'll have like three or four different languages,

281
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,791
and I think Spore shipped in like 21 languages.

282
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:31,453
So, it's a pretty wide variety of things,

283
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:33,474
and you get some kind of interesting problems,

284
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:36,356
like in Spore, which is a game I worked on for EA.

285
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:40,645
We did it in Thai, and Thai is not a character high,

286
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:42,245
it's a character and a half high,

287
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:45,767
and that really wreaked havoc with the UI of the game

288
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,468
because nothing fit.

289
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,249
Like when the translations went in,

290
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,769
we're like, oh, that's terrible.

291
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,250
And so then you end up working

292
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,931
with both the translation team,

293
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:55,812
but you also end up working with the UI team

294
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:57,453
to make the UI dynamic.

295
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,694
So you get to work with a bunch of different people,

296
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:01,635
and it can actually be a really interesting job.

297
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:08,456
So, you know, one of the things that I think is an awesome piece

298
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:09,898
about doing localization processing.

299
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:13,038
is it also makes games more accessible for more people,

300
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,579
which I think is just cool.

301
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:15,999
Like I just think that's a really good thing

302
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,220
in our industry for anybody to be able to play any game

303
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,221
is just a worthy goal.

304
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:23,382
But I also feel like there's,

305
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:25,622
and this I only have anecdotal information about this

306
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:27,703
from a couple of the different games I worked on

307
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,343
that were highly pirated,

308
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:32,585
is that localizing actually decreases piracy.

309
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,625
Because a lot of times people in countries

310
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,546
that don't get games in their native language,

311
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:39,368
will buy a pirated version that's been done in their language,

312
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:41,470
whereas if you offer it in that language,

313
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,492
they will give you money for it, which is so crazy.

314
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:48,996
So I think that there's a big case to be made for localization.

315
00:13:49,056 --> 00:13:53,059
There's a big case to be made for having a dedicated localization producer managing that.

316
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,922
Again, this can be a fairly isolating role, though,

317
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:58,384
because you're not typically working on the game features.

318
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:01,254
You might be coming in towards the end of the project,

319
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:03,635
so you might not even see the game while it's in development.

320
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,035
And to me, that's also a really fun part

321
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,956
of being in game development is seeing it be super crappy

322
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:10,116
and then get super awesome.

323
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:13,477
So, you know, it can be a hard role

324
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:16,477
if you feel like the need to be, you know,

325
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,657
in on the ground for a game development project.

326
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:21,658
So, let's shift gears a little bit and start talking

327
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:24,638
about the engineering specialized producers.

328
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:27,119
And we're going to start with the game director.

329
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:28,239
Sorry.

330
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,158
We're going to start with Development Director.

331
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,463
So Development Director is a good production specialization

332
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:37,046
path that you can go down if you're a producer.

333
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:38,728
And typically, you're going to do this

334
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:41,210
if you're really interested in scheduling and project

335
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:41,711
management.

336
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:48,238
Excuse me.

337
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:53,760
Typically, you're going to be doing things like putting together schedules for projects.

338
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,642
You're doing a lot of, you know, use a traffic cop.

339
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,504
You're doing a lot of, like, you over here get this done.

340
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,865
You over there get that done.

341
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:05,788
And you're doing a lot of facilitation of mostly engineers trying to get their jobs

342
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:06,048
done.

343
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:10,871
And it can be a really satisfying role, and I'm going to tell you why in one second.

344
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:16,195
I have a friend, a very good friend I've worked with for a long time who's development director.

345
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:19,748
I asked her for a reason.

346
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:20,930
I haven't been a development director,

347
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,173
so I didn't have like a, why would I love this job?

348
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,836
Because I don't actually think I would love the job.

349
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:26,658
So I couldn't make up something there.

350
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,501
So I asked her, and I'm gonna read you a quote

351
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:29,062
that she gave me.

352
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:31,064
She wrote, I love working with engineers.

353
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:32,907
One of the great fallacies of engineering

354
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:34,509
is that it's not a creative discipline.

355
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,211
and that could not be less true.

356
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:38,393
One of the hallmarks of a great engineer

357
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:40,935
is their ability to function as an elegant thinker

358
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:42,757
who is able to cut to the heart of a problem

359
00:15:42,797 --> 00:15:44,078
with efficiency and grace.

360
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,580
That takes incredible focus and creativity,

361
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,163
and the ability to harass a bunch of brilliant,

362
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:51,065
creative minds to do great work

363
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:52,926
is what gets me out of bed in the morning.

364
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:54,748
And I actually love that quote,

365
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:56,389
because it makes me actually think,

366
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,812
oh, maybe it would be cool to be a development director.

367
00:15:59,212 --> 00:16:00,673
And I think if you can look at engineers,

368
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:01,174
and it's a,

369
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,700
Grace Hopper, Alan Turing, and Ada Lovelace,

370
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,061
who are the three engineers that my engineers I work with,

371
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:08,801
were like, those are my three favorite engineers

372
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,061
that I think are just brilliant.

373
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:13,942
If you can work with those types of minds

374
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:15,203
and get good work out of them,

375
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,623
I can imagine that being a fairly satisfying career path.

376
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:20,944
And you're doing a lot of scheduling

377
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:22,744
and you're keeping things a lot on track.

378
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:24,985
In fact, if things go off track,

379
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,005
it's probably going to be seen as your fault.

380
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:31,594
And that's definitely one of the minuses of this whole situation.

381
00:16:31,914 --> 00:16:34,255
When things go well, no one really considers why that is.

382
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:38,416
But when things go bad, you're typically holding the bag as the development director.

383
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,436
So there's a really high level of responsibility.

384
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:45,698
So this is a good role for you if you are interested in scheduling, you're interested

385
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:50,519
in management, you like working with technical brilliant minds, and you like having a high

386
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,719
level of responsibility for the success of your project.

387
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,340
Like there's a big risk reward payoff in the development director world.

388
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:01,241
Okay, so this is what I do now.

389
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,882
I'm a technical program manager for Amazon.

390
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:05,623
I work on the Lumberyard game engine.

391
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:08,043
And I put this in not because I work

392
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,144
at a game development company anymore,

393
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:11,524
I work for a game engine company,

394
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,605
of which there are quite a few now.

395
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:15,525
Like Lumberyard's only one of them.

396
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:19,627
There's Unity, there's Crytek, and there's Unreal.

397
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:20,927
So there's a lot of different jobs,

398
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,028
and within a lot of large technical companies.

399
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:29,450
There are also a lot of different, more technical roles.

400
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,811
When I came to Amazon, they were like, what do you do?

401
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,391
And I was like, I'm an executive producer.

402
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:36,532
And they said, yeah, we don't have that job family here.

403
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:39,493
And I had to sit down with the management and say like,

404
00:17:39,553 --> 00:17:41,614
okay, if you don't have that job family here,

405
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,014
let's figure out what my skills are

406
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:44,855
and where they're gonna be most applicable.

407
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,456
And what we came up with was a technical program manager.

408
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,199
And it's a fairly high-level job at Amazon.

409
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,520
It's like a career path job.

410
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,941
It's not like an entry-level job.

411
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:56,663
And basically, my job means that I manage

412
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,986
multiple ongoing interdependent projects

413
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:01,288
across different functional groups.

414
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:05,311
I coordinate roadmaps, I plan releases, I run sprints,

415
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:08,434
I run triages, and I assign bugs to engineers.

416
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:11,076
And I needed to have a basic understanding.

417
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:12,097
This is kind of what got me

418
00:18:12,117 --> 00:18:13,859
and got the technical in front of my name.

419
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,942
is I needed to have an understanding of how engineers do their jobs,

420
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:20,425
which I have from just years of working with engineers.

421
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:23,587
So again, this is another role where if you like working with engineers

422
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:27,771
and you like seeing everything kind of come together and be wonderful,

423
00:18:28,452 --> 00:18:30,113
this is a good one for you.

424
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:33,836
So before I did computer stuff, I was a cook.

425
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:38,160
I was a line cook. I used to take orders and put them up and I ran the kitchen.

426
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,321
So I was the grill cook and I...

427
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:43,608
I had the guy on my left who was making salads and I had the guy on my right who was doing

428
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:45,349
saute pans and I did all the grilling.

429
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:50,752
And it was my job to make sure that everybody's food came out at exactly the same time and

430
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,334
was beautiful.

431
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:55,235
And I kind of think that's what I do in my job now.

432
00:18:56,236 --> 00:19:00,299
Basically I'm coordinating all of the different projects to come together at the same time

433
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:04,662
and get out and be exactly what we want so that our customers will want to keep coming

434
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:05,202
back for more.

435
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:11,930
The other part of my job that I really like that's really the interesting creative piece

436
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,395
of my job is that I ensure that technical design and implementation meet the product

437
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:17,955
requirements.

438
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:21,959
So I work pretty closely with product managers who are coming up with the ideas of things

439
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:26,403
that can be in the product and help make sure that everybody on the product knows the right

440
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:28,204
thing to do to get that outcome.

441
00:19:28,224 --> 00:19:31,047
So that's the more satisfying parts of my job.

442
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:34,737
It has some ups and downs, I'll say that about it.

443
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:39,798
You know, I definitely feel like it's not as creative

444
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:41,939
as some of the roles I've held in the past.

445
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,140
I'm not doing the product management side,

446
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,341
so I'm not creating as much as I have

447
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:49,061
with regards to technical project specs.

448
00:19:50,202 --> 00:19:51,622
And that's fine with me,

449
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:53,003
because there's other parts of my job

450
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:53,863
that are very challenging,

451
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,423
and I love the engineers I work with.

452
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:57,324
I'm not working with artists anymore,

453
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,504
and I kind of miss seeing art.

454
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,744
And it makes me go out and play more indie games,

455
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,665
because I just crave sort of seeing

456
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:05,405
wacky, crazy art in my world that I don't see at my job.

457
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:08,186
So I think when you're being a development director

458
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:10,587
or a technical program manager, you have to kind of commit

459
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,807
and say, what I want to do is I want to manage projects

460
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,027
and be successful at that.

461
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,828
And I need to let go of maybe some of the creative aspects,

462
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:19,328
or maybe I'm not that interested in that.

463
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:21,489
Satisfying for me about game development

464
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:22,749
is getting the job done.

465
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,003
So, talking a little bit, like switching gears again

466
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:28,864
and talking a little bit about online.

467
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:33,305
So, mobile product manager is a new sort of avenue

468
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,625
for producers to go down.

469
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:36,665
And this is one that's a little more appropriate

470
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:37,666
for most mobile games.

471
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:40,306
Like most mobile companies have one or more

472
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,526
mobile product managers.

473
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,087
And then they tend to be a little bit more focused

474
00:20:44,147 --> 00:20:45,687
on things like customer retention,

475
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:49,228
player behavior analysis, things like revenue generation

476
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:53,369
are really big areas of study for mobile product managers.

477
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,678
They usually collaborate with designers, so there's a lot of opportunity for them to give

478
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:04,599
some creative input in their job.

479
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,680
And they usually have monthly, quarterly, and annual revenue targets.

480
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,702
So if you're somebody who thinks, you know, one of the things I really enjoy is having

481
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:17,185
a way to quantify whether my job is going to think I'm successful in my job, there is

482
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:19,566
no better way to do that than to make money for your company.

483
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,488
Because people will notice it and you will get credit for it.

484
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:28,891
So if that gives you a lot of satisfaction at work, this is definitely an area for you

485
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:29,392
to consider.

486
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:35,856
If you have a business background, if you're into data analysis, if you like statistical

487
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:39,358
analysis, this is another really good area for you to be in.

488
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:45,883
It's a really good training ground for sort of executive management, not necessarily project

489
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:52,089
management, but executive management within a small to medium-sized company.

490
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:58,935
One of the ups that I found from working with product managers that they really enjoyed

491
00:21:58,975 --> 00:22:03,519
is they spent almost their whole job worrying about customers.

492
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,921
I worry about, am I going to get to the finish line in time?

493
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:10,140
they worry about is the customer going to get to the finish line in time.

494
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:14,904
And I think that that's a pretty satisfying way to think about your job.

495
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:18,587
Another really important piece of it is, you know, if you're at a small company

496
00:22:19,227 --> 00:22:22,470
and you're a good product manager, you're helping pay the bills for the company.

497
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,762
So your coworkers can pay their rent and you guys can have pizza and things are good because

498
00:22:28,802 --> 00:22:32,304
your product manager is thinking about how to generate revenue all along the way.

499
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:35,245
And that's a really nice feeling to pay rent.

500
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:36,826
I enjoy it.

501
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:37,766
It's a good thing to do.

502
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:40,528
It's also a pretty new area.

503
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,308
Like mobile hasn't been around that long.

504
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:46,650
And that means that there's a lot of room for innovation and experimentation.

505
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,031
So if you're a person who says like.

506
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:49,479
I think this might work.

507
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:53,822
And you can make a data analysis that it will work.

508
00:22:54,162 --> 00:22:56,183
You can almost always find a manager who's going to say,

509
00:22:56,203 --> 00:22:57,044
yeah, let's give it a go.

510
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,705
Let's see if your idea works.

511
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:01,006
And they won't all work, but most of the companies

512
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,408
that have people like mobile product managers

513
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:06,690
are OK having some measured amount of risk

514
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,451
in the types of things that they do,

515
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,273
because some stuff works and some stuff doesn't.

516
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:12,534
And if it does work, you have clash of clans.

517
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:13,355
So not too bad.

518
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,592
The downsides were you really don't necessarily play the game itself on a daily basis.

519
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:26,735
A lot of these are going to be live games that have ongoing new content coming into them.

520
00:23:27,695 --> 00:23:29,416
And that might be something that's really important to you.

521
00:23:29,456 --> 00:23:32,097
You really want to be able to play the game and have that experience.

522
00:23:32,518 --> 00:23:36,640
You might not have time to do that, so you have to put your trust in the other people that are working on the game.

523
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:40,729
And one of the other people that will be working on the game

524
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:49,687
a few years for a company called NG MoCo.

525
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:52,648
And your primary job in this role

526
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:56,009
is to make sure that the online game is being

527
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,310
updated on a regular basis.

528
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,371
So in this world, your game doesn't,

529
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:01,312
you're not finished when you launch,

530
00:24:01,712 --> 00:24:02,792
you're just getting started.

531
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:06,234
You have so much more work to do once customers actually

532
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:06,594
come in.

533
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:09,295
And you're typically worried also

534
00:24:09,335 --> 00:24:10,736
about generating online revenues.

535
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:12,376
You're going to have a product manager that you

536
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:13,137
work with on this.

537
00:24:13,657 --> 00:24:15,198
But you're also going to be doing things like,

538
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:16,758
so you're going to be worrying about money.

539
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:20,620
You're going to be worrying about when is my game going to get approved from the app store.

540
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,701
You're going to be worrying about whether my servers are up, which is that red and yellow.

541
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,422
You don't want that much red.

542
00:24:27,262 --> 00:24:28,523
Trust me, it's not good.

543
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:32,484
And you want to look and see how popular are the servers, how are things going.

544
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,966
That's just the WoW server list because that's a great long-term online game.

545
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:38,066
They are experts in live operations.

546
00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:39,947
They have lots of live producers at Blizzard.

547
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:44,827
You will need to know some about server management and data operations.

548
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:47,770
So you'll need to understand like, how are my servers doing?

549
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,692
Am I getting enough data back to be able to make decisions about my product?

550
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:52,093
And you're going to be a conduit.

551
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:55,817
You're going to be doing a lot of mediation between the designer and the product manager.

552
00:24:55,857 --> 00:24:59,500
Because the product manager is going to say, I think this product is, this feature is going

553
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,381
to make so much money.

554
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:02,823
And the designer is going to say, that is terrible.

555
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:04,924
We would never want to do that to our customers.

556
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:07,545
And you as the live producer are gonna have the opportunity

557
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:09,086
to mediate between those two people.

558
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:11,127
And if you like your team and you have fun

559
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:13,247
working with people, this is a great job for you

560
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:15,228
because you're gonna be able to use those people skills

561
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:18,989
to help solve problems and help people get their jobs done,

562
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:21,250
which is really what producers do to me.

563
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,392
So, you know, me, this is a server chart from New Relic

564
00:25:27,452 --> 00:25:29,132
and this is just app response time.

565
00:25:29,172 --> 00:25:30,713
This is the kind of stuff I used to look at

566
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:33,333
pretty much all day on one of my monitors.

567
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:38,065
And I feel like my job was intrinsically tied to the servers.

568
00:25:38,826 --> 00:25:40,789
If the servers were down, two things happened.

569
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:42,611
One is my customers couldn't play my game,

570
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:44,953
which is terrible, and you never want customers

571
00:25:44,973 --> 00:25:45,955
to not be able to play your game.

572
00:25:46,435 --> 00:25:48,698
But the other piece was we weren't generating any revenue.

573
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:50,360
If there was no servers capacity,

574
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,122
then nobody could get in to play,

575
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:53,443
and nobody was gonna give us any money.

576
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,501
And those were not great moments.

577
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,964
But what those did give me was an opportunity

578
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:01,628
to work with some really dedicated DevOps professionals.

579
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,351
So I worked with some engineers who made it their life's work

580
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:06,674
to A, try and keep the servers up the best that they could.

581
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:09,017
And when they went down, they did heroic efforts

582
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:09,838
to get them back up.

583
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:13,362
And that was a really, that's like being in the trenches.

584
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:15,964
I've never been to war, I've never been in the military,

585
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:18,305
and it is, I'm sure, not as bad as that.

586
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:21,087
But it is definitely quite an experience

587
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:22,768
to have your servers all go down.

588
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:24,609
I think there was an AWS outage this morning

589
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:27,731
that probably freaked a lot of my coworkers out quite a bit,

590
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:29,973
but I wasn't there, so I have to really rather.

591
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:31,694
Plus, here at GDC.

592
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:36,177
So the other thing that I found really fun

593
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:39,919
about doing online production is that you really are.

594
00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:42,170
things all the time for your customers.

595
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,652
And you get to see, I love working with communities

596
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:46,954
and I love people and seeing what they're doing

597
00:26:46,994 --> 00:26:49,015
and getting to see how they're playing your game

598
00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:52,218
and then going onto the forums or Twitter or anywhere

599
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:54,140
and sort of seeing what are they saying,

600
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,421
what would they like to see next,

601
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,723
and having the opportunity to build those features

602
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,265
into a game and have people go,

603
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:03,027
oh my gosh, they actually heard me and listened to me.

604
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:05,369
That was extremely satisfying for me.

605
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,071
And in packaged games, you don't get that.

606
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:11,374
In packaged games, you ship and either if you're

607
00:27:11,414 --> 00:27:13,956
digitally distributed, your boxed product, it's out

608
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:15,217
and there's no changing it.

609
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:18,019
So that was a super fun thing for me

610
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:21,382
and I feel like being in live production is great for you

611
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:23,904
if you like change, if you're adaptable,

612
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:25,645
if you like working with people,

613
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:29,088
if you get excited when things happen

614
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:31,890
that are beyond your scope of ability to...

615
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:36,001
to prevent but that you really are excited about resolving.

616
00:27:36,942 --> 00:27:40,305
So I think it's a really fun and exciting area of production

617
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,408
that's very different from, like if you were a producer

618
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,451
10 years ago on a box game, they just had nothing like that.

619
00:27:49,494 --> 00:27:51,757
Next one I wanna talk about is publishing producers.

620
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:52,598
So at the end of the.

621
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:56,024
you know, here's a game and all the way up to the publisher.

622
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:58,845
Publishing producer is a relatively new kind

623
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,647
of producer that's been around for a few years.

624
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:03,287
It tends to be a little bit more senior.

625
00:28:03,368 --> 00:28:07,149
So this could be interesting to you somewhere down the line

626
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:08,470
in a career if you decide.

627
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,991
I like things like traveling and meeting new people

628
00:28:11,051 --> 00:28:13,312
and seeing new kinds of games and making money

629
00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:15,373
and I'm really into a few different things.

630
00:28:16,314 --> 00:28:16,874
And I feel like.

631
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:22,212
Publishers tend to work as a publishing arm of a company.

632
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:24,573
So it'll be either a developer who makes their own games,

633
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:25,833
but also as a publishing arm,

634
00:28:26,214 --> 00:28:27,974
or a dedicated game publishing company.

635
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:30,155
And they typically handle things

636
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:32,476
like marketing, distribution,

637
00:28:32,857 --> 00:28:34,777
but the publishing producer's gonna be able to,

638
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:36,458
you know, keep their eye on production

639
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:39,620
all the way through the development of the game.

640
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:42,385
to ensure that there's a financial and critical success

641
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:43,946
because the publishers only get a big money

642
00:28:44,346 --> 00:28:45,247
if the game makes money.

643
00:28:46,088 --> 00:28:48,330
You need exceptional people skills for this.

644
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:49,912
So if you decide you want to go

645
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:51,213
become a localization producer

646
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:53,115
because you kind of like swimming in your own lane

647
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:54,676
and working on your own stuff and not talking.

648
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:56,597
to a lot of people except on email,

649
00:28:57,718 --> 00:29:00,759
then this might not be the job for you.

650
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:02,640
Like, this is a job where you are gonna be

651
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,121
schmoozing people and going out to do stuff.

652
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,282
If you don't like going to parties,

653
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:09,483
please don't become a publishing producer.

654
00:29:09,563 --> 00:29:11,043
Like, it will not be a good job for you.

655
00:29:11,824 --> 00:29:14,025
You also need a broad understanding of game development.

656
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:17,230
That's why I say it's maybe a job that's for later on in a career,

657
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,673
because you'll need to have some sort of knowledge of everything from initial pitch

658
00:29:22,534 --> 00:29:26,437
through and including shipping the game and doing after marketing.

659
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,528
So you're gonna spend a lot of your time

660
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:30,689
doing communication, so you're gonna need to,

661
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:32,690
you know, be on email a lot, you're probably gonna

662
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,451
have a couple of different Slack channels

663
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:35,771
for different teams you're working with,

664
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:37,992
and you're gonna be a Skype expert.

665
00:29:39,073 --> 00:29:40,873
You also need to be super organized.

666
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:44,255
If you aren't organized, you're gonna lose track of stuff

667
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:47,136
because you're not necessarily living it day to day.

668
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:50,377
You might work on a project with an external developer,

669
00:29:50,437 --> 00:29:53,058
only have every two weeks you have things with them,

670
00:29:53,098 --> 00:29:54,579
and you need to remember to ask them about it

671
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:55,299
when you talk to them.

672
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,793
And lastly, you need to be sort of the paragon of enthusiasm and positivity.

673
00:30:01,293 --> 00:30:04,377
So, you know, for a publishing producer, they're out talking to the people

674
00:30:04,397 --> 00:30:07,760
that are making these games who are in the trenches, and this is the role

675
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,044
where you really want to be the guy who brings along, the guy or woman

676
00:30:11,084 --> 00:30:14,928
who brings along, you know, that, like, sense of excitement and positivity

677
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:16,269
and that everything's going to be okay,

678
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:18,531
because you're helping them make everything okay.

679
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:21,885
I talked to a couple of people.

680
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,186
I've never been a publishing producer.

681
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,307
I talked to a few, I actually had a whole bunch of people

682
00:30:25,347 --> 00:30:26,968
who when I asked some friends,

683
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:28,429
they were like, oh yeah, I was a publishing producer

684
00:30:28,449 --> 00:30:28,830
for a while.

685
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,471
So I got a lot of feedback on this one from people

686
00:30:31,491 --> 00:30:32,852
and they have a lot of different reasons

687
00:30:32,892 --> 00:30:33,733
for wanting to do it.

688
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,694
I think it's another one of those jobs

689
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,475
that you take on when you want to be.

690
00:30:38,256 --> 00:30:39,837
thinking about moving it to upper management.

691
00:30:40,077 --> 00:30:44,261
So they wanted more insight in how decisions were made from above.

692
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:46,102
And then a great quote from one friend was,

693
00:30:46,402 --> 00:30:49,845
I've always been a fan of games as a new and relatively unexplored art form.

694
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:52,567
And I want to help those trying to push the medium

695
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:54,669
in new and interesting directions find an audience.

696
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:57,912
And I was like, that is the most lovely altruistic reason

697
00:30:57,932 --> 00:31:00,734
I can possibly imagine for being a publishing producer.

698
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:02,856
Good job. Like that was awesome.

699
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:05,638
But, you know, he also said he gets lonely

700
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:07,540
and he misses the creative dynamism.

701
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:11,868
of a, he was a producer before he became a publishing producer and just worked on a game

702
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:13,529
and he misses it.

703
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:17,371
He misses that dynamism of working with a group because now he mostly works with a bunch

704
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:20,934
of publishing, to develop studios that are publishing.

705
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,438
Another friend of mine said his worst.

706
00:31:28,807 --> 00:31:32,130
He loves his job and there's a lot of great stuff he gets to do and he loves delivering

707
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,912
good news, but he also has to be the bearer of bad news.

708
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:39,997
And you can really destroy people's dreams if you're a publishing producer, if you pull

709
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:41,098
the plug on their project.

710
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:45,582
And you become the person that has to actually communicate that to somebody.

711
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:50,407
And that's a really terrible place to be, and you have to be able to be okay with that

712
00:31:50,447 --> 00:31:52,529
some of the time too, because that's going to be part of the job.

713
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:54,050
Sometimes things are going to go great.

714
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:55,736
sometimes they're not going to go great.

715
00:31:55,877 --> 00:31:58,306
As a publishing producer, you have to be prepared for both sides.

716
00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:04,135
All right, so I said I'd talk a little about design producer, and here's that moment.

717
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:10,479
I think of design producers as feature producers, and that's pretty much the most traditional

718
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,521
type of production that there really is.

719
00:32:13,562 --> 00:32:16,644
I don't want to spend a bunch of time talking about it today, because I think you probably

720
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:20,346
got a lot of information if you were here for Aaron and Ruth's sessions earlier today,

721
00:32:20,727 --> 00:32:23,809
and they probably covered most of the ups and downs here, and I don't want to cover

722
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:25,710
stuff that other people already talked about.

723
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,252
If you want to talk about this more, I'm happy to.

724
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:29,252
I've done this job.

725
00:32:29,272 --> 00:32:31,373
I know lots of people who have done this job,

726
00:32:31,914 --> 00:32:33,855
and I can give you some feedback on it.

727
00:32:34,195 --> 00:32:35,956
But if you decided to go into production,

728
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,398
which I assume most of you in this room did decide that,

729
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:40,759
or you wouldn't be here at the production bootcamp.

730
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:43,657
then you probably have a pretty good idea

731
00:32:43,717 --> 00:32:46,680
what a feature or design producer does.

732
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,922
There are some new types of roles.

733
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:50,864
I worked at Telltale for a while

734
00:32:50,924 --> 00:32:52,425
and they have a design associate.

735
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:54,187
It's kind of like a design producer

736
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,889
except it's more to go in the design track,

737
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,671
which I think is a different,

738
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,212
other interesting specialization,

739
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:02,154
but I think of that as a design specialization.

740
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:03,656
That's a talk for another day.

741
00:33:03,676 --> 00:33:04,777
Okay.

742
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:09,821
So those are the types of specializations that I'm going to cover today.

743
00:33:09,941 --> 00:33:15,043
And now I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about how some of these different

744
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:19,525
specializations vary when you're working on a small team versus a large team.

745
00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:24,228
So when you're working on a small team, you're pretty much going to wear a lot of different

746
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:24,528
hats.

747
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:29,490
You're going to have the opportunity to try maybe two or three of these types of specializations.

748
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,852
So you might be the art outsourcing, UI, and localization producer on a small team.

749
00:33:34,915 --> 00:33:37,977
And that's an interesting way for you to start experiencing

750
00:33:39,358 --> 00:33:40,820
the different types of specializations

751
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,721
and sort of see what might be appropriate for you.

752
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:45,264
One of the things I like that,

753
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,747
is this is what represents a dive deep,

754
00:33:49,147 --> 00:33:50,949
which is an Amazon leadership value.

755
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:52,230
And basically what it means is,

756
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,313
you will dig in and do whatever needs to be done

757
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:56,794
to get the job done.

758
00:33:56,814 --> 00:33:59,016
And I think that's like a hallmark of any producer.

759
00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:01,556
But I think that when you're on a small team,

760
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:04,180
it becomes even more valuable as a skill,

761
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:07,966
that you're able to say, I am not super excited

762
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:10,770
or I am super excited, but I'm gonna jump into this task

763
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,333
and even though it's kind of not quite in my bailiwick,

764
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:14,154
I'm gonna go for it

765
00:34:14,174 --> 00:34:15,516
and I'm gonna try and get something done.

766
00:34:16,827 --> 00:34:20,730
One of the downsides to small teams is there's limited growth opportunities.

767
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:27,374
So pretty much if you have an EP and a senior producer and a couple of producers, there's

768
00:34:27,414 --> 00:34:31,676
not a lot of growth opportunity and there's not a lot of opportunities for really getting

769
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,678
in and really becoming a specialized producer.

770
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:37,921
And I feel like that can be okay for a while,

771
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:40,363
but if you do say, like, I really want to be a DD,

772
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:41,844
you're probably going to need to move on

773
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:43,686
and end up in a larger team.

774
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:45,707
Because when you get to a larger team,

775
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:47,529
that's when you start seeing these different types

776
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:50,411
of producers break out and spend all of their time

777
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,013
focusing on one specialization.

778
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:54,455
And that's when you can get the best experience out of it

779
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:56,476
and understand what's going to be right for you.

780
00:34:57,915 --> 00:34:59,555
There's also room for growth.

781
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:02,977
You don't feel like, oh, I hope the senior producer wins

782
00:35:03,037 --> 00:35:05,398
the lottery, because then maybe he won't come to work again.

783
00:35:05,418 --> 00:35:06,779
Then I could have his job.

784
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,860
But in a large team, you have a lot more opportunity

785
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,641
for movement around.

786
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:16,803
And then if you stretch that out and you become on a large team,

787
00:35:17,263 --> 00:35:21,245
but within a studio that has multiple projects, you can say,

788
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:22,986
oh, I can also move over to that project.

789
00:35:23,473 --> 00:35:24,754
Or if you're in a corporate environment,

790
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:25,514
you could actually move over

791
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:26,695
to a completely different studio.

792
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:29,097
I really like, you know, BioWare's games,

793
00:35:29,157 --> 00:35:30,678
and I've been working on Dead Space,

794
00:35:30,718 --> 00:35:32,919
but man, I'd love to work on Mass Effect.

795
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,781
Like, that kind of opportunity is there for you as well,

796
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:37,502
especially if you have a specialization

797
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:38,463
and you know they need it.

798
00:35:39,283 --> 00:35:40,964
That's why localization's an awesome one,

799
00:35:40,984 --> 00:35:42,985
because there's always room for localization.

800
00:35:43,786 --> 00:35:44,847
I'll stop talking about that now.

801
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:46,007
All right.

802
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,720
Within that, though, there's a series of hard skills

803
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,142
that I think all producers need to bring to the table.

804
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,903
And again, different specializations

805
00:35:54,943 --> 00:35:57,105
are going to have different hard skills that they focus on.

806
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:00,507
On the left is all the project management stuff

807
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:02,288
that I've had to use in the last couple of years.

808
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:05,630
Project management and communication.

809
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,770
This didn't include email.

810
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,511
Email producers live and die by email a lot.

811
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:11,392
Although I like that Slack is actually starting

812
00:36:11,452 --> 00:36:13,993
to take the burden of email off a little bit.

813
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:16,313
It's nice and it's a little more fun and manageable.

814
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:17,614
But mostly fun.

815
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,954
I actually think Slack is pretty fun.

816
00:36:20,115 --> 00:36:22,015
But I would become an expert in some of these things.

817
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,936
Like one of the things I learned on one of my first projects

818
00:36:24,956 --> 00:36:26,677
that I was working with Jira,

819
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:29,238
it was years ago when Jira was still pretty early,

820
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:31,279
was somebody made me an admin,

821
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:32,379
because I was a producer.

822
00:36:33,616 --> 00:36:34,999
that made sense at the time.

823
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,846
And I learned how to create workflows in Jira.

824
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:40,529
And it's something that I use to this day.

825
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,933
Like somebody knows they can make me an admin in Jira

826
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:44,717
and I can probably set up a workflow for them.

827
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:47,825
15 or 20 minutes and get a project kicked off.

828
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:50,366
And that's just a great skill to have,

829
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:53,568
even though it didn't take me very long to learn,

830
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,028
but hardly anyone learns it.

831
00:36:55,469 --> 00:36:57,750
So you can go sign up for a free JIRA account,

832
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,290
and you can learn how to do this on your own.

833
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:01,991
And then you start developing those skills

834
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,893
that become part of different specializations.

835
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,613
Like it is a really good skill

836
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:07,914
for a development director to have.

837
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:10,275
It is a really good skill for a TPM to have.

838
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:13,156
Not necessarily a skill a UI producer needs.

839
00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:20,960
In the middle are two of the producers best friends Excel and and Google Sheets. I love Google Sheets

840
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,122
I wish I could use it for everything. We don't really use it much at Amazon

841
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:28,104
just because well, it's Google and

842
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:34,595
I use Excel a lot, but I love Google Sheets for being able to see projects getting updated.

843
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:38,596
I worked with an external development shop for a while, and we could have meetings where

844
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:42,058
all of us sat in Google Sheets and we updated it on the fly together live.

845
00:37:42,698 --> 00:37:47,280
That's incredibly valuable as a production tool when you're working with distributed

846
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,062
teams, which almost all of the production specialists could eventually do.

847
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:57,964
However, on the far right, those are all of the first-party...

848
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:00,562
development platform.

849
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:03,706
So if you have to submit to Steam,

850
00:38:03,746 --> 00:38:07,150
or you have to submit to iOS, or Sony, or Microsoft.

851
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:12,094
Different specializations have different parts in that role.

852
00:38:12,854 --> 00:38:16,676
So it might be that you're the producer who goes and reads

853
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:20,757
how iOS requires you to do your user experience design.

854
00:38:21,158 --> 00:38:23,158
Well, that's on the iOS portal.

855
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,499
Or you're the producer who, at the end, has to actually

856
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,380
submit the app for distribution.

857
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,761
That's a completely different other part of the portal, and

858
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:31,201
it's a completely different specialization.

859
00:38:31,822 --> 00:38:34,083
But, these are all really good things for you to understand.

860
00:38:34,143 --> 00:38:38,964
What are the requirements of the first platform holders and how can I make sure that my area,

861
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:44,546
my area of specialization is doing the right thing so that we don't fail submission because

862
00:38:44,586 --> 00:38:45,146
of my stuff.

863
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,092
So those are some of the hard skills.

864
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:49,855
There's a lot of different hard skills.

865
00:38:49,915 --> 00:38:52,278
I think that we're going to talk a little about development

866
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:54,301
methodologies, and that kind of leans a little bit

867
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:55,443
into the hard skills as well.

868
00:38:55,743 --> 00:38:57,846
But I want to talk for just a second about soft skills.

869
00:38:58,707 --> 00:39:01,191
Empathy is, at its simplest, awareness of the feelings

870
00:39:01,231 --> 00:39:02,332
and emotions of other people.

871
00:39:02,753 --> 00:39:06,918
It is the link between self and others because it is how we as individuals understand what

872
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:09,961
others are experiencing as if we are feeling it ourselves.

873
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:15,147
This is probably the best soft skill that I can tell any producer to bring to any specialization,

874
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:20,053
particularly if you are managing people and particularly if you are one of the specific

875
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:22,496
producers that is mediating between two different groups.

876
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:25,715
This is an area where you can bring,

877
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:29,557
like I have in my past been terrible at empathy,

878
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:32,119
like super terrible, and it's been a skill

879
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:34,420
that I've been working on over time,

880
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,182
because I think it's a really important production skill

881
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:38,062
for me to be able to say.

882
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,098
If that person can't get that done, why is that?

883
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:43,000
Like, what are they feeling

884
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,142
and how are they going through their job

885
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:48,226
that is not enabling them to do their job?

886
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,368
So I feel like that's probably one of the biggest

887
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:52,450
soft skills that you can bring to the table

888
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,771
in any of the specializations,

889
00:39:54,132 --> 00:39:56,174
but particularly the ones where you're mediating

890
00:39:56,234 --> 00:39:58,656
between a designer and an engineer

891
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,479
or an executive and an artist.

892
00:40:05,715 --> 00:40:08,717
This is a book, you'll be able to see my slides online.

893
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:10,798
This is a really good book about difficult conversations.

894
00:40:11,218 --> 00:40:13,399
This is another really good one if you're mediating

895
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:16,561
or managing between different groups,

896
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:19,823
because I feel like this is what producers do a lot

897
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:23,465
if they are the type of producer who's working with groups,

898
00:40:23,545 --> 00:40:25,025
not necessarily the ones that are swimming

899
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:26,126
in their own lane as much.

900
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:30,288
One of the other things I think is a really important soft skill

901
00:40:30,448 --> 00:40:32,690
for production is team health.

902
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:37,242
I think that no matter who you're working with and which part of the organization that

903
00:40:37,622 --> 00:40:41,624
you're working with in your specialization, team health is really important because if

904
00:40:41,684 --> 00:40:45,465
you and your team aren't happy and aren't feeling good about their work and don't have

905
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:50,867
a good work-life balance, that is partly your responsibility because your job is to get

906
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:56,709
the project out the door and team health is a huge part of that and that's become more

907
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:58,950
important as time has gone by.

908
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,772
And specialists, within specialist producers,

909
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,094
have a really big role to play there.

910
00:41:04,114 --> 00:41:06,116
And it's a super fun thing to do.

911
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:07,517
Like, worrying about team health means

912
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:10,800
that you get to plan cool things for people to go do.

913
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:15,083
And I think that that can be a really positive experience

914
00:41:15,143 --> 00:41:15,664
as a producer.

915
00:41:18,464 --> 00:41:20,466
One of the things I use at my current job

916
00:41:21,507 --> 00:41:22,948
that's less about ordering pizza,

917
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:24,609
the ordering pizza side of team health,

918
00:41:24,669 --> 00:41:26,151
and a little bit more about making sure

919
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:27,572
we're getting the job done team health,

920
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:31,536
because that also is a very positive impact on your team.

921
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:35,379
We use some parts of Agile, and we use some waterfall.

922
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,961
So I'm going to talk a little about

923
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:38,182
the parts of Agile that we use.

924
00:41:38,202 --> 00:41:40,444
Have you guys, anybody used Agile?

925
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,913
Everybody, sweet.

926
00:41:43,696 --> 00:41:47,629
Has anybody used strict, crazy strict Agile

927
00:41:47,669 --> 00:41:48,412
for game development?

928
00:41:49,597 --> 00:41:51,358
Wow, yeah, that's one.

929
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:54,460
So, you know, for me, when I think of how we've used Agile

930
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:56,802
on the projects that I've worked on,

931
00:41:57,202 --> 00:42:00,905
these are really the four areas that I tend to use the most.

932
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:03,767
So I like to use user stories for game development

933
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:05,768
because it makes sure the engineering team

934
00:42:05,828 --> 00:42:07,189
is actually thinking about what's right

935
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:10,851
for the user experience and not relying on built as design,

936
00:42:11,251 --> 00:42:13,913
which is my favorite answer as a producer

937
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:15,354
to get from an engineer when I say,

938
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,735
yeah, but it doesn't work.

939
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:18,776
Hey, it's built as designed.

940
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:24,029
So, you know, user stories are a great way around that because you can say, like, the

941
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,951
user needs to be able to create an avatar, right?

942
00:42:27,271 --> 00:42:28,552
That's a great user story.

943
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:32,074
And then you can flow out everything from that to actually get that work done.

944
00:42:33,486 --> 00:42:38,292
I love daily stand-ups, not necessarily because I use them in the strict Agile way, but because

945
00:42:38,332 --> 00:42:40,975
I get updates from my team and it helps me sleep at night.

946
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:47,443
On days when I don't go to my stand-ups are my worst days for wondering, like, is the

947
00:42:47,503 --> 00:42:48,324
train rolling?

948
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:50,526
Are we getting everything done that we need to get done?

949
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:53,210
I like to use incremental development.

950
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:56,451
And I think that's a really good one for specialized producers in particular,

951
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:57,572
because it helps you figure out,

952
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:00,957
when am I going to be able to give a report about my part of the project

953
00:43:01,077 --> 00:43:02,278
to another part of the project?

954
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,781
And what's going to be in that?

955
00:43:04,861 --> 00:43:06,464
So if you say, like, I know in this sprint,

956
00:43:06,924 --> 00:43:08,526
we're going to get this amount of work done.

957
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:13,028
I know from previous sprints that we actually get three quarters of that work done, then

958
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:17,849
I can go out and say, hey executives or other teammates, here's what I think we'll have

959
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:18,609
done in two weeks.

960
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:22,170
And if a combination of the stand-ups and knowing that that incremental development

961
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,591
in sprints is happening, I as a producer are going to be able to work with other producers

962
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:28,872
and be able to report to my management what's getting done in the project.

963
00:43:30,462 --> 00:43:32,964
And personas I really like and I use them both,

964
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:35,727
I used them a ton when I was doing mobile development,

965
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:38,710
but I use them now even though I don't share

966
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,233
what I do with them to as many people.

967
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,374
In mobile development you use them

968
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:43,335
because you're trying to figure out like,

969
00:43:43,715 --> 00:43:45,877
what are the product features that we need to prioritize

970
00:43:45,937 --> 00:43:47,279
based on who's using the product?

971
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:48,780
And you have all the data telling you

972
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,681
who's using the product.

973
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,451
In my current job, I don't really have that,

974
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:55,955
but I do have the idea of who's using our engine

975
00:43:55,995 --> 00:43:59,118
to do what right now, and thinking about those personas

976
00:43:59,198 --> 00:44:00,739
and figuring out how to do feature development,

977
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:02,461
even though it's not necessarily tied to revenue,

978
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:04,103
I still find very valuable.

979
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:09,928
Waterfall, this is not the fanciest waterfall slide

980
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:12,290
in the world, but waterfall's pretty basic.

981
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,512
It's been around a long time.

982
00:44:15,134 --> 00:44:17,236
You know, it's sequential, it's non-iterative.

983
00:44:17,677 --> 00:44:20,460
If one thing slips, it causes lots of other things to slip.

984
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:25,366
I tend to rely on it to do upfront schedules,

985
00:44:25,386 --> 00:44:26,167
because I just want to like,

986
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,869
like when I'm trying to schedule something out,

987
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:29,851
just to get sort of a vague idea,

988
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:31,754
a straw man of when something might be done.

989
00:44:32,594 --> 00:44:35,637
but they tend to, you know, I say your mileage may vary

990
00:44:36,077 --> 00:44:37,979
when you use Waterfall, they're easy to create,

991
00:44:37,999 --> 00:44:40,521
but unless somebody's actually really actively updating it,

992
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,862
it becomes out of sync pretty quickly.

993
00:44:42,882 --> 00:44:45,645
So I tend to, you know, look at that and I say,

994
00:44:45,665 --> 00:44:47,546
you know, what I end up doing is I say,

995
00:44:47,566 --> 00:44:49,868
I use a combination of these things.

996
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:54,872
And, you know, it sometimes leads to mayhem and chaos,

997
00:44:55,272 --> 00:44:56,713
but what I usually get from it is,

998
00:44:56,793 --> 00:44:58,274
I take the pieces of Agile that work,

999
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,216
I take the pieces of Waterfall that work,

1000
00:45:00,636 --> 00:45:01,617
I try and combine them,

1001
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:05,729
and figure out which works best for which specialization I'm doing at that moment.

1002
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:11,115
So for live production, my scheduling is completely different than what I do as a TPM at Amazon.

1003
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:13,978
So you know, again, your mileage may vary.

1004
00:45:14,018 --> 00:45:17,922
This is something that you'll adapt for your particular specialization, and you'll have

1005
00:45:17,962 --> 00:45:19,123
to work with other people on it.

1006
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:22,727
Like you have to get your engineers to buy in with whatever production methodology you

1007
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:23,027
use.

1008
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:26,048
or you will get nowhere really, really fast.

1009
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:28,769
So you want to be having those kinds of discussions

1010
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,969
at the beginning of a product

1011
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:32,990
and try and move things along in a way

1012
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,730
that makes sense for your particular product.

1013
00:45:35,811 --> 00:45:37,611
All right, last slide.

1014
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:39,792
Pusheen, because there should be a cat

1015
00:45:39,852 --> 00:45:40,832
in every presentation.

1016
00:45:40,852 --> 00:45:44,353
All right, what should you major in?

1017
00:45:44,633 --> 00:45:46,033
So if you're in college right now

1018
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:47,994
and you're hoping to become a producer someday,

1019
00:45:48,394 --> 00:45:50,154
you should major in whatever the fuck you want.

1020
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:58,215
Basically, I sort of feel like you should also take some engineering classes, but you

1021
00:45:58,235 --> 00:46:01,938
should major in something that's going to give you a broad knowledge of humans and what

1022
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:05,401
we've done with the society that we've had for millions of years.

1023
00:46:06,562 --> 00:46:09,925
And for production in general, you're going to work with so many different kinds of people

1024
00:46:09,965 --> 00:46:11,546
doing so many different kinds of things.

1025
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,948
Having a broad base of knowledge is the best win.

1026
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:18,371
I am a terrible artist, which is why I drew not one of my slides.

1027
00:46:19,592 --> 00:46:21,913
I am really literally a terrible artist.

1028
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:26,536
But I took art history classes because I love art, and that gave me enough information for

1029
00:46:26,556 --> 00:46:30,579
me to sit down with a game artist and be able to have a conversation where I don't sound

1030
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:31,459
like a complete idiot.

1031
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:34,642
And it also makes me enjoy it.

1032
00:46:34,822 --> 00:46:36,743
Like I actually have an appreciation for the art

1033
00:46:36,763 --> 00:46:40,066
that happens in games, even though I can't do it myself.

1034
00:46:40,606 --> 00:46:41,727
And that's kind of why I think, you know,

1035
00:46:41,747 --> 00:46:42,628
what should you major in?

1036
00:46:42,688 --> 00:46:43,768
Really anything.

1037
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:45,410
It's what you learn along the way

1038
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:46,891
and what you want to bring to the table

1039
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:48,732
for the job that you want to have down the line.

1040
00:46:50,242 --> 00:46:52,965
All right, should you take classes in Agile?

1041
00:46:53,045 --> 00:46:55,667
Should you take classes in anything?

1042
00:46:56,308 --> 00:46:57,489
If you want, you should.

1043
00:46:58,189 --> 00:47:00,071
I don't know that I would take an Agile class.

1044
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:01,953
I think there's plenty of information online

1045
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:04,956
and it seems like all of those Agile classes are like,

1046
00:47:04,996 --> 00:47:08,779
come to San Francisco for an all-day Agile class.

1047
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,321
I can't think of anything that I would find more boring.

1048
00:47:14,747 --> 00:47:16,188
Sorry if you teach Agile classes.

1049
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,513
But, you know, I think if you're super interested in it

1050
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:23,676
and you want to become, you know,

1051
00:47:23,696 --> 00:47:25,217
a super technical project manager,

1052
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:27,259
maybe it would be a good thing for you.

1053
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,201
I still think there's plenty of stuff online.

1054
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:31,163
I think there's other classes you can take.

1055
00:47:31,203 --> 00:47:33,045
Like I took a Java class a few years ago

1056
00:47:33,105 --> 00:47:33,926
just because I wanted to learn

1057
00:47:33,946 --> 00:47:35,347
about object-oriented programming.

1058
00:47:35,757 --> 00:47:36,938
I'm not going to become a programmer.

1059
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:40,521
I have no desire to do that at all, although I have tons of respect for programmers.

1060
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:46,145
But it just helped me be able to have more intelligent conversations because I had taken

1061
00:47:46,185 --> 00:47:49,688
a little bit of time and learned a little bit more about something I didn't know about.

1062
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:52,089
So I'd say yes if you want.

1063
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,031
How do you get into production?

1064
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:59,395
So if you're somebody who's not in production now, but you want to be in production, and

1065
00:47:59,415 --> 00:48:03,018
you don't have any experience and you don't know anybody in the industry, look for an

1066
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:03,899
entry-level job.

1067
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:07,962
And you might find an entry-level assistant producer job, but it's more likely you'll

1068
00:48:07,982 --> 00:48:08,723
find something like...

1069
00:48:09,757 --> 00:48:11,038
excuse me, a QA job.

1070
00:48:11,698 --> 00:48:13,379
There's still a few of those that are feeders

1071
00:48:13,479 --> 00:48:14,379
into a production group.

1072
00:48:14,419 --> 00:48:16,580
Like I worked at Telltale, they feed people from QA

1073
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,781
into production all the time there.

1074
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:20,382
Or look for a community manager job,

1075
00:48:20,402 --> 00:48:23,704
because most people know how to use social media.

1076
00:48:24,084 --> 00:48:25,684
Learning how to use social media is, again,

1077
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:26,885
something you don't need a class in.

1078
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,286
You can kind of learn that online.

1079
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:30,247
And that leads you down the path

1080
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:31,427
of getting a foot in the door.

1081
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:33,308
Understanding community and understanding

1082
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:34,508
who's playing the game is actually

1083
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:36,549
a super valuable producer skill

1084
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:37,730
for almost any of the,

1085
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:41,005
production specialization, so that's a good foot in the door.

1086
00:48:42,123 --> 00:48:44,025
When you're a producer and you've joined the company,

1087
00:48:44,565 --> 00:48:46,347
find a mentor, find somebody in the company

1088
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:47,968
that is doing one of these specializations

1089
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,970
that you're interested in that's more senior than you,

1090
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,511
and ask them to go to lunch.

1091
00:48:52,071 --> 00:48:53,512
Take them out to lunch, it'll be worth it.

1092
00:48:54,213 --> 00:48:56,054
You don't need to have a formal mentor relationship

1093
00:48:56,094 --> 00:48:57,656
with them, but if you have a relationship

1094
00:48:57,676 --> 00:48:59,237
where you can ask them a question here or there,

1095
00:48:59,697 --> 00:49:01,378
they know who you are, they start seeing you

1096
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:04,621
around the company, that's a really good thing to foster,

1097
00:49:04,761 --> 00:49:06,042
and it gives you somebody to talk to

1098
00:49:06,122 --> 00:49:07,343
about something you're interested in,

1099
00:49:07,383 --> 00:49:10,606
which is super fun and why we are human beings.

1100
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:15,076
Another thing to do when you join a company is finding a champion.

1101
00:49:15,557 --> 00:49:18,419
And a champion is a little bit different from a mentor, because a champion is going to say,

1102
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:22,263
I think you're valuable, and I want to help you get ahead personally.

1103
00:49:22,323 --> 00:49:22,843
Like I want...

1104
00:49:23,424 --> 00:49:26,286
And those do exist, particularly in some of the larger companies.

1105
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:30,390
And what they'll do is they'll, you know, work with you, they'll see what you're good

1106
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,711
at, they'll understand your value.

1107
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:34,338
and hopefully they'll help you get ahead within the company.

1108
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:36,440
They're definitely harder to find than mentors,

1109
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,361
but if you find one,

1110
00:49:38,421 --> 00:49:40,943
take advantage of that relationship and work with them

1111
00:49:40,963 --> 00:49:44,846
because it's a great way to learn about a company

1112
00:49:44,946 --> 00:49:47,968
and learn about how to improve yourself within the company.

1113
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:50,230
And that's it.

1114
00:49:59,403 --> 00:50:00,524
I have some time for questions.

1115
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,105
If you ask a question, please do it at the mic, because I'm going to lose my voice in

1116
00:50:04,145 --> 00:50:07,425
about 10 minutes, and I don't want to have to repeat everybody's questions.

1117
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:08,686
Hi.

1118
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:09,326
Hi.

1119
00:50:10,026 --> 00:50:11,186
So first, very helpful.

1120
00:50:11,246 --> 00:50:11,706
So thank you.

1121
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:16,427
So one of the things I've noticed, actually it was at Amazon, so I was at a PM at Amazon,

1122
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:20,608
and then it's a PM at Microsoft, technical producer at someplace else.

1123
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:25,210
So how do you kind of like bridge the different titles in different places?

1124
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:30,053
Like, how do you kind of describe your role in a resume when you look for things, kind

1125
00:50:30,073 --> 00:50:31,594
of like keywords to bridge the things?

1126
00:50:32,054 --> 00:50:36,377
And then as an addition for that, what do you do if you find yourself at a production

1127
00:50:36,397 --> 00:50:39,219
role that is very, very specific to the place you're at?

1128
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:43,081
And how do you can then advertise yourself to other things or grow into other things?

1129
00:50:43,922 --> 00:50:48,605
Yeah, so I think for the first part of that, you know, what I tend to do, it's really easy

1130
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,847
to write too many things about a job.

1131
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:54,089
And I try and look at like the three things I do most.

1132
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:56,879
So what are the, you know, within a week,

1133
00:50:56,919 --> 00:50:58,280
what are the three things I do most?

1134
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,280
For me right now, the three things I do most are

1135
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,081
roadmap planning, sprints, and bug triages.

1136
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:06,641
So those would be the three I'd pick,

1137
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:09,082
even though I do like a bunch of,

1138
00:51:09,122 --> 00:51:10,522
like I do contract management,

1139
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:12,023
I do all this other stuff that I just don't think

1140
00:51:12,063 --> 00:51:14,303
is as relevant for whatever the next job I want.

1141
00:51:14,663 --> 00:51:16,183
So what are those three things that I do

1142
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:19,284
that are gonna resonate in whatever I wanna do next?

1143
00:51:20,272 --> 00:51:22,472
If you're doing something, is that your first question?

1144
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:22,992
Is that?

1145
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:26,673
Okay, so the second question with regards to

1146
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:28,454
if I'm doing something and I kind of want to go

1147
00:51:28,494 --> 00:51:30,955
in a different direction for a job that I see

1148
00:51:30,995 --> 00:51:32,915
that doesn't have, it doesn't usually need the skills

1149
00:51:32,935 --> 00:51:36,036
that I'm working with now and aren't part of my resume.

1150
00:51:36,656 --> 00:51:38,137
I'd probably try and figure out another way

1151
00:51:38,157 --> 00:51:39,897
to get some of those skills and that might be

1152
00:51:40,277 --> 00:51:42,578
participating in a hackathon or a game jam

1153
00:51:43,038 --> 00:51:44,799
and say, you know, like go to a game jam and say,

1154
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:47,079
you know, I really want to be the person

1155
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,380
who helps pull together all the art.

1156
00:51:48,842 --> 00:51:53,023
because I've never done art, but I think art would be more interesting than localization.

1157
00:51:54,484 --> 00:51:57,845
So try and find the experience somewhere else if you can't find it within your own company.

1158
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,045
Thank you.

1159
00:52:00,006 --> 00:52:05,887
On your last slide you had bullet points about finding someone to mentor or champion you

1160
00:52:06,408 --> 00:52:07,468
as a young producer.

1161
00:52:07,488 --> 00:52:12,689
Do you have any advice for people who want to get into mentoring or champion people less

1162
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:13,530
experienced than them?

1163
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:17,431
Yeah, I mean I think that if you're at a company that's big enough, go talk to HR.

1164
00:52:18,085 --> 00:52:19,486
and say you want to spearhead that,

1165
00:52:19,686 --> 00:52:22,486
it could be as easy as if you have an internal spam list

1166
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:27,288
that's like, I'm selling my cat carrier.

1167
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:29,268
It could be just as easy to say,

1168
00:52:29,368 --> 00:52:30,529
I'm looking to mentor,

1169
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:33,369
here's the three things that I do most with my job.

1170
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:37,050
But HR typically also has people who might be interested

1171
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,731
and might be able to help you do that

1172
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:41,431
if your company has an HR person.

1173
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:43,632
What if you don't have an HR person?

1174
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:44,752
You don't have an HR person?

1175
00:52:45,252 --> 00:52:46,493
Well, do you have a company spam list?

1176
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,483
Ah, there you go.

1177
00:52:49,104 --> 00:52:49,324
Yeah.

1178
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:53,046
Or ask managers, ask other managers too.

1179
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:54,207
Hi.

1180
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:58,970
Hi, my question was about mentors and finding a champion.

1181
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,131
Do you think it's appropriate

1182
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:02,592
if that ends up being the same person

1183
00:53:02,852 --> 00:53:05,494
or would it be better to have it be two separate people?

1184
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:12,320
I kind of would end up thinking it's two separate people because I think, you know,

1185
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:15,562
the champion you want to be the highest person in the company that you can get.

1186
00:53:16,742 --> 00:53:20,904
And the mentor, you really want to be somebody that's in a discipline area you want.

1187
00:53:21,405 --> 00:53:24,546
And it's not necessarily that that's I mean, if it's the same person, that's fine.

1188
00:53:24,986 --> 00:53:28,248
But I would I don't know how that would work.

1189
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:32,090
Like, I don't know that many companies are the same person.

1190
00:53:33,405 --> 00:53:35,328
is like a senior, like unless it's like you wanna go

1191
00:53:35,368 --> 00:53:38,332
into marketing and you want the CMO and they also are like,

1192
00:53:38,352 --> 00:53:40,394
yeah, I think you'd be great in marketing or whatever.

1193
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:42,397
So I don't think it would work out

1194
00:53:42,978 --> 00:53:44,140
that it would happen very often,

1195
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,642
but I don't think that there's a problem with it

1196
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:46,743
if it did work out that way.

1197
00:53:47,484 --> 00:53:47,745
Thank you.

1198
00:53:49,465 --> 00:53:49,625
Hi.

1199
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:51,907
Hi, first of all, thank you for being a producer.

1200
00:53:52,948 --> 00:53:58,371
And my question is, you touched a little bit about agile classes, but what are your feelings

1201
00:53:58,411 --> 00:54:02,214
and thoughts about like agile scrum project management certifications?

1202
00:54:02,634 --> 00:54:03,175
Are they worth it?

1203
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:06,757
You know, I think in tech companies, they might be a little bit more worth it.

1204
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:10,400
I'm not sure they're in game companies, just because I just don't know that many game companies

1205
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,121
that use strict.

1206
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:15,067
agile scrum techniques.

1207
00:54:15,227 --> 00:54:16,467
Like they just, they're just,

1208
00:54:16,847 --> 00:54:18,508
they need just to be modified.

1209
00:54:18,948 --> 00:54:20,048
And I think that's because games,

1210
00:54:20,888 --> 00:54:23,249
unlike software, games actually need to be fun.

1211
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,550
And I actually don't know agile,

1212
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,650
I don't think agile scrum actually addresses

1213
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,771
like the fun factor of games very well.

1214
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:31,711
So I think that a lot of companies try and use it

1215
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:33,192
to the best extent they can,

1216
00:54:33,712 --> 00:54:35,832
but then have to veer off at the point when they're like,

1217
00:54:36,432 --> 00:54:39,553
once you get all those independent pieces together

1218
00:54:39,593 --> 00:54:40,433
at the end of scrum,

1219
00:54:41,094 --> 00:54:42,855
In technical software, that's fine.

1220
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:45,278
Like, your accounting software, it's great.

1221
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:46,719
Two and two does equal four.

1222
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:47,780
I'm done.

1223
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:51,223
You know, but in a game, that rarely happens.

1224
00:54:51,524 --> 00:54:53,986
Like, when you get to beta in a game,

1225
00:54:54,026 --> 00:54:56,068
you're like, oh, I actually, eh, not so fun.

1226
00:54:56,108 --> 00:54:57,830
You know, that's bad.

1227
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,671
So I don't know if the certification matters

1228
00:54:59,691 --> 00:55:03,135
so much in games as it does, as it might in other areas.

1229
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:05,297
That said, I know people who have gotten it.

1230
00:55:06,775 --> 00:55:09,818
You know, I guess it sort of depends on who's hiring you

1231
00:55:10,718 --> 00:55:13,120
and what you bring to the table from that training.

1232
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,862
I think you'd probably want to be able to articulate

1233
00:55:14,922 --> 00:55:16,823
what you got out of it pretty thoroughly.

1234
00:55:16,843 --> 00:55:18,264
Thank you.

1235
00:55:18,484 --> 00:55:19,945
Hi.

1236
00:55:20,246 --> 00:55:20,406
Hi.

1237
00:55:21,206 --> 00:55:24,149
On one slide you had a bullet point about personas.

1238
00:55:24,189 --> 00:55:26,310
Can you just touch on that real fast?

1239
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:26,731
What is that?

1240
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:28,372
Oh, personas, oh sorry.

1241
00:55:28,712 --> 00:55:33,116
It's basically a fictional biography of a typical user.

1242
00:55:33,716 --> 00:55:35,117
So a persona might be

1243
00:55:36,411 --> 00:55:39,914
Like in the case of a whale in a mobile game is a persona.

1244
00:55:40,094 --> 00:55:42,596
You'd be like, oh, it's somebody who plays the game

1245
00:55:42,736 --> 00:55:45,459
x amount of time, spends x amount of money

1246
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:48,161
over x amount of time, and sort of fits that.

1247
00:55:48,701 --> 00:55:50,543
Or some other persona from a mobile game

1248
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:53,765
might be somebody who plays the game x amount of hours

1249
00:55:53,806 --> 00:55:56,788
but never spends money, but I serve them this many ads.

1250
00:55:57,068 --> 00:55:58,489
So there's another way to look at them.

1251
00:55:58,509 --> 00:55:59,670
So it's some kind of user profile.

1252
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:00,551
Yeah.

1253
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:01,892
But it's usually fictional.

1254
00:56:01,912 --> 00:56:03,814
You usually sort of create them and then try.

1255
00:56:03,834 --> 00:56:05,475
A name and all that kind of stuff.

1256
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:05,575
Yeah.

1257
00:56:06,987 --> 00:56:07,307
Hi.

1258
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:07,687
Hi.

1259
00:56:07,808 --> 00:56:08,768
Very interesting talk.

1260
00:56:10,489 --> 00:56:12,551
I run a small studio down in Costa Rica.

1261
00:56:12,991 --> 00:56:16,854
And the problem that I have is that I am not a producer.

1262
00:56:16,894 --> 00:56:18,515
My background is computer science.

1263
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:21,557
And since we're a small team, I got

1264
00:56:21,717 --> 00:56:25,320
pulled into the production area of the company.

1265
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:29,903
So the image of a game producer, it's

1266
00:56:29,983 --> 00:56:32,565
non-existent in the Latin American area.

1267
00:56:32,785 --> 00:56:32,925
So.

1268
00:56:33,877 --> 00:56:37,779
What would be your advice to me in order to try to increase,

1269
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:39,861
because we tried working with a remote producer,

1270
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:42,903
but it's not working.

1271
00:56:43,023 --> 00:56:46,946
So what would be an advice just to improve the process

1272
00:56:47,106 --> 00:56:48,087
that we're having right now?

1273
00:56:48,107 --> 00:56:51,549
Are there people who call themselves project managers?

1274
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,251
No, we're seven people.

1275
00:56:53,431 --> 00:56:54,151
Oh, seven people.

1276
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:57,574
So it's just me, and then art, and then programming.

1277
00:56:58,384 --> 00:57:01,386
Yeah, I mean I think in that case you might want to think about ways to get your group

1278
00:57:01,406 --> 00:57:02,526
to be self-producing.

1279
00:57:03,127 --> 00:57:07,569
So that, you know, I mean somebody, whoever's the lead of the project.

1280
00:57:07,729 --> 00:57:14,193
So thinking of another friend's small company and basically if they all are individual contributors,

1281
00:57:14,773 --> 00:57:19,436
but the person who owns the creative vision of the company needs to have that ownership

1282
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:23,138
of this piece needs to fit with this piece needs to fit with this piece.

1283
00:57:23,478 --> 00:57:25,739
There has to be somebody who says, I'm going to own that.

1284
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:29,643
even if each person is responsible for putting all their own tasks in Jira.

1285
00:57:30,203 --> 00:57:33,004
And making sure the sprint, you know, they put this stuff in the sprint.

1286
00:57:33,024 --> 00:57:37,946
There still needs to be somebody who sets the sprint up to be populated with tasks.

1287
00:57:38,487 --> 00:57:41,908
And that probably ends up being the project lead or the founder.

1288
00:57:42,508 --> 00:57:42,829
Sorry.

1289
00:57:42,849 --> 00:57:45,490
Thank you.

1290
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:47,251
Hi.

1291
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:53,994
What would be your advice for someone who wants to laterally become a producer in a

1292
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,775
company that doesn't have a lot of producers?

1293
00:57:59,024 --> 00:58:01,505
Is there an acknowledgment that there's a need for producers?

1294
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:09,467
It's kind of like a lot of people act like producers because there's a lot of leadership that, you know,

1295
00:58:10,027 --> 00:58:14,068
people take initiative and everyone's kind of got their own area they're in control of.

1296
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:17,970
But, you know, as somebody who wants to kind of be a producer...

1297
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,150
How much overtime do you want to work?

1298
00:58:21,608 --> 00:58:23,549
I actually work pretty long hours already.

1299
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:26,090
Okay, I mean that's really the, at the end of the day,

1300
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,391
and this goes for most jobs,

1301
00:58:28,531 --> 00:58:31,932
the job that you want needs to become the job that you do.

1302
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:35,694
And if you need to do your own job,

1303
00:58:35,754 --> 00:58:38,175
if you're an artist and you need to still produce

1304
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,076
all your art, then on top of that,

1305
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,497
you also need to provide the value that you'd provide

1306
00:58:42,517 --> 00:58:44,158
as a producer for somebody to see the worth.

1307
00:58:45,196 --> 00:58:48,940
So it's not, it's really hard to convince somebody with words

1308
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,401
that they need something.

1309
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:51,763
You really have to do it with actions.

1310
00:58:52,523 --> 00:58:54,025
And that's really not a great answer for somebody

1311
00:58:54,045 --> 00:58:55,687
who's already like, ugh, I'm already working

1312
00:58:55,707 --> 00:58:56,668
like a gazillion hours.

1313
00:58:57,369 --> 00:58:59,831
So, yeah, but it's really like doing the job you want

1314
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:00,572
before you have it.

1315
00:59:01,393 --> 00:59:02,494
It's how to get promotions too.

1316
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,723
Yeah, on a following note, I work in a mobile gaming company,

1317
00:59:08,223 --> 00:59:12,666
and I want to eventually work for a AAA console company

1318
00:59:13,507 --> 00:59:15,609
in a production role.

1319
00:59:15,649 --> 00:59:16,769
What's some advice you might have

1320
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:19,812
for that kind of transition or marketing myself?

1321
00:59:20,232 --> 00:59:21,653
Yeah, that's a hard one if you...

1322
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:23,855
I mean, I was in AAA and then went to mobile

1323
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:24,755
and then came back to AAA, so...

1324
00:59:27,421 --> 00:59:31,104
I think it's a tough jump from mobile to AAA,

1325
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:33,386
and I think you probably need to figure out a way.

1326
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:35,147
And really, one of the biggest differences

1327
00:59:35,207 --> 00:59:38,469
is the quality of the art and the environments,

1328
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,812
typically is the biggest chasm I've found.

1329
00:59:42,452 --> 00:59:46,916
And the technology as well, just behind game engines.

1330
00:59:46,996 --> 00:59:49,317
But you need to figure out a way to get yourself

1331
00:59:49,357 --> 00:59:50,278
some of that experience.

1332
00:59:50,698 --> 00:59:54,161
You need to find a project to work on, again,

1333
00:59:54,201 --> 00:59:55,862
in your copious amounts of spare time.

1334
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:58,175
Thank you very much.

1335
00:59:58,395 --> 00:59:58,777
Good luck.

1336
01:00:00,441 --> 01:00:01,725
All right, well, thanks very much today.
