1
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:08,013
Good morning.

2
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:08,913
Thank you for coming.

3
00:00:08,913 --> 00:00:09,874
My name is Emma Kidwell.

4
00:00:09,874 --> 00:00:13,057
I'll be moderating the session on behalf of Celia.

5
00:00:13,057 --> 00:00:16,059
If you have any questions, you can type them

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,901
into the chat box next to the session video,

7
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,764
where I'll field them to Celia, pending if we

8
00:00:21,764 --> 00:00:23,925
have time for questions.

9
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:26,327
Celia, I'm going to hand it off to you.

10
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:26,587
Thank you, Emma.

11
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:27,108
Hi, everyone.

12
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:30,551
I'm happy to be here at GDC Summer.

13
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:35,134
And I hope that everybody is doing well, as well as

14
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:36,435
your loved ones.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,261
So my name is Sylvia Houdent and I have a PhD in psychology

16
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:44,223
and I've been working in the video game industry

17
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:44,623
over 12 years now.

18
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:47,884
I've worked at Ubisoft, I've worked at LucasArts

19
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:48,925
and I worked at Epic Games.

20
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:52,626
I was director of UX at Epic at the studio level

21
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:56,388
and I worked on Unreal Engine, I worked on a bunch of games

22
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:58,789
and I worked very closely with the Fortnite team.

23
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:00,109
I left Epic in October, 2017.

24
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:03,911
And ever since then, I'm a independent consultant.

25
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,440
And so I help a lot of companies, like AAA companies,

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,323
smaller companies, to develop their UX mindsets

27
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:16,387
and to develop processes and train people and all that.

28
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:19,510
So this approach of emotion is going

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,492
to be through the lens of UX.

30
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:31,512
My framework for UX is to break it down into two big pillars.

31
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:35,056
So you have usability and engageability.

32
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:38,360
When you try to anticipate problems

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,122
from happening in your game and you try to...

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,325
you know, improve things. There are two big lenses. Usability is the ability of the game to be used,

35
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:52,648
so it's more about the functionality. Are people understanding what to do? Can they accomplish

36
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:56,450
the objectives they need to accomplish, like if they need to craft in your game?

37
00:01:56,931 --> 00:01:58,532
can they understand how to craft?

38
00:01:58,532 --> 00:01:59,954
So that's the usability part.

39
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:03,117
And a game can be usable, but boring.

40
00:02:03,117 --> 00:02:05,399
It's not because a game is gonna be easy to understand

41
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,041
and easy to use that it's gonna make it engaging.

42
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,564
So we also need to look into engageability,

43
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,205
especially for video games,

44
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:15,448
because the whole point of interacting with a system

45
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:19,152
and when you play a game is to have fun and be engaged

46
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:20,393
and to interact with the system.

47
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:25,756
So engageability is more around stuff like motivation, emotion,

48
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:26,236
and game flow.

49
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:28,737
So this is a framework that I've been

50
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:31,699
using to tackle problems like UX issues

51
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:34,360
so that we can understand where they come from,

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,441
and then we can fix them.

53
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:39,323
I did a bunch of GDC presentations on the topic.

54
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:43,545
They are called the Gamer's Brain, and part one, part two,

55
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:44,225
part three.

56
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:47,527
So you can just go back and see that if you're interested

57
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:49,568
and you haven't seen it before.

58
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:57,275
But here, we're going to tackle emotion in this framework,

59
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:03,740
and again, through the lens of UX and by understanding what's the science behind it,

60
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,704
and how we can use it to improve the user experience of a game.

61
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:14,695
So there's gonna be three big parts in this presentation.

62
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,096
We're gonna start with the science of emotion.

63
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,437
I'm not gonna go super deep, of course,

64
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:23,959
but it's just for you to have a broad understanding

65
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,540
of what's going on in the brain when we have emotions.

66
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,302
And then we're gonna talk about the UX framework

67
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:34,103
to use emotion in game design.

68
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,902
And lastly, we're going to touch on ethics considerations.

69
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:44,827
Of course, there's a lot of stuff to say around emotion.

70
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:47,749
In 45, 40, 45 minutes, I really don't have time

71
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,811
to talk about many things.

72
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:53,093
So the idea is just to give you an overview.

73
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:55,175
And during the questions, I can also

74
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:56,556
dive deeper into some elements.

75
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:10,835
So the limbic system is what is thought to be responsible for emotion in the human brain.

76
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:17,256
There is a broad consensus around it in science, but it's not completely clear. There are some

77
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:22,317
scientists that actually don't agree that there is such a thing as the limbic system.

78
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:26,838
But for the sake of simplicity here, let's say that there is some sort of consensus around this.

79
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:32,683
And so the limbic system, it's a lot of parts in the brain

80
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:36,927
that take part that are in this system.

81
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,189
You can see here just a few of them,

82
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,651
and these ones are very deep down the brain.

83
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:45,934
So on the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala,

84
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,236
the frontal lobe is more on the cortex area.

85
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:57,685
And the hippocampus is an interesting part of the brain

86
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:59,866
because we know that it's also taking part

87
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,827
into memory, into souvenirs.

88
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:07,169
And the amygdala is oftentimes the part of the brain

89
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,851
that we mention when we talk about emotion and fight

90
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:14,752
or flight restances.

91
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:21,515
So it's just for you to have a big overview of what

92
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:22,635
we call the limbic system.

93
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:26,386
And so usually when we talk about emotion,

94
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:29,747
it's to say that it's guiding our behavior.

95
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,728
We need to survive in this world,

96
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:35,450
and so we seek pleasure and we avoid pain.

97
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:41,053
This is how we can find food and mate

98
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:43,835
and carry on with our genes

99
00:05:43,835 --> 00:05:46,696
and avoid getting killed or getting hurt.

100
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:49,177
So overall, emotion is very good for that.

101
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:50,998
If we try something, it's pleasurable.

102
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:54,387
We're going to remember that, we're going to do it again.

103
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,848
So we do need to remember that.

104
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:59,271
And that's typically like the amygdala

105
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,732
and the hippocampus is helping us do that.

106
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:04,294
And of course, if we're experiencing something

107
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:06,496
and it's having a bad outcome,

108
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:09,898
this is where we remember not to do this again.

109
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:13,421
So it's really important to have these emotions

110
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:18,284
so it can guide us through our lives.

111
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:19,125
Oops, sorry.

112
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:26,353
So we learn to recognize and avoid unpleasant situations.

113
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,953
So here's an example.

114
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:32,415
If you've been, if you've experienced being bitten by a dog,

115
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:34,055
you will remember that.

116
00:06:34,055 --> 00:06:37,396
And we learn some elements.

117
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:43,019
There are some, there's a very natural, I would say,

118
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,339
but some that we learn.

119
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:51,736
and we can reduce that in video games and of course artists do that very well.

120
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:56,559
For example, if you see an enemy that has very sharp teeth like here in Mario,

121
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:03,463
you don't need to really experience what's going to happen when you get close to it.

122
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:09,386
You understand that this is an enemy, that it is dangerous, and that you should avoid it. Otherwise

123
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:14,935
we're gonna probably get hurt. So through emotions, that sort of emotions, we can guide our players

124
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:20,625
to understand what's a good outcome and what's probably dangerous.

125
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:27,517
That's pretty basic, but a lot of people misunderstand conditioning a little bit.

126
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:35,163
Conditioning has a bad name today, and sure enough, when we think about conditioning,

127
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:40,407
we think about the Skinner box, and we think about the experiments that he did

128
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:48,073
mostly with rats and with pigeons, and they had to tap or to press on a pedal, for example,

129
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:49,894
when there was a light lining up.

130
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:53,947
to get food, but they also need to learn to press a pedal

131
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:56,729
or to not press a certain pedal to avoid

132
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:58,310
getting electrical shocks.

133
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,371
So this is what conditioning is about.

134
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:03,633
You learn to, this is more specifically

135
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,774
operant conditioning, so you see a stimulus,

136
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:09,316
you need to do a certain action,

137
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:11,257
so press the pedal, for example,

138
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:16,320
in order to either get a reward or to avoid a punishment.

139
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:22,505
This is something that we use in our lives all the time.

140
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:25,427
If you think about shaking hands, for example,

141
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,249
we've been conditioned to, every time you

142
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:30,892
see someone doing this gesture, like raising out

143
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:33,053
to reach out to your hand, we have

144
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:35,896
been conditioned to do the same because this

145
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:37,977
is a social construct and we need to do that.

146
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:43,362
Today we can't do this anymore and so we have to repress that movement.

147
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:49,567
Now today we got used to it but for a moment it was hard to, at the very beginning of the pandemic,

148
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:55,151
it was really hard to repress ourselves to shake hands and that happened to me very often

149
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:58,274
and that's because we've been conditioned.

150
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:04,836
to do that. And so in that case, we need to relearn because we have, like, for example, people, if

151
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:11,300
I try to reach out to you, and I see that you're looking at me like, no, I mean, we need to be

152
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:20,866
careful. This can be interpreted as a negative outcome. And because social relatedness and

153
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:26,509
social elements are really important for humans, we're going to react. We're going to change our

154
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:33,858
our pattern to react to this to have a better, more adapted response.

155
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:42,644
So this is what conditioning is about. It's about learning to repeat certain actions that lead to

156
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:49,048
pleasurable outcomes and to avoid certain actions that lead to non-pleasurable outcomes or dangerous

157
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:49,248
ones.

158
00:09:50,468 --> 00:09:55,269
I'm going to make you listen to this sound effect.

159
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,210
So be careful.

160
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,611
It should not be too loud, but just like if you have headphones, just be careful.

161
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:02,351
This is a sound coming up.

162
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:09,474
So listen to this sound.

163
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:10,514
I didn't hear anything.

164
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:16,356
I don't know if you heard the sound in there.

165
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:17,476
I hope you did.

166
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:19,097
I did not have feedback on that.

167
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:25,150
Um, so this was the sound from Metal Gear Solid.

168
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:29,325
So if people have played Metal Gear Solid,

169
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:31,186
this is a sound that is very recognizable

170
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:34,067
and that you've been conditioned to react to

171
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,627
whenever you hear it,

172
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:38,268
because you know that it's the sound that we hear

173
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:40,029
whenever there are enemies around

174
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:41,629
that are about to spot you.

175
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:47,131
So you've been conditioned to either hide very quickly

176
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:49,792
or go into the open and shoot at everybody.

177
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,432
So this is an example of conditioning

178
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:53,793
that is pretty powerful in a video game

179
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:55,213
because it can guide us.

180
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:58,756
And it's also creating some emotional arrestments, of course.

181
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:00,578
It's raising your awareness because we

182
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:04,281
know that there is danger around,

183
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:07,783
because this particular stimulus has been tied to danger.

184
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:12,607
So that's an example of how we can use emotions in games

185
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:15,830
and use conditioning, and not in a way that

186
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,092
is going to be tricky.

187
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:23,116
We're going to talk about dark patterns and emotions that

188
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:30,160
not so good, that creates some manipulation is not so good,

189
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,421
but conditioning is very important in our lives

190
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:36,422
and this is a very efficient way to learn.

191
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:38,742
For example, another example of real life

192
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:40,823
is you've been conditioned if you start driving

193
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:42,383
and you forgot to fasten your seat belt,

194
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:45,884
then your car's gonna beep and we react to that beep

195
00:11:45,884 --> 00:11:47,265
because it's super annoying by.

196
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:49,987
fastening up our seatbelt.

197
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:53,618
This is the restlessness that we've been conditioned to do

198
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:55,685
so that the annoying beeping stops.

199
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:01,485
So emotion guides our cognition, and this idea

200
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:08,908
that we need to be emotionless to reason appropriately

201
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:09,929
is not true.

202
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,270
You have the same neural networks

203
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,412
that take part into emotion, also take part into reasoning.

204
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:20,434
And so cognition and emotion work together.

205
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:28,037
We need emotions to be able to have an adaptive response

206
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:28,577
to our will.

207
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:35,572
Music is very particular and

208
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:46,562
and our brain because we have a very special resonance to music for some reason. So it's

209
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:53,326
one of the most rewarding and pleasurable experiences for humans. And it's modulating,

210
00:12:53,326 --> 00:13:02,290
it can modulate activity in the regions that are associated with primary rainforces, such as food.

211
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:07,871
or sex. So it's particularly powerful, and that's the reason why we can have goosebumps,

212
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:14,353
or we can cry when we listen to certain music. It is particularly powerful in humans, and so,

213
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:22,935
of course, we should use that in video games, when you have games. I know that on mobile,

214
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:28,736
a lot of people turn the sound off, so it's, of course, creating some constraints. But in the...

215
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:36,432
other games, it's really important to polish the sound design and the music, but without

216
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:43,097
forgetting about accessibility and players who have hearing impairments or are deaf,

217
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:45,880
so that they are also taken into account.

218
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,316
So emotion guides our behavior.

219
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,797
But what's interesting, it's also

220
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:57,178
influenced by our cognition.

221
00:13:57,178 --> 00:14:01,560
So we saw that emotion is making us do stuff

222
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,380
that we're going to interpret later on.

223
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,721
So emotion guides our cognition.

224
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:09,163
But also, our cognition is influencing our emotions.

225
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:12,374
Then I'm going to take an example.

226
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:14,816
I'm French, so I'll take an example

227
00:14:14,816 --> 00:14:18,660
with a bottle of champagne, a fine bottle of champagne.

228
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,162
If you have two bottles of champagne,

229
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:22,024
like this one is Dom Pérignon.

230
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:24,126
So if you know about champagne, it's

231
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:27,070
a very expensive brand of champagne.

232
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,592
And the bottle looks really, really nice.

233
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:30,673
It's really appealing.

234
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:35,879
And let's say you have another bottle of champagne, it's like a plastic bottle,

235
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:43,208
and it looks super cheap. And we ask you to try the champagne from both of these bottles.

236
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:47,673
Most people are going to have a tendency to think that, to feel that the champagne coming from a nice

237
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:54,455
The very fine bottle tastes better than the one from the plastic bottle, but of course,

238
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:55,656
it's the same champagne.

239
00:14:55,656 --> 00:15:02,778
And so this is how our cognition, our expectations is changing actually how we feel about things.

240
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,599
This is what we call appraisal.

241
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:12,581
We judge of situations based on what we know, based on our culture, based on social constructs.

242
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:13,802
And so this is in.

243
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,142
impacting our conscious feeling of things.

244
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:20,462
So that's appraisal.

245
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,843
And that's really important to understand

246
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:28,104
because we know that our perception is subjective.

247
00:15:28,104 --> 00:15:30,805
It can be cultural-based.

248
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,766
And so this is going to have an impact on how we feel

249
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,807
about things about art.

250
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:38,708
And so we need to take that into account.

251
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,208
So that's appraisal.

252
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,009
You also have reappraisal.

253
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,430
So reappraisal is when you have some bad emotion,

254
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,771
like some negative emotion happening,

255
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,752
let's say you just lost a game.

256
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:55,355
And reappraisal is when you try to get over it,

257
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,957
and it could be seen as seeing the glass half full

258
00:15:58,957 --> 00:15:59,897
instead of half empty.

259
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:04,199
Here's an example in a multiplayer game, Overwatch,

260
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,540
an old screenshot, where they do that pretty well.

261
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,821
In any multiplayer game that is competitive,

262
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:12,982
you're always going to have some players that are going to

263
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:14,483
have some negative emotions because they lost,

264
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:17,164
and so it's going to be important to help them

265
00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:19,565
reappraise the situation.

266
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:23,726
Here's the screen that you would see when you were on

267
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:23,806
the

268
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,568
on the victorious team.

269
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,130
So for those who don't know, Overwatch is a game

270
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,332
you play six versus six.

271
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:36,035
And this is what you would see when you win.

272
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:40,999
So you have badges and your XP is going up

273
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,200
and it's all great.

274
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:46,996
When you're on the defeated team, you actually,

275
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:48,817
so you have the feedback that you lost,

276
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:52,879
but they don't insist on how crappy you are to have lost.

277
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,061
It's not like, oh, you suck, you lost.

278
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:58,983
They tell you that you are defeated.

279
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:05,689
But they try to help you rephrase the situation by showing you how you got better against your own stats.

280
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:09,192
So they don't emphasize how you compare to other players,

281
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:13,697
because it's very likely that we're not on top of the charts.

282
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:21,525
In the 6v6 game, there's one player that's on top of the scoreboard and all others are not.

283
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,807
But if you compare people to their own stats...

284
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:28,449
It is very likely that we're going to get better because we played more.

285
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:34,051
And so as we practice the game, we are very likely to progress.

286
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:37,072
And that is a very good feeling.

287
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:42,014
So one of the elements that I showed you from the framework that I'm using in motivation

288
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:43,074
is intrinsic motivation.

289
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:47,256
One part of this is competence.

290
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:53,438
We need to feel competent in an activity to be motivated to keep doing that activity.

291
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,220
And so in a game where there's a lot of competence going on,

292
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,422
it's really important to see ourselves progressing.

293
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:02,804
So if it's a skill-based game and we practice,

294
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:04,885
we are likely to get better.

295
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:08,547
And so if you emphasize how the player is getting better

296
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,729
against their own stats, it's helping them reappraise

297
00:18:11,729 --> 00:18:12,890
the fact that they lost.

298
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:15,832
So this is an example of how by understanding

299
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:19,034
a little bit better how emotion is working,

300
00:18:19,034 --> 00:18:25,498
you can help designing for some experiences that

301
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:29,841
are going to be more pleasurable emotionally for players.

302
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:32,562
So that's to sum up this part.

303
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:35,964
Emotion guides our behavior and cognition,

304
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:39,226
and cognition in return influences our emotion.

305
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,577
So now we're going to talk about emotion in game design.

306
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:49,463
And to talk about this, we're going to start by talking.

307
00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:52,608
about emotion in design.

308
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:58,130
So Don Norman is a UX designer and a kind of scientist,

309
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,592
and he's the one who coined the term UX back in the 90s.

310
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:04,933
So he's like the father of the UX mindset.

311
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:07,395
And he has a book called Emotional Design

312
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,395
where he explains a little bit

313
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:11,016
the three levels of processing

314
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,918
when we interact with an object or a system,

315
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:18,059
we're gonna process the system

316
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:18,640
through.

317
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,889
three levels that are going to create some emotions. So the first one is visceral. That's

318
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:32,840
the level that is very based on appearance. It's like your gut feeling, like the term is pretty

319
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,501
self-explanatory.

320
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:37,245
It's visceral, so it's how things look.

321
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:39,888
Bright colors, for example, or how things taste.

322
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,730
The look, feel, the sounds.

323
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,575
This is really like you just look at something

324
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:47,597
and it looks amazing.

325
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:48,758
If you're into cars, you know,

326
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:49,599
they're the cars that.

327
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:51,900
there's a lot of, um,

328
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,422
like, like, like, like, like

329
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:57,443
Luke, uh, had like lines that

330
00:19:57,443 --> 00:20:00,425
are either aggressive or they

331
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:01,626
really feel that they're

332
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:03,347
powerful. This is all about

333
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:05,468
visceral design. And so that's

334
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:08,429
really important in games as

335
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:09,850
well, of course, and, uh, all

336
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,551
about presentation art, um,

337
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:14,513
direction, but also game feel

338
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:15,813
we're going to talk about

339
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:18,508
The next level is behavioral.

340
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,730
So it's how do we interact with that system?

341
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,792
So it's the pleasure and effectiveness of use.

342
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:27,534
So this time, it's less about how it looks,

343
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:28,694
you know, how beautiful it is.

344
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,175
It's not about the aesthetic.

345
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,236
It's about the functionality.

346
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:34,818
It's about am I able to accomplish the things

347
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,779
that I want to accomplish?

348
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:39,361
And so in UX, we call that usability.

349
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:42,743
We make sure that a system like a video game

350
00:20:43,063 --> 00:20:47,606
is going to be designed to be used by a human.

351
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:51,308
This is what we call human-centered design.

352
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:53,169
We make sure that it's usable,

353
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,971
so that we understand the sense and feedback,

354
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:58,713
that we understand how to use the system.

355
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:00,274
We have form follows function,

356
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:02,716
function comes first, and we try to make sure

357
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:05,037
that the functionality is conveyed

358
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:08,299
through the shape and sound of the element.

359
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:15,251
All of these things is about behavioral level and of course accessibility is in there.

360
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:19,189
And the last level is reflective.

361
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:23,132
So this is more about the self-image

362
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:26,314
that we get when we interact with the system.

363
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:30,657
Maybe we felt guilt or maybe we are proud because we won.

364
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,219
So that's self-image.

365
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:35,241
Personal satisfaction, memories.

366
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:38,663
So it's all about the meaning of elements.

367
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:41,785
What it makes you think about.

368
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:47,900
If you think about Star Wars, if you're in your 30s or 40s,

369
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,700
you know, you have like that memories

370
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,041
that are attached to it.

371
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,721
And it's more about, you know,

372
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:57,062
the battle of the good against evil,

373
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:59,702
more than a political movie.

374
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:02,603
So it's all about the story, the narrative,

375
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:07,804
the meaning, what does it mean to you?

376
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:10,565
So it's not now, not about the functionality,

377
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,165
but it's about how you reflect.

378
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:20,869
on this. Novelty is also a part of it. We like to have novel experiences, and so we

379
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:28,692
can reflect on these elements. So this is the baseline, the three levels of process

380
00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:33,854
when we interact with anything. So these all happen at the same time, and this was very

381
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:34,954
well described by Don Norris.

382
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:40,238
Here I'm going to show you how we use in game design emotion

383
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:41,139
more specifically.

384
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:44,479
So there are two big notions in game design

385
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:46,140
to tackle emotion.

386
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,821
The first one is what we call game feel.

387
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:53,882
So there's a book by Steve Swink that describes very well

388
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:55,782
what game feel is about.

389
00:22:55,782 --> 00:22:59,043
But basically, it's how good it feels to interact with the game.

390
00:22:59,363 --> 00:23:02,885
So there are three very important notions in here.

391
00:23:02,885 --> 00:23:06,586
The first one is what we call the three Cs.

392
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:09,087
And I'm going to describe that a bit later.

393
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,508
So it's a camera-controlled character.

394
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:14,249
It's also about the sense of presence.

395
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:18,711
Do I feel, is there anything preventing me from feeling

396
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:21,752
that I am inside the game?

397
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:25,175
And the last one is the sense of physical reality.

398
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,777
Is it believable when, I don't know,

399
00:23:27,777 --> 00:23:29,779
if there's a game where you explode balloons,

400
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:34,903
do you have a believable physical experience in there?

401
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:40,487
Balloons popping with a specific sound effect,

402
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:40,948
VFX, et cetera.

403
00:23:42,563 --> 00:23:45,426
So to be more precise, the three Cs, like I said,

404
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:48,148
it's camera, control, characters.

405
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:51,250
So camera is gonna have a very big impact

406
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,292
on how we feel about the game, of course.

407
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:56,914
So if you have a game that is godlike,

408
00:23:56,914 --> 00:23:58,735
most of the time you're gonna have a top-down

409
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:01,237
or isometric view of the game

410
00:24:01,237 --> 00:24:04,139
because you feel that you can control things

411
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:05,680
and you're managing it.

412
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,924
all this world. If you want a game that's more about the thrill, about being scared,

413
00:24:12,924 --> 00:24:18,307
which is the visceral level, like being scared about something like a roller coaster or horror

414
00:24:18,307 --> 00:24:28,052
movies is the visceral level. And to accomplish that, we're going to use a first-person camera

415
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:30,293
and most of the time we're going to have a narrow...

416
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:36,719
field of view, so it feels like you don't see around, and it's much easier to jump scare people

417
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:43,305
when we do that. So the choice of camera is going to have a big impact on how the game feels, and

418
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:50,052
it's of course very important. It's one of the main elements that we need to tackle in a game.

419
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:54,216
Another very critical element are the controls.

420
00:24:55,137 --> 00:25:01,841
how the players are going to be able to interact with the system and what are the controls?

421
00:25:01,841 --> 00:25:09,907
Is it going to be easy to do or do you feel like an octopus to accomplish some very common

422
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:11,288
actions in the game?

423
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:18,636
I'm showing here the controls from ESK because it was a very interesting use of controls.

424
00:25:18,636 --> 00:25:26,804
So ESK is the game about skating and instead of using the face buttons for the tricks,

425
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:28,546
they used the thumbstick.

426
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:33,708
The idea was to try to recreate with your thumb

427
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:37,169
the sort of physical feeling that you would get

428
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,290
while skating.

429
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,091
And so that was an interesting approach to control.

430
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:44,512
So the controls and how could they feel,

431
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:50,395
if they feel natural or is it kind of weird?

432
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:54,896
It's not by chance that we have...

433
00:25:55,462 --> 00:26:06,516
that we shoot on a console game with the triggers because it feels like a trigger from a real gun

434
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:11,723
so and it's and you hold it and it's you have a good grip in your hand so.

435
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:14,841
Controls are also very important to nail in your game.

436
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,822
And the last one is character.

437
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:21,283
So the main character is the avatar of the player, of course,

438
00:26:21,283 --> 00:26:23,823
but all the characters in the game are gonna be important

439
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:26,784
and they need to convey some emotions.

440
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:30,625
So of course we care a lot about who are these characters?

441
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:33,025
What do they transcend?

442
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:37,306
And so here's an example from Hellblade and you have Senua.

443
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:41,910
She's the avatar, she's the heroine of the game,

444
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:47,896
and you see, for example, there's an element from this character model,

445
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:52,340
as she has that rat that is growing on her hand every time she dies.

446
00:26:53,630 --> 00:27:01,352
and while we time the player dies and she experimented in her world and so you see that

447
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:08,714
thing growing on her arm. So all these elements are really really important to have a good game

448
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:16,597
feel and many big studios they are tackling camera controls characters first during their

449
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:20,978
pre-production so that they can nail that the best they can.

450
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:25,026
So that was for the three Cs.

451
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:28,068
And then I told you about presence and physical reality.

452
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:31,610
So presence is, do I feel present in the game?

453
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,231
And by that, I don't mean removing the HUD.

454
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:37,373
It's not by removing all the things

455
00:27:37,373 --> 00:27:40,435
that you necessarily can have a bigger sense of presence.

456
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:44,717
Like, imagine if you drive a new car that you don't know.

457
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:47,819
It's not about removing all the controls

458
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,740
and all the dashboard that's going

459
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,401
to make you feel that you're on the road.

460
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:53,001
When these.

461
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:58,383
controls and dashboard are not in the way and feels natural and you can just concentrate on the road.

462
00:27:58,383 --> 00:28:03,625
It's the same thing with the video game, you have the controls and you have the interface and you

463
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:09,747
have the head, but when it's not in the way this is when you can feel that you have presence

464
00:28:09,747 --> 00:28:13,928
in the game. So of course usability is really important to nail that.

465
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:18,611
Presence is also, do I feel that I'm part of the world?

466
00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:25,096
So if you look at a game where you have a crowd AI,

467
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:30,800
is the crowd reacting in a realistic way to what you're doing?

468
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,142
So for example, in Assassin's Creed, if you're doing something weird

469
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:36,865
or you assassinate someone in the street and people see you,

470
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:40,628
if the crowd is reacting to that, it makes you feel present in the game.

471
00:28:41,005 --> 00:28:46,370
In 2D, for example, in a mobile game like Clash of Clans,

472
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,471
you want to build a new building

473
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:50,813
and you feel that sense of presence

474
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,374
because as you say, yeah, I wanna build that,

475
00:28:52,374 --> 00:28:54,816
you have the little characters that come over

476
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,737
and they start building.

477
00:28:55,737 --> 00:28:59,200
And so it makes you feel that you have a real presence

478
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,582
into the world and the game world is reacting to you.

479
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:07,271
The narrative also is really important for presence.

480
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:11,293
The story, you know, can I make choices

481
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:16,496
that are gonna be meaningful for the story?

482
00:29:16,496 --> 00:29:18,137
All that increases the same with presence

483
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:19,318
and music and all that.

484
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:22,640
I can't cover it all, but it's like pretty important.

485
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:27,527
And physical reality, is it believable?

486
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:29,969
So I told you, like, if you pop balloons in a game,

487
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,990
do you feel that it is balloon?

488
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,512
Is it doing like the pop sound

489
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:35,033
that you would expect from balloons?

490
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,782
Do you have particle effects?

491
00:29:38,782 --> 00:29:40,843
If you have a very strong character

492
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:43,204
that is running towards you,

493
00:29:43,204 --> 00:29:44,985
you might have like a camera shake

494
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:47,146
every time the character, like as it runs,

495
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:49,587
the foot hits the ground.

496
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:52,169
So all these elements are about physical reality.

497
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:54,250
It is not about photo realism.

498
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,252
Again, it's more about is it believable in the game?

499
00:29:58,252 --> 00:30:01,214
So here I'm gonna show you an example from Fortnite.

500
00:30:01,214 --> 00:30:01,874
Again, so it's old.

501
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:04,576
It's from the closed alpha around the loot box.

502
00:30:04,576 --> 00:30:06,658
Why I'm showing you that?

503
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:09,820
Because it's particularly the game feel,

504
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,502
and this is particularly well done.

505
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:16,386
You can see that the loot box is not just a box,

506
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:19,368
it's not just a chest or a card pack that you would open.

507
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:23,230
It is in the shape of a llama pinata.

508
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,031
So that's all about presence.

509
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,572
You know, it's also about the narrative.

510
00:30:26,572 --> 00:30:28,713
You know, how does it fit the world?

511
00:30:28,713 --> 00:30:32,394
It's also reacting to you when you move the mouse around.

512
00:30:32,394 --> 00:30:34,795
Its eyes, they are following you.

513
00:30:34,795 --> 00:30:35,836
And when you're about to hit it,

514
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,897
so you have like a, it feels,

515
00:30:37,897 --> 00:30:41,418
you have that sense of physical reality,

516
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:44,619
and then you have particle effects and all that.

517
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:47,120
So I'm gonna show you how it looks like.

518
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,281
Hopefully you'll have the sound.

519
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:58,068
It's a lovely day for loot.

520
00:30:58,068 --> 00:30:58,809
Have at it.

521
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:05,935
Oh, I am feeling lucky.

522
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:08,197
Hey, check out this nice loot.

523
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:19,204
Alright, so you see, you know, there's stuff happening, and oh, you get something cool,

524
00:31:19,204 --> 00:31:22,850
you know, it's changed in color, and you have all this, all this stuff happening.

525
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:29,259
So all of that is about game feel, and it's really important to polish it and the game

526
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:31,863
to increase the emotional connection that we have to it.

527
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:38,459
OK, so that was about game feel.

528
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:41,381
And arguably, we can talk about hours about that.

529
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:43,302
But I just want to move on so that you

530
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:48,044
have an overview about all the things that you can talk about.

531
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:53,307
There's also the brain is pretty reactive to novelty

532
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:55,708
because anything new in our environment

533
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:57,349
can potentially kill us.

534
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,430
So we have a tendency to.

535
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,253
to pay attention, to raise our awareness when something is new

536
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:05,575
and that can be potentially dangerous.

537
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:08,278
So that's the reason why we love novelty.

538
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:11,120
We love to have surprises and to discover things.

539
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,904
This is why learning is pleasurable most of the time.

540
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:20,007
And we can use that to sustain engagement so that players

541
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:20,888
are not getting bored.

542
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:22,249
If you always do the same activity,

543
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:24,491
even though you like that activity, at some point,

544
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:27,394
your awareness is decreasing.

545
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:30,116
because you don't really need to pay attention.

546
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:33,601
So that's the reason why novelty,

547
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:35,523
so discovery, surprises, curiosity,

548
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:40,270
all things that we can use to raise engagements and awareness.

549
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,509
So some examples of that.

550
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:48,511
In Zelda, they teased players a lot.

551
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:51,713
They teased players' curiosity.

552
00:32:51,713 --> 00:32:55,235
So in this old screenshot from A Link to the Past,

553
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:56,676
you see the cracks in the wall.

554
00:32:56,676 --> 00:33:00,118
And these are new cracks from this wall.

555
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:02,719
It's a different wall that you've never seen before.

556
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:05,081
And so players see that for the first time.

557
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:07,442
And they're like, oh, that seems new.

558
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:08,583
And how do I interact with that?

559
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:09,403
And this is how you.

560
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:13,426
learn that you need a super bomb to explode this particular wall.

561
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:20,148
So through something a bit new, it cannot be too new because then it can be very scary to have

562
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:26,531
something completely new, but we like to have some novelty and to have our curiosity teased.

563
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:28,511
Another example of that is

564
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:32,666
Uncharted 3, in Uncharted 3 you have a section in the game

565
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,488
where you're in a ship and the ship is sinking.

566
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:40,230
As it sinks, it's rotating, it's tilting at 90 degrees

567
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,592
and all your controls are rotated 90 degrees as a result.

568
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:48,333
So it's creating some sort of some new surprise

569
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,935
and that's tied to game feel, so it's tied to controls.

570
00:33:50,935 --> 00:33:53,876
And so for example, if you try to move forward,

571
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:56,337
your character is actually moving left.

572
00:33:56,737 --> 00:34:00,718
And that creates some sort of novelty.

573
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:03,739
So it's good to do that once the player is already

574
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:06,020
used to the controls.

575
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,201
So that brings some sort of novelty

576
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:10,661
that is raising your awareness.

577
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:13,662
Another game does that.

578
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:15,823
Limbo does that.

579
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:19,504
You have a level where it's a side-scrolling.

580
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:30,030
platforming puzzle game and at some point you have a level where your gravity is upside

581
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,492
down. So you arrive in the sub-level of Solemn EQ.

582
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,060
you get stuck to the ceiling.

583
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,301
So all these elements are something new

584
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:38,521
that's happening in the game,

585
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:41,382
at some point when you're already used to the game,

586
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:44,063
so that is raising awareness.

587
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:47,724
Another example more tied to narrative

588
00:34:47,724 --> 00:34:51,725
is on Fortnite or on Diablo, you have the mimics.

589
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:54,146
So you think it's a chest,

590
00:34:54,146 --> 00:34:56,146
and you don't even pay attention,

591
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:58,587
you just like hold to open it,

592
00:34:58,587 --> 00:35:00,428
and surprise, this is not a chest,

593
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:02,648
it is an enemy that's trying to destroy you.

594
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:04,969
So all these things bring some novelty.

595
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:08,630
The problem with that is you need

596
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:13,052
to make it novel quite often to work.

597
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:18,514
And that's the reason why we need to always have

598
00:35:18,514 --> 00:35:24,516
new elements in an online game that is live so that players

599
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:25,476
are not getting bored.

600
00:35:25,947 --> 00:35:29,208
So one of the ways to do that is to have new content,

601
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:34,109
so DLC or new seasons or new characters or new maps.

602
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:37,470
Multiplayer games can be more engaging in the long term

603
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,830
because every time you play, it can be with different players.

604
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,731
So it can bring something new.

605
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:45,531
Or systemic, procedurally generated games

606
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:49,092
can help with that because every time you play,

607
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:51,113
it's going to be a little bit different.

608
00:35:51,113 --> 00:35:53,733
Arguably, it's taking a lot of time,

609
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:54,833
and it's also making...

610
00:35:55,762 --> 00:36:00,104
The game workers crunch quite a bit,

611
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:02,665
so it does have its downside, for sure.

612
00:36:02,665 --> 00:36:08,168
Just here are a few books if you want

613
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:09,768
to dive more into the topics.

614
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,769
So Emotional Design from Don Norman, Game Film

615
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,650
from Steve Swink, and How Games Move Us

616
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,831
from Catherine Neswister.

617
00:36:18,547 --> 00:36:21,708
And again, think about emotion.

618
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,010
So in my framework, I explained that emotion

619
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,091
is here to support motivation,

620
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:30,873
and this is what you really need to do

621
00:36:30,873 --> 00:36:35,356
to think about game feel and presence and surprises

622
00:36:35,356 --> 00:36:38,017
and how this can support player motivation

623
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:42,720
in terms of competence, autonomy, and relatedness.

624
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,561
So for example, if you have particle effects,

625
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:46,382
it's even more meaningful if it's because

626
00:36:46,382 --> 00:36:48,083
you just want something or you.

627
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:51,204
accomplished a goal, and so you feel competent.

628
00:36:51,204 --> 00:37:00,790
So the last, so yeah, this is it for this part.

629
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,392
So remember to use game feel, spaces, presence,

630
00:37:04,392 --> 00:37:07,634
physical reality, and novelty to sustain engagement.

631
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:11,896
And the last part, I'm going to go fast

632
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:16,859
because I'm already, it's really late already.

633
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:16,939
So.

634
00:37:18,394 --> 00:37:21,215
It's all about trying to manipulate emotions ethically.

635
00:37:21,215 --> 00:37:24,757
There is no such thing as neutral design.

636
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:26,899
And the thing that we design is going

637
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:31,622
to influence people to interact with it in a certain way.

638
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:34,043
For example, if you have a handle on a door,

639
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:38,586
this is influencing you to grab the handle and pull.

640
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:41,085
So sometimes these doors need to be pushed

641
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:42,386
and that's a bit annoying.

642
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:46,767
So it manipulated you into a wrong behavioral response.

643
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,208
So it's not the end of the world,

644
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:50,949
but everything that we create, everything that we design

645
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:53,610
is gonna have an impact on people's expectations

646
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,591
and behavior and art, of course,

647
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:58,151
is about manipulating emotion.

648
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,412
So we need to understand that nothing we do

649
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,573
is gonna be neutral and we need to ensure

650
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:05,754
that this is not gonna have a negative impact

651
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:07,034
on our players, of course.

652
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,106
So I told you that we need emotion to think rationally,

653
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:18,650
to accomplish our goals, and to be able to reason.

654
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,214
The problem is emotions can trick us, of course.

655
00:38:22,214 --> 00:38:25,717
So here are just a few examples that have been

656
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:27,880
studied by behavioral economics.

657
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,501
You have the example of scarcity.

658
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:34,806
When something is getting scarce, like we had a few countries like that,

659
00:38:34,806 --> 00:38:40,390
where because of the pandemic, all of a sudden there were a scarcity in toilet paper.

660
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:45,014
And so when there's scarcity, even though you don't care that much about toilet paper,

661
00:38:45,014 --> 00:38:48,056
now we want it because we might not have it.

662
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:51,439
And so scarcity works a lot with the fear of missing out, the FOMO.

663
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:55,182
because we know that maybe it's gonna be gone

664
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:56,623
before I get there.

665
00:38:56,623 --> 00:38:59,385
So anytime you see sales,

666
00:38:59,385 --> 00:39:02,187
this is the fear of missing out is used,

667
00:39:02,187 --> 00:39:03,928
like, you know, it's ending tonight.

668
00:39:03,928 --> 00:39:05,669
Or so like, you have to be there.

669
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:07,411
You have only like one more day

670
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,033
to benefit all of these awesome discounts.

671
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:16,589
loss aversion, we are very averse to loss more than we like

672
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:20,092
gains. And so anytime we feel that players are going to lose

673
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:23,916
something, we play on loss aversion. So example would be

674
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:26,038
streaks when like in Snapchat, you had the snap streaks.

675
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:30,340
And like every day you interact with a certain person,

676
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,081
it's going up and up and up.

677
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:33,962
And if one day you don't interact with that person,

678
00:39:33,962 --> 00:39:35,883
it's going all the way back down.

679
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:38,184
And this plays on loss aversion.

680
00:39:38,184 --> 00:39:40,746
So we don't want to lose all that awesome streak.

681
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:43,187
And so that's encouraging us to keep interacting

682
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:45,609
with the system even though we didn't really want

683
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:46,549
to do it that day.

684
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,591
And the last one of my examples, there's many, many more.

685
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:52,072
It's anchoring effect.

686
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:53,633
We also see that in sales.

687
00:39:53,633 --> 00:39:56,074
And when you see the original price

688
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:57,515
and you have the straight through on it

689
00:39:57,515 --> 00:40:01,597
and you see the new price, the discounted price,

690
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:06,119
we have a tendency to base our decision on an anchor.

691
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,080
We compare things.

692
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,302
And this can persuade us to buy something

693
00:40:11,302 --> 00:40:12,663
that we did not really want.

694
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:15,803
So this is all the things when Emotion trick us

695
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:18,444
and has been used in tech and in marketing

696
00:40:18,444 --> 00:40:26,506
and many situations for a long, long, long, long time.

697
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:28,666
The thing is we have to be careful

698
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:31,787
and see how it can impact negatively our players.

699
00:40:31,787 --> 00:40:34,927
When we do UX, we think about humans first

700
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:35,947
and not the business first.

701
00:40:35,947 --> 00:40:37,768
Of course, we need to make sure

702
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,668
that the game is gonna be sustainable.

703
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:44,871
But we don't want to trick players because this is not what we do.

704
00:40:44,871 --> 00:40:51,975
Here is an example of one of these emotional tricks that sometimes people use.

705
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:53,796
I'm going to use the example of Amazon because...

706
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:57,128
They're pretty infamous for that.

707
00:40:57,128 --> 00:40:59,389
So for example, like here,

708
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:01,670
they use the loss aversion,

709
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,471
like, oh, you don't want to subscribe for

710
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:05,511
Amazon Prime and therefore you're ready to,

711
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:06,872
well, they don't use the term lose,

712
00:41:06,872 --> 00:41:09,293
which is making it a bit better.

713
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:14,415
But so, oh yeah, you agree to not save some money.

714
00:41:14,415 --> 00:41:17,596
So it's also implying that you're a bit dumb.

715
00:41:17,596 --> 00:41:18,536
So it's playing on your emotions.

716
00:41:19,974 --> 00:41:22,976
So of course, we're going to have that in video games,

717
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:26,698
because again, art form is going to manipulate emotion

718
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:29,339
by definition, but we need to be careful at what

719
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:30,860
is it we're manipulating.

720
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,343
And if we're using some of these emotional tricks

721
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:40,185
not to serve gameplay or not to increase

722
00:41:40,185 --> 00:41:43,968
the experience for the players, but to increase our business

723
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,548
goals or to make players come back.

724
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:48,109
or to make them spend more.

725
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:50,570
So I'm not saying that it's an easy way

726
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,491
to define where's the line,

727
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:55,091
like the crops dying or the time at Gucci,

728
00:41:55,091 --> 00:41:58,152
it's difficult to have that experience

729
00:41:58,152 --> 00:42:04,274
of these sort of games without that last version feeling

730
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:06,415
because things are decaying if you're not here.

731
00:42:06,415 --> 00:42:08,396
So I'm not saying that it's very easy

732
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:09,676
to define where the line is,

733
00:42:09,676 --> 00:42:12,917
but we certainly need to think about it that way.

734
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:16,879
so we can understand what impact we have on our players.

735
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:20,522
Especially when we are targeting kids,

736
00:42:20,522 --> 00:42:23,824
or we know that our game is played by kids,

737
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:26,505
because kids don't have a mature.

738
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:28,906
Prefrontal cortex, I don't know if you remember

739
00:42:28,906 --> 00:42:30,787
the one of the first slides.

740
00:42:30,787 --> 00:42:33,168
I showed you the limbic system.

741
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:35,909
And it's interacting with the frontal lobe,

742
00:42:35,909 --> 00:42:37,810
and more specifically, the prefrontal cortex.

743
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,691
This is the part of the brain that

744
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:42,513
is avoiding automatic behavior.

745
00:42:42,513 --> 00:42:48,416
And sometimes, this is when we stop and think

746
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:51,778
instead of falling for the trap or falling for loss aversion.

747
00:42:52,078 --> 00:42:54,679
going to stop and think, and that's thanks to the prefrontal cortex.

748
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:59,322
The problem is the limbic system develops way faster than the prefrontal cortex,

749
00:42:59,322 --> 00:43:05,185
and the prefrontal cortex is maturing around, completely around 20...

750
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:07,344
three to 25 years old.

751
00:43:07,344 --> 00:43:10,988
So it's not to say that teenagers are completely

752
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:16,013
lost before that, but it is harder for young children

753
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:20,238
and even teenagers to resist some of these tricks.

754
00:43:20,238 --> 00:43:24,262
So we definitely need to be careful, more so than when

755
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:25,583
we're addressing adults.

756
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,018
So I'm going to leave you with that.

757
00:43:28,018 --> 00:43:32,183
If you have a game that is rated T or E,

758
00:43:32,183 --> 00:43:35,447
make sure to avoid all these tricks

759
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:37,649
and reconsider them in all the games.

760
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:41,153
So guilt tripping, loss aversion if you're missing out,

761
00:43:41,153 --> 00:43:43,555
loot box tied to monetization because it's using

762
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:45,097
conditioning, et cetera, et cetera.

763
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:49,198
So manipulate emotions ethically.

764
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:52,600
Emotions are going to be manipulated in an art form.

765
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,581
It is normal, and it's good.

766
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:57,343
We want that, but we need to consider

767
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,524
the ethics of the manipulation in our art form.

768
00:43:59,524 --> 00:44:03,907
So this is the reason why you can take a look at ethicalgames.org,

769
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,428
which is an initiative that we just kicked off.

770
00:44:06,428 --> 00:44:12,532
And we have a panel at GDC Summer on Thursday at 10 AM

771
00:44:12,532 --> 00:44:14,173
if you're interested in that topic.

772
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:19,609
All right, I talk too much, so I'm just right on time,

773
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:23,193
but I don't think we're going to have enough time for questions.

774
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:26,256
But you see here the books that I wrote,

775
00:44:26,256 --> 00:44:28,478
and you can book me on Twitter, and you'll

776
00:44:28,478 --> 00:44:30,039
find some resources on my blog.

777
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:33,002
And let me know, Emma, if we have time for maybe one

778
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:36,345
or two questions, or if I should take it offline and answer

779
00:44:36,345 --> 00:44:39,108
questions on Twitter or on chat.
