1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,111
So guys, thanks for coming out. I want to thank Tim and Mike for putting this together.

2
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:16,973
This is a lot of people. This is really great. So I know this was asked earlier, you know,

3
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:20,955
how many animators we have. How many game developer animators do we have in the room

4
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:27,097
today? And then students. And then, like, non-animators. Just, you hear, okay, great.

5
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:34,040
This is a great turnout. So I'm Jay Hossfelt. I'm the lead animator at Epic Games.

6
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:39,614
I want to talk about animation prototyping. So they, they say that you teach best what

7
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:43,617
you need to learn the most. And I've been at Epic Games for ten years, and we never

8
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:48,060
had a formal prototype process. When I first started there, the first game I worked on

9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,704
was Unreal Championship 2, and that game was heavily based on prior versions of Unreal.

10
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:57,927
And a lot of gameplay systems were kind of set in stone. There wasn't a big global game

11
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:03,031
to prototype. And as I was working on UC2, down the hall, they were starting Gears of

12
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:03,952
War. And Gears of War...

13
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,316
if you don't know, started off as actually an Unreal

14
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:09,998
kind of gameplay mode.

15
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:11,539
And that evolved over time as well.

16
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,140
So even Gears of War never started out

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,203
with this, like, official prototype phase of a game.

18
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:20,206
And then, of course, Gears of War 1 was successful.

19
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,126
We moved on to 2 and 3.

20
00:01:21,126 --> 00:01:24,169
And sequels don't really have a time

21
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,310
for a prototype phase as well.

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,113
And recently, we sold the Gears of War IP

23
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:31,134
to Microsoft Studios.

24
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,156
And Black Tusk is working on it.

25
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:36,417
And suddenly, we're going to work on a new game

26
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,638
that's not based on a prior game.

27
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:43,742
And we had to approach this from a total blank slate

28
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:44,903
and to prototype a game.

29
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:47,685
And this is something I had never done before

30
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:48,826
in such a capacity.

31
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:53,150
And before me working at Epic, I worked in games for 10 years.

32
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,854
And none of those games had a really formal prototype process.

33
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:00,275
And that's what I want to cover today.

34
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:02,717
It's kind of like my journey from discovering all that.

35
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:06,737
So.

36
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:13,259
So, to kind of give the essence of prototyping,

37
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,439
we played this game at Epic.

38
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,800
And we kind of had this company meeting,

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,060
where we all came down to play this game.

40
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,721
And it's called the Marshmallow Challenge.

41
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,821
I don't know if you guys have heard of it.

42
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:27,342
But we had to break up in groups of four.

43
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:29,802
And the challenge was to build the tallest tower

44
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:31,743
to keep the marshmallow on the top.

45
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:33,483
And we had 20 pieces of spaghetti,

46
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:34,663
some string, some tape.

47
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,680
Not much more. And we had eighteen minutes to do it.

48
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,401
So Celia, who was hosting this meeting, said go.

49
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,002
And so my group, I think it was a programmer,

50
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:46,143
a marketing guy, an animator, and someone else.

51
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:48,124
And, of course, we all turned to the programmer,

52
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:50,245
because those are the smart ones, right?

53
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:53,446
And he had a pretty good idea, and we started

54
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:55,887
getting ready to go. But the guy next to me

55
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:57,688
kind of called out a flaw he thought he saw

56
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:00,209
in that idea. So he proposed his idea.

57
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,170
And that looked good. Until the guy over here kind of

58
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,167
called out a flaw. And we listened to his idea.

59
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,029
Got to me, same thing. I'm an animator. I've

60
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:12,012
worked on complex rigs. I can design a marshmallow

61
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:14,875
tower. So I gave, I gave my example.

62
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:18,234
Well, then we heard Sylvia say,

63
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:20,095
all right, you got five minutes left.

64
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:21,976
We had been talking for 13 of those 18 minutes.

65
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:23,437
So it was like musical chairs.

66
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,639
We were on my idea, so we went with it.

67
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,160
We all just kind of divided labor.

68
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,042
I was going to make the middle part,

69
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,383
and this guy over here was going to make the supporting legs,

70
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:34,466
and this guy was cutting the tape.

71
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:36,127
And we heard Sylvia then say, 10 seconds left.

72
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:37,248
And we're just speeding along,

73
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:39,249
and we're looking around to see the other towers.

74
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,372
and she counts down. Three, two, and we stick that

75
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,133
marshmallow on top, and we look around, we had

76
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:48,155
the tallest tower. It was great. So as she's walking

77
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:51,497
over, our tower just goes, boom, and it falls.

78
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,299
This is us working on it.

79
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,781
So we lost, and these guys won. And I

80
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:59,242
don't know if you can tell from the picture,

81
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,283
but their tower is about as tall as one

82
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,425
strand of spaghetti. I mean, they spent eighteen minutes.

83
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:06,287
They could have easily just stuck three strands in

84
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:06,807
a marshmallow.

85
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:13,176
We sat down and, with Celia with these meetings,

86
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:16,538
things are never quite what they seem. So she showed

87
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:17,679
us this TED talk, and it turns out this

88
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:20,881
Marshmallow Challenge has been done all through the country.

89
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:24,523
Different schools and companies. And, so it turns out

90
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:28,046
there's one group of people, other than architects, there's

91
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:31,248
one group of people that consistently build taller towers

92
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:32,048
than all the rest of us.

93
00:04:32,048 --> 00:04:36,651
And does anyone want to guess what that group

94
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,192
is? If you know, don't tell me. But does

95
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:38,713
anyone want to guess?

96
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,582
It is. It's kindergartners.

97
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,928
So why is that? We're sitting there, we're adults,

98
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:49,033
we've all been trained in various, you know, technical things,

99
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51,778
but how come we can't beat kindergartners in this?

100
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:58,119
So it turns out, kindergartners don't do that whole posturing around a table

101
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:01,061
for 15 minutes, trying to see who's going to get the idea.

102
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,303
They go straight to building, and their tower falls.

103
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,004
And they build again, and it falls.

104
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:09,847
We only allowed ourselves one ta-da moment at the very end of the 18 minutes,

105
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:11,928
and kindergartners on average allowed five.

106
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:17,191
And I'm sure we've all, people who've worked on games have been on that game,

107
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,812
but the game's kind of not there.

108
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:20,213
And there's about a month till ship.

109
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:24,175
And you have that last ta-da moment, and hopefully you can get it playable.

110
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:31,019
So, this is the essence of prototyping. And so to give the formal definition of prototyping,

111
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:38,605
you know, it's an early sample. It's built to test a concept or a process. And it's actually

112
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:42,748
something to be learned from. Prototyping is not for the consumer down the road. It's

113
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:48,513
for the team. Steve Jobs and crew would never think to sell this prototype to the public.

114
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:53,376
To make it polished and clean is something for later. But you need that prototype process.

115
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:58,795
And I think somehow we, as adults, and we

116
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:01,257
as game developers, got off track. You know, the

117
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:03,158
kids naturally iterated. No one ever had to tell

118
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:04,379
them there's value to it.

119
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,383
And, in my experience, many of the game developers,

120
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:11,564
we, we didn't. And so how did we get

121
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:11,905
off track?

122
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,847
So I look back. I've been working on games,

123
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:17,348
like I said, for twenty years. One of the

124
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:19,030
first games I worked on was a game called

125
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,151
Genome. If you're one of the ten people that

126
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:22,112
bought it, raise your hand.

127
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:24,113
But back then.

128
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:31,230
Game developers were more generalist, and the specs were really low.

129
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:36,052
Like maybe 250 polygon characters, maybe a 256 by 256 texture map.

130
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:38,232
So we got assets done really quickly.

131
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,373
So we kind of got the rapid part of rapid prototyping down,

132
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:44,014
but we were, we were not mature developers back then.

133
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:46,855
The minute we got the first thing in the game and it worked,

134
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:47,135
we're good.

135
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:48,035
We moved on to the next.

136
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:52,356
So fast forward to Gears of War 3.

137
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:54,677
We're now mature developers.

138
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,644
AAA, you know, next-gen content takes so long to create.

139
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:03,409
And so, from that moment someone wanted to design something

140
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:05,992
and then see it implemented in game, for instance,

141
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,795
something like a boss battle, it was now 12 weeks

142
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,560
versus what would have been two weeks long ago.

143
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,250
On Gears of War, we were mature enough, if we got something in,

144
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,750
say a boss battle, and it wasn't working,

145
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,050
we were mature enough to tear down some stuff and rebuild it.

146
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,951
But at most, we got two ta-da moments.

147
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:25,011
It was a very expensive process.

148
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,972
Gears of War was not known for its great boss battles,

149
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:32,272
and that could have benefited from a more formal prototype process.

150
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:33,513
We just didn't have it.

151
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:40,294
So as game developers, you know, what is our marshmallow challenge?

152
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,834
Like, we're not just building this simple...

153
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:47,982
kind of objective goal thing like the tower.

154
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:53,045
Games are really complex things, and they have a lot of complex systems that work together.

155
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:58,048
You know, you're going to get a much larger team than four guys around a table, and they're

156
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:01,090
made for an audience. The audience is ultimately what judges your

157
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,913
success. And then games require a creative process.

158
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:09,115
So how do you quantify a creative process?

159
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,220
So I just want to let you guys know, to talk about prototyping, I kind of want to give

160
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,140
the whole context of what prototyping happens in.

161
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,801
So I'm going to zoom really far out and talk about some things that we probably just all

162
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:22,661
take for granted.

163
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:26,002
And that is, what is a creative process?

164
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:28,763
Can we parse that down to something describable?

165
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:30,283
What is a game?

166
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:35,384
We all work on games, but what makes a game different than something else like cooking

167
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:37,204
dinner or riding a bike?

168
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:39,705
And then what is our role as animators?

169
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,050
in this whole thing.

170
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:47,115
So the creative process, I don't know if you guys have read this book by Scott McCloud,

171
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:50,138
but he had this one chapter on the creative process that I thought was really fitting

172
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,700
for this.

173
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,742
And it goes something like this.

174
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,528
The idea of purpose, and that kind of comes from just that initial inspiration.

175
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:03,050
It comes, actually, it comes from part of the brain that doesn't even process language.

176
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,552
It's that initial inspiration impulse.

177
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:09,553
But you do want to get that out to the world in a form of something.

178
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:12,335
So as a creative, you're going to figure out the form.

179
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:16,717
Then the idiom, that's kind of like a more narrowly defined version of that form.

180
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:17,817
That's kind of like the genre.

181
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,899
You know, so if you're making a movie, it's going to be a horror movie.

182
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:21,619
It's kind of like a...

183
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,192
the genre. And then past that you have the structure, and that's all the components

184
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:31,553
and how they work together to achieve the form that you're creating. And then you have

185
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:36,234
the craft. And that's why a lot of us are here today as animators, is to learn how to

186
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:40,035
better our craft. And this is where we put a lot of the blood, sweat, and tears into

187
00:09:40,035 --> 00:09:44,855
what we do. And then you have the surface, and this is what the audience sees. You know,

188
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:47,556
they don't see all the stuff that happened prior to the surface, they just see that on

189
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:51,637
the shelf. And this is like a good way to kind of parse the creative process.

190
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:02,426
And oddly enough, all of us in here, we kind of, we master this creative process backwards.

191
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:08,111
We all started out on the other side of surface. We started out as a consumer, seeing the surface

192
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:13,037
of someone else's creative process, but something in us made us want to peek behind a curtain.

193
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:17,822
Maybe it was like a making of, or an article you read, but somehow you got to the side

194
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:18,302
of craft.

195
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:25,557
And that's what brought us here today.

196
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,738
So I'll put this in context of making a game.

197
00:10:27,738 --> 00:10:31,920
So I'm going to use Cliff Bleszinski, the maker of Gears of War,

198
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,921
and run through this, like how it may, maybe it went like this.

199
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:35,722
I don't know for sure.

200
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,842
But let's say Cliff and his brother, they're sitting there,

201
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:41,024
they're talking about when they were kids, and they'd go out to,

202
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:43,825
you know, out to play and explore.

203
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:47,607
And Cliff wanted to make a game that kind of encompassed that,

204
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:53,169
that initial motivation, the, the inspiration to make something.

205
00:10:55,595 --> 00:11:00,919
and they're remembering that, and he's going to put it into a form.

206
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,161
And of course that's going to be the video game.

207
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,783
He's not going to make a board game, he's not going to make a movie, he's going to make

208
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:06,224
a video game.

209
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:13,410
And then to create this, the EDM, it's going to be a 360 game, it's third person.

210
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,332
He wants multiplayer and co-op, so he and his brother can play.

211
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,977
And then you get to the actual game itself.

212
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,977
And a game is its structure.

213
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:26,438
That's all the components within it.

214
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:29,839
And so for Gears, some of the systems were like running,

215
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,900
shooting mechanics, cover, all just the little systems

216
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,881
you need for your game to actually be the game.

217
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:38,284
And then of course it's a craft.

218
00:11:38,284 --> 00:11:41,105
This is the very slow part of any creative process

219
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:44,626
because this takes like the heavy lifting work right here.

220
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:47,547
And then of course the surface.

221
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:49,168
So Gears of War is released.

222
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:49,768
It's the final product.

223
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:50,848
It's on the store shelves.

224
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:51,868
Everyone's seeing it.

225
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:54,349
So did Cliff's initial inspiration survive

226
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:56,690
all the way through to what the audience got?

227
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,071
It's kind of like the skin of an apple.

228
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:02,231
You know, the shininess is there,

229
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:03,252
but the consumer's gonna take it

230
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:05,092
and they're gonna bite into that apple.

231
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:07,447
And are they gonna be pleased with it?

232
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:11,249
And a lot of games have that beautiful, shiny marketing

233
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:14,172
touch. They have beautiful craftspeople. The craft in the game

234
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:17,714
is really good. Great renderer. Great models. But then,

235
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:19,856
you play the game for a couple hours, and

236
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:23,338
you're just not into it. And there's a bargain bin

237
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:23,979
full of these.

238
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:24,259
And so, how do we.

239
00:12:28,946 --> 00:12:30,567
how do we avoid that? Like, how do we

240
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:33,088
get, you know, we, we put so much effort

241
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:34,929
into the craft. How, how can we make sure

242
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,510
the games we're working on aren't gonna get to

243
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,670
that bargain bin?

244
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,472
So let's go back to structure. This is where,

245
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:45,754
this is where you could ultimately fix it. Because

246
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:48,655
I think this is where it breaks, breaks down.

247
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:53,625
And so, we do take this for granted, working on games.

248
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,466
But what is a game?

249
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:57,127
What is, what is like a core structure of a game

250
00:12:57,127 --> 00:13:00,129
that sets it apart from any other kind of activity we do?

251
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:03,431
And it goes something like, like this.

252
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,991
I got this from Stone Labrandi,

253
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:08,734
a guy who works on, a designer at EA.

254
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,775
So all games start with a starting point.

255
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:14,657
And they have a goal.

256
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:17,278
And then there's opposition to that goal.

257
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:23,684
but you allow the player decisions and tools to get around that goal.

258
00:13:23,684 --> 00:13:28,127
And all of this is encompassed within the boundary of rules,

259
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:31,769
and then how the player interacts with the whole thing.

260
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,531
And each of these components is something to be dialed with,

261
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:36,552
depending on what kind of game you want.

262
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:40,515
You're gonna tweak the decisions, the opposition, and all that.

263
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:44,177
So just show some other examples.

264
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:46,459
We all know this one.

265
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,100
Starting point, goal.

266
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,781
opposition, tools and decisions, and the rules of

267
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:56,882
the game. And it's not just video games. You

268
00:13:56,882 --> 00:14:04,123
got your kickoff, your goal, your opposition, your decisions,

269
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:06,744
and your rules. So once you kind of, like,

270
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:10,205
have the game down, down to that, you, you

271
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:12,525
kind of know where, what you're looking for when

272
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:15,306
discussing the vernacular of a game.

273
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:17,266
So where do animators come into this scenario?

274
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,939
So I'm zooming back in now to animation.

275
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:27,524
And like film animators, film animators serve the purpose of telling the director's story,

276
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:29,245
to help communicate the story.

277
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:32,568
That's what you guys are for video games.

278
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:33,829
You're communicating the game.

279
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:37,532
You're communicating, I hit a button.

280
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:38,433
Did the character react?

281
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:40,095
You're communicating if that was successful.

282
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:44,479
You're communicating if you broke the rules somehow, or if you were successful with the

283
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,859
decision.

284
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:51,283
And it's what we do. And we share this task with audio effects, UI.

285
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:56,729
There's many ways we communicate to the player about the state of the game.

286
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,613
And the game designers kind of orchestrate this like an orchestra.

287
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:04,858
Like sometimes animators have their solo as the key communicator of the game.

288
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:06,760
Sometimes we all share in it.

289
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:13,950
And this point was brought clear to me.

290
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,912
So we're starting prototyping on a game,

291
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:17,634
and the designers told me, like,

292
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:18,835
don't worry, we don't need animation,

293
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:19,756
we don't need anything.

294
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,978
We're just gonna use rectangular cubes,

295
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:23,400
you know, in place of characters.

296
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,343
And so they had these cubes running around,

297
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,625
changing speeds and direction,

298
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,987
and hitting backwards if you hit them.

299
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:33,436
But it didn't communicate.

300
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:34,417
They finally came and said,

301
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,939
look, we need something more than this.

302
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:39,682
This is just too raw, too, like, we cannot tell.

303
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:42,505
And we put in bipeds, and suddenly the communication

304
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:44,026
of the state of the game was instantaneous.

305
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:48,891
And this kind of really solidified that role

306
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,352
for us animators, what we do.

307
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:53,034
And of course, this is where we...

308
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:58,177
So this, when I'm talking about prototyping for games, I'm not talking about craft.

309
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:01,679
You know, sometimes in craft we do a bunch of stub animations to kind of get the designers

310
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,641
off our backs so we can spend more time polishing the animation.

311
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:07,322
All that is a part of prototyping.

312
00:16:07,322 --> 00:16:15,667
This is kind of the, think of the structure side versus the craft side of prototyping.

313
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:19,410
So if you're on a project like mine where it's day one, it's not a sequel.

314
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,171
You don't have a ton of resources to draw from.

315
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,100
What does day one look like?

316
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,121
And this is, you know, you've got your designers with their gameplay pillars.

317
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:32,542
You probably have some tech in place already, and they're doing gray box levels.

318
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,103
And the team's just ramping up.

319
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:36,624
The art team has nothing.

320
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:38,304
There's no models yet.

321
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:40,045
At best, they're scribbling some concept.

322
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:42,105
But we don't have much.

323
00:16:42,105 --> 00:16:45,927
So as animators, how could we help designers instantly?

324
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:47,807
And so that was our challenge.

325
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,288
So we wanted to make a pipeline.

326
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:57,915
for prototyping that was still useful once we got to production, but it allowed us with,

327
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:02,638
it allowed us some tools. And so our goals were to make fast prototype assets, like make

328
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:07,500
it fast but not ugly. I mean, if people are going to be looking at a prototype game for

329
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,403
a while, you don't want any distractions and ugly temp art really just grinds on you day

330
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:12,823
after day.

331
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:19,886
And in a prototype phase, since you are working on the game with those components,

332
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:22,306
communication is all you're dealing with.

333
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:26,247
You're not dealing with showing how great of an animator you are at this point.

334
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:30,928
You want to just communicate the actual ideas being done.

335
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:33,808
You're not going to noodle on just fine polished animation.

336
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:36,109
And then there's no rules.

337
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:40,230
There's no shame in reusing and retargeting run cycles over and over and over.

338
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,710
So these were our goals here, a little bit of our goals.

339
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,190
And.

340
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:50,276
So we made this content creation tool for Maya.

341
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:52,458
It's called the AutoRigger.

342
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:57,484
And what it does is it creates a fast prototype of the character.

343
00:17:57,484 --> 00:18:02,789
Let me get this playing here.

344
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:07,034
So what this does is it allows us to create a biped really quickly.

345
00:18:08,606 --> 00:18:13,629
We can scale various portions, and it's done quite quickly.

346
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:17,311
Then we can just snap it to an autorig that gives us all the controls,

347
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:19,972
with IK, FK switching, spline IK.

348
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:23,834
We could load animations onto it, load mocap, export, whatever we need to do.

349
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:25,635
But the key is to do it fast.

350
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:29,217
This character here, I think in the end, took about 45 minutes

351
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:31,978
before we could have it imported into the editor.

352
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,259
And in addition to that...

353
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,013
We also have this real simple texture for it, where we can go into Photoshop and just

354
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:46,215
paint bucket in the various points.

355
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:50,239
Because in the game, sometimes you want to communicate who the enemies are, who the team

356
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,682
members are, maybe what buffs would look like, or anything else.

357
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,683
And so we have just a quick color scheme.

358
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:04,821
And then, so, we have this guy, and what we do is we sit in a room with the designer,

359
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:08,083
and we're asking him, like, what's your idea for this game?

360
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,986
And as he's talking, he's describing the verbs.

361
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:15,390
And so as an animator, you're going to sit there and you're just pulling out the verbs

362
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,132
from his game design, what he's talking about.

363
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:21,294
The idols, let's say the guy's going to punch, and he jumps,

364
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,197
and when you shoot him, he falls backwards.

365
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,559
All these things are verbs to be communicated.

366
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,721
But it's not just communicating verbs.

367
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:34,212
that you gotta think about who you're communicating to.

368
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:37,175
So sometimes some of the animations on your player

369
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,317
is for the player himself, the guy with the controller.

370
00:19:39,317 --> 00:19:41,619
But sometimes the verbs are for the opponent.

371
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:45,843
So you gotta keep in mind who these verbs are meant for.

372
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:48,907
With Gears of War, we noticed that a lot of times,

373
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:50,989
we were spending a lot of time polishing animations,

374
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,190
but no one was watching Marcus.

375
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,831
They were watching the reticle on the screen.

376
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:58,319
So then we put more effort into the animations

377
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,180
that we knew people were looking at.

378
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,682
And that was oftentimes the, times the opponents.

379
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:06,503
And it is said that with video games,

380
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:09,265
you have to make the animations look good from all angles.

381
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:10,105
And that's very true.

382
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,595
When we get down to it, there are a couple of primary angles you're going to see of the character in the game.

383
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:20,280
And just knowing who you're communicating to in the game, whether it's the opponent or player,

384
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,585
that gives you a sense of, does that pose need to look good from the front, the back?

385
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:26,407
You know, what's the camera angle in the game?

386
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:34,700
And then we have, we're developing Unreal Engine 4 right now, and we have a really strong

387
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,421
focus on animation tools that are animator-friendly. We kind of got tired of, in the past, creating

388
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:45,062
just this big list of animations to kind of throw over a fence to programmers to get in.

389
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:53,903
And so we have these, these tools called blueprints that, basically we could take the variables

390
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:58,084
that the game has, like say speed, height, you know, running.

391
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:02,465
And animators can go in and plug anything they want into these variables.

392
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:07,149
So let's say the pawn is what we call it.

393
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:09,231
The pawn is running forward at 200 units.

394
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,353
We know we can trigger the run cycle.

395
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,616
And so we have things like the state machines.

396
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:23,387
But the emphasis here is that it allows animators just to drag and drop the stuff they need,

397
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:25,169
and we work with the rule set at first.

398
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:27,510
And of course that's with the input of the designer.

399
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,613
But that allows us to mock everything up.

400
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:35,096
So within two days, easily, we've created a character

401
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:37,978
that's pretty much decoupled from the art department.

402
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:43,182
We've created a character, rigged it, put in rough poses, animations,

403
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:45,744
brought it into the editor, and we've given it its basic.

404
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,944
run cycles, basic behavior, and we pass that off to the designer

405
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:53,346
so he can start prototyping and iterating.

406
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:57,650
And it ended up being like super lightning fast.

407
00:22:00,605 --> 00:22:03,846
So sadly, I can't show you guys the game I'm working on right now.

408
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:05,686
We're in the prototype phase.

409
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:07,527
But just to kind of give another example,

410
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:11,168
this is that same prototype character I did earlier.

411
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:14,529
And another one of our tools is just the simple aim offset

412
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:16,449
that's added of layering.

413
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:19,630
And we made it very simple for animators

414
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,991
to just go in and drag and drop this stuff in.

415
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:24,431
And so we have things like blend spaces.

416
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:25,932
So depending on the angle and running,

417
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:27,572
we can then trigger other animations.

418
00:22:27,572 --> 00:22:28,832
And all these tools have really.

419
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:38,313
put a lot of power, I guess, into the animators' hands, but it's also made us, like, it's definitely

420
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:43,815
made us put a foot into the design aspect of developing a game.

421
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:52,760
And so as we do this, we, you know, like I said, within, let's just call it a week, within

422
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,342
a few days, we now have this thing in, we're ready to play test, you know, what the designers

423
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,082
want to prototype.

424
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:05,976
And we found that when we first were testing,

425
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:09,038
you know, these, these mini-games we were prototyping,

426
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,500
we found that if something wasn't fun, we would

427
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,081
go back to our desk. We had a list

428
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,982
of, you know, sometimes a dozen things. And we'd

429
00:23:15,982 --> 00:23:18,303
all just go back and tweak things. And then

430
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:20,725
the next day, the game might be fun, but

431
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:22,386
we didn't know what the magic thing was that

432
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:24,707
we changed to do it. So we kind of

433
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:27,429
had to limit ourselves to only picking one to

434
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:29,410
two variables between playtests.

435
00:23:30,548 --> 00:23:33,389
Otherwise, we're just kind of spinning our wheels in place.

436
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:39,931
And then as animators, everything we had in there, we had to ask ourselves, is it communicating?

437
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:44,032
You know, do people feel like, if they're getting shot, do they feel like they're getting

438
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:44,612
hit reactions?

439
00:23:44,612 --> 00:23:48,013
Or if they're getting punched, do they see the anticipation?

440
00:23:48,013 --> 00:23:52,874
So a lot of the times, animators sitting there, just making sure, like, we are communicating.

441
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:58,118
And sometimes, depending on the game, like how far the camera is from something, sometimes

442
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:02,981
the animator, no matter how strong he makes his pose, he's going to need help from an

443
00:24:02,981 --> 00:24:08,844
effects guy, you know, to kind of put some kind of maybe effects emphasis on something.

444
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:13,987
So this is where we play each day and we kind of just get to the point of where we're communicating

445
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:16,008
the game to the best of our abilities.

446
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:21,351
So we know that if the game feels fun or not fun,

447
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:26,416
it's the game itself and not because we're lacking in communication.

448
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,118
And of course we test for responsiveness.

449
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:30,020
And of course when playtesting, nothing is sacred.

450
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,123
You've got to be in the mindset that everything and anything

451
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:38,188
can be thrown away at any time for something better.

452
00:24:38,188 --> 00:24:41,211
So we're prototyping this stuff.

453
00:24:42,237 --> 00:24:44,517
for weeks on end, and then suddenly we start hearing

454
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:45,397
from the art department.

455
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:46,698
They actually are making great things.

456
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:50,598
Well, from my earlier slide, the art department,

457
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:53,419
it's very slow to create next-gen art assets.

458
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,480
So we had to ask ourselves, like, how do we roll this in

459
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,900
to this prototype phase?

460
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,701
You know, if we now have to wait four or five weeks,

461
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,961
maybe six weeks to get a model in,

462
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,262
do we hold off on prototyping certain aspects?

463
00:25:06,262 --> 00:25:09,082
And so that was one of the first questions we asked.

464
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:11,263
And the other one was, how do we just roll

465
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,962
some of the artists into that mindset of prototyping.

466
00:25:14,962 --> 00:25:24,390
And so we sat down with the art team, and we kind of showed them our prototypes, and

467
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,692
we said, look, here's what we're thinking.

468
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,934
And some magic happened, like, the first day.

469
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:33,638
The concept guy played the prototype, and suddenly he got the essence of what he was

470
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:34,919
going to be designing.

471
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:40,399
you know, we're testing the pure function of the game, not the form at all.

472
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:47,042
Just the function. But by him knowing the function, it definitely informed him of the form.

473
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:52,045
But like any artist, they're not going to just coldly, cold-calculated stick to just the form.

474
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:54,166
They're going to add in...

475
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:57,543
you know, what they're paid to do, these concept guys.

476
00:25:57,543 --> 00:26:00,625
And so what we also found was we would get that concept back,

477
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:04,207
and then suddenly the designers are seeing things in the concept work

478
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:05,849
that they never even thought of.

479
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:08,370
So we kind of got this cool feedback loop

480
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,693
between concept art and game designers,

481
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:15,435
where they were kind of bettering each other by going back and forth.

482
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:25,162
So we got the concept art down. It's feeling really good putting that into our prototype process.

483
00:26:25,162 --> 00:26:26,502
But models still take forever.

484
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:31,943
The guys, they model it out, they ZBrush it, they make all the normal maps.

485
00:26:31,943 --> 00:26:35,304
And so we asked them, like, is there a point, guys, where

486
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:38,644
we can get something quicker from you so we can try it out?

487
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:40,505
Because we've all had that...

488
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:45,346
At least in my experience, we've gotten models before that totally broke the gameplay mechanic.

489
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:46,446
Where the model itself...

490
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:50,010
did not lend itself to the gameplay it needed to be.

491
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,713
So if we could find out how, if we could solve that problem earlier, it'd be fantastic.

492
00:26:53,713 --> 00:27:00,938
So the modelers said, yeah, sure, we can mock up the broad stroke shapes of our models early

493
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:05,521
and hand them to you, and we'd put those on our autorigger that we used for the earlier

494
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:06,222
mission demands.

495
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:06,822
Same tool.

496
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:15,557
we would get that model in game. And the questions we ask are, you know, does the silhouette

497
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:22,059
of this new model lend itself to the communication it needs to do? All the, if the guy has to

498
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:27,980
run and jump and stretch and grab, reach over his head, can the model support that? And

499
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,541
so we were able to get this, like, feedback back to the modeler so they can make changes

500
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:35,883
very, very quickly. And when we rigged this, we...

501
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:40,140
We weren't caring about skin weighting. We weren't even caring about textures at this point.

502
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,241
Just the broad stroke stuff.

503
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:48,926
But we had that model, and the animators were kind of panicked for a little bit.

504
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:51,608
We were like, do we make a whole new round of stub animations?

505
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:54,510
Because we just made some for this Michelin man.

506
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,112
But not everything is going to totally apply to the new model.

507
00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:04,457
And so we said, no, there's no way. We can just do two rounds of just redoing all these animations.

508
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:04,757
So...

509
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:08,152
We have a pretty easy retargeting tool in UE4.

510
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:11,494
We would just click, and within minutes, all the animations

511
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:12,754
would come over.

512
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:14,915
And so that kept the play test going.

513
00:28:14,915 --> 00:28:18,637
They didn't have to wait for a new model update.

514
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:20,619
But we knew that model was going to totally break.

515
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:22,279
And we're not going to look at the silhouettes of those

516
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,162
animations and make sure they work.

517
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,763
So what we'd do is all those verbs we had and the key

518
00:28:28,763 --> 00:28:31,625
poses, we would just make a character sheet with this new

519
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,586
model and make sure that his silhouette reads from those

520
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,507
key things you're communicating, those key moves.

521
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:42,572
like his runs, or if he's jumping up in the air, his anticipation poses.

522
00:28:42,572 --> 00:28:51,702
And then what was great with this is all the departments, we were all kind of in sync with

523
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:58,610
what all these assets are created for. In the past, with Even Gears, it was just this

524
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:04,898
concept would kind of go over a fence to modeling, that would be passed over a fence to animation.

525
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:09,143
And you could honestly never say we were all in sync with each other.

526
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:13,129
But now we all know, like, the why and the purpose of the game.

527
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:26,618
And so, like, I briefly ran through, like, the prototyping of design and the prototyping

528
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:31,520
of art, the rapid prototyping. But that's really half of it. Half of, the other half

529
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,222
of animation is just the technical aspects of it. And you do not want to, like, halfway

530
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:44,765
through production find out that something you're relying on is broken. So if art.

531
00:29:45,637 --> 00:29:48,179
designed everything to have cloth, and you find out halfway

532
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,821
through production that cloth will not work, you can't have

533
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:53,224
it, that's just a huge pain. So what we do

534
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:56,527
is, we're also prototyping this along with everything else.

535
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:59,770
And right here I showed our character with a

536
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,451
trench coat on. But actually what we did, we

537
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:03,613
didn't even have a trench coat model. We just

538
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:06,076
threw on a cape, threw on some Apex cloth,

539
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:08,398
just to make sure it worked.

540
00:30:09,515 --> 00:30:13,599
And we tested other things, too, like how many characters can you have on screen, your

541
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,280
bone counts.

542
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,464
And we did all this kind of still decoupled from production art.

543
00:30:18,464 --> 00:30:24,150
And it doesn't predict everything, but it lets you get a better idea early on.

544
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,010
But there is a harsh reality to this.

545
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,933
So Epic, we're self-funded, so we don't have to worry about

546
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:40,595
the nervous publisher saying, show me something pretty or

547
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:42,536
we're not going to green light your game.

548
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:44,177
And that's a true reality.

549
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:47,020
I know we've all done stub animations, and to us it's

550
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,461
clear they're temp animations.

551
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:52,704
But someone inevitably comes up and says, hey man, are you

552
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:57,127
going to redo that animation at some point?

553
00:30:57,127 --> 00:30:59,389
And so there's always this communication of prototyping.

554
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:02,203
And so, you don't want to give up prototyping

555
00:31:02,203 --> 00:31:05,646
to, you know, please those that don't have the imagination

556
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:10,911
to see what game you're making. So don't skip prototyping.

557
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:14,454
But, since you do have the art direct, the art team,

558
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:16,756
make it, make that a part of prototyping. Make them

559
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:18,857
make all the visual assets to kind of fill in

560
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:22,801
the blanks for people. I don't have, like I said,

561
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:24,262
I'm in a situation where we're not dealing with

562
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:27,525
publishers. I don't have the end-all, be-all answer to that.

563
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,395
I think if you make a visual prototype on the art side, that's going to help.

564
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:36,237
That way you can have kind of your gray box prototype level going, and so the developers

565
00:31:36,237 --> 00:31:40,159
can still learn and fail quickly what they need to.

566
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:48,862
And I've said this earlier, is you want to make the temp art appealing, and you just

567
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:52,224
don't want to grab a bunch of just assets from here and there where nothing feels like

568
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:54,225
it's part of the same thing.

569
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,740
because you're going to be looking, in prototyping, you don't want any distractions. You just

570
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:07,642
want to get to the core of, of the game.

571
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:12,323
And so when it comes down to communication of prototyping, you know, the film industry,

572
00:32:12,323 --> 00:32:19,064
they got this figured out. You can show a storyboard to someone, and they know what

573
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,445
you're getting at. They know that.

574
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:26,273
that you're prototyping the structure of your piece through the storyboard.

575
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:29,214
And so we had to make this little demo for GDC last year.

576
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:32,895
And we had a very short amount of time to do it.

577
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:34,576
And we had to kind of limit our risk.

578
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:39,757
So yeah, we just kind of scratched on Post-it notes

579
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:43,218
to kind of find where our problem areas are.

580
00:32:43,218 --> 00:32:48,020
So this was totally acceptable, and people didn't panic on this.

581
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,541
But I feel like with games, we haven't quite got to that point

582
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:50,981
where.

583
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:56,259
people are fine with seeing a prototype type thing. So I think part of it is the more we

584
00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:01,482
do this as an industry, the more it'll be an acceptable form of prototyping.

585
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:08,505
Like, case in point, no one's going to walk up to you and say, hey man, is this final

586
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:16,169
guy going to have a scribble on his face? But we do get those kinds of questions with

587
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:17,029
game prototyping.

588
00:33:21,213 --> 00:33:23,794
realities to the team dynamics of our prototyping team is

589
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:27,916
we've all spent so much time honing our craft

590
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:31,997
that it's hard to jump on a project where you're asked to

591
00:33:31,997 --> 00:33:34,638
make stuff very quickly and throw it away.

592
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:39,060
And it takes a certain type of tinkerer.

593
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,460
You do not want to keep, you don't want the team's large.

594
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,421
You kind of want to keep it small, so it kind of keeps the

595
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,542
communication loop tight.

596
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,443
But you also don't have too many cooks in the kitchen.

597
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:54,383
And since it's rapid prototyping, it actually doesn't take a large team to create a ton

598
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:55,163
of assets for it.

599
00:33:55,163 --> 00:34:01,506
And like I said earlier, use generalists who are excited by tinkering and who do a little

600
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:05,748
bit more beyond their specialty.

601
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:17,027
With us, there's definitely a personality type for it. We had some people on the prototype team that just begged to get off of it later,

602
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:20,428
because they just wanted to get back to the craft part.

603
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:24,689
But there's other people that just love that tinkering and trial and error.

604
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:30,710
So I think when building a prototype team, it's important to find the right people for it.

605
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,331
And then what's to be gained?

606
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:37,912
We were able to fail fast, fail often.

607
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:41,233
But there's other things to be gained for the project going forward.

608
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:47,260
And that is, you have all your systems, at least a good idea of your systems in place.

609
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,741
You know that you're not going to get some kind of feature creep later on in the game.

610
00:34:50,741 --> 00:34:55,323
And so you kind of have some of your production costs and needs.

611
00:34:55,323 --> 00:34:59,064
You kind of know what your animation budget's going to be in the future

612
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,105
without ever having to jump into it head first.

613
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:06,186
And then, of course, during prototype, we don't have everything we need.

614
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:10,088
And the prototype period's relatively short, so we don't have...

615
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,893
time to build new engine features. So the things we do need, we can inform the engine

616
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:22,238
team of what they need to add going forward when we go into production.

617
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:27,501
And if you don't have an engine team, there's some, there's middleware, other software to

618
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:31,564
help you out. And then also, back to that communication thing,

619
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:36,647
we found that kind of based on how you're communicating the game.

620
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:41,631
kind of is going to define your style. So with animation, if the game's depending more

621
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:47,614
on animation to communicate, you're going to need a style that is going to allow you

622
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:53,797
to show more stronger poses. Like a subtle mocap style might not be able to communicate

623
00:35:53,797 --> 00:35:58,640
everything. You just need to kind of choose your style guide, maybe inform the style guide

624
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,161
a little bit more based on what needs to be communicated.

625
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,301
Do you have enough information to jump into production?

626
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:11,482
And you're never going to know everything before going into production.

627
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:17,464
There's always a plethora of unknowns, but if you can just cut down a lot of it during

628
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:20,685
prototype it helps out a lot.

629
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:27,667
And then, so with Gears 1 we had, say, a ton of stretch goals.

630
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,788
A prototype team's going to have a lot of stretch goals.

631
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,401
And if you get them in great. If you don't,

632
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:36,162
then if you do work on a sequel, it's going to be easy.

633
00:36:36,162 --> 00:36:38,943
You're going to have so many, like, you're already going to have these systems

634
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:42,245
you are totally motivated to go after.

635
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:46,486
And so Gears of War 2, that was nothing but Gears of War stretch goals

636
00:36:46,486 --> 00:36:48,327
that we weren't able to get to with Gears of War 1.

637
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:49,667
And then as an animation director,

638
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,408
being on the MoCap floor...

639
00:36:58,658 --> 00:37:02,102
and directing the actors, I kind of knew what the communication was for.

640
00:37:02,102 --> 00:37:06,205
So rather than just being on the floor and watching their movement from all angles, I

641
00:37:06,205 --> 00:37:09,869
know the gist of what they have to communicate strongly.

642
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:15,173
And just knowing the structure of that, what they have to communicate, just allows me to

643
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:20,638
give much more focused feedback to the actor.

644
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:28,974
And then even to the guys on my team, when I first became an animation lead, I tended to direct them on the craft.

645
00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:33,856
The twelve principles of animation and the craft and that stuff.

646
00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:40,459
But when you're solidly aware of the structure of the game and what you need to communicate,

647
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:46,141
you're going to give more applicable feedback to them.

648
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:49,063
And so they can make decisions that are...

649
00:37:51,653 --> 00:37:55,577
that are not just aesthetic, but more functional for the game.

650
00:37:55,577 --> 00:38:02,562
And then, so, asset creation was less like the telephone game,

651
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:04,224
and so it's more like we're in a room together

652
00:38:04,224 --> 00:38:07,066
between all disciplines. So, the modeler leads,

653
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,408
the modeling leads, the texture leads, the effects leads,

654
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,009
we all just kind of were on the same page,

655
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:15,653
versus using that old, old system of throwing assets over a fence.

656
00:38:15,653 --> 00:38:15,753
And so...

657
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:28,610
Like I said earlier with this, with the creation, or with the creative process, we all started

658
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:34,132
off, and for some reason many of us here decided to peek between the curtain, between surface

659
00:38:34,132 --> 00:38:38,214
and craft, and we stayed in craft for a long time.

660
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:44,016
And I was thinking about films, and I know several animators who went on from the craft

661
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:47,238
of animating to become a cinematic director.

662
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:53,502
We got film directors like Disney, Tim Burton, Lasseter, and Brad Bird,

663
00:38:53,502 --> 00:38:58,508
who they all started off as animators, but they ended up as directors.

664
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:00,311
But I thought about with games,

665
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:03,655
I don't know of very many examples of the animator

666
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:06,218
kind of going to the path of a designer.

667
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:12,139
And the reason is, I think old tool sets and old team structures

668
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:17,081
didn't allow for the animators really to peek into the structure of the game as much.

669
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:22,343
We kind of were just making animation lists and passing it on for someone else to plug in.

670
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:25,264
And so with this prototype process, even on our team,

671
00:39:25,264 --> 00:39:28,326
I noticed that animators were suddenly being more aware.

672
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:29,306
They're more aware of the...

673
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,854
what they need to communicate in the game.

674
00:39:32,854 --> 00:39:35,996
And case in point, one of our animators

675
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:38,557
just graduated on to the design team.

676
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:43,381
Because of this, he found that he liked the structure part,

677
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,302
the designing part, but he got to transition there

678
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:49,925
via animation, which was a first for me to see

679
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:52,706
in the industry, or any companies I've worked at.

680
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:58,289
And someone like me, I like craft. I want to stay, I want to be that animator.

681
00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:04,312
But I know having one foot, knowing the structure of the game I'm working on, just allows me

682
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:06,933
to ultimately be a better craftsperson at animation.

683
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:13,275
And so we're back to our roots. You know, back several years ago, it took two weeks.

684
00:40:13,275 --> 00:40:20,478
With this prototype process, we're back down to one week.

685
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:29,538
And, and, but we had the maturity we had.

686
00:40:29,538 --> 00:40:31,299
You know, we know when we need to go

687
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:32,599
back and keep improving something.

688
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:37,162
And then, so, let's get back to Surface.

689
00:40:37,162 --> 00:40:38,002
It's the final ta-da.

690
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:38,843
Your game's out.

691
00:40:38,843 --> 00:40:45,306
There's no guarantee that your game's gonna completely succeed,

692
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:51,650
but you have allowed your team many more times to fail and try again.

693
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:57,743
And with a good prototype system in place, you've allowed that,

694
00:40:57,743 --> 00:41:03,586
and you've allowed yourself to kind of get back to that thing we kind of always knew

695
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:07,748
as kids. And it kind of ultimately allows you to be

696
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:12,070
far more creative, because you get to do it at a faster pace.

697
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,412
So that kind of summarizes the prototype, prototyping for games.

698
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:19,514
So if you guys have questions, feel free. And thank you.

699
00:41:34,312 --> 00:41:35,793
And I want to thank these guys for the reference.

700
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:35,873
Yes?

701
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:41,358
So you were talking about having an auto-register

702
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:51,948
and having a bunch of middleware tools to kind of get you started.

703
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:52,048
Mm-hmm.

704
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:15,286
Yeah, so the question was, are there tools out there for a smaller team?

705
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:19,753
to use if they don't have their own tools, programmers, or a TD to set up the system.

706
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:26,336
I believe there are. I mean, I know Mixamo offers anim sets for people to jump off with.

707
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:34,259
I know our tool we use for Maya, we based a lot of those features off the, is it biped

708
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:37,600
for Macs? You know, a lot of that. So a lot of it's there. If you don't mind it being

709
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,581
very gray box looking, I'm sure there are a lot of options out there.

710
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:03,071
Yeah, so, in this prototype process, actually being in Maya was the fastest part, because

711
00:43:03,071 --> 00:43:08,113
really we're just getting the assets out as quickly as possible, so we found ourselves

712
00:43:08,113 --> 00:43:13,555
in the editor more, just kind of setting up the rule set and the flow of, kind of like

713
00:43:13,555 --> 00:43:15,715
the logic between all the animations and how they...

714
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:17,727
blend into one another.

715
00:43:17,727 --> 00:43:17,807
Yes?

716
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:25,911
You mentioned before that you needed people on the prototyping team that were good with

717
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:29,273
trial and error and everything.

718
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:35,557
When you started working, doing that type of thing and going back to the design and

719
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:43,601
finding that it was the same way, and sometimes the design mindset is that I need to create

720
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:44,422
this.

721
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:59,207
And going back and working with the design of the content,

722
00:43:59,207 --> 00:44:00,508
is that an issue?

723
00:44:00,508 --> 00:44:03,130
Because it's the right type of person to work with?

724
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:03,290
Yes.

725
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,391
I mean, that's one thing I probably left off is you,

726
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:09,134
well, first of all, you have to have just good communicators

727
00:44:09,134 --> 00:44:09,414
on your team.

728
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:10,975
One thing we did to make sure that happened

729
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:13,177
is we would sit in close proximity with the designers.

730
00:44:13,177 --> 00:44:14,698
And we kind of had an animator and designer kind of pair up.

731
00:44:14,698 --> 00:44:16,259
And after like.

732
00:44:16,471 --> 00:44:19,274
the first couple iterations, they kind of learned how to communicate with each other

733
00:44:19,274 --> 00:44:20,275
and work together.

734
00:44:20,275 --> 00:44:21,317
So did that answer your question?

735
00:44:21,317 --> 00:44:21,457
Yeah.

736
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:22,858
Did it take time in order for that to happen?

737
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:23,219
Because of...

738
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:23,319
Yeah.

739
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:23,399
Yeah.

740
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:23,499
Yeah.

741
00:44:23,499 --> 00:44:23,659
Yeah.

742
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:23,800
Yeah.

743
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:23,900
Yeah.

744
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,020
Yeah.

745
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,100
Yeah.

746
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,180
Yeah.

747
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,260
Yeah.

748
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:24,340
Yeah.

749
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:24,440
Yeah.

750
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:24,661
Yeah.

751
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:24,861
Yeah.

752
00:44:24,861 --> 00:44:25,021
Yeah.

753
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:25,221
Yeah.

754
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:29,606
Yeah.

755
00:44:29,606 --> 00:44:30,067
Yeah.

756
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:36,899
It depends the personality type. There's some guys who,

757
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:39,941
and we found this, I mean it's actually really hard for someone to

758
00:44:39,941 --> 00:44:44,544
do a bunch of content and throw it out to be critiqued, even when everyone's aware of

759
00:44:44,544 --> 00:44:50,307
a prototype phase. And so some designers kind of like to keep their whole vision like this,

760
00:44:50,307 --> 00:44:56,250
and others were more than willing to throw theirs out for the play test that day.

761
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,071
So it just takes time. It took, I think it took us maybe...

762
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:02,167
four, five, six weeks to kind of get that process flowing.

763
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:02,247
Yeah.

764
00:45:02,247 --> 00:45:02,607
Real quick, guys.

765
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:03,527
There's three bikes in each pile.

766
00:45:03,527 --> 00:45:05,108
If you could each use those, that would be a good question.

767
00:45:05,108 --> 00:45:05,428
Thank you.

768
00:45:05,428 --> 00:45:06,068
Yes, sorry.

769
00:45:06,068 --> 00:45:06,348
Yeah.

770
00:45:06,348 --> 00:45:07,989
Yeah.

771
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:09,869
Yeah.

772
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:10,410
Yeah.

773
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,890
Yeah.

774
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:13,311
Yeah.

775
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:13,931
Yeah.

776
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:14,371
Yeah.

777
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:15,271
Yeah.

778
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:16,372
Yeah.

779
00:45:16,372 --> 00:45:17,252
Yeah.

780
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:17,992
Yeah.

781
00:45:17,992 --> 00:45:19,072
Yeah.

782
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:20,613
Yeah.

783
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:23,834
Yeah.

784
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:23,934
Yeah.

785
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:24,014
Yeah.

786
00:45:24,014 --> 00:45:24,234
Yeah.

787
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:24,394
Yeah.

788
00:45:24,394 --> 00:45:24,474
Yeah.

789
00:45:25,577 --> 00:45:31,062
Hey, so you were talking about how you're communicating the idea to the user.

790
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:38,507
As a designer, what sort of ways could I be able to communicate the idea to the animator

791
00:45:38,507 --> 00:45:41,530
to kind of increase the productivity on that end?

792
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,491
That's a good question.

793
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:50,377
I mean, I'm taking a lot of stuff for granted here because our designers and animators have

794
00:45:50,377 --> 00:45:51,338
worked together so long.

795
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:53,159
It's a really good question.

796
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:53,660
I think...

797
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:57,430
I think it's just sharing knowledge between the two.

798
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:02,695
I think if designers kind of speak about the core, that's why I kind of brought up like

799
00:46:02,695 --> 00:46:03,856
what is the game and the components.

800
00:46:03,856 --> 00:46:10,321
I think the more animators can kind of get that language down, the more likely they can

801
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:12,683
kind of have that common vernacular between the two.

802
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:22,565
Hi, so when you were talking about the visual bar in a sense or the quality of the prototype

803
00:46:22,565 --> 00:46:26,907
in regards then showing it to other people, I know you were saying that because you're

804
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:30,830
working internally mostly and not having to show to publishers or other people it's not

805
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,352
quite so stressful, but I was interested if you could elaborate more on where...

806
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:36,173
where that bar ended up being for you.

807
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:37,354
You know what I mean?

808
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:39,795
Like, was there a certain level of lighting

809
00:46:39,795 --> 00:46:42,577
or a certain model quality or a certain animation quality

810
00:46:42,577 --> 00:46:45,518
that you ended up finding was the right level

811
00:46:45,518 --> 00:46:48,040
that people didn't mind looking at the prototype

812
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,622
and could get past the visuals and see the practice,

813
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:52,622
what was going on behind it?

814
00:46:52,622 --> 00:46:57,345
Yeah, so the prototyping was just for us, right?

815
00:46:57,345 --> 00:46:59,026
It's just for our team only,

816
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:01,107
not to be seen by outside people, really.

817
00:47:01,107 --> 00:47:02,928
And we could probably communicate it with a lot of...

818
00:47:03,732 --> 00:47:12,018
wording to them. But I think it, for us it kind of naturally happened. Like, we wanted

819
00:47:12,018 --> 00:47:16,341
the aesthetics to kind of be soft on the eyes and kind of have everything united. So the

820
00:47:16,341 --> 00:47:19,544
shading on the characters needed to be the same as the shading in the environments. So

821
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:25,908
at the bare essentials, it still had to have a little bit of aestheticness to it, but we

822
00:47:25,908 --> 00:47:30,792
also wanted to decouple it from art as much as we could.

823
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:37,234
But really our goals weren't to communicate outside to people as much as just give us

824
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:42,019
something where we could instantly know if something's working or not and get rid of

825
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:43,760
all the other distractions.

826
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,165
So you had like animation binking and this sort of, you know, much more simple animations

827
00:47:49,165 --> 00:47:51,087
or did you do another pass to sort of...

828
00:47:51,087 --> 00:47:52,948
Some animations.

829
00:47:52,948 --> 00:47:53,189
So...

830
00:47:54,758 --> 00:47:59,522
We generally would do blocking, like first pass blocking animations to get it in and get the timing.

831
00:47:59,522 --> 00:48:02,224
It depends what kind of system you're working on.

832
00:48:02,224 --> 00:48:05,507
So let's say if it's something like a melee system,

833
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:12,933
we found those needed far more kind of advanced animations to kind of get just the prototype working.

834
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:14,434
And then other things like idle poses,

835
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:18,577
you don't need all the little subtle, you know, rub your nose stuff.

836
00:48:18,577 --> 00:48:22,600
So those were just usually like one frame to kind of just embody who the character was.

837
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:30,650
So it kind of is basically what got it enough to be prototypable, you know, is basically

838
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,891
the role set for that.

839
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:33,811
It was really hard for us to not go beyond it.

840
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:38,993
I found myself just noodling on animations when I didn't need to.

841
00:48:38,993 --> 00:48:40,254
Thank you.

842
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:42,054
Yeah.

843
00:48:42,054 --> 00:48:43,215
I'll go to this side.

844
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:47,396
So I get to do a ton of prototyping actually at my job.

845
00:48:47,396 --> 00:48:49,457
And that tool looks awesome.

846
00:48:49,457 --> 00:48:51,198
And most of the time when a prototype requires

847
00:48:51,198 --> 00:48:53,718
a bunch of animation, it's usually an immediate turn off.

848
00:48:53,718 --> 00:48:56,919
Just even because that's usually considered a huge time

849
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:58,340
sink for a prototype, right?

850
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,421
So I was curious, the tool looks so awesome.

851
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:05,462
Did you actually have the reverse of designers?

852
00:49:05,462 --> 00:49:07,163
It was so intuitive that designers

853
00:49:07,163 --> 00:49:09,743
were able to jump in, tweak animations, and?

854
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:20,172
And like, did you guys build off any ideas just strictly from the tool of like making a prototype more animation centric and like manipulating the character?

855
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:38,126
Yeah, I mean, I don't think we had the problem of, say, designers kind of coming into our animation tool in Maya and doing anything. But when it got to UE4, honestly, right now, we're trying to figure out where the line is between animator and designer because the tools are kind of simple enough to where each one can kind of just

856
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:45,143
go either way. The animator can take design really far, or the designer can go and tweak

857
00:49:45,143 --> 00:49:48,445
animation stuff. And right now we're kind of keeping that open because we're trying

858
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:54,248
to figure out which way is going to break and which way works most effectively. So I

859
00:49:54,248 --> 00:49:57,690
don't have an answer for it. We're actually kind of, that's another thing we're prototyping

860
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:03,293
is the, where does it end and where does one begin. We've definitely found a lot of kind

861
00:50:03,293 --> 00:50:03,333
of...

862
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:09,378
But that's why it's important for the designer and animator to just kind of team up and work together.

863
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:12,820
So that way one doesn't know what the other one tweaked.

864
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:18,364
Are you seeing more of a trend where like some of those tasks are becoming like kind of a one man thing?

865
00:50:18,364 --> 00:50:24,287
You know what I mean? Like you kind of have like a designer that's focused strictly on the animation portion?

866
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:27,189
Actually in the past we needed that. We needed designers to...

867
00:50:27,189 --> 00:50:30,531
We had to find a designer that had a good eye for animation.

868
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:37,773
I think with our new tools, our focus is to allow the animator to go in and there's some

869
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:44,178
core things you can't change, like sometimes like some of the timing of the actual events.

870
00:50:45,182 --> 00:50:50,405
But a lot of the stuff like blends and transitions and stuff are kind of becoming more open to the animator end.

871
00:50:50,405 --> 00:50:55,508
And like that one animator I talked about who is now over in the design team.

872
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:57,329
He kind of was an animator that kept

873
00:50:57,329 --> 00:51:05,034
pushing into design and he actually was coming up with stuff that the designers liked and they begged for him to be on their team.

874
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:11,120
So this process kind of blurs some of the lines.

875
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,762
We say it a lot that we're kind of stopping,

876
00:51:14,762 --> 00:51:18,064
referring to ourselves as the animator, the modeler.

877
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:20,985
We're all just kind of back to the game developer.

878
00:51:20,985 --> 00:51:23,306
The game developer who animates, the game developer

879
00:51:23,306 --> 00:51:24,867
who can model.

880
00:51:24,867 --> 00:51:29,449
And really, it's just been the tools.

881
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:32,051
We're kind of cutting down some of the barriers

882
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:34,452
between departments.

883
00:51:34,452 --> 00:51:35,012
Cool, thanks.

884
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,627
Hey, I just wanted to make a quick comment.

885
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:41,890
You mentioned animators who became designers and such

886
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,611
that you didn't know of any.

887
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:47,855
I do know of one who is Fumito Ueda, the lead of Ico

888
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,116
and Shadow of the Colossus.

889
00:51:49,116 --> 00:51:50,437
So there's the one guy.

890
00:51:50,437 --> 00:51:51,017
Oh, yeah, yeah.

891
00:51:51,017 --> 00:51:54,540
And they make, apparently, good games.

892
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:54,740
Yeah.

893
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:59,044
Except that Stargaming was canceled.

894
00:51:59,044 --> 00:52:00,525
So they did make good games.

895
00:52:04,545 --> 00:52:05,926
Over here.

896
00:52:05,926 --> 00:52:12,629
Do you think a team of prototyping group for a company can benefit from generalists that

897
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,290
can do multiple things at once?

898
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:15,831
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

899
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:23,075
Do you think a team in a company that's specially designed for prototyping can benefit from

900
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:27,637
members that are generalists that can also do modeling and texturing and animating at

901
00:52:27,637 --> 00:52:28,277
the same time?

902
00:52:28,277 --> 00:52:30,018
Yeah, absolutely.

903
00:52:31,822 --> 00:52:43,205
We definitely have benefited from the guys who are more willing to be generalist and go out and if they don't know something, the guys that go out and kind of teach it to themselves rather than just wait for the other guy with the specialty to come in.

904
00:52:43,205 --> 00:52:45,865
So it's definitely geared towards generalist.

905
00:52:45,865 --> 00:52:57,768
And that way you're not, you can keep your like beautiful, the animator who can just create the best quality animation, you're not making him do this, you can still keep him on the production team.

906
00:52:58,573 --> 00:53:03,496
So do you think in the future maybe when companies implement like prototyping teams for games,

907
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:07,579
do you think this will create like opportunities for journalists?

908
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:11,342
Or do you think it will always be specialized and remain...

909
00:53:11,342 --> 00:53:12,283
I don't know.

910
00:53:12,283 --> 00:53:15,625
It depends where the game industry is going.

911
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:19,768
There's so many types of games that I think there will always be a game company

912
00:53:19,768 --> 00:53:23,371
who would benefit from a generalist more than a specialist.

913
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:26,493
But there's other games that need the specialist.

914
00:53:27,382 --> 00:53:31,364
I don't know of any trend, the game industry is in such a change right now that I don't

915
00:53:31,364 --> 00:53:33,105
know where the trend is heading.

916
00:53:33,105 --> 00:53:38,768
I know for, personally at Epic, we used to really want the specialist animators.

917
00:53:38,768 --> 00:53:45,092
Now we're certainly looking at the generalists who, and when I say generalists, I just mean

918
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:48,014
people who don't say, hey that's beyond, that's beyond my role.

919
00:53:48,014 --> 00:53:50,695
You know, it's out of my, I don't, I don't want to look at it.

920
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:56,779
We want the people who are willing to dig into a game engine and figure stuff out.

921
00:53:57,578 --> 00:53:58,599
Thank you.

922
00:53:58,599 --> 00:53:58,719
Yeah.

923
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,360
So that was, yeah, that was a great talk.

924
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:07,543
I work at Criterion and it's really interesting because we've been going through a really

925
00:54:07,543 --> 00:54:11,604
parallel process to what you guys have been doing and come to a lot of the same sorts

926
00:54:11,604 --> 00:54:14,045
of conclusions.

927
00:54:14,045 --> 00:54:18,487
But I was just wondering, was this one prototyping team that was really focused on the animation

928
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:20,988
side of things or was it across the whole game experience?

929
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:22,820
that was being prototyped?

930
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,442
This prototype team was for the whole game.

931
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:29,544
And with two animators thrown into it, we learned a lot.

932
00:54:29,544 --> 00:54:36,169
So my talk was kind of on both, straddling both ends of it.

933
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:38,470
But yeah, and it's new for us.

934
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,091
We took a bunch of guys who were used to,

935
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:41,853
I mean, these are guys that worked on Gears of War,

936
00:54:41,853 --> 00:54:48,877
were used to the production, the craft section of making a game.

937
00:54:49,908 --> 00:54:52,449
we always blasted through prototyping stuff.

938
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:55,211
I think in the past, prototyping was always done

939
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:57,192
maybe on a per person level,

940
00:54:57,192 --> 00:54:59,193
or maybe a couple people would prototype something

941
00:54:59,193 --> 00:55:02,415
over here, but not a effort by the whole team.

942
00:55:02,415 --> 00:55:05,196
Yeah, that's sort of been exactly the same for us

943
00:55:05,196 --> 00:55:06,777
over the last few projects.

944
00:55:06,777 --> 00:55:09,559
So, but how far are you guys taking the prototype?

945
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:11,520
I'm just really curious to know.

946
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,621
To what extent are you sort of fleshing out

947
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:15,622
a whole game experience as like a?

948
00:55:16,478 --> 00:55:26,625
It's a good question. So the fell fast, fell often philosophy is good, but only if you have really well grounded goals.

949
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:31,408
So I think whatever your goals are that you need to prototype, I think it just needs to be worked out.

950
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:36,812
We have a little bit of extra time to prototype. Not every company is going to have as much time.

951
00:55:36,812 --> 00:55:44,897
You might only have a couple weeks. So you're just going to write down, you know, you've just got to figure out what are the risky things that you want to try out and prototype.

952
00:55:45,557 --> 00:55:46,659
So for us, it's certainly...

953
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:50,626
I would say it's more the structure of the full gaming experience.

954
00:55:50,626 --> 00:55:51,948
We're trying to find like, what...

955
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,571
what...

956
00:55:53,571 --> 00:55:55,655
what, like, gameplay loops,

957
00:55:55,655 --> 00:55:58,279
what kind of, you know, structural elements will help make this game.

958
00:55:59,547 --> 00:56:01,829
So I've got time for one more question.

959
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:03,150
My question is regarding IK.

960
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,372
Is it something that you consider when prototyping?

961
00:56:06,372 --> 00:56:09,355
And if it's not through during prototyping,

962
00:56:09,355 --> 00:56:12,217
is it a programmer task or an animator concern

963
00:56:12,217 --> 00:56:13,138
or responsibility?

964
00:56:13,138 --> 00:56:18,103
And finally, do you aim for the IK system in Unreal Engine 4

965
00:56:18,103 --> 00:56:21,005
to replace human IK at one point?

966
00:56:21,005 --> 00:56:24,228
So yeah, we don't have human IK integrated.

967
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:26,009
Or at least at Epic, we don't.

968
00:56:27,826 --> 00:56:30,588
But I didn't even mention on my slide I was showing IK,

969
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:34,371
that in the prototype phase, the animators are setting that up.

970
00:56:34,371 --> 00:56:36,453
Because we're ultimately the ones that kind of need

971
00:56:36,453 --> 00:56:38,295
to define when and where it's used,

972
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:43,939
and what it's going to be best used for.

973
00:56:43,939 --> 00:56:47,362
So we're kind of handling, I guess,

974
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,304
the first implementation of IK.

975
00:56:49,304 --> 00:56:52,186
But if we get to a section where we need predictive IK,

976
00:56:52,186 --> 00:56:53,868
we're just going to have to pull in a coder

977
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:54,848
to help us with that system.

978
00:56:57,517 --> 00:56:59,350
Alright, great questions guys. Thank you so much.
