1
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:03,902
Hello.

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,065
Wow, there are many of you here.

3
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:10,312
First, thanks so much for coming to this session.

4
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:13,517
My name is Dennis Huang.

5
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:17,022
I'm the Director of Interaction and Visual Design at Niantic.

6
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:25,040
Yes, it's funny standing here because a while ago I used to work at Google,

7
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:30,022
and back then I used to like sneaking into GDC because I was so curious about,

8
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:35,885
I was so excited about the games industry and wanted to be part of the excitement.

9
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:42,207
So I'm very grateful to be standing on stage today, getting to talk to you guys.

10
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:46,649
So just a brief introduction.

11
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:50,292
So my team at Niantic, we're responsible for

12
00:00:51,032 --> 00:00:54,395
most of the visual things that we do.

13
00:00:54,415 --> 00:01:00,340
So all across user experience and visual design,

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,824
3DR, 2DR, graphic design, you name it.

15
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:07,146
Anything that's kind of visual,

16
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:10,850
our small crew has to handle.

17
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,792
And our company's still pretty small.

18
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:22,474
We were only recently founded in 2011 within Google.

19
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,394
We're what's called an autonomous unit,

20
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:25,654
so we're kind of like a startup

21
00:01:25,674 --> 00:01:27,295
that was being incubated within Google.

22
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:31,516
But we spun out in 2015, near the end.

23
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:36,950
But just to give you a quick overview,

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,490
the company was founded by John Hanke,

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,671
who is the founder of Keyhole,

26
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,251
which became Google Earth,

27
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:48,272
and later he oversaw all of the Geo initiatives at Google,

28
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:49,952
so Google Maps and Google Earth,

29
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:53,313
those are some of his well-known accomplishments.

30
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:58,994
And the main goal for the company's founding,

31
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:01,975
we had this pet peeve that was kind of common

32
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:02,915
across the team.

33
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:04,195
We wanted to.

34
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,795
change how people were interacting with their cell phones around us. So you know you go to a

35
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:18,182
beautiful beach or a beautiful hiking trail and inevitably you see like a family that has children

36
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:24,268
and the parents are just looking at their phones and the kids are like begging for attention or

37
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:28,131
you know the parents are just reading news or checking email. So...

38
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,025
Niantic, we looked at smartphones and said,

39
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:36,388
hey, these are really powerful computing devices

40
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:38,310
in virtually everyone's pockets.

41
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,651
And guess what?

42
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:43,354
They have tons of sensors, they have audio capability,

43
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:45,535
they have a nice size screen.

44
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:48,157
incredible amount of processing power.

45
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:52,060
So, and of course GPS, among other sensors.

46
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,001
So we said, hey, can we change the relationship

47
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,123
that people have with their surroundings

48
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:58,884
using these devices?

49
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:05,128
So that was the core mission of the company.

50
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:09,691
And you'll see that theme of kind of location-based games

51
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,572
and user experiences that require movement

52
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:15,094
be kind of a common theme throughout.

53
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:29,072
my presentation. So after the spin out around October 2015, we launched Pokemon Go and we

54
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:30,514
saw this happen.

55
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,870
So this was a player organized,

56
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,131
what was called the Pokemon Go Crawl.

57
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:09,632
It was kind of a pub crawl mixed with location-based gaming

58
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:12,094
and thousands of people showed up.

59
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,575
And this wasn't just in San Francisco,

60
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:17,776
but it was all around the world, including in Sydney

61
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:21,018
and just tons of places around the world.

62
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:22,858
It was kind of happening simultaneously.

63
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:26,100
So meanwhile, at Diantic headquarters,

64
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,581
we were all pretty shocked and in awe.

65
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:38,432
And it was just something that we were like totally not expecting and not really prepared for.

66
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:45,661
But it was like amazing. It was like this moment of almost like a utopian, you know, it didn't matter what gender, what...

67
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:50,404
class you're from, what ethnicity or any demographics.

68
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:54,506
It was, Pokemon was this kind of common bond

69
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:57,267
that people were sharing and in the parks

70
00:04:57,307 --> 00:04:58,488
you would see hundreds of people

71
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,809
and somebody could just yell out, Pokemon,

72
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:02,390
and the whole park would just cheer.

73
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,371
So it was just like really idealistic,

74
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:08,873
like amazing experience that even the dev team

75
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,974
were in awe of and very grateful for.

76
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,595
We were just so glad that

77
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:16,396
the players were responding in such a positive way.

78
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:19,097
But of course behind the scenes,

79
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:22,299
this chart kind of gives you an idea of what was happening.

80
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:27,381
So the orange line was kind of our best guess estimate

81
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,762
of traffic expectations to our servers.

82
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:36,544
The red line was the maximum that we kind of pinned and said,

83
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:41,585
okay, this is the red line amount of traffic that we should worry about.

84
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:43,946
So it was the estimated worst case scenario.

85
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:47,287
The green line is what ended up happening.

86
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:50,588
So you can imagine our poor server engineers.

87
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:59,400
We're working around the clock trying to keep the service alive, but we're still just amazed

88
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,084
and grateful at the world's response.

89
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,603
So just a quick overview at Pokemon Go

90
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:09,004
before we start talking about

91
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:10,886
some of the behind the scenes stuff.

92
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:14,769
So far the app's been downloaded over 650 million times

93
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,813
and Pokemon Go players have collectively walked

94
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:22,857
8.7 billion kilometers as of December last year.

95
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:24,558
So it's probably a higher figure.

96
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:27,241
We just haven't done the number crunching yet.

97
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,364
And in that same period,

98
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:35,737
trainers, the Pokemon Go players have caught

99
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:38,700
88 billion Pokemon in that period.

100
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:42,123
So when Pokemon Go first launched,

101
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,667
the conversation was all about AR.

102
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:50,692
The capture mechanic that we designed

103
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:54,315
had utilized the smartphone's camera feature.

104
00:06:55,036 --> 00:07:02,600
and it was just piping the camera phones video feed and you guys are probably familiar with some of the game mechanics already.

105
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,803
But for us it was kind of a happy accident.

106
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:12,026
I mean at the time AR was a topic but not really to the mainstream.

107
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:17,429
Like hardware like the Microsoft HoloLens was being talked about.

108
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:21,946
being part of Google earlier, we knew about things like Project Tango,

109
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:26,250
and Magic Leap was starting to kind of make rumbles.

110
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:31,796
So, people, when you think of AR, most people thought of hardware,

111
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:35,260
like some sort of futuristic device that was still in the labs.

112
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,922
But for Niantic, it was slightly different.

113
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:43,405
Our founder, CEO, John, he always made the argument

114
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:46,767
that AR was already here, and it was already in our pockets.

115
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:52,131
Part of it was the navigation experience, like Google Maps.

116
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:53,992
Was in a way, if you think about it,

117
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:57,094
a map application is kind of giving you guidance

118
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:59,716
in the real world, and it's taking you from point A

119
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:00,116
to point B.

120
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,294
in a kind of a timely, concurrent basis

121
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:08,516
through all of its computing capabilities and its sensors.

122
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:14,861
So for us, even many years ago,

123
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:20,105
when we were working on this game Ingress,

124
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:21,606
we were trying to solve the question

125
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,728
of how do you get people to move?

126
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:26,050
So if you're not familiar with Ingress,

127
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,392
I thought I'd just play the trailer really quick

128
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,333
to give you a sense of what we're going after.

129
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,137
What was the net effect of the Niantic project?

130
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,480
We had crossed a threshold in which global security could be at risk.

131
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,562
Decrypting the data was the mistake.

132
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:49,968
This is not psychosis or some cognitive break, but an actual takeover of the mind.

133
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:56,072
Much of the public sculpture found in our cities is based on design, seeded in the human mind.

134
00:08:56,392 --> 00:09:00,655
Certain places have an energy that not only attracts people, but attracts events.

135
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,846
The mission of 13 Magnus is to monitor the effects of mind hacking.

136
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:09,992
Obviously, this will be done with the highest of security,

137
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,858
to make sure that the ideas do not contaminate or threaten humanity.

138
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,342
This all leads to Niantic.

139
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,978
I know that many tools will be needed to fight this battle.

140
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,500
You just have to know where to look and know what you're seeing.

141
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,382
Portals emit exotic matter into our world, and that matter has certain effects on our world.

142
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:33,725
I started noticing that there were energy fields, anomalies on Earth, all around me.

143
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:37,967
A few of them exhibit properties that are as yet unexplained.

144
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:40,468
I know that there are others out there.

145
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:43,630
What if they're already among us, but we don't realize it?

146
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:47,319
And I must be prepared to work with them or fight them.

147
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:48,981
They are coming.

148
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,403
If something's wrong out there in the world,

149
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:54,166
this doesn't feel like a scientific study.

150
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:58,131
The one hope lies in understanding what happened to Niantic.

151
00:10:00,553 --> 00:10:01,715
Not all mysteries are solvable.

152
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:04,578
But the joy comes in the pursuit.

153
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:15,325
So Ingress had this thick layer of conspiracy theory

154
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:16,505
and science fiction.

155
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:18,986
But it was really kind of an expression

156
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:23,008
of Niantic's thoughts about augmented reality

157
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,029
in 2011 kind of form.

158
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:34,621
It was more of an alternate reality game where you have to actually physically move and in

159
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:41,206
like a Pac-Man kind of fashion, you kind of vacuum up these energy globules that are scattered

160
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:42,167
all around the planet.

161
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,979
and any game actually required that energy.

162
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,440
So you're constantly required to walk and move

163
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,300
in the real world.

164
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,081
And these locations weren't just like map-based,

165
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:55,821
just random.

166
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:58,862
The game wasn't just a game on a map.

167
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:03,283
We actually spent an incredible amount of energy

168
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,903
trying to build up a database

169
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,744
of these point-of-interest locations

170
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:09,584
where...

171
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:18,330
you know, millions of players would submit interesting places that either had artistic or

172
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,331
cultural or historical merit.

173
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,702
So, our goals are pretty modest initially with Ingress.

174
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:31,147
All we wanted really was if we can change someone's habit,

175
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,769
so take like a typical office worker,

176
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,651
and if we could change that person's habit

177
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,913
during the commute route where they walked

178
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:42,076
like an extra few blocks, we would have been

179
00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:52,242
totally happy because we knew how hard it was to motivate someone to actually get off the chair and move due to some app or some game.

180
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:57,885
What you're seeing on the screen is an image that somebody posted and

181
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:04,081
The image on the left is their normal commute route,

182
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,321
the straight red line.

183
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:08,363
And the image on the right is going to work

184
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,284
while playing Ingress image.

185
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:13,486
And you can see the person decided to walk in the park

186
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:15,748
and stop by all these interesting points.

187
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:20,390
So in a sense, we really started to feel like

188
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,692
there's a ton of potential with real world

189
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:25,994
location-based gaming.

190
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:31,859
And the way we achieved this kind of change in behavior pattern

191
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,821
was using all kinds of classic game mechanics,

192
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,482
like collection, game loops.

193
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:40,763
There's this heavy dose of social interaction

194
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,865
because you inevitably end up meeting other players when

195
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,466
you play a real-world game.

196
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,387
And there's this emergent gameplay

197
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:50,068
based on territory capture.

198
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,650
So we considered Ingress.

199
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:57,160
you know, already pretty successful in what we wanted to achieve.

200
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,543
But then we started noticing that the social dynamics of the game

201
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,865
was really just taking on a life of its own.

202
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:07,167
So all around the world, every once in a while,

203
00:13:08,148 --> 00:13:11,951
thousands and thousands of players come together and duke it out all day

204
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:13,792
in what's called like an Ingress Anomaly.

205
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,635
This event picture is from Cologne.

206
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:21,438
But Tokyo, Seoul, Korea, all over the world,

207
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:23,220
these events are happening right now.

208
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,806
And as I mentioned, inevitably when you're playing

209
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,989
these location-based games, you end up running

210
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:33,813
into other players, you might battle it out all day long

211
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:35,495
and then go for a drink afterwards,

212
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:36,676
get to know each other better.

213
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:40,700
So we started seeing Ingress marriages and Ingress babies,

214
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:43,203
which is pretty awesome.

215
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:47,795
And people were also losing weight playing our game.

216
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,956
Because all of our game requires you to walk,

217
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,356
people were clocking tens of kilometers,

218
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:57,117
in some cases hundreds of kilometers in distance walk

219
00:13:57,157 --> 00:13:58,937
just from playing this mobile app.

220
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:02,898
So we actually ran a survey where 60% of our users

221
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,379
reported having lost weight.

222
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:06,819
So that was pretty awesome.

223
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,360
And to give you an idea of how connected

224
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,981
our players were to the game,

225
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:17,115
What you're seeing on the screen are the faction logos.

226
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:22,164
So Ingress has two teams, the blue team, Resistance, and the green team, Enlightened.

227
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,384
And even when we were at beta,

228
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:31,408
we started seeing this phenomenon

229
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:32,729
which we never expected,

230
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,711
which was people getting tattoos of our game icons.

231
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:39,093
And Paul Martini, who's one of the designers,

232
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:40,874
and I, we looked at each other and said,

233
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:43,756
oh no, we can't ever change this logo again.

234
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:46,278
And we were still in beta,

235
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:49,580
so we were always saying, oh yeah, yeah,

236
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,802
we'll come back and polish the icons later.

237
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:59,985
So it was really an amazing experience helping build Ingress.

238
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:03,086
We learned a lot about how AR games,

239
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:06,428
how it has so much potential to change

240
00:15:06,768 --> 00:15:08,189
real world behavior of players

241
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,931
and in positive and meaningful ways.

242
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:15,333
The social interaction component was greater

243
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,354
than we ever imagined.

244
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:19,315
Like I said earlier, the marriages,

245
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:24,258
the countless Ingress babies is quite impressive.

246
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:27,060
And then encouraging exploration.

247
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,522
People were renting helicopters, airplanes.

248
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,003
People are traveling across continents.

249
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:35,425
Ingress players are pretty hardcore

250
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:37,586
when it comes to exploration.

251
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:41,970
And as part of that exploration, of course,

252
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,573
physical exercise and increased activity.

253
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:50,237
So these are all really interesting to us,

254
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:52,319
and that's when we set out to build Pokemon Go.

255
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,944
As you can see from this awesome concept art

256
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,307
that Chris Dusky, one of our concept artists, created,

257
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:05,810
we had a pretty clear idea of what.

258
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,141
we wanted out of Pokemon Go.

259
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:14,205
It's not too hard to relate to this age-old archetype

260
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,247
that you are the game's hero.

261
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:19,309
Like, I don't want to be just twitching my fingers

262
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:21,531
to control some external thing.

263
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:25,554
I want to be the one slaying the dragon or fighting the aliens

264
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:28,036
and moving about in the real world.

265
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:31,839
So we kind of took that concept and tried to apply it

266
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,341
to this amazing IP called Pokemon.

267
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:38,443
And we wanted a more accessible version compared to Ingress.

268
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:41,465
We wanted to appeal to a wider demographics,

269
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:44,926
a wider age group across gender.

270
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:49,108
And so we made a lot of concept designs

271
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:52,229
and tried to move forward in building

272
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:53,770
a greater sense of immersion.

273
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,831
But we ran into a lot of challenges.

274
00:16:56,691 --> 00:17:01,633
And I want to kind of give you this definition of the term cognitive dissonance.

275
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:06,974
And that cognitive dissonance is something that the design team at Niantic, the art team,

276
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:13,717
we fought with a lot. So anytime your brain is like struggling to make sense of these two things

277
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:18,618
that are clashing together, that's kind of cognitive dissonance. And for us, what that

278
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:20,459
means is if you're out in the real world,

279
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:25,101
and let's say your screen is showing this beautiful snow mountain,

280
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:28,703
but you're on a beach on a sunny day,

281
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:32,645
that kind of separation of what you're being shown and where you're at

282
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:36,107
physically, that is the cognitive dissonance that

283
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:44,772
Team Niantic was struggling to solve. So in Ingress, we have these

284
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:48,774
point of interest locations called portals.

285
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,345
And as I told you earlier, we collected data

286
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:56,587
all around, points all around the world,

287
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,129
actually like five or 10 million points around the world.

288
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,935
And they were player submitted with photos.

289
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:07,998
So Eiffel Tower, for example, would have a screen like this.

290
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:12,680
So we knew that being in front of Eiffel Tower,

291
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,263
seeing Eiffel Tower, and on your phone seeing the photo

292
00:18:16,323 --> 00:18:20,446
of Eiffel Tower was this kind of way to connect the game

293
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,328
to where you're standing.

294
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,651
So that kind of immersion is something that we really

295
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:29,014
wanted to repeat, but in a greater way in Pokemon Go.

296
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:32,916
At first we started looking at photo spheres.

297
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,097
So think like Google Street View,

298
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:42,180
where it's like a static 360 view of a location.

299
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,081
So we started looking at,

300
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:47,962
is there a way to get a little bit fancier than ingress,

301
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:48,823
not just a photo,

302
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:50,984
but something feeling a little bit more immersive.

303
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,185
So we started just mocking up characters

304
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:55,085
kind of in a photo sphere.

305
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,086
And we weren't quite sure.

306
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,940
if the camera technology on phones and all of this stuff

307
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,781
was good enough to actually do the true AR

308
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:09,582
that we always wanted from science fiction.

309
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:12,704
So this was kind of a compromise approach

310
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,705
that we started looking at first.

311
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:15,605
But.

312
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:22,303
As you guys can guess, the photosphere introduces a lot of problems.

313
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:26,990
If you just plop down a model on a static texture map sphere,

314
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,792
and if that...

315
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:35,844
placement doesn't have any awareness of where it is in the real perspective.

316
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:42,513
Depending on the height of where it's placed, Pikachu can look like a giant monster,

317
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:46,899
like Godzilla-sized, or it can look really tiny.

318
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:57,395
And actually one of the bigger issues was that a lot of the photosphere data tended to be car-centric.

319
00:19:57,475 --> 00:20:03,218
So when we wanted this walk-friendly gameplay to have lots of roads everywhere

320
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:07,519
and the photosphere data wasn't compelling to us.

321
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,000
So that's when...

322
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,470
We started prototyping, and we have this tech artist,

323
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,572
a fellow named David Holland, who was a godsend.

324
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:21,174
He's just started using his Unity skills

325
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:26,117
to just try out ideas that we weren't quite sure about

326
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:28,559
from just a tech point of view.

327
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,661
We weren't sure if the mobile CPU and the GPU

328
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:35,504
could handle kind of the augmented reality

329
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,045
experience that we wanted.

330
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:43,204
But the device limitations suddenly seem surmountable when

331
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:44,805
David came up with this.

332
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:59,689
So this is his backyard at home.

333
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:06,753
And this is the very first prototype of the capture mechanic using the camera.

334
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:12,836
So, it's pretty close to what we ended up launching with, but when the team saw this,

335
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:18,820
we were pretty much all in, and this is the battle mechanic that he prototyped.

336
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:26,844
So he's sitting on the floor to kind of get himself a pretty good canvas to work with.

337
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,500
You know, as you guys know, this is kind of a sleight of hand.

338
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,062
It's not true awareness of the environment,

339
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:40,387
so it's not true augmented reality in that sense.

340
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,870
But the experience when we tested it out in our prototypes,

341
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,371
it was just so compelling.

342
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:48,854
You know, the team just really went all in

343
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:50,755
in launching with this.

344
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:54,098
That sense of immersion and that connection

345
00:21:54,198 --> 00:21:56,820
to the actual location that you're standing in.

346
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,422
was really something special.

347
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:04,545
So once that was sort of kind of locked in,

348
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,807
we started looking at the map experience next,

349
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:10,190
which is a very important part of location-based gaming.

350
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:14,384
And the map has this kind of conflicting goal.

351
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:19,347
And on one hand, it needs to function like a functional

352
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:22,230
map application, a navigation application.

353
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:26,453
So it has to just present information in a clear way.

354
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:28,455
It has to show your bearings in a clear way.

355
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:32,157
it needs to be like Google Maps.

356
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:34,759
But on the other hand, it needs to be,

357
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,941
for Pokemon Go, it needs to be fun

358
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:41,643
and needs to function as part of a game element.

359
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:49,908
And fun visuals tends to be a little bit harder to see.

360
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:52,009
If you have lots of VFX, for example,

361
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:55,812
it can obscure those functional information.

362
00:22:57,032 --> 00:23:01,354
So when our team started looking at the map styles,

363
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,977
on one extreme we started at the very virtual end,

364
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:08,578
like the pure functional, really clean map,

365
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:11,199
kind of like what you see on the screen,

366
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:15,141
and just highlighting the point of interest

367
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:20,924
in a very pop kind of colors that are quite popping.

368
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:24,786
And we kind of went further in that direction.

369
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:31,164
And we started noticing that the map was starting to feel

370
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:34,005
a little bit too cold, it was getting a little bit too far

371
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,705
from the Pokemon IP.

372
00:23:37,326 --> 00:23:40,186
So then we pulled back, our team started looking at,

373
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:43,247
okay, well, is there a better, more natural texture

374
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,068
that's still somewhat abstracted,

375
00:23:45,128 --> 00:23:48,429
that doesn't cause too much of a cognitive dissonance?

376
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:54,285
And this was another mock that Mika Hutchins,

377
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,806
our concept artist created.

378
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:59,148
So when you start putting like trees and grass

379
00:23:59,328 --> 00:24:01,810
and birds that aren't really there,

380
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,371
it starts to feel a little bit too much

381
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,633
like the cognitive dissonance I was talking about.

382
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:08,854
Like if you're in the middle of like, you know.

383
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:11,411
fourth and fulsome intersection.

384
00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:14,095
And we paint this like lush vegetation.

385
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:18,141
That's not quite the balance that we wanted to achieve.

386
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,324
So we started kind of mixing the two extremes.

387
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:24,690
This is an example of a little bit more of a mixed approach.

388
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:25,592
And from here.

389
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:30,195
our final map style kind of came about.

390
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:34,577
So it is still very green and the textures are lush

391
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:37,759
to connect to the Pokemon IP,

392
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,681
but things are pretty flat and abstracted

393
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:43,223
and a little bit more vectorized

394
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:46,144
to keep that level of cognitive dissonance

395
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:50,127
from being too intrusive when you're walking about

396
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:51,668
in the real world.

397
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:55,669
So we were really happy with this look,

398
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:59,292
and we started kind of wanting more immersion.

399
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:04,276
So we started looking at, can we pipe the real world data?

400
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,059
in a greater way into the map.

401
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:09,722
So we started thinking about time of day.

402
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:12,925
So even though we didn't end up having time

403
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,988
to implement this, this kind of more rich

404
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:19,232
time of day based map experience

405
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:20,934
can really connect the player

406
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:24,778
to their surroundings, to their environment.

407
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:31,300
And this is another example of what we were looking at.

408
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,504
So Krzysztofski just kind of put together a quick mock

409
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:36,907
of different time of day encounter scenes

410
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:42,134
and plopped down a equally, the same Pikachu image.

411
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:47,736
You know, our team is pretty small, so we had to be quite frugal with our resources and time.

412
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:53,098
So we're like, hey, Pikachu doesn't look so bad daytime or nighttime.

413
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:55,038
Let's just kind of get away with both.

414
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:59,600
So that's where our scheme of the characters being lit the same,

415
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,161
but the environment's changing, where that whole thing came from.

416
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:10,477
So with the map time of day stuff figured out,

417
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:13,661
we moved on to looking at the avatar.

418
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:17,124
So the avatar of course is a very important element

419
00:26:17,164 --> 00:26:19,807
of the player's experience in the game.

420
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:22,269
It's kind of your representation of the identity.

421
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,122
But the original direction that we looked at,

422
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:29,845
we're worried about the same cognitive dissonance concept.

423
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,468
We didn't want to kind of separate too much

424
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:35,450
of who you are in the real world

425
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:37,712
and what was happening on the map.

426
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:40,214
So this is a really old mock.

427
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:44,938
So we kind of went for this like intentionally separate,

428
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:48,401
like, okay, let's not make the avatar too like,

429
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:54,984
too humanoid, let's do like a hologram bust approach

430
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:58,705
so that it still feels like a car navigation type thing

431
00:26:58,745 --> 00:27:00,726
where the direction heading is really clear

432
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,828
and you get to customize your character a little bit.

433
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:08,069
But it wasn't.

434
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:11,039
quite cool looking at the end.

435
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:15,920
We weren't that happy with kind of the chopped bust look.

436
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,701
So we kind of went with a little bit more

437
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:19,461
conventional approach with the avatar,

438
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:23,562
but instead, even though our team was small,

439
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:25,962
we kind of invested a lot of energy and effort

440
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,723
into avatar customization so that players

441
00:27:28,783 --> 00:27:31,344
can customize the look.

442
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:38,863
And on that note, actually, we needed to be pretty efficient

443
00:27:38,903 --> 00:27:40,864
with our tech art pipeline.

444
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:43,547
Because of our small team,

445
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,069
because of the mobile device limitations,

446
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,311
we needed to kind of plan ahead

447
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:52,814
how our UV texture maps were laid out.

448
00:27:52,874 --> 00:27:55,937
And these textures aren't actually full three-color

449
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:57,979
all necessarily.

450
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:01,742
We went with a technique called luminous map.

451
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:04,943
luminous map mapping, I guess,

452
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:09,005
where the grayscale texture that you see on the left

453
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:13,066
maps the range 0 to 256 values,

454
00:28:13,506 --> 00:28:17,708
but that grayscale gets mapped back to a color ramp.

455
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,409
So the examples on the right,

456
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:22,550
you can see that just by switching that,

457
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:23,670
you know, 3K, 4K, tiny...

458
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:28,953
ramp texture, we can get very different looks.

459
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:33,996
And this was so that we used the data blobs very efficiently

460
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:37,518
when you're even on a relatively slow network.

461
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:41,301
And this also gave our team ability

462
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:45,803
to quickly iterate on the color swatches.

463
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:51,380
So similar to the avatars, for the characters,

464
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,221
the Pokemon characters themselves,

465
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,282
we wanted to really nail that look.

466
00:28:56,702 --> 00:29:01,423
So even though the Pokemon IP has existed for 20 plus years,

467
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:06,585
for Pokemon Go, we were given a lot of leeway and freedom

468
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:08,165
to develop kind of our own look.

469
00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:14,283
I really wanted the Pokemon characters in our game to feel like they were alive because

470
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:20,606
of our real world connection, because we were trying to suspend that disbelief that these

471
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:21,926
were just virtual characters.

472
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:27,769
We spent a lot of time in the Look Dev, so again, Mika Hutchins, our concept artist,

473
00:29:29,162 --> 00:29:32,264
did this great set of reference images

474
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:36,166
where we went for a softer look.

475
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:41,289
We used the Fresnel shader kind of look heavily

476
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:43,310
with a healthy dose of rim lighting

477
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,411
because we knew that

478
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:49,332
the image, the background of the characters,

479
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:52,454
we weren't going to necessarily know the light direction.

480
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:56,415
So we needed to just kind of have a amorphous,

481
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:59,297
kind of even lighting for our characters.

482
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:03,598
And this kind of lighting scheme ended up working out great

483
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:05,759
for the AR camera.

484
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,701
And similar to the avatars, we needed to be efficient

485
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:13,463
with how we were gonna shade these guys.

486
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:14,803
So...

487
00:30:16,634 --> 00:30:18,235
Mike Tan, one of our tech artists,

488
00:30:19,036 --> 00:30:21,657
did a great job coming up with a super efficient,

489
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:25,160
mobile, device-friendly way to achieve that look

490
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,702
using these BRDF shader,

491
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:32,505
texture lookup scheme,

492
00:30:32,805 --> 00:30:36,147
where the rim, top and bottom,

493
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:41,190
and the diffuse, and the ambient lights

494
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,893
are controlled through a very efficiently packed texture.

495
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:48,182
And also with the character animations,

496
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:51,465
we used a UV offset scheme where

497
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:54,489
we separated the

498
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,314
the UV, we used a UV space for masking the mesh

499
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:03,876
so that like zero to one, for example,

500
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,318
would control the eye animation

501
00:31:06,438 --> 00:31:08,479
and one to two would control the mouth.

502
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,204
So what that allowed us to do was just use one draw pass

503
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:17,847
to shade these characters very efficiently and have...

504
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:24,766
and get rid of the need for having separate textures for just masking.

505
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:28,269
So it was a pretty efficient way to handle

506
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,153
these hundreds of characters that you're having to

507
00:31:32,994 --> 00:31:34,395
download while you're on the road.

508
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:42,763
With the immersive, the avatar, the map,

509
00:31:43,243 --> 00:31:47,665
the immersive, the AR part is figured out.

510
00:31:47,725 --> 00:31:52,387
The next thing was to look at the interface

511
00:31:52,487 --> 00:31:56,229
and we just needed to not get in the way

512
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:58,871
of movement-based gaming.

513
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:03,493
So in Ingress, back to this portal screen,

514
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:06,174
we had a lot of shortcomings.

515
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:12,688
This was very precision, tap-based kind of UI.

516
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:17,712
And often the controls were precisely in the wrong place,

517
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,876
so you had to reach to the upper right corner of the screen

518
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:25,879
to get to the main game action menu.

519
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:32,182
and the taps that were required for the main game actions

520
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:35,603
also were, it's almost like a webpage navigation scheme

521
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:38,343
and I used to be a web guy so I was applying

522
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:42,125
past experience precisely in the wrong spots.

523
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:48,107
So this was very movement unfriendly UI I would say,

524
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:49,087
I would admit.

525
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:55,630
And with Pokemon Go, we wanted to change this for the better.

526
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,592
So in Pokemon Go, you'll notice that it's

527
00:32:59,752 --> 00:33:02,152
a very DOM-friendly layout.

528
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:07,214
We did our best to move all the core essential controls down

529
00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:07,854
to the bottom.

530
00:33:09,515 --> 00:33:12,817
And if you look at the diagram, that kind of center,

531
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:14,538
like lower half of the screen,

532
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:16,979
where both the left thumb and the right thumb can reach,

533
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,162
that's really where you wanna kind of keep your controls at.

534
00:33:26,736 --> 00:33:29,237
Personally, I think swipe gestures on phones

535
00:33:29,337 --> 00:33:32,178
feel so satisfying because while you're swiping,

536
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,199
you have a pretty good grip on the phone.

537
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:38,761
So even when you're walking and playing Niantic games,

538
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,037
that grip on the phone is quite important.

539
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:45,818
So you don't want to be doing precision tapping

540
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,158
like I said earlier.

541
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:53,341
So in Pokemon Go, you can swipe to catch the characters,

542
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:54,241
to throw the balls,

543
00:33:54,301 --> 00:33:57,162
you can swipe down to close various panels,

544
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,583
you can open panels using the swipe gesture.

545
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,984
So we try to use the swipe quite liberally.

546
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:10,049
And the one-handed use was really important while we were playtesting.

547
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:16,474
We found that any kind of two-handed play kind of killed the momentum of that game session.

548
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:22,538
So unlike Ingress, we really tried to make the map experience one-hand friendly.

549
00:34:22,578 --> 00:34:28,123
So that's where the one-thumb rotate kind of camera controls idea came from.

550
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:32,626
And most game actions you can get away with just using one hand.

551
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:36,208
And if you live in a really cold country,

552
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,410
last thing you want is to have to take both hands out

553
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,330
in cold weather.

554
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:47,814
And in terms of the, yeah, so that's where we ended up

555
00:34:47,894 --> 00:34:48,995
with the interaction design.

556
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,641
appealing to a really wide array of demographics,

557
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:59,662
like my 70 plus year old mother

558
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:01,584
as an avid high level player,

559
00:35:02,484 --> 00:35:07,046
and this kind of Pokemon, Pokestop interaction with the.

560
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,537
regular daily rhythm of the daily bonuses,

561
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:15,502
PokéStops that change color to pink. It kind of acts as like a breadcrumb when

562
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:19,306
you're walking and moving about. All these

563
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:22,630
elements were designed to keep you moving and

564
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,773
keep you motivated while playing in the real world.

565
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:35,180
So with this achieved, we had a lot of surprising side benefits after we launched.

566
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:39,787
We realized that people were using Pokemon Go to help fight anxiety.

567
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:41,230
People were...

568
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:44,756
getting their marriages helped, I guess.

569
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:48,558
And autism was also an aspect that apparently

570
00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:52,720
Pokemon Go players found beneficial effects.

571
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,481
Like we were getting letters from parents

572
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:56,302
who had autistic children,

573
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,824
and they were like just thanking us

574
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,585
that for the first time in a long time,

575
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:08,088
their autistic children were able to interact with others

576
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:11,630
in a very healthy way when they were out in the park.

577
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,412
For example, everybody was welcoming them

578
00:36:16,373 --> 00:36:18,915
because they're all out there playing Pokemon Go together.

579
00:36:19,315 --> 00:36:21,336
So we got a lot of touching letters

580
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:25,759
from all around the world along these lines.

581
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:27,540
It was quite moving.

582
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,382
And this was interesting too.

583
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,083
There's a children's hospital that is using Pokemon Go for physical therapy.

584
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:41,044
So because it requires real world movement...

585
00:36:41,645 --> 00:36:42,805
...or to squat down.

586
00:36:43,066 --> 00:36:46,388
I can say, hey, the guy's a little bit lower, can you reach down and get him?

587
00:36:46,468 --> 00:36:51,991
And that's just a really tricky way that physical therapy or occupational therapy can get a kid to do the exercises

588
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:55,353
that he was screaming and crying about five minutes ago that he didn't want to do.

589
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:01,236
This kind of raises the general atmosphere of happiness here.

590
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:05,103
It's the technology that's only going to get better and it's going to be more exciting.

591
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:15,348
So yeah, the technology is only going to get better and we're pretty excited about what's next.

592
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:23,092
There's so many ideas that we wanted to build that we didn't have time for.

593
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:31,057
What kind of ended up going out to the public was probably like 10% of all the ideas that Niantic dev members had.

594
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,101
So for example, one of the things that we want to go back to is just

595
00:37:36,482 --> 00:37:41,923
continuing to increase the real world connection and the immersiveness with the player.

596
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:45,024
So this kind of beautiful sunset

597
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:51,045
type thing is just a small example of what we mucked up but didn't get to implement.

598
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:55,087
Someday hopefully we'll get to do more weather kind of effects.

599
00:37:58,163 --> 00:38:03,987
The social aspect is something that we're continuing to look forward to.

600
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:09,070
With Ingress, we already have this massive Ingress anomalies where,

601
00:38:09,711 --> 00:38:15,815
for example, in July of last year, we had twelve thousand people gather in Tokyo

602
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:19,037
to play Ingress together as a community.

603
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:20,899
So these kind of epic events,

604
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:26,583
we hope to be able to design features into Pokemon Go so that we can replicate.

605
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:30,385
this kind of amazing social experiences.

606
00:38:32,246 --> 00:38:36,087
And last but not least, hope we'll see more tattoos.

607
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:43,531
And finally I'd like to thank the small but scrappy design

608
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:45,552
and art crew at Niantic.

609
00:38:47,073 --> 00:38:49,734
Paul, Mika, Chris, David, now Caitlin and Marco,

610
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:53,756
they're just, I'm so lucky to work with these amazing

611
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:54,757
talented people.

612
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,121
And we're hiring.

613
00:38:57,581 --> 00:38:59,903
So we're always looking,

614
00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:02,986
we're kind of in a growth stage right now.

615
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:04,768
It's a great time to join Niantic.

616
00:39:05,108 --> 00:39:07,070
We're still like a small, scrappy startup,

617
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,134
but we have big dreams and we're hoping to achieve a lot.

618
00:39:11,154 --> 00:39:14,697
So Unity artists, 3D artists, 3D animators.

619
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:18,461
And Niantic.

620
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,682
we're building these platforms,

621
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:23,923
these real world location-based platforms

622
00:39:23,963 --> 00:39:28,447
so that game developers like you can take your amazing ideas

623
00:39:28,507 --> 00:39:32,349
and build a real world version of X,

624
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,851
whatever, insert game idea here,

625
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:36,433
like that kind of a concept

626
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:39,935
using Niantic's great location-based platform.

627
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:43,578
So hope that in the future, our paths will cross

628
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:47,701
and we can see even more amazing things happen.

629
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:49,170
throughout the world.

630
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,650
Thank you very much.

631
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:07,399
I left a little bit of time for questions in case any of you was curious about any of

632
00:40:07,419 --> 00:40:08,620
the material that I presented.

633
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,903
So please come to the mic and let me know.

634
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:22,266
Hi there.

635
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,048
So I'd just like to know,

636
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:26,532
what's it like swimming in a Scrooge McDuck money pit?

637
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,374
I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?

638
00:40:28,394 --> 00:40:30,417
What's it like swimming in a Scrooge McDuck money pit?

639
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,127
So the question was...

640
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:45,436
You don't have to answer that.

641
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:51,161
Yeah, we did end up with an overwhelming response from all around the world.

642
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:55,004
You know, our revenue stream is quite healthy.

643
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:58,746
Our ambitions are also equally big.

644
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:04,007
We're not looking at ourselves as just a small game shop, game studio,

645
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:10,769
but we really want to build up this platform and we want to continue kind of encouraging the healthy habits

646
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:15,290
that we triggered with Pokémon GO and Ingress, where people are walking extra,

647
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,911
spending more time with their family, with a shared game experience,

648
00:41:19,591 --> 00:41:21,411
enjoying their local surroundings.

649
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:25,812
We have big ambitions, so hopefully we can put those resources to good use.

650
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:33,218
I was wondering, early on you had a slide about changing player behavior, changing someone's

651
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:38,603
route to work. I was curious if you could speak more about how big a change you were

652
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:42,146
seeing from the average person and how long that would last. Was it permanent or would

653
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:44,648
they start, kind of revert to their normal route after a while?

654
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:50,823
I think a lot of that depends on the person and it still remains to be seen what the true

655
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:51,644
potential is.

656
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:58,967
Just to repeat the question, the question was about what kind of player habit change,

657
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:05,650
going more detail into the types of player habit changes that we've seen.

658
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:15,894
Ingress players so far have astounded us in how hardcore, how engaged they've been with the game.

659
00:42:17,214 --> 00:42:28,638
We've seen people just completely change their life around from being a sedentary, you know, kind of a typical, you know,

660
00:42:29,023 --> 00:42:36,166
techie to a totally fit, always going out to meet with Ingress players.

661
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:42,309
A lot of Ingress communities around the world have these weekly gatherings where they'll

662
00:42:42,629 --> 00:42:52,673
meet at a local pub and then go on a group walk lasting many hours, or they'll farm the

663
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:54,734
game locations, the game board.

664
00:42:56,854 --> 00:42:58,276
We've seen people...

665
00:43:00,782 --> 00:43:04,624
like go out to like really remote locations like in Alaska,

666
00:43:04,704 --> 00:43:07,565
like there's tales of their battle stories

667
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:09,766
where they rented a plane

668
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:11,607
and there's like a winter storm coming

669
00:43:11,687 --> 00:43:14,548
and the pilot was like, we gotta take off now.

670
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:16,789
And the player wasn't getting GPS signals.

671
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:20,091
So they're like five more minutes and we have to leave now.

672
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:23,272
And they like create these cross continental links.

673
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:27,074
So the extremes are definitely out there.

674
00:43:28,054 --> 00:43:28,975
With Pokemon Go.

675
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:32,341
You know, like I mentioned earlier,

676
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:33,904
the billions of kilometers walked,

677
00:43:34,405 --> 00:43:36,550
that's definitely material distances

678
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,452
that people are walking.

679
00:43:40,897 --> 00:43:43,958
the game dynamic elements that we're constantly thinking of,

680
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:48,199
starting with egg hatching and the Pokestop colors changing,

681
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,740
these bright crones, and these rewards for walking.

682
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,741
The game mechanic actually having rewards for walking

683
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,782
is something that we'll keep doing.

684
00:43:56,862 --> 00:44:01,443
So I can only expect more of this in the future.

685
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:04,144
Yes, please.

686
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:10,589
talk about ingress, you talked about how you had a lot of

687
00:44:10,629 --> 00:44:13,931
experience provoking these massive rallies and real world

688
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:17,173
social events. When Pokemon Go came out there was a rush of

689
00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:21,696
news stories about the geography you had layered over the real

690
00:44:21,736 --> 00:44:25,178
world leading people to run up against the difficult geography

691
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:28,460
of the actual world. So there were people finding bodies or

692
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,202
there was an issue with national parks in Milwaukee. There was a

693
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:39,945
Government in Southeast Asia that was worried that it might lead people to trespass into military bases. I was wondering how much

694
00:44:40,907 --> 00:44:45,051
How ready were you for that? How surprised were you by it and how much planning and thinking did you do?

695
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:48,556
Beforehand about what might happen when this was unleashed on the world

696
00:44:50,327 --> 00:45:05,653
Sure, so the question is how prepared or how much do we anticipate some of the side effects of having such a massive location-based game take off in terms of trespassing or unsafe areas?

697
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:20,163
Having run Niantic, I mean having run Ingress as part of the company, we did anticipate a lot of those issues, but in a much smaller scale.

698
00:45:20,223 --> 00:45:28,448
We didn't quite anticipate the massive explosion of player activity that Pokemon Go triggered.

699
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:32,805
we were making adjustments.

700
00:45:33,285 --> 00:45:36,846
You saw the game add speed limit detection,

701
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,526
warning to players to make sure

702
00:45:39,566 --> 00:45:41,847
that they're paying attention to their surroundings.

703
00:45:42,267 --> 00:45:43,747
Those are really important changes

704
00:45:43,947 --> 00:45:46,488
and we constantly continue to remind players

705
00:45:46,588 --> 00:45:50,728
about safety and the issues of location-based gaming.

706
00:45:51,909 --> 00:45:54,829
With governments, we actually have a pretty healthy

707
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:58,110
relationship with park operators or various,

708
00:46:02,512 --> 00:46:09,458
authorities where we're kind of in a continuous dialogue about, you know,

709
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:14,362
working together to make these experiences safer and better for the

710
00:46:14,962 --> 00:46:17,825
player community. So, for example,

711
00:46:19,006 --> 00:46:22,028
In Japan, the local governments actually

712
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:25,430
kind of coordinated with us and, you know,

713
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:30,352
they'll do these like lapris, like kind of spawning events

714
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:33,574
to kind of move people throughout their cities

715
00:46:33,634 --> 00:46:35,455
where they wanted more like tourism

716
00:46:35,596 --> 00:46:38,557
or more community building kind of activities.

717
00:46:38,617 --> 00:46:40,699
So that's kind of a direction

718
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:43,220
that we're really interested in going.

719
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:44,981
Thank you.

720
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:46,282
Yes, please.

721
00:46:46,362 --> 00:46:47,222
Thank you for sharing.

722
00:46:48,445 --> 00:46:50,385
I was wondering, you spoke about Unity.

723
00:46:50,405 --> 00:46:55,987
Can you speak a little bit more about how you used Unity for the game?

724
00:46:56,007 --> 00:46:59,108
And was it part of, was it real-time rendering?

725
00:46:59,228 --> 00:47:01,209
Or you said that it really made a big difference.

726
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:03,510
And I just want to explore that a little bit more.

727
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,672
Sure, yeah, Unity, so the question is,

728
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,094
how do we use Unity?

729
00:47:07,414 --> 00:47:09,597
Unity 3D is our main game engine.

730
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:12,460
As many of you guys know,

731
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,505
the cross-platform capabilities really helped us launch

732
00:47:17,607 --> 00:47:18,888
on both iOS and Android.

733
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:27,897
And yeah, it just offers a lot of hooks for the artists to iterate quickly without too much engineering help.

734
00:47:28,577 --> 00:47:37,946
But having a healthy tech artist team, we found, was really important to act as a glue between more traditional artists and engineers.

735
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:43,688
And yes, it is real-time graphics running on the phones

736
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,989
and Unity offers a lot of hooks to get at those sensors

737
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:51,770
and the camera feed data and things like that.

738
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:55,191
So it's been pretty indispensable for our projects.

739
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:56,952
Yes, please.

740
00:47:57,313 --> 00:48:02,921
Hi. I'm a bit curious about the philosophy behind the geographical distribution of spawns

741
00:48:03,021 --> 00:48:08,569
because I think that if you live in downtown San Francisco you have a very different

742
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:13,215
opportunity to play the game than if you're like in a rural village in Kazakhstan or

743
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:13,656
something.

744
00:48:14,418 --> 00:48:18,980
Right, yeah, and we, the devs at Niantic, we share that view.

745
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:24,142
We really are desperately wanting more gameplay opportunities in rural areas.

746
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:30,124
We're heavily reliant on player submitted location data, you know, for many reasons,

747
00:48:30,164 --> 00:48:31,485
player safety being one of them.

748
00:48:32,465 --> 00:48:37,086
So we're starting, like in Ingress for example,

749
00:48:37,146 --> 00:48:41,828
we have an online tool where players can submit

750
00:48:42,068 --> 00:48:46,150
and rate each other's location, you know,

751
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,510
photos and the description about that place.

752
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:54,047
you know, how interesting is it culturally or artistically.

753
00:48:54,927 --> 00:49:00,030
So I'm optimistic that over time we'll be able to grow

754
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,531
that database so that rural areas can also have

755
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:04,372
a rich gameplay experience.

756
00:49:05,653 --> 00:49:05,853
Thanks.

757
00:49:07,534 --> 00:49:10,495
Hello, I'm curious about why you launched

758
00:49:10,535 --> 00:49:13,076
with the gym system you did, as opposed to allowing

759
00:49:13,136 --> 00:49:14,977
like players to battle their friends head to head

760
00:49:15,237 --> 00:49:15,698
in real time?

761
00:49:16,822 --> 00:49:27,249
Yeah, we have a lot of game feature ideas that we want to continue building in the future, like PvP or a better tuned gym system.

762
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:31,732
So the game loop is something that we're continuing to evolve.

763
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:43,626
But initially the rollout focused really on the collection mechanic and wanted to test the waters and if there is something interesting here.

764
00:49:44,006 --> 00:49:50,171
And there was. So the dev team is really hard at work building out the game features.

765
00:49:50,551 --> 00:49:57,836
So I can say, yeah, please look forward to more fun, engaging game mechanics in the future.

766
00:50:02,555 --> 00:50:08,319
Hi, I wanted to ask about, you talked a lot about the textures and how that was kept small.

767
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:16,105
I was curious how, what the restrictions were on 3D models and the variety of complexities with

768
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:19,407
character models of so many numbers in a game like that.

769
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:25,530
Yeah, luckily, so the question was about the complexities

770
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,091
of the character data.

771
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:29,673
And luckily we had a great partner,

772
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:33,135
the Pokemon Company and Creatures, Inc.

773
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:38,439
They gave us the base mesh data

774
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:42,322
that we were able to massage and process in our pipeline.

775
00:50:43,903 --> 00:50:45,625
from the original game series.

776
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:49,148
I'm not quite sure which platform, maybe the DS games.

777
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:50,789
So we had a good starting point,

778
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,313
but of course taking that to a smartphone,

779
00:50:54,353 --> 00:50:58,757
like Unity kind of model, it was quite difficult.

780
00:50:58,817 --> 00:51:02,901
So it just took a ton of effort writing smart tools

781
00:51:02,941 --> 00:51:05,743
to automate as much as possible

782
00:51:05,843 --> 00:51:08,125
and minimize manual tuning and things like that.

783
00:51:08,205 --> 00:51:08,966
But we were able to.

784
00:51:10,587 --> 00:51:13,167
Mike Tan and Kayla and those guys were,

785
00:51:13,327 --> 00:51:16,388
the tech artists were really able to massage the data

786
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:21,829
so that, yeah, not just the vertex data

787
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:24,910
but the texture data came over pretty good.

788
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:28,831
But it was still a very subjective thing

789
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:30,211
for the look dev part.

790
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,612
There was a lot of directions we could have gone

791
00:51:33,172 --> 00:51:34,792
in terms of shading the character.

792
00:51:34,932 --> 00:51:38,993
So our concept artists really had to go model by model.

793
00:51:39,754 --> 00:51:43,536
and tune the AO layers or get the colors right.

794
00:51:43,556 --> 00:51:45,758
It was a pretty tough process,

795
00:51:45,818 --> 00:51:46,859
but we're getting better at it.

796
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,200
Thanks.

797
00:51:49,261 --> 00:51:49,441
Hi.

798
00:51:49,561 --> 00:51:49,721
Hi.

799
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:57,811
So you spoke a little bit about the iteration process for the player avatar models and the style design behind that.

800
00:51:58,572 --> 00:52:06,435
I noticed in your earlier, some of the earlier concepts, there was more of an anime style sort of in line with the original IP.

801
00:52:07,596 --> 00:52:15,479
Why did you guys choose to go for a slightly more realistic look for the avatar? Was that more immersion, sort of that AR?

802
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,143
Yeah, definitely. It was a very conscious decision on our part.

803
00:52:19,924 --> 00:52:24,688
We wanted to have a version of Pokémon that wasn't...

804
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:30,954
Well, so the original IP, the trainers have a much younger look,

805
00:52:31,655 --> 00:52:34,898
and the target audience tends to skew younger ages.

806
00:52:36,099 --> 00:52:39,702
But for us, the avatars, we wanted to kind of elevate them.

807
00:52:40,563 --> 00:52:47,951
to an older generation slightly and for that lessening that cognitive dissonance that I

808
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:53,777
mentioned earlier we didn't want some super stylized like big-headed but small-bodied

809
00:52:53,857 --> 00:52:55,899
kind of characters running around on a map when

810
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,000
like you're the real game hero.

811
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,141
We kind of wanted to match the virtual

812
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:04,301
with the physical as much as possible.

813
00:53:04,441 --> 00:53:06,382
So in a way we achieved that.

814
00:53:06,402 --> 00:53:10,343
We're already seeing people make their costumes

815
00:53:10,503 --> 00:53:12,764
to match what's in the game and kind of wear that

816
00:53:12,784 --> 00:53:14,224
while they're playing Pokemon Go.

817
00:53:14,304 --> 00:53:15,265
So that's kind of cute.

818
00:53:16,885 --> 00:53:18,446
And also the...

819
00:53:19,827 --> 00:53:21,769
And we're gonna try to push that further.

820
00:53:21,809 --> 00:53:24,751
We want more hairstyles and more,

821
00:53:25,551 --> 00:53:27,613
hopefully more age, different ages

822
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:30,014
that you can choose from, different skin colors.

823
00:53:30,154 --> 00:53:32,596
So we're hoping to push the envelope

824
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:33,517
a little bit more there.

825
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:34,998
Thanks.

826
00:53:35,721 --> 00:53:35,961
Hello.

827
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:36,681
Hi.

828
00:53:37,642 --> 00:53:41,303
You talked about tattoos and how you could never, ever change

829
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:41,963
that again.

830
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:44,944
How did you approach your design process?

831
00:53:45,044 --> 00:53:47,425
Did you think about things that you couldn't pull back on,

832
00:53:48,665 --> 00:53:50,826
in terms of anchoring the community,

833
00:53:50,866 --> 00:53:51,746
if you were afraid of that?

834
00:53:51,886 --> 00:53:55,227
Or do you release them and are open to pull back

835
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:56,147
on certain designs?

836
00:53:57,848 --> 00:54:00,649
Are you talking about the graphic design specifically,

837
00:54:00,769 --> 00:54:02,169
or just designs generally?

838
00:54:02,229 --> 00:54:04,290
Just designs in general, so gameplay as well.

839
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:13,230
Yeah, maybe because of Ingress and the whole tattoo kind of experience, we were a little bit more cognizant of what's possible out there.

840
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:24,557
So the question was, you know, did the team feel, or how did the team deal with the fact that once you put out something, it's like permanent, basically.

841
00:54:25,778 --> 00:54:29,881
So, certainly with the faction symbols and Pokémon GO.

842
00:54:31,742 --> 00:54:34,184
Team Valor and Team Instinct, that kind of thing.

843
00:54:34,644 --> 00:54:37,686
We iterated quite a long time,

844
00:54:37,706 --> 00:54:40,147
because the whole time the artist and I were going,

845
00:54:40,547 --> 00:54:44,049
these are gonna be tattoos, we know it, it's gonna happen,

846
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:47,071
so let's make sure that it works well as a tattoo.

847
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:49,432
So we put in a lot of...

848
00:54:50,072 --> 00:54:53,838
time and energy specifically on the graphic design.

849
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:58,686
But you're right that generally the game got so much

850
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:02,371
attention that anything that we put out was scrutinized

851
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:03,994
and analyzed and it was...

852
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,797
It's very natural to feel like once we put out something,

853
00:55:08,817 --> 00:55:12,098
it's like anchored and we can't change it ever again.

854
00:55:12,498 --> 00:55:14,098
But I think it's really important,

855
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:16,659
especially with smartphone mobile games,

856
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:20,400
that the devs kind of resist that impulse.

857
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,200
It is this malleable thing

858
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,081
where if something's not working well,

859
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:27,221
you have to be able to go in

860
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:28,842
and do the surgery to change it.

861
00:55:34,952 --> 00:55:40,615
And that's kind of Niantic's attitude about our current game loop.

862
00:55:40,675 --> 00:55:45,657
We have a lot of ideas about how to improve certain things that aren't working so well

863
00:55:45,777 --> 00:55:48,978
and emphasize things that are working well.

864
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:52,520
like hatching eggs, for example,

865
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,422
really is motivating people to walk incredible distances.

866
00:55:57,303 --> 00:55:59,505
So that's something that we'll hold on to,

867
00:55:59,585 --> 00:56:01,986
but adjust some of the other game loop elements.

868
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:05,048
So we're trying to stay flexible and stay on our toes.

869
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:06,769
Thank you.

870
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:08,891
Yes, hello.

871
00:56:08,951 --> 00:56:09,191
Hello.

872
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:11,733
What are some of the steps you guys took

873
00:56:11,893 --> 00:56:15,215
or techniques you employed to combat people cheating

874
00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:18,237
by spoofing their GPS location monitoring?

875
00:56:19,304 --> 00:56:22,487
Yeah, so that's probably a great question for Ed,

876
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:24,068
who's our engineering director.

877
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:27,171
He's actually giving a talk, I think, later this week.

878
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:30,994
But we have some really smart people

879
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:34,197
working day and night trying to combat that.

880
00:56:36,118 --> 00:56:40,859
My limited understanding of the situation is that a lot of the hardware, a lot of the phones,

881
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:48,520
like if you kind of get underneath a certain OS level, then it's just really hard for the game

882
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:54,482
operator to detect truly whether, you know, that phone's been hacked or not.

883
00:56:54,522 --> 00:56:57,602
So we have to use all kinds of other signals to combat.

884
00:57:00,024 --> 00:57:05,228
cheating behavior. So it's an ongoing thing, but we have some

885
00:57:05,268 --> 00:57:08,932
really good people on it. And hopefully, yeah, there's not too

886
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:13,496
much I can say on that topic. I'm sorry. I'm the art guy.

887
00:57:13,636 --> 00:57:20,042
Thanks. Hi. For the tracking part, did you consider using more

888
00:57:20,162 --> 00:57:23,325
powerfully match based algorithms for the tracking at

889
00:57:23,345 --> 00:57:26,007
some point? And if you did, why did you discard them?

890
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:29,036
I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?

891
00:57:29,056 --> 00:57:31,778
Yeah, like algorithms for image space tracking,

892
00:57:31,978 --> 00:57:33,439
like the ones that they use the camera

893
00:57:33,479 --> 00:57:35,460
like to do the tracking for the phone,

894
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,961
like I don't know, Slam or something like that.

895
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,102
If you consider using them,

896
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,804
and if you did, why you discarded them in the end?

897
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:45,285
Yeah, we're looking at a,

898
00:57:45,605 --> 00:57:48,127
so the question is about like image tracking technologies

899
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:50,828
and what we considered.

900
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:58,660
Initial launch phase, we were targeting devices that were pretty old,

901
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,581
and that's because we wanted that accessibility.

902
00:58:01,661 --> 00:58:05,922
So, like our target device was I think a Nexus 4 on the Android side,

903
00:58:06,002 --> 00:58:08,823
and like an iPhone, a low-end iPhone.

904
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:12,285
So that's like two, three generations back.

905
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:16,466
So that kind of limited what we could really do with the game.

906
00:58:16,766 --> 00:58:16,846
And...

907
00:58:21,854 --> 00:58:25,236
Because of the importance of that immersion

908
00:58:25,356 --> 00:58:27,438
and augmented reality to our titles,

909
00:58:27,778 --> 00:58:34,143
we are heavily investing in various AR technologies

910
00:58:34,203 --> 00:58:37,706
out there and looking at solutions very carefully

911
00:58:37,786 --> 00:58:40,549
and talking to partners and stuff like that.

912
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,213
We're pretty optimistic that AR is really,

913
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:49,698
has a bright future, even relative to VR.

914
00:58:49,778 --> 00:58:53,882
So that's where we'll keep taking a close look at.

915
00:58:54,903 --> 00:58:55,124
Thank you.

916
00:58:55,204 --> 00:58:57,266
I think I'm way over time.

917
00:58:57,286 --> 00:59:00,810
So maybe last couple of questions.

918
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:07,472
Your game is very rooted in a lot of pretty technical stuff.

919
00:59:07,613 --> 00:59:08,993
Can you talk about some of the challenges

920
00:59:09,093 --> 00:59:10,854
of working on a product that really had

921
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:13,176
these tech barriers that you had to cross

922
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:14,596
to be able to create something?

923
00:59:16,057 --> 00:59:18,118
Sorry, tech barriers?

924
00:59:18,339 --> 00:59:18,939
Yeah.

925
00:59:21,902 --> 00:59:28,788
Yeah, I mean, I think the main aspect regarding technical challenges for us was given how

926
00:59:28,868 --> 00:59:29,989
small our team was.

927
00:59:30,009 --> 00:59:34,193
I think when we spun out from Google, we were barely like 30 people.

928
00:59:35,353 --> 00:59:41,035
So you can imagine trying to tackle a project like Pokemon Go with a pretty small crew.

929
00:59:41,055 --> 00:59:47,297
So a lot of, at least from my side of things, a lot of the technical challenges had to do with

930
00:59:47,357 --> 00:59:53,059
how do you take very few people and just really maximize and amplify their contribution.

931
00:59:53,879 --> 01:00:09,967
So again, having tech artists who can write scripts and tools and Unity widgets that speeds up the artist was really crucial to where we ended up being able to get to.

932
01:00:12,048 --> 01:00:16,030
the character pipeline, I think we easily doubled the speed

933
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:19,592
of shading, kind of tuning that was happening

934
01:00:19,732 --> 01:00:23,393
just from a few days worth of tech artists

935
01:00:23,513 --> 01:00:25,134
like writing helper tools.

936
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:28,736
So that was kind of the main example

937
01:00:28,816 --> 01:00:30,216
of some of the technical challenges

938
01:00:30,256 --> 01:00:32,017
that we had to solve on our side.

939
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:34,918
And then there were the optimization stuff

940
01:00:34,938 --> 01:00:36,819
that I mentioned already with the mobile.

941
01:00:38,014 --> 01:00:44,317
data, you know, we were cognizant of like other countries where mobile data is pretty expensive, so

942
01:00:45,338 --> 01:00:48,079
we tried our best to kind of minimize

943
01:00:48,759 --> 01:00:49,840
the data usage there.

944
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,480
Thank you. Thanks.

945
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:52,796
Hi.

946
01:00:53,176 --> 01:00:55,178
Hey, I'll ask one last quick question.

947
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,921
So you guys have had a lot of really awesome, positive

948
01:00:58,961 --> 01:00:59,522
impacts.

949
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,726
I'm curious, are you guys thinking about developing,

950
01:01:03,746 --> 01:01:07,209
and maybe more as a personal thing for you or Niantic,

951
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:10,071
but are you trying to make games that are

952
01:01:10,091 --> 01:01:11,232
going to continue to do that?

953
01:01:11,532 --> 01:01:13,574
Or do you want to create games that create more communities?

954
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:15,696
Are you focusing on health and fitness?

955
01:01:15,816 --> 01:01:17,558
Or some of the really incredible stuff

956
01:01:17,578 --> 01:01:18,859
about marriages and things.

957
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:28,358
Sure, so the question is will Niantic continue to build games that have a positive social and world impact?

958
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,519
Absolutely.

959
01:01:32,612 --> 01:01:38,957
are talking to many IP or potential partners.

960
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:43,980
And Niantic, we really do want to make our platform

961
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,862
kind of the go-to place where game developers

962
01:01:46,922 --> 01:01:50,624
can take their amazing idea, like I said earlier,

963
01:01:50,745 --> 01:01:53,667
real-world version of something and kind of.

964
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:58,797
build an amazing experience that we even haven't begun to

965
01:01:58,998 --> 01:02:04,421
imagine yet. So I think the potential is huge and hopefully

966
01:02:05,281 --> 01:02:07,122
we'll continue to be able to execute on that.

967
01:02:07,863 --> 01:02:09,103
Thank you. It was a great talk.

968
01:02:09,364 --> 01:02:10,024
Thank you very much.
