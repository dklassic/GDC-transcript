1
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:09,947
All right, let's get started.

2
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:12,028
Thanks for coming.

3
00:00:12,648 --> 00:00:14,409
Quick reminders, please silence your cell phones

4
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:15,930
and no video recording.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,692
This hour-long talk is split into two halves

6
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:19,892
by me and Robert Yang.

7
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:21,954
So we have separate evaluation forms.

8
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:24,575
If you didn't get beeped on the way in,

9
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:25,916
like if you stayed from the last talk,

10
00:00:26,256 --> 00:00:28,758
if you can go get beeped, that would be great.

11
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:30,399
You'll get the evaluation form.

12
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:31,960
Please fill them out,

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,241
because your feedback is important to us.

14
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:35,762
My name is David Shaver,

15
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:36,983
and I'm a game designer at Naughty Dog.

16
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:39,343
Before that, I was at Respawn Entertainment,

17
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:40,664
Shell Games, and Zynga.

18
00:00:41,364 --> 00:00:43,224
I've been in the industry for almost 11 years

19
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:44,704
and worked on lots of different games,

20
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:46,245
the most recent you can see here.

21
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:49,506
I started out as a game programmer

22
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:51,286
and switched to game and level design.

23
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,887
Years ago, this very workshop helped

24
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:56,767
me realize my love of design and helped with that transition.

25
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:01,208
Now, this talk is about how to guide players naturally

26
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:03,629
with your level layout and how to minimize

27
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,629
the reliance on HUD markers and forced camera

28
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,490
moves and all that stuff.

29
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:08,792
It's the talk that I wish someone would have given me

30
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:10,914
years ago, because it really would have saved a lot of time.

31
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:14,056
Speaking of saving time, this talk is jam-packed,

32
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:15,157
so this overview's quick.

33
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:18,279
Part one, guiding players with block mesh layouts with me,

34
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,181
and part two, Robert will be talking about level lighting.

35
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:21,842
Let's go.

36
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:24,864
First up, let's get all on the same page.

37
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:26,986
What the heck is block mesh?

38
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:30,528
Well, at Naughty Dog, we call levels built

39
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,430
with simple geometry and textures block mesh.

40
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,711
Unfortunately, our industry hasn't arrived

41
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:35,832
at a single term at this yet.

42
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:38,623
They also call it gray box and white box

43
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:39,483
and all kinds of things.

44
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:41,923
Mostly, I prefer block mesh because it

45
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:43,704
includes color and lighting, which

46
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:45,604
are very important when playtesting layouts,

47
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,144
since they help guide players.

48
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:50,625
Also, handing off colored block meshes to your artists

49
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:52,125
make it a lot easier to communicate

50
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,846
the kinds of textures and colors you had in mind.

51
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,007
Green floor, it's probably grass.

52
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,307
Brown, it's probably dirt.

53
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:02,748
Now let's look at a common level design process at a game

54
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:03,088
studio.

55
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:06,023
First, you need to establish the context and constraints

56
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:06,503
of your level.

57
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:09,085
This includes things like the environment type,

58
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:11,266
the time of day, location in the story,

59
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:14,067
available character abilities, enemy types, all that stuff.

60
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,868
You should decide on the game plan narrative beats, too.

61
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:19,570
Once you have your requirements and beats,

62
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,951
dive right into building a rough version of the entire level

63
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:25,372
so that you can get a sense of pacing and scale.

64
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,214
Be sure to stub in those game plan narrative beats, too.

65
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:31,675
Get something playable quickly, and then watch other people

66
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:31,975
play it.

67
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,097
There's no need for a formal play test or anything.

68
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:36,899
You can just grab anybody, because the feedback

69
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,760
that you get from them is going to change a block mesh.

70
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,682
Repeat this iteration loop until you basically run out of time.

71
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:45,643
And once you run out of time, your layout's locked,

72
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:47,084
and you hand it off to the rest of the team

73
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:48,005
to make it look amazing.

74
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,686
But your job isn't done yet.

75
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:51,887
Your task at this stage is to ensure

76
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:54,228
that your design goals mesh with their artistic goals.

77
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,890
So keep play testing, and work with your artists

78
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,111
to ensure that it still plays great with the real art.

79
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,192
Now, it's worth noting that every studio

80
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:02,013
has a different process.

81
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:04,519
but this core iteration loop is universal.

82
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,100
So now let's get to the block mesh tips.

83
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,521
Now, our game director Kurt told me

84
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:11,763
that tips wasn't a strong enough word for how important

85
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,663
these are, so I'm going to rename them now

86
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:15,164
to guidance principles.

87
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:18,466
So first up, we have affordance.

88
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,968
One of the most powerful ways to guide players

89
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,549
is by using affordances, which are properties of an object

90
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,310
that define its possible uses and make clear

91
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,131
how it should be used.

92
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:30,812
A classic example is a door handle.

93
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:33,439
Just by looking at a push bar or a pull handle,

94
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,700
you intuit whether or not to push or pull the door

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,420
as you approach.

96
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,580
Ladders afford climbing.

97
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:41,361
Edges also afford climbing.

98
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:45,902
Ramps afford jumping off or smashing through a vent

99
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:46,822
in Wolfenstein II.

100
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:49,143
Affordances depend on your game rules

101
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:50,963
because that's what they're communicating to the player.

102
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:54,384
So for our game designers, affordance

103
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:57,465
is a great way to communicate to the player what they can interact

104
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,545
with or where they can go.

105
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:00,749
Players will learn what is interactive,

106
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:02,770
and it will attract them towards these affordances.

107
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:06,553
Consistent color and shape establish a trust contract

108
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:09,454
with players who use these to learn your game rules.

109
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,416
You should ensure that all of your affordances

110
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:13,837
work consistently throughout the game,

111
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:15,738
or it breaks that trust contract, which

112
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:16,978
will cause player frustration.

113
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,180
You should also include affordances

114
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,361
in your block mesh phase.

115
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,482
It'll help guide players where you want them to go.

116
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:24,823
So let's see what it looks like.

117
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:30,486
So in this block mesh, it's not clear where the player should go next.

118
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,710
Sure, the ladder affords climbing up the little tower, but then what?

119
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,531
Jump to the cliff, dive in the water?

120
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:39,275
But if we add some affordances, it becomes clear where to go.

121
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:42,098
The boards on the roof afford jumping to the cliff,

122
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:45,661
while the edge grabs on the cliffs afford climbing.

123
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:48,644
Of course, this example is tailor-made for Uncharted,

124
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,268
but the game's same concepts will apply to your traversal mechanics.

125
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:54,894
It may seem silly to add them so early,

126
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,075
but trust me, it makes a world of difference

127
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:58,396
in how your playtests go,

128
00:04:58,616 --> 00:04:59,857
and it doesn't take that much effort.

129
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:01,619
And one more thing.

130
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:05,662
Ensure these affordances use consistent shape and color.

131
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,183
Follow the game metrics,

132
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:09,565
and you empower your team with this information.

133
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:11,606
They could even be prefab objects

134
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,627
that the whole team can use.

135
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,110
Next tip, denying affordance.

136
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,352
While affordances are important

137
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:21,133
at showing the player what they can interact with,

138
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:23,984
Showing them what they cannot interact with is also important.

139
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:25,905
This is denying affordance,

140
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:28,225
and it prevents player frustration and guides them.

141
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:32,547
Now, you can't just disable a ladder or place an invisible wall.

142
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:35,108
I mean, you can, but you shouldn't,

143
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,928
because it's frustrating to players.

144
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,029
So, you need to contextualize why you can't use the affordance

145
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,430
by adding clearly visible things that say,

146
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,051
can't use this, or don't go there.

147
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,972
Also, make sure the reason for denied affordance

148
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:50,112
is clear in your block mesh.

149
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:54,780
At Naughty Dog, we record when a playtester tries to jump

150
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,742
and grab something that they can't grab.

151
00:05:57,282 --> 00:06:00,245
We call these bad jumps and overlay them as red spheres

152
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:02,507
in the game so that we can identify problem areas.

153
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:05,210
Often, we'll find something that looks climbable

154
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,271
but isn't supposed to be.

155
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,713
So we'll cover it with foliage or something,

156
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:11,296
and after the next playtest, those bad jumps will be gone.

157
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,458
Like sanding down a piece of wood,

158
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:15,860
this process makes the levels play smoother.

159
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:19,629
Here's an example of using spiky shapes

160
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:21,470
and breaking up the horizontal edge

161
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,751
to deny climbing affordance.

162
00:06:23,972 --> 00:06:26,193
Even though the window is within climbing range,

163
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:28,715
you still can't grab it because it's visually blocked.

164
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:31,217
Notice how this is contextualized

165
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:33,338
to the environment with bricks and rebar.

166
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,740
This is important for games grounded in reality.

167
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:40,203
For games not so grounded, you can get away with a lot,

168
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:41,003
and that's okay.

169
00:06:41,964 --> 00:06:43,985
Just find the right tone and context for your world

170
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,086
to make it feel natural and still deny affordance.

171
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:47,956
Now let's see some block mesh.

172
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,957
Let's say that we want the player to go through the window

173
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,557
on the right, which is busted open.

174
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,378
The left window is covered with a bush,

175
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,740
and the front porch window and door are blocked with boards.

176
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,581
Most players will glance at this house

177
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:04,421
and go right for that window in a play test.

178
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:06,342
The intended way forward is open,

179
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:09,003
while the rest of the entrance affordances are denied.

180
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,984
Next tip, shape language.

181
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,205
Establishing a consistent shape language.

182
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,562
communicates affordance and guides players.

183
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,764
Climbing edges in Uncharted are always horizontal and flat.

184
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:26,106
As a player, you learn this visual language

185
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:29,648
of Ford's climbing, and you can spot it easily.

186
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:33,249
Also, people tend to have emotional associations

187
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:35,650
with certain types of primitive shapes, which

188
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,031
is even common across cultures.

189
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:42,534
We can use this to our advantage to guide players toward or away

190
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:43,374
from certain shapes.

191
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:46,235
Round shapes tend to be viewed as non-threatening.

192
00:07:46,543 --> 00:07:47,743
There's nothing to stab you with.

193
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:51,484
Rectangular shapes are viewed as stable and trustworthy,

194
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:52,925
like a shelter.

195
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:56,406
And diagonal shapes are viewed as aggressive and dangerous,

196
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:57,106
like a spear.

197
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:00,647
Now let's take a look at a screenshot from Uncharted

198
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,528
The Lost Legacy and highlight the shapes.

199
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:07,269
As you can see, the spiky shapes feel a little bit uncomfortable,

200
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,510
possibly causing you to want to avoid those areas.

201
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,051
The round areas aren't a threat, and they actually provide stealth.

202
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:16,426
And the square shapes are combat cover or buildings,

203
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:17,347
nice and stable.

204
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:20,128
All of this subtly guides the player to the buildings.

205
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:22,310
Now let's see what it looks like in block mesh.

206
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,612
Let's say we want the players to go to the right,

207
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:29,194
and they're being chased, so exploration will wreck pacing.

208
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:31,315
The path sort of leads there,

209
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,056
but some players may veer to the left.

210
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:34,937
So how can we gently nudge them to the right?

211
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:37,959
First, let's add some spiky trees

212
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:40,100
and some other pine trees that angle toward the goal.

213
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,281
Then we'll add some round bushes.

214
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:45,428
Finally, we'll add a small building.

215
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:46,929
And I'm not going to lie, at this point,

216
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:47,589
I kind of feel like this.

217
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,350
But with a lot less hair.

218
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,091
All right, let's highlight the shapes we just added.

219
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:58,332
The spiky shapes say danger, and they discourage going there.

220
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:01,753
The square building implies, hey, stability is this way.

221
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:04,414
The round stepping stones on the ground

222
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:06,355
act as breadcrumbs to that stability.

223
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:08,796
And the round bushes kind of act as bumpers

224
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:10,116
to frame the play space.

225
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:12,597
Of course, none of this prevents the player

226
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:13,577
from going wherever they want.

227
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,848
It just gently guides them where they should go.

228
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:18,730
Next tip, color language.

229
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:22,833
When you're trying to establish a consistent visual language

230
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:25,514
in your affordances, shape is only half of it.

231
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:27,896
You also need a consistent color as well.

232
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:32,419
Adding color provides valuable context

233
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,000
for an otherwise barren block mesh.

234
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:36,522
It also adds depth if you're making a 3D game.

235
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:40,405
Coloring also speeds up collaboration with your team,

236
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:43,186
because at a glance, they can get it without explanation.

237
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,357
Is the ground supposed to be dirt, lava, water?

238
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:50,638
Now Naughty Dog is notorious for using contrasting colors

239
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:52,298
to draw the eye to where you should go.

240
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,199
Here we have a bright yellow sign and rail,

241
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,040
and it subtly lets the player know where to put the plank.

242
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,580
Most people won't question why only one rail is yellow.

243
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,081
They'll just remember that they intuitively knew where to go.

244
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:07,742
Here we have white climbable edges.

245
00:10:08,802 --> 00:10:09,882
And here are some more edges.

246
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:11,262
But wait, these are green.

247
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:12,663
I thought you said to be consistent.

248
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:15,486
Well, it's not a single color that's important.

249
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:18,247
It's using consistent color and shapes

250
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:19,927
in the context of the environment.

251
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:22,028
Try to blend them into the environment

252
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:24,529
so it looks natural but still stands out.

253
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:27,429
Let's see how color can age a block mesh.

254
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:29,490
Here we have a gray box.

255
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,530
It's not really clear where the player should go

256
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,831
or where they even can go.

257
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:36,251
Affordances are gray and they're hard to see.

258
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,512
Also, what kind of environment is this?

259
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:39,112
A desert?

260
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,112
An icy planet?

261
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,592
First, let's add color to the affordances

262
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,574
so that you can see them in the path forward, sort of.

263
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:48,696
But we're still missing the context.

264
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:49,577
What is this place?

265
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:51,178
You know, everything blends together.

266
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:52,719
Boom.

267
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,582
We add color to the top of the blocks,

268
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:57,704
and suddenly you're in a grassy, mountainous area

269
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,705
with water down below.

270
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,247
As you can see, adding color to your block mesh

271
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,810
helps contextualize the level to the players and the teammates.

272
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,752
And to further ground this on Earth, let's add some props.

273
00:11:09,454 --> 00:11:09,634
OK.

274
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:10,475
Now.

275
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,381
Color is important, but it shouldn't be the only thing that you rely on

276
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:14,961
because some players are colorblind.

277
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:17,142
You should combine color with other techniques,

278
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:21,863
like unique shapes and using contrasting color values rather than hues.

279
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:25,124
Bonus points if you can get colorblind playtesters or teammates

280
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:27,925
to help identify problems and make your game more accessible.

281
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,406
Next tip, landmarks.

282
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,848
There she is. That's our building.

283
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,148
There's the tower.

284
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,783
Here's the bridge, that's our way out of here.

285
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,045
Ever wonder why game characters spend so much time pointing

286
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:46,965
at things in the distance?

287
00:11:48,226 --> 00:11:49,246
Well, that's because they're landmarks,

288
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:51,327
and they're a great way to orient players in your world.

289
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:54,348
A landmark is basically just a big object

290
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,669
that can be seen from far away and from different vantage

291
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:56,989
points.

292
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,390
If used correctly, players will see this object

293
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,951
over and over as they get closer to it

294
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:02,831
to let them know they're headed in the right direction.

295
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:06,653
Landmarks also act as a goal for the player to work toward.

296
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,193
They're also called weenies.

297
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,902
If you want to know more about that, just Google Disney and weenies.

298
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:13,382
Don't worry, it's safe for work.

299
00:12:14,302 --> 00:12:14,783
Probably.

300
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:17,403
Depends if your safe search is off.

301
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:18,964
All right, check this out.

302
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:22,045
Zelda, the Breath of the Wild really goes nuts with the landmarks.

303
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:25,045
In just this one shot, there are several visible all in a row,

304
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,646
and they're not overlapping one another.

305
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:29,487
They also have unique silhouettes, so you don't confuse them,

306
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:30,867
which is also a great tip.

307
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:33,588
Try to have unique silhouettes for things in your game,

308
00:12:33,808 --> 00:12:35,768
so that players can distinguish them at a glance.

309
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:37,829
All right, block mesh time.

310
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,637
Let's add a landmark to this block mesh.

311
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:45,898
It's pretty basic, but it can have a huge impact

312
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,019
on drawing the player toward a certain direction.

313
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:51,400
If I'm working with a landmark, I like to add it first

314
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,161
and then build the level backwards from there.

315
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:55,342
That way I can always see it in the distance

316
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:56,582
and shape the level accordingly.

317
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,123
Next tip, openings attract.

318
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:01,524
Caves, doors, et cetera,

319
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:03,305
they all seem to attract people toward them.

320
00:13:04,445 --> 00:13:06,506
These openings often lead to a refuge space,

321
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,326
which psychologically feels safe.

322
00:13:09,757 --> 00:13:11,579
Openings also have an air of mystery about them,

323
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,160
and people want to see what's inside.

324
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:15,522
This attraction happens in the real world

325
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:18,084
with hobbies like spelunking and urban exploration.

326
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:21,887
Here in Titanfall 2, a ramp affords

327
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:24,529
jumping to a nicely lit opening that begs to be explored.

328
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,651
This underwater opening lets you know

329
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:29,353
that there's something beyond it if you swim for it.

330
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:32,475
It even works in block worlds.

331
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:34,137
As soon as I saw this, I went right for it.

332
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,844
Doors and archways also draw you inside,

333
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:39,705
even though an archway may not have a roof above it.

334
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:43,688
When adding openings to block mesh,

335
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,750
it's important to have different colors

336
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,471
for interior and exterior walls.

337
00:13:48,352 --> 00:13:49,973
Here we have a cool white exterior

338
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,134
and a warm yellow interior.

339
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,796
This helps players read depth in your block mesh.

340
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:55,938
If they're the same color, it's hard to tell

341
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:57,099
that it's even an opening.

342
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,742
Also, communicate this design intent to your artist

343
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:02,603
to ensure that they know that this is an entrance

344
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:03,984
and that it needs to stand out.

345
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:08,020
Next tip, gates and valves.

346
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:10,121
Terrible joke.

347
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:12,062
All right, no, not those gates and valves,

348
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:13,383
the kind that make way more money.

349
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:15,103
We want the level design kind.

350
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:18,905
Gates stop progress until some sort of conditions are met.

351
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,366
You've killed all the enemies,

352
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,366
you've moved the debris out of the way, et cetera.

353
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,087
Valves are the opposite.

354
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:25,728
They let players move forward,

355
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,329
and then they slam the door shut behind them

356
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:28,469
so they can't get backtrack.

357
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,711
In this scenario, we want the player to enter the combat space

358
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,152
and be trapped until combat's over.

359
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,848
We have a valve into the space and then a gate at the other end blocking them so they can't leave.

360
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:45,250
Once they enter, the gates and valves reduce the possibility space of the world to just the combat zone.

361
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,591
Also, there's less mentally to keep track of so players can focus on the task at hand.

362
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:57,233
It may look like this is only useful in linear games, but open world games can use it too with scenarios like arena battles.

363
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:02,195
The Halo series did a great job of having big open levels that gated and valved players when needed.

364
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,370
Now, gates are pretty straightforward.

365
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,351
There's something in your way, and you need to clear it.

366
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:10,251
So I'll focus on valves, which can be a little more nuanced.

367
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:12,472
In this valve example, you drop down,

368
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:13,512
and you can't get back up.

369
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,458
A fairly famous valve is in Super Metroid.

370
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:35,294
where an entire chunk of level acts like a valve.

371
00:15:35,914 --> 00:15:38,016
At some point, the player falls down this really long shaft,

372
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:38,896
and there's no way back up.

373
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:42,479
They're stuck, and the vast possibility space of the game

374
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:45,000
is reduced to a tiny portion as seen on the map.

375
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:48,682
In this space, they find two critical items, the high jump

376
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:49,543
boots and the ice beam.

377
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:52,705
And they learn to freeze enemies and then jump off of them

378
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,926
so that they can use it to escape the shaft.

379
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:57,748
The shaft that was once a valve has now

380
00:15:57,788 --> 00:15:59,209
become a gate that needs to be overcome.

381
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:01,712
Given the entire world to explore,

382
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,754
they may have never discovered this ability.

383
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:06,576
Next tip, leading lines.

384
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:09,558
Leading lines are a composition technique

385
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,320
where lines in the environment draw the eye

386
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,801
to a specific place in the scene.

387
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,664
In this photo, the logs dry the eye up and into the frame

388
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:18,045
to finally rest on the house.

389
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:21,268
In games, these are often things like roads and pipes

390
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:22,589
and cables and all sorts of stuff.

391
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,411
Here in Titanfall 2, we wanted the player

392
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,373
to focus on this door and not miss the reveal

393
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:27,953
of a new enemy.

394
00:16:28,964 --> 00:16:31,085
Pipes and floor grates form leading lines to the door.

395
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,368
And when you get close, a stalker rips the door open

396
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:35,269
for a grand reveal.

397
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,512
Here in the block mesh is a hallway with a T-junction

398
00:16:39,552 --> 00:16:39,952
at the end.

399
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:42,895
Let's say you wanted the player to go to the right again.

400
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:44,996
Right now, it's a coin toss.

401
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:48,519
They may turn left, see a locked door and turn around,

402
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,261
or they may smoothly go to the right and enter the next area.

403
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:53,743
By adding some leading lines, though,

404
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:55,365
we can draw their attention to the right

405
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:57,106
and increase the chances they'll go there.

406
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:01,095
Pipes on the walls and rug guide the player down the hallway.

407
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:04,937
But the pipes on the left stop while the pipes on the right

408
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:06,878
go along around the corner, drawing the eye.

409
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:10,940
The caution cones break up the red line of the rug going left.

410
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:15,542
And to go over the top, we add a big, bright yellow cable

411
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:18,284
that hugs the right side and goes along around the corner.

412
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:21,205
Just some simple shapes, but it can have a huge impact

413
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:23,206
on smooth navigation in your play tests.

414
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:25,227
Next tip, pinching.

415
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:28,905
Pinching basically means your layout funnels the player

416
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:29,845
to a specific spot.

417
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:33,166
You accomplish this by blocking off areas and angling shapes

418
00:17:33,206 --> 00:17:35,767
to naturally flow to that spot.

419
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:38,228
It's good for redirecting players to a specific area.

420
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:40,829
And it's also a great way to set up a cool reveal,

421
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,490
like the view of a landmark, without forcing

422
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,490
the camera to look at it.

423
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:46,831
If you pinch them to a specific spot,

424
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:48,672
the camera will be naturally pointed

425
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:49,772
at the thing you want them to see.

426
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:53,374
Wrong slide.

427
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:53,514
OK.

428
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:54,254
There we go.

429
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,642
Of course, all of this completely depends on your mobility mechanics.

430
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,883
It's much easier to do this in a game where players are stuck on the ground

431
00:18:01,143 --> 00:18:03,444
than in something like Titanfall where they're flying all over the place.

432
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:05,305
Let's look at an example.

433
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:08,967
Here, the buses and cars are angled to a specific spot,

434
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:10,948
which you can see highlighted here.

435
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:16,651
Walking down the street, the shapes naturally bring you to the end of the pinch,

436
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:18,672
which faces the way forward.

437
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:21,033
Let's see it in action.

438
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:25,658
In this video, the pinch lines up a perfect shot of the hospital in the distance, which is your goal,

439
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:27,379
and the tunnel that takes you there.

440
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,831
Next tip, framing and composition.

441
00:18:44,472 --> 00:18:46,473
Another technique borrowed from photography.

442
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:51,457
By framing your subject, be it a landmark, a big enemy, or a cave opening, you draw attention to it.

443
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,448
If you'd like to learn more, just Google some photography

444
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,310
composition techniques, you'll find lots of stuff.

445
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:00,155
This one's really useful when combined with pinching

446
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:01,918
to set up an important reveal on the level.

447
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,521
After you pinch the player to a specific spot,

448
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:07,845
perfectly frame the object for maximum effect.

449
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:09,367
Let's see it in action.

450
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:21,213
As you saw, the player is naturally pointed at the dam,

451
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,815
and due to good framing, it was the dominant thing on screen.

452
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:27,476
Also, a side tip, people's eyes are drawn to detail,

453
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:28,857
and the dam is very detailed.

454
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,198
All of this with just some layout

455
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,359
and no forced camera moves.

456
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,560
All right, next tip, breadcrumbs.

457
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,941
Aw, yes.

458
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,702
Breadcrumbs lead the player a little piece

459
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:41,623
at a time to the goal.

460
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,644
They can be almost anything,

461
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:44,844
chunks of stuff on the ground,

462
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:48,266
pickup items, enemies, lit areas, et cetera.

463
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:51,686
It's usually better to add breadcrumbs to your block mesh

464
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,686
after the early play tests, because they

465
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,907
can hide fundamental layout guidance problems.

466
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,508
But if you still need them after a few revisions,

467
00:19:58,548 --> 00:19:59,588
don't feel bad about adding them.

468
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,009
In this example, the bits on the fence and roof

469
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,410
create a visual stepping stones to the ledge.

470
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,951
In Destiny 2, these panels guide the player into the tunnel.

471
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,932
Now, if your game has pickups, they're

472
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:15,732
a classic way to breadcrumb players around the level.

473
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,170
Like how many times have you played a Mario game

474
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,871
and the coins led you to a new area?

475
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:23,912
Pickups are also great for letting players know they're on the right path

476
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:25,573
in a cluttered or maze-like environment.

477
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:28,474
This one's placed next to an area that you can duck under,

478
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:30,315
which some players forget they can even do,

479
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:32,935
so it subtly hints, yep, you're going the right way.

480
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:35,997
So to go back to this house,

481
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:39,398
let's say only half the players during our last playtest went into the house,

482
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:40,858
and the other half got lost.

483
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:44,960
Let's add some rocks and boards as breadcrumbs leading to the window.

484
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:47,571
Notice how the boards are angled toward the window,

485
00:20:47,671 --> 00:20:48,612
creating leading lines.

486
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:52,413
You can also sprinkle these breadcrumbs in open world areas

487
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:53,973
to lead players to interesting things,

488
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:55,813
like the panels in the Destiny example.

489
00:20:57,394 --> 00:20:58,374
Next tip, textures.

490
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:02,115
You can use textures to subtly, or sometimes obviously,

491
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:03,015
point the way to a goal.

492
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:04,896
These can be just about anything.

493
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:08,076
Arrows, scrapes on the wall, signs, et cetera.

494
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:10,377
Here in Uncharted, The Lost Legacy,

495
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:13,238
scrape textures on the wall communicate affordance

496
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:14,198
that you can shimmy here.

497
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:17,400
This example leads to a secret area and a collectible.

498
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,642
So it's a good example that you don't need to do this

499
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:20,743
for just the main path.

500
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:23,345
Here in Uncharted 4,

501
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,288
these tire tracks on the rock

502
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:28,030
communicate a fordance that you can drive here.

503
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,651
Now when I played this game,

504
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,573
I didn't notice the tire tracks and I got lost.

505
00:21:32,614 --> 00:21:33,314
I didn't work on this game.

506
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:35,897
I worked on the next one.

507
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,520
Once I noticed the tire tracks, though,

508
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,102
the rest of it driving went totally smoothly.

509
00:21:42,504 --> 00:21:44,385
Signs literally point the way to the hospital,

510
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:45,345
which is also your goal.

511
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:48,527
These textures are often some of the last things added

512
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:50,568
when making a level, so it doesn't,

513
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,829
seems like it's not really gonna help your block mesh phase.

514
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:53,629
But guess what?

515
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:55,730
You don't need to wait for an artist to add them.

516
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,131
You can cheat, and you can build them out of block mesh

517
00:21:59,812 --> 00:22:00,572
for your play tests.

518
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:03,813
Here I've added an arrow and a sign to point the way.

519
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:07,035
And these scratch marks lead into the alley,

520
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:08,976
indicating something heavy was dragged back there.

521
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:10,316
And the best part?

522
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:12,237
These are all just block mesh.

523
00:22:13,585 --> 00:22:15,606
Labeling rooms and areas can be super helpful

524
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,646
for both linear and open games.

525
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:20,167
If you're building a school, for example,

526
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:22,468
having labels like gym and cafeteria

527
00:22:22,768 --> 00:22:24,609
provide valuable context and signposts

528
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:25,849
as your players explore.

529
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:29,671
I totally hit next.

530
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:30,611
All right.

531
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,873
Here I've pulled this away from the wall a bit

532
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:35,313
so you can see that it's just a bunch of blocks.

533
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,694
This stuff only takes a couple minutes to do

534
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:39,355
and it works wonders for your play tests

535
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:41,115
and also to communicate with your artist

536
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:42,336
where you think signage might go.

537
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:45,676
And I'm not going to lie, this one is so easy and simple,

538
00:22:45,856 --> 00:22:48,058
it's obvious, it kind of blew my mind when I learned it.

539
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:50,239
All right, next tip.

540
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,520
Movement.

541
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:54,262
Movement grabs the eye and the player's attention.

542
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:56,784
This can be anything that fits your game.

543
00:22:56,924 --> 00:23:00,167
Big scripted moments, birds, sparks, buddies, enemies,

544
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:02,889
and even just something flapping in the breeze.

545
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,711
Also, make good use of the direction of the movement.

546
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:08,673
The player's eye will follow the movement,

547
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:10,774
and it can draw an invisible line right

548
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:11,735
to where you want them to go.

549
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,091
In this example I'm about to show, the birds draw your attention to the left,

550
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:18,352
where there's this open trailer door.

551
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,632
And the trailer door is also banging in the wind.

552
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:23,033
Both of these things kind of subtly let you know,

553
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:24,734
like, hey, maybe you should check out what's inside.

554
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:40,679
And the dead body totally helps too.

555
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,168
Of course, adding movement in the block mesh phase

556
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:46,388
is highly dependent on your game and engine.

557
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,029
If you can, though, try to include them in your play tests.

558
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:51,470
Maybe not in the first ones, but definitely before you lock it

559
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,730
down.

560
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,630
And you don't have to get fancy.

561
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,031
You can have basic cubes just lurping through the sky

562
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:57,171
as a placeholder for birds.

563
00:23:58,632 --> 00:24:00,913
Now, adding movement is also super useful as a bandage

564
00:24:01,013 --> 00:24:03,953
late in development when the level is basically done,

565
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:05,254
but players are still getting lost.

566
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:07,774
Since the level itself is done, you

567
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,135
can script in some movement to help.

568
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:10,595
But don't rely on it, though.

569
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,072
like try to solve the player guidance problems

570
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:13,933
in the block mesh phase.

571
00:24:15,094 --> 00:24:17,435
Last tip, light and god rays, a.k.a.

572
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:18,876
light rays or sunbeams.

573
00:24:20,137 --> 00:24:22,900
Light and god rays are useful for guiding players to a goal.

574
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,361
People are naturally drawn to light sources,

575
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:27,363
and god rays point a line right at the goal.

576
00:24:28,504 --> 00:24:30,706
This is important even in the block mesh phase.

577
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:33,047
The Naughty Dog lighting artists begin very early.

578
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:38,391
In this example, the two lit areas are breadcrumb goals.

579
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:40,811
First the one with the bad guy in the middle,

580
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:42,052
and then the one at the top right.

581
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:45,212
Here we have some god rays coming out of a window.

582
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,173
They take up more screen space, so you're

583
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,233
more likely to notice them.

584
00:24:48,513 --> 00:24:49,953
And they draw the leading line straight

585
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:51,454
to the window, which is also the exit.

586
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:53,174
Also, notice that swordfish.

587
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:55,355
It is totally drawing an arrow right at the window.

588
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:58,015
So that's not lighting, but textures.

589
00:24:58,536 --> 00:25:00,056
So since my talk is about player guidance,

590
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,016
these light tips focus on that.

591
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,817
Robert's upcoming talk is about lighting a level,

592
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:06,017
so let's start wrapping it up.

593
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:08,038
But first, a bonus tip.

594
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:11,550
Ah, the squint test, so simple and majestic.

595
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:12,890
But what is it?

596
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,750
Well, it's basically an easy way to see

597
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,890
what stands out in your level.

598
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:19,791
Step one, squint your eyes and look at your game.

599
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:22,411
Step two, things will be blurry,

600
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:24,232
but what stands out from that blur?

601
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:26,412
A lit door, a bright yellow truck?

602
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:28,493
The things that are standing out are the things

603
00:25:28,513 --> 00:25:29,733
that players are gonna notice first.

604
00:25:30,193 --> 00:25:32,813
So step three, adjust your block mesh in your lighting

605
00:25:33,113 --> 00:25:34,694
so that the things that are popping out

606
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,314
are the things that you want them to see.

607
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,078
And here's a fun quote Matias gave me.

608
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,999
My professor used to say that squinting can replace

609
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:43,799
four years of art school.

610
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:46,400
Thanks for the quote.

611
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,940
Okay, let's see it in action before we wrap up.

612
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,320
Here's a shot from Titanfall 2.

613
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,081
Squint your eyes and take note of what stands out.

614
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:54,101
Go ahead, I'll give you a minute.

615
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:56,942
Squinting, are we good?

616
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,202
Squinting, got it?

617
00:25:58,382 --> 00:25:59,102
Okay, good.

618
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,483
You probably noticed the yellow walls

619
00:26:01,863 --> 00:26:03,903
and the waterfall and the orange cave opening.

620
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:06,427
The yellow walls are wall running paths

621
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,469
that draw leading lines straight to the cave.

622
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:10,871
And the waterfall uses movement and sound

623
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:13,453
to grab your attention, and it also helps frame the cave.

624
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:15,955
Openings attract, and the cave is lit

625
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:17,936
a totally different color from everything else in the scene.

626
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:20,298
OK, it's time to wrap it up.

627
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,180
But wait, there's more.

628
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:25,382
I want to tell you about hashtag Blocktober.

629
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:28,525
Last October, Michael Barkley at Naughty Dog tweeted this,

630
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:30,526
but in his awesome Scottish accent

631
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:31,647
that I am not going to attempt.

632
00:26:32,528 --> 00:26:33,508
What's up, level designers?

633
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:34,969
Level blockouts are art.

634
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,211
Hashtag Blocktober should be a thing.

635
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:39,413
The response was overwhelming.

636
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,856
Everyone from AAA devs to hobbyists participated.

637
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:45,318
Now I bring this up because it's important

638
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,759
to demystify game development

639
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:48,080
and encourage people to make things.

640
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:51,723
So many people didn't realize that the self-deprecating crap

641
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,384
that they were making looked exactly

642
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:55,226
like their favorite games early in development

643
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:56,927
and they were super inspired to keep going.

644
00:26:57,888 --> 00:26:59,330
Blocktober's happening again this year

645
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,771
and Mike created this Twitter account

646
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:02,372
to collect everything people make.

647
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,119
So follow it and get started now on your block meshes

648
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:05,779
for Blocktober.

649
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,000
If you like this talk,

650
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,840
check out these other links and books.

651
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,581
If you make multiplayer maps,

652
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:14,961
be sure to check out Elizabeth's talk from last year.

653
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:16,222
There's no need to write these down.

654
00:27:16,262 --> 00:27:18,302
I'll put all this up on my website after GDC.

655
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:20,323
It has some bonus tips at the end.

656
00:27:21,163 --> 00:27:22,284
Hopefully you found this talk useful,

657
00:27:22,404 --> 00:27:24,304
and I'll see your block meshes in Blocktober.

658
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:24,804
Thank you.

659
00:27:24,824 --> 00:27:27,665
Thank you.

660
00:27:27,685 --> 00:27:27,885
Thank you.

661
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:28,085
Thank you.

662
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:37,632
Okay, hi, this is the second half of the talk of Invisible Intuition.

663
00:27:38,113 --> 00:27:42,556
I'm Robert Yang. I'm a professor at the NYU Game Center.

664
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:46,558
If you want to know more what we're about, come visit us on the expo floor starting Wednesday.

665
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,382
And David just talked a lot about block mesh and gray boxing,

666
00:27:51,762 --> 00:27:55,705
not gray boxing, sorry, block mesh, just block meshing and geometry.

667
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:59,847
And in this talk, I want to focus kind of more on the lighting side of things,

668
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:04,148
because as David just said, at Naughty Dog, they actually start lighting really early.

669
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:09,509
So this is also kind of a dimensional level design that I think a lot of people are scared of

670
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,430
and want to avoid doing, and you shouldn't be scared about it.

671
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,991
So a little bit about me.

672
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:21,112
I'm mostly known for my gay culture video games.

673
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:23,872
Can I get a round of applause for gay sex?

674
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:36,354
Okay, no, stop, stop. It's not about that, perverts. This talk is kind of more about

675
00:28:37,274 --> 00:28:43,380
maybe how I light my gay video games, maybe, a little bit. And it's okay if you're not

676
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,724
cool enough to put gay sex in your game, but, you know, even if you're a straight person,

677
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:50,166
you can put lighting in your game, maybe.

678
00:28:53,248 --> 00:28:57,271
So in this talk, it's kind of aimed more for beginners

679
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:59,793
and intermediate level designers.

680
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,074
Although even if you're an experienced level designer,

681
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:04,356
maybe you don't think about lighting as much as you could.

682
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,497
So maybe it'll still be helpful for you.

683
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:11,061
We'll start with a more general discussion of lighting

684
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:13,342
and then get more and more specific

685
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:16,705
as the talk progresses until we end with how

686
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:20,067
to light a level with a more specific suggested workflow

687
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:22,749
that you can do in Unity or Unreal or whatever you use.

688
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:28,107
So first let's start with a brief history of light.

689
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,550
A very brief and simple history of light

690
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,371
might start with the sun, right?

691
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:38,132
The sun is really great, let's give it up now for the sun.

692
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:41,194
Although it's gonna rain a lot, I'm told,

693
00:29:41,294 --> 00:29:43,795
so you won't see much sun in the next few days.

694
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:48,197
There's also fire, controlled burning in gas lamps,

695
00:29:48,457 --> 00:29:50,298
incandescent light bulbs with filament

696
00:29:50,358 --> 00:29:51,719
and run current through the filament.

697
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:56,569
There's also a stronger focus these days on energy efficient light sources like

698
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,272
fluorescent lighting or LED lighting is also becoming more common.

699
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:07,276
And I think it's very tempting to think of this as a story about technology and

700
00:30:07,356 --> 00:30:12,380
progress and older light sources becoming obsolete or something.

701
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,423
But that's not exactly true, and I don't think that's exactly accurate.

702
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:20,325
Like the light bulb did not make the sun obsolete.

703
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:24,978
Right? Like you still like going outside and playing in the sun or whatever you do in the sun.

704
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,401
Um, I wouldn't, no, I'm a game developer. But, um,

705
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:32,484
the LED did not make the fire obsolete.

706
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:35,966
Right? Uh, you'll go to a restaurant and

707
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:39,589
maybe tonight and have a nice candle lit dinner or something

708
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:42,531
and the flickering candle,

709
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:47,795
it's really nice when that's actual fire, not one of those weird LED flickering things. Right?

710
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:57,204
So as a society, I think we still use fire as a light source, not necessarily as a task

711
00:30:57,485 --> 00:31:00,466
light source where you write letters by candlelight or something.

712
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,388
But it's still in our birthday candles, our campfires.

713
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:09,871
Fire hasn't disappeared, but our culture around fire has changed.

714
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:14,013
Fire used to be common, and now it's more like a special occasion kind of thing.

715
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,435
But it's still here in civilization.

716
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:22,305
So each of these light sources means something different and makes a space feel different,

717
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:27,126
and I urge you to pay attention to the different moods and atmospheres these different light

718
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:27,846
sources evoke.

719
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:37,468
And today, contemporary lighting design has been kind of heavily standardized and industrialized.

720
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:43,089
If you're a lighting designer and you're shopping for light fixtures or luminaires,

721
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,130
as they're called in Europe,

722
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:50,453
It's very common to, on the left right there, that's like a picture of like a lighting catalog.

723
00:31:51,193 --> 00:31:54,355
And the lighting catalog gives you all these different stats so you can kind of predict

724
00:31:54,435 --> 00:31:55,336
what the light will do.

725
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:59,798
And there's also usually often like a chart in that lower left.

726
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:02,019
I've blown up the chart on the right there.

727
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,441
And that's a light distribution curve chart.

728
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:09,023
And that kind of shows you how much light that light source or light fixture is going

729
00:32:09,043 --> 00:32:11,745
to throw at every given angle.

730
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:15,645
So notice this light bulb with that light distribution chart on the right.

731
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:20,129
It's kind of shaped like a heart a little bit and has like a crease at the top.

732
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:22,010
Well, that makes sense, right?

733
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,372
Because the light socket is on top.

734
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:27,094
It's not gonna throw light through the light socket.

735
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:27,915
That doesn't make sense.

736
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:30,257
So it's mainly throwing light downwards and to the right.

737
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:33,660
So now you know how to read a light distribution chart.

738
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,380
It's pretty easy.

739
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:42,776
So this is how real life lighting design quantifies and standardizes the physics of light.

740
00:32:43,356 --> 00:32:46,979
But in video games, light is often much messier than this.

741
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,624
So now I want to talk a little bit about what is game lighting and what do we mean by that.

742
00:32:55,866 --> 00:33:02,552
Light is a complex phenomenon that's hopefully elegant with like a unified theorem and all

743
00:33:02,592 --> 00:33:02,792
that.

744
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:09,212
all these phenomena like reflections, occlusion,

745
00:33:09,272 --> 00:33:12,513
translucence, shadows, all those happen in real life

746
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:14,654
like for free, so to speak.

747
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:19,356
But in video games, lighting is like a bunch of crap

748
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:22,877
in a box, we don't, it's just a bunch of random systems

749
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,738
that we like hack and tune together,

750
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:26,938
and we throw all that crap in a video game

751
00:33:26,978 --> 00:33:29,599
and then pray it'll look okay in the end.

752
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:32,760
So it's not a beautiful, elegant system,

753
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,601
it's just a bunch of random stuff.

754
00:33:35,469 --> 00:33:37,950
And to give you an idea of all that random stuff, right?

755
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,171
In any given game engine, there's

756
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:43,153
different cascading shadow maps, there's refraction shaders,

757
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:46,775
there's caustics, there's fog, there's glow sprites, HDR,

758
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,557
screen space ambient occlusion, bloom.

759
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:52,459
All these different things are all kind

760
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:54,380
of representing one system.

761
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,762
But in a video game, it's like 20 different systems, right?

762
00:33:58,363 --> 00:34:00,544
And we kind of just turn them on and turn them off

763
00:34:00,604 --> 00:34:02,285
on a case-by-case basis.

764
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:05,105
when you play a video game, maybe when you go in this room,

765
00:34:05,365 --> 00:34:09,387
that's when they turn on some screen space reflection.

766
00:34:09,707 --> 00:34:10,968
And then when you go in this other room,

767
00:34:10,988 --> 00:34:12,809
they turn off screen space reflection

768
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:15,030
to save on frame rate and optimize it and stuff.

769
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,712
And again, from a physics perspective,

770
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,733
that makes zero sense, right?

771
00:34:20,773 --> 00:34:23,934
The idea that you can turn off shadows in real life

772
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:28,377
makes no sense, because that would just be like,

773
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,017
you should go see a doctor if that happens.

774
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:30,818
That's not good.

775
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:36,129
So again, video games, we rely on this piecemeal approach

776
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:37,831
of all this random stuff together.

777
00:34:39,373 --> 00:34:41,495
So in this talk, I'm not going to be talking

778
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:43,256
about a lot of those effects.

779
00:34:43,377 --> 00:34:44,738
I'm going to be focusing on what I

780
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:48,382
view as the fundamentals of lighting in level design, which

781
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:50,944
are basically these four basic light types,

782
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:53,987
directional light, spotlight, ambient light, and point light.

783
00:34:57,033 --> 00:35:01,274
So let's say you're mocking up a level in Unity or something,

784
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:03,834
and you don't have any lights going on.

785
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,395
It's just a dark level, no lights there yet.

786
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:08,556
And I just have a bunch of blocks there.

787
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:13,277
So first you might add some ambient light.

788
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:17,178
Ambient light is a kind of default amount of light

789
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:18,418
you might add to a scene.

790
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:20,478
It refers to the whole scene.

791
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:21,258
It's global.

792
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:24,959
And you do that to make sure those shadows in your levels

793
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,200
aren't pitch black.

794
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:30,964
because in real life, very few things are just pitch black like that,

795
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:33,065
unless you're in a really dark cave or something.

796
00:35:33,285 --> 00:35:36,265
There's always a little bit of light bouncing around everywhere.

797
00:35:36,606 --> 00:35:39,806
So ambient light is kind of meant to simulate that a little bit.

798
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,307
But notice when we add ambient light,

799
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,367
that doesn't really help us read the shapes or anything.

800
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:47,508
It's still very flat, right?

801
00:35:48,168 --> 00:35:50,989
You still can't really see the shapes that well,

802
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,149
but you can just distinguish the silhouette.

803
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:57,190
So that's when you might add another light source.

804
00:35:57,611 --> 00:35:59,552
So here's a directional light.

805
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:01,793
Directional light is a global light source.

806
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:05,115
It illuminates the entire scene at once from one given

807
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:05,876
direction.

808
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:07,877
And it usually doesn't matter where

809
00:36:07,897 --> 00:36:09,398
you position a directional light,

810
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:10,839
depending on what tool you're using.

811
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:12,560
And now with the directional light,

812
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,041
you can read the shapes much more clearly,

813
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:17,403
because you add that directionality component

814
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:17,903
to it now.

815
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:20,165
And notice how everything pops out more.

816
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,712
In games, we usually use directional light,

817
00:36:22,812 --> 00:36:25,554
usually for sunlight or maybe moonlight or something.

818
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:28,816
Then we also have a spotlight.

819
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:31,198
If the scene is set at night, maybe you

820
00:36:31,218 --> 00:36:32,499
want to add some street lights.

821
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,302
For a street light, you might want to use a spotlight.

822
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:38,764
A spotlight throws light in a cone shape in a given direction

823
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:40,706
and from a given position.

824
00:36:40,786 --> 00:36:43,428
So here I'm using a spotlight as a down light

825
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:46,410
to emphasize this walkable floor area instead

826
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,931
of emphasizing something else.

827
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:53,383
And lastly, I want to talk about the point light.

828
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:55,724
The point light throws light in every direction.

829
00:36:56,164 --> 00:36:59,045
Some tool sets might call this an omnidirectional light,

830
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:01,265
or you can call it an omni light for short,

831
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,146
which makes it sound really cool, omni light.

832
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:08,247
But you imagine a point light as this invisible ball of light

833
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:11,208
that's just washing everything nearby with light.

834
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,908
So a point light, I think, is usually

835
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:16,509
really good at drawing attention to a focal point,

836
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:19,049
because it ends up creating kind of this hot spot

837
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:19,990
effect a little bit.

838
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:26,821
In contrast with a spotlight, right, it's not always clear where the spotlight is shining from,

839
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:30,843
especially if it's a spotlight like a floodlight shooting light across.

840
00:37:33,244 --> 00:37:36,546
And in practice, you should try to use all four lighting types at once

841
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:39,107
because they all can work together really well.

842
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,028
Ambient helps bring up the shadows.

843
00:37:41,308 --> 00:37:43,769
Directional light helps make those background buildings pop

844
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,431
and helps guide the main mood of the scene.

845
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:49,094
Then you also have a spotlight highlighting an area.

846
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,515
Then you also have a point light highlighting the streetlight.

847
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,916
And again, all this stuff works together, helps create depth.

848
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:59,938
It helps push a background and a foreground for your scene.

849
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,939
And that's good.

850
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:07,240
And with these light sources, I would

851
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,862
argue that they form a complete domain of lighting tools.

852
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:16,212
So stretching this gamut from like a global light source that affects

853
00:38:16,332 --> 00:38:20,615
everything to a local light source that only affects nearby things or a light

854
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:25,117
source that shines in one direction or all directions I feel like it's like a

855
00:38:25,157 --> 00:38:30,200
complete domain kind of. So the kind again that's why every 3d engine or

856
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,861
tool set usually has these light sources.

857
00:38:36,643 --> 00:38:40,806
So now we should talk a little bit about why we how we should use these light

858
00:38:40,826 --> 00:38:41,166
sources.

859
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:47,804
And I'm going to talk about a lighting theory called three-point lighting, which is a very

860
00:38:47,944 --> 00:38:54,566
common form of lighting design theory that's very common in film and photography.

861
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,528
So if you have a background in that, this will seem very familiar to you.

862
00:38:59,448 --> 00:39:03,110
Basic idea of three-point lighting is that you have three different light types.

863
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:08,005
And here's a diagram that hopefully explains some of it.

864
00:39:08,285 --> 00:39:11,087
In that top left, we have a combined composite

865
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:12,668
of three different light types.

866
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:15,590
But we can also break down what each light is doing

867
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,811
into a separate channel.

868
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:20,033
So that's what those other three smaller pictures are doing.

869
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:23,275
And in the top right, you have a key light.

870
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:25,756
The key light is kind of like your brightest light source.

871
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:29,699
And it kind of sets the dominant lighting angle and mood

872
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:31,760
for your scene or picture or image.

873
00:39:32,443 --> 00:39:34,804
Then in the bottom left, we have a fill light.

874
00:39:35,245 --> 00:39:37,585
A fill light helps brighten up the shadows,

875
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,866
kind of like the ambient light we were talking about before,

876
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:42,487
and helps fill in the darker parts.

877
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,968
Usually you want this at a lower intensity

878
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,009
than your key light.

879
00:39:47,149 --> 00:39:50,210
Then in the lower right, we have the rim light.

880
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,532
And it's also sometimes called a back light or a hair light,

881
00:39:54,572 --> 00:39:55,652
depending on what you're doing.

882
00:39:56,149 --> 00:40:00,451
And it illuminates your silhouette to help pop it out from the background very faintly.

883
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:04,154
Otherwise the hair might end up, or the top of the head might be blending in with the

884
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:04,634
background.

885
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:08,597
So notice they do some specular and stuff on top like that.

886
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:15,642
And a very common three-point kind of setup might end up looking a little bit like this.

887
00:40:16,603 --> 00:40:19,945
You have a key light and fill light, usually kind of at opposing angles.

888
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:24,488
Usually don't want them falling the same direction and position, because then that kind of defeats

889
00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:24,988
the purpose.

890
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:30,111
So usually you want fill and key to be at least different angles and positions.

891
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:36,993
And in film and photography, there's also often the background light, that optional light right there.

892
00:40:37,673 --> 00:40:43,496
The background light helps brighten the background to help get rid of any awkward shadows that come from the key and fill.

893
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:46,917
Remember, in real life, they can't just turn off shadows for the key and fill.

894
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:49,858
They actually have to have another light to get rid of that shadow.

895
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:58,865
And if you basically watch any movie, you can kind of break down any given film shot

896
00:40:59,286 --> 00:41:03,309
along these lines and try to see what all the different light sources are doing.

897
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:06,872
So these are some examples from a blog called Lighting Pixels.

898
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:11,236
You can see there's a key light, a fill light, and a rim light on that left.

899
00:41:11,896 --> 00:41:15,540
The key light is kind of coming from that top left of that image.

900
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,602
So then it kind of feels like sunlight, kind of.

901
00:41:19,484 --> 00:41:24,025
And everything in that image is kind of evenly illuminated too, so it seems very readable.

902
00:41:24,726 --> 00:41:28,587
Meanwhile, on the right, the key light is not coming from the top, right?

903
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:33,269
The key light is coming from below, which means it's probably not sunlight, unless these

904
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:36,350
people are like hanging upside down, that's probably not sunlight, right?

905
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:41,952
So to me, that means it's more like an artificial light source, maybe like a nice candle or

906
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:42,452
something.

907
00:41:42,973 --> 00:41:43,433
And when that...

908
00:41:43,855 --> 00:41:50,898
candles illuminating from Bama's face. I feel like that sets up a very different mood in the right image versus the left image, right?

909
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:53,740
the right image feels kind of more intimate and

910
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:00,303
Maybe even like romantic. I don't know what movie that's from. Maybe maybe they're breaking up or having a divorce

911
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:06,685
I don't know some some shit is going down in that right image, right? But in the left image zero shit, right?

912
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:09,326
It's very very nice and safe

913
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:17,786
And it's really important to note that with three-point lighting,

914
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:21,227
it's referring to three types of light sources.

915
00:42:21,487 --> 00:42:24,327
You don't always need to place three lights in every scene.

916
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:27,168
So, for example, in that film shot on the left,

917
00:42:27,428 --> 00:42:30,268
there's only two light sources there, a key light and a rim.

918
00:42:30,308 --> 00:42:34,709
There's no fill, and the right side of his face is left in shadow.

919
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:37,510
And that's OK if that's what you want to do with your lighting,

920
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,690
and that's the mood you want to create.

921
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,831
Same thing in that right image.

922
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:42,851
There's only one light source, just one key.

923
00:42:43,546 --> 00:42:47,447
to help kind of emphasize, I think, the extreme close-up and intimacy of that shot.

924
00:42:49,127 --> 00:42:53,188
So, again, it's just about what you want to do with your lights

925
00:42:53,248 --> 00:42:54,489
and what you want your lights to say.

926
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:58,070
So, here's another example.

927
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,311
I mean, Unity, say you want to light this hunky dude with three-point light theory.

928
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:06,912
The way I lit him, I had a key light kind of grazing him a little bit

929
00:43:06,972 --> 00:43:08,872
so I could catch some muscle definition.

930
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:13,920
And I had the fill light kind of a little off angle from there

931
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,241
because I still wanted to maintain the key,

932
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,622
but I wanted to soften how the shadows were hitting him.

933
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:22,905
If you see in the right, that's a variant

934
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:24,065
without the fill light.

935
00:43:24,105 --> 00:43:26,607
And without the fill light, I felt like his face

936
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,228
was too much in shadow, and I couldn't

937
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:29,288
read what was going on.

938
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:31,810
And if you're like a beginner level designer,

939
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:36,492
I would say most beginners forget to do the fill part.

940
00:43:36,921 --> 00:43:40,963
And if you're starting out, you should air on the side of more fill than less fill.

941
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:48,526
And then lastly, I have a rim light also kind of picking out the right side of his face there

942
00:43:48,546 --> 00:43:51,908
and help separating that from the background so you can read his features better.

943
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:58,471
And as for implementation, here I'm actually using three directional lights in Unity.

944
00:43:59,192 --> 00:44:02,813
but just with the layer mask set to just one layer

945
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:04,553
just for that object.

946
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:06,514
So it ends up being not that expensive

947
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:08,214
if you use the culling masks.

948
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:11,654
In Unreal, you can use a feature called light channels,

949
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,955
which kind of does the same thing.

950
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:16,215
It's super useful for isolating light sources for objects.

951
00:44:16,935 --> 00:44:19,316
But most games end up doing

952
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:21,696
just maybe one light source technically,

953
00:44:21,976 --> 00:44:24,116
with the key light might be your main directional light,

954
00:44:24,517 --> 00:44:28,297
but your fill might be ambient or spheric harmonics probes.

955
00:44:28,741 --> 00:44:32,903
and then your rim light might be Fresnel and reflection and stuff in your shader.

956
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:40,588
But I think there's one big problem with three-point light theory for games,

957
00:44:40,768 --> 00:44:42,609
especially in regards to level design,

958
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:46,912
and that is the fact that film and photography

959
00:44:47,092 --> 00:44:49,934
have a very tightly controlled camera perspective,

960
00:44:50,374 --> 00:44:53,776
but in video games, we often give camera control to the player.

961
00:44:54,496 --> 00:44:54,776
So...

962
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:13,894
If you were looking at this hunky dude and then you walk around and and admire the back of this hunky dude now the key light isn't a key light anymore because the viewing angle has changed now my rim light is like a key light now my fill light isn't visible or something I don't even know what's going on in that image anymore so.

963
00:45:15,175 --> 00:45:23,442
One big problem here is that we can't really know where the player is going to see this object which will affect how we compose our lighting.

964
00:45:25,378 --> 00:45:28,139
This is why a lot of 3D games I think end up vomiting

965
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,440
rim shaders and Fresnel effects everywhere

966
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,102
because they can't predict where the player is going to be looking at this object

967
00:45:34,182 --> 00:45:37,203
so they just spam Fresnel and rim everywhere

968
00:45:37,464 --> 00:45:40,705
so that there's always some rim action going on.

969
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:43,586
But, you know, that should be your last resort.

970
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:45,307
Let's try to be more subtle than that.

971
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:49,649
And I would argue the way you can be more subtle

972
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:53,031
is to think about how your level layout will facilitate

973
00:45:53,616 --> 00:45:55,797
the viewing angles for your subjects.

974
00:45:56,198 --> 00:45:58,459
And then you can light accordingly and use that

975
00:45:58,499 --> 00:45:59,560
as a framing device.

976
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,442
So your level layout is a lighting tool.

977
00:46:04,323 --> 00:46:07,745
You can suggest a view or frame a certain composition

978
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:11,047
just by having the player move through a hallway,

979
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:12,828
and that'll suggest an angle for them.

980
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:17,971
That's also why you need to do a little bit of block out

981
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:20,633
and block meshing before you do some lighting,

982
00:46:20,813 --> 00:46:22,054
so that you have an idea of where

983
00:46:22,094 --> 00:46:23,095
the player's going to be going.

984
00:46:26,607 --> 00:46:29,269
And lastly, I want to end with this section,

985
00:46:29,409 --> 00:46:30,889
how to light a level.

986
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,971
And I want to walk you through some steps

987
00:46:34,031 --> 00:46:36,712
that I would recommend you take with your own levels

988
00:46:36,993 --> 00:46:37,773
if you're starting out.

989
00:46:39,414 --> 00:46:41,455
This example will be in Unreal, but you can do it

990
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:42,595
in any engine, basically.

991
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:47,438
So first, you do your block out, or gray box,

992
00:46:47,498 --> 00:46:48,718
or whatever you want to call it.

993
00:46:49,063 --> 00:46:50,804
with just some basic real-time light.

994
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:52,866
If you're doing some light baking,

995
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:54,267
you don't want to do it at this stage

996
00:46:54,287 --> 00:46:56,028
because your level is constantly changing.

997
00:46:56,068 --> 00:46:57,269
You don't want to waste your time

998
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:59,531
spending an hour lighting a room

999
00:46:59,631 --> 00:47:01,572
and then you end up deleting that room or something.

1000
00:47:01,592 --> 00:47:02,693
Then you've wasted your time.

1001
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:04,915
So right here is when I recommend

1002
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:06,656
you just use some basic real-time light

1003
00:47:06,676 --> 00:47:08,437
and not worry about the lighting so much.

1004
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:10,979
For Unreal, I like switching it.

1005
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:13,221
I like using stationary lights for this

1006
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:15,523
and I also like enabling a setting

1007
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:17,544
called Force No Precomputed Lighting.

1008
00:47:17,907 --> 00:47:21,629
which will help you not worry about light mapping and light

1009
00:47:21,669 --> 00:47:22,570
map baking and stuff.

1010
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:25,712
And that's in the world settings in the Unreal Editor.

1011
00:47:26,133 --> 00:47:28,274
And in Unity, I like using real-time lights,

1012
00:47:28,655 --> 00:47:32,137
and I disable the auto-generate lighting checkbox

1013
00:47:32,457 --> 00:47:35,560
so that you're not constantly sitting and waiting and stopping

1014
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,681
for the light maps to bake.

1015
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,584
Although I hear the light map's faster now or something.

1016
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:41,984
I don't know.

1017
00:47:42,004 --> 00:47:45,067
Bye.

1018
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:45,487
Step two.

1019
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:49,871
Now you want to set up your main mood, your big mood in your scene.

1020
00:47:50,652 --> 00:47:53,874
And to do that you want to set up your global lights.

1021
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:55,915
So remember ambient and directional,

1022
00:47:56,115 --> 00:47:58,557
those apply to your whole entire game world.

1023
00:47:58,617 --> 00:48:00,659
So now's maybe the time to set that up

1024
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:02,500
before you worry about smaller stuff.

1025
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:06,183
And here you can see I have a bunch of sunlight

1026
00:48:06,363 --> 00:48:08,564
flooding in from those middle windows right here.

1027
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:12,527
And I want to set up the main mood of this level

1028
00:48:12,787 --> 00:48:15,769
with like a big sunny sun-filled area.

1029
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:21,997
And to do that, I need to set up the indirect light bounces,

1030
00:48:22,117 --> 00:48:24,019
especially for directional light or sunlight.

1031
00:48:24,659 --> 00:48:26,180
If you want something to feel like sunlight,

1032
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,922
you should be paying attention to your indirect light bounce

1033
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:29,302
settings.

1034
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:32,424
And in Unity, that would be going to your light settings.

1035
00:48:32,665 --> 00:48:34,106
And in Unreal, that would involve

1036
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:36,387
going to your world settings and adjust the light mass

1037
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:37,588
section of the world settings.

1038
00:48:38,128 --> 00:48:41,571
And also look at the skylight actor in your Unreal scene.

1039
00:48:43,132 --> 00:48:43,792
And if you're not.

1040
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,351
working with global illumination or light map baking for whatever reason,

1041
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:52,712
then the next best thing is to hand place, like, invisible, faint point lights everywhere.

1042
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:57,953
If you're, like, working on a game, like, I hear there's a rumor that

1043
00:48:58,053 --> 00:49:01,854
Fallout 4 did not have global illumination, so they had to place

1044
00:49:02,454 --> 00:49:07,915
faint point lights to, like, simulate and fake all the sunlight bouncing everywhere.

1045
00:49:08,656 --> 00:49:10,056
So you can totally do that as well.

1046
00:49:12,111 --> 00:49:14,514
In Unity, I like switching those lights to not important

1047
00:49:14,774 --> 00:49:16,656
so that they don't contribute to specular stuff.

1048
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:19,599
And in Unreal, I like increasing the minimum roughness

1049
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,821
on those lights so that they don't create

1050
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:23,083
hot spots in your reflections.

1051
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:29,209
Then step three, after you've kind of set up

1052
00:49:29,249 --> 00:49:30,791
the main mood of your scene, now you

1053
00:49:30,811 --> 00:49:33,294
should start thinking about the gameplay and lighting

1054
00:49:33,334 --> 00:49:34,195
for your critical path.

1055
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,072
To review, the critical path is kind of like the ideal things

1056
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:41,694
that your ideal player would kind of do in a certain order

1057
00:49:41,714 --> 00:49:42,755
or whatever in your level.

1058
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:46,017
And at this stage, you should probably

1059
00:49:46,057 --> 00:49:48,458
focus on navigation and wayfinding.

1060
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:52,601
Does the player know various entrances and exits

1061
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:53,862
and know where they are?

1062
00:49:54,322 --> 00:49:56,643
David talked about this a lot in his talk,

1063
00:49:56,683 --> 00:49:58,545
about how they care a lot about wayfinding.

1064
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:00,546
Lighting is another tool for you to do that.

1065
00:50:00,942 --> 00:50:09,448
And here I'm using it in like a really painfully obvious way where I'm using like bright orange lights on bright red doors.

1066
00:50:10,989 --> 00:50:18,734
Feel free to be more subtle than that in your own work, but for example, for the purposes of this example, it's like super obvious.

1067
00:50:20,535 --> 00:50:26,960
And when you're doing that, I also urge you to think about kind of like the hierarchy of different things you're doing here.

1068
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:33,438
Here I would argue the left door is being lit to be more important than the door on the right.

1069
00:50:33,718 --> 00:50:37,340
The door on the left kind of has a wider spotlight and it's more intense and brighter

1070
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,403
and also kind of has its own room and shadow so the contrast is much stronger.

1071
00:50:41,823 --> 00:50:46,145
Meanwhile that door on the right it's certainly an option and it certainly reads as like an

1072
00:50:46,245 --> 00:50:51,629
entrance or exit to this room but it's also a bit more faint so now we're emphasizing this

1073
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:56,972
door on the left super important this door on the right it's like okay you know it's an okay door

1074
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:57,192
but you

1075
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,646
you know, that door on the left.

1076
00:50:59,007 --> 00:50:59,207
Yeah.

1077
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:03,230
Then once you're done

1078
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:05,292
doing main player wayfinding

1079
00:51:05,352 --> 00:51:07,634
and also you're like testing throughout all of this,

1080
00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:09,396
right, you should be

1081
00:51:09,496 --> 00:51:11,297
thinking about the other

1082
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:13,299
interactions in your game. So if you're

1083
00:51:13,379 --> 00:51:15,501
setting up any NPCs or set pieces

1084
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:17,043
or encounters, you should be

1085
00:51:17,363 --> 00:51:19,244
trying to light those encounters so that

1086
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,166
the player will actually notice what's going on.

1087
00:51:22,087 --> 00:51:23,448
So here, these are like

1088
00:51:23,568 --> 00:51:25,030
critical gameplay objects.

1089
00:51:25,466 --> 00:51:28,769
that you might want to light enemies coming into the room,

1090
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:32,652
or maybe the enemies are guarding an objective or something.

1091
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:35,174
So on the left, they're guarding this orb.

1092
00:51:35,414 --> 00:51:37,916
The orb is very important in this game, I assure you.

1093
00:51:38,456 --> 00:51:41,178
And I have set up a blue,

1094
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,640
blue-green kind of turquoise light.

1095
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:46,623
And it's kind of coming at this perpendicular angle

1096
00:51:46,843 --> 00:51:48,124
to that orange arrow,

1097
00:51:48,204 --> 00:51:51,587
which is what I imagine as the player's critical path in this case.

1098
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,072
And when you have that blue light coming

1099
00:51:54,232 --> 00:51:56,593
like a grazing perpendicular angle kind of,

1100
00:51:56,934 --> 00:51:58,814
that helps set that up as a rim light

1101
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,856
to help emphasize the shapes going on there

1102
00:52:02,136 --> 00:52:03,576
instead of the surfaces.

1103
00:52:04,697 --> 00:52:06,858
Kind of the same thing going on in the example on the right.

1104
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:09,099
You might see two small people,

1105
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:11,460
two small silhouettes in the background.

1106
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,221
And that's because I've kind of thrown

1107
00:52:14,261 --> 00:52:15,881
a background light behind them.

1108
00:52:16,422 --> 00:52:18,883
So those silhouettes end up popping out

1109
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:20,703
and you notice them really easily.

1110
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:24,431
So again, if you're lighting stuff where soldiers or enemies

1111
00:52:24,491 --> 00:52:25,851
jump through windows or something,

1112
00:52:26,051 --> 00:52:28,532
you might want to have a light behind them to help frame them

1113
00:52:28,692 --> 00:52:29,612
and help them pop out.

1114
00:52:33,913 --> 00:52:35,994
And when you're doing this, you should be thinking

1115
00:52:36,034 --> 00:52:37,234
about your texture paths.

1116
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:41,255
Texturing is pretty important.

1117
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:43,895
I think that's why David talks about using color a lot.

1118
00:52:43,915 --> 00:52:45,676
You should be thinking about the basic values.

1119
00:52:46,536 --> 00:52:49,117
This is a page I basically just said.

1120
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,321
took these from some Unreal UDK documentation.

1121
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:56,062
But here the albedo on the left is really dark,

1122
00:52:56,202 --> 00:52:58,723
and the albedo diffuse texture on the right is much brighter.

1123
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,524
And when you have that dark albedo,

1124
00:53:01,764 --> 00:53:03,224
the light doesn't bounce as much,

1125
00:53:03,404 --> 00:53:05,705
because most game engines use the albedo texture

1126
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:08,445
to calculate reflectance for indirect light.

1127
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:11,866
So you can see that scene ends up feeling really, really dark

1128
00:53:11,906 --> 00:53:12,507
in a weird way.

1129
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:16,139
But if you use a brighter albedo in that bottom right example,

1130
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,581
now the scene is kind of evenly illuminated

1131
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:20,203
and it feels much more like sunlight.

1132
00:53:20,783 --> 00:53:22,124
And one really easy way to check this

1133
00:53:22,184 --> 00:53:25,147
is if you open up your albedo or diffuse texture in Photoshop,

1134
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:27,449
open up the levels histogram, look at that.

1135
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:30,731
Most of your values should be more in the upper mid-range.

1136
00:53:31,112 --> 00:53:33,794
And you usually want to leave the left and right,

1137
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:37,277
the extreme values, empty so that lighting can do its work.

1138
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:40,119
So don't try to do extreme black or extreme white.

1139
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:41,941
And.

1140
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,347
Oh my god, I'm running out of time.

1141
00:53:43,447 --> 00:53:44,227
OK, I'll try to go fast.

1142
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:48,408
So this is also where lighting is really, really important,

1143
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:52,249
I think, where some stuff might be too dark

1144
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,150
and some stuff might look great.

1145
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:58,611
And I think that has a very strong political valence to it.

1146
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:01,012
This is an example from an article called

1147
00:54:01,032 --> 00:54:03,492
Black Skin is Still a Radical Concept in Video Games.

1148
00:54:04,254 --> 00:54:09,816
And in this one, the woman on the right from Skyrim, I would argue, is lit pretty well.

1149
00:54:10,316 --> 00:54:13,357
You can read all the different contours and surface planes of her face.

1150
00:54:13,757 --> 00:54:18,838
Meanwhile, the woman on the left is lit very poorly, I think, where I can't really read

1151
00:54:18,898 --> 00:54:19,879
her face that well.

1152
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:22,720
Her chin and jaw are totally lost.

1153
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:29,101
And I'm not trying to call out Skyrim or Bethesda.

1154
00:54:30,821 --> 00:54:33,642
I don't think there was an evil racist at Bethesda going,

1155
00:54:33,682 --> 00:54:37,723
ha ha ha, right? I think this was just another example

1156
00:54:37,883 --> 00:54:41,244
of institutional racism that happens in video games where

1157
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:45,686
maybe playtesters were testing mostly with white characters, so they never

1158
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:49,307
saw that black characters are lit really poorly in this game

1159
00:54:50,107 --> 00:54:53,708
or need more specular contribution on their reflection or light probes

1160
00:54:53,768 --> 00:54:55,069
or whatever is going on in Skyrim.

1161
00:54:57,453 --> 00:54:59,814
It's important for us to take responsibility for our art.

1162
00:55:00,114 --> 00:55:02,955
And if in doubt, just ask a collaborator

1163
00:55:03,055 --> 00:55:05,236
so that you can avoid situations like these.

1164
00:55:08,117 --> 00:55:10,998
And then the last step is you should maybe

1165
00:55:11,118 --> 00:55:12,638
iterate on your level.

1166
00:55:12,818 --> 00:55:14,499
Keep trying different lighting schemes.

1167
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:20,005
And this is an example of a sci-fi scene that's lit four different ways.

1168
00:55:20,105 --> 00:55:22,887
So keep experimenting with your lighting, but at the same time,

1169
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:25,268
know when to stop and move on with your life.

1170
00:55:25,888 --> 00:55:28,730
This is a trap that a lot of level designers fall into.

1171
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,412
They keep tweaking lights a little bit brighter, a little bit darker,

1172
00:55:31,652 --> 00:55:33,173
as if that'll make a huge difference.

1173
00:55:33,293 --> 00:55:33,933
It will not.

1174
00:55:34,393 --> 00:55:35,014
I guarantee you.

1175
00:55:35,054 --> 00:55:39,036
Just make the lights as good as you can, and then move on.

1176
00:55:39,056 --> 00:55:40,937
Maybe come back to it later if you have more time.

1177
00:55:41,117 --> 00:55:44,119
You won't have more time, but, you know, go back to it later.

1178
00:55:44,677 --> 00:55:48,219
just say that to yourself and move on and make the rest of your game.

1179
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,200
So to review real quick,

1180
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:56,663
lighting sets mood and evokes culture. There's four different light types common to a lot of

1181
00:55:56,863 --> 00:56:00,625
3D game engines and tool sets. Three-point lighting argues that you

1182
00:56:00,645 --> 00:56:04,868
should think about the task and function of each light and what it's doing for the image composition.

1183
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:08,570
Light globally, do your big lights first and then

1184
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:12,131
start doing spot checks for gameplay and critical path.

1185
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,433
And also, know when to stop.

1186
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,866
fiddling with your lights and move on and make your game and don't just keep

1187
00:56:19,107 --> 00:56:22,913
fiddling with one light. Thanks for listening. That was me.

1188
00:56:24,876 --> 00:56:25,598
Applaud. Bye.
