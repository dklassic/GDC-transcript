1
00:00:02,914 --> 00:00:08,595
Hello. My name is Jason Vandenberg, creative director for Honor. Before I get started, just to get an

2
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:14,316
idea of who I'm dealing with here, how many of you all have played for Honor? Holy, wow, okay,

3
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:21,118
great! That's about half. That's cool. So that's good. I do have information for the rest of you,

4
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:26,198
so you won't be lost. I just wanted to sync up there. All right. So this talk is Forging Honor,

5
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,699
Providing a Coherent Vision for a New IP.

6
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:34,519
And the more I read that sentence as I was preparing this,

7
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:35,840
the more I read that subtitle,

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,184
the harder it was for me to look in the mirror

9
00:00:38,244 --> 00:00:40,246
and maintain any of my self-respect.

10
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:46,773
because that is horrible corporate speak and not at all what

11
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:55,436
happened. So I'm going to rename this talk here because while we

12
00:00:55,556 --> 00:01:01,017
did end up providing a coherent vision for a new IP, it grew out

13
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:03,378
of one very important emotion and that is this.

14
00:01:05,744 --> 00:01:10,546
We had a big challenge and a lot of work to do to make it happen.

15
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:12,907
Now, when I showed my producer this slide, Stephan Cardin,

16
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:16,069
he was like, I don't think that it was desperation he gave me this other one.

17
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:18,830
I think it was more determination that we were doing this.

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,033
And that right there tells you a lot about me and my producer.

19
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:25,374
We're a good pair.

20
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:27,272
We'll hear more about that.

21
00:01:27,312 --> 00:01:30,813
So this talk is not providing a coherent vision for the new IP.

22
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:31,333
No, no, no.

23
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:33,933
Let's rename it to what I actually want you to remember.

24
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:37,414
And that is that if you want to provide a coherent vision

25
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:41,875
for your new IP, what you need to do is never stop pitching.

26
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:43,116
Never.

27
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:46,896
Now, that will make more sense as we get deeper into the talk.

28
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:47,637
But that's the title.

29
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:50,317
Never stop pitching.

30
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:50,917
Never stop.

31
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:51,437
OK.

32
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:52,558
So the pitch.

33
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:57,155
Why is, if I'm here to talk about vision,

34
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:58,497
why am I here to talk to you about a pitch?

35
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:01,119
I mean, this isn't a sales presentation, right?

36
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:02,400
This isn't about getting the deal.

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,462
I'm a designer, I'm a creative director, what am I doing?

38
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:07,324
The thing is that hundreds of people simply can't agree.

39
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:09,986
It's not doable, right?

40
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:12,448
You can coerce a lot of people to agree, right?

41
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,131
But that's hard to do, and in a team project,

42
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:16,872
you need people to all be aligned

43
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:18,153
and moving in the same direction, right?

44
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:20,295
So, the pitch.

45
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:27,951
The art of the pitch is how you get people to see the same goal and how you get people aligned.

46
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,954
The first part of this talk is going to be an examination of how to do that.

47
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:36,321
And then the second part will be what that looks like, different tools that you can turn,

48
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:39,745
that you can use during your production to keep people in line.

49
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:41,911
Pitching.

50
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:42,571
Okay?

51
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:44,412
Keeping people aligned is all pitching.

52
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:46,214
So let's start by defining what a pitch is.

53
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:46,934
So never stop pitching.

54
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:47,815
Let's define what a pitch is.

55
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:49,776
This is one way.

56
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,737
We think that a lot of people

57
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:52,418
think this is how pitching works, right?

58
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,419
You get in an elevator,

59
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:54,840
get in the elevator,

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,881
you say, hey, I have a screen.

61
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:58,062
30 seconds later,

62
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:00,544
30 million dollars.

63
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:02,826
It's amazing.

64
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:05,027
We just gotta refine that pitch

65
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:06,668
so you have exactly the thing.

66
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:07,249
Doesn't happen.

67
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:07,949
That's not how it works.

68
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,100
This is another idea of how we think, where we have this,

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,260
and we get up in front of this room,

70
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,521
and it's very important people,

71
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:16,622
and we make this very reasoned, impassioned,

72
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:19,104
maybe very clever emotional appeal,

73
00:03:19,184 --> 00:03:21,405
and then they think very cautiously,

74
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:23,707
and then they nod seriously,

75
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:26,348
and then we walk away with $30 million.

76
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,509
Right?

77
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,071
Now that does actually happen.

78
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:32,932
Once.

79
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:37,074
And that is not enough to keep your team on track

80
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,255
across an IP, right?

81
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:42,179
This is what pitching actually looks like.

82
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,641
This is an open house with a politician in the middle

83
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:48,882
talking to their constituents,

84
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:53,143
because pitching is actually a process of interaction

85
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,604
between you, the vision holder.

86
00:03:57,241 --> 00:04:02,885
and the people who actually need to understand and comprehend and buy in and then feedback to

87
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:07,408
you about where you're wrong. And then that dialogue needs to occur. So this is actually

88
00:04:07,428 --> 00:04:12,232
what pitching means and you do it all the time. Now, to be clear, this story, I'm going to tell

89
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:17,215
you about how this went on for honor. I kind of sucked at this at the beginning. So I'm going to

90
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:20,758
give you some, tell you some stories about what happened in the beginning. The early stories are

91
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:25,421
not going to be examples of good pitches, but we'll get there eventually. So,

92
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:30,754
To clarify, what do we think pitching is for?

93
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:33,335
We believe, a lot of people, that pitching

94
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,015
is for convincing to get cash.

95
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:37,236
That is not at all what it's for.

96
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:43,439
Pitching is a way for you to signal your values

97
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,200
to the people you are going to collaborate with

98
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:49,401
in order to earn their confidence.

99
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,430
in whatever that means,

100
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:54,472
confidence that their jobs are meaningful,

101
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,353
confidence that the project's gonna be a success,

102
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:57,774
confidence that they're gonna get money back

103
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,895
from their investment, whatever confidence means to them

104
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:01,616
and whatever confidence means to you,

105
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:04,038
this is what pitching is actually trying to do,

106
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:07,580
which is why it is at the heart of creative leadership

107
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:10,542
and why it is at the heart of keeping people aligned

108
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:11,122
over time.

109
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:12,883
Keeping people aligned over time

110
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,224
is not telling them what to do,

111
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:17,806
it is signaling that you are on the same team,

112
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,307
you want the same things.

113
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:21,747
and then you show them where you want to go

114
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:23,908
and then they see that they want to go there too.

115
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:26,871
Okay, that's what pitching actually is, not that one.

116
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:28,112
It's that one.

117
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:31,995
Okay, so a pitch is anything that connects people

118
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,337
to the reasons why their efforts matter,

119
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:36,819
which is why we do it in the beginning to get the money.

120
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,301
Now, that's a pitch.

121
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:45,036
What is For Honor? Before we go any further, What is For Honor? It's a video game where

122
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:53,180
knights, vikings and samurai crash together on an epic medieval battlefield. It was my 15 year

123
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,743
dream pitch game. It was my personal sort of quest that has now came out on February 14th, a

124
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:00,363
couple of weeks ago.

125
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,766
It's easier to just show you what the game is like. So this is a quick video that we'll

126
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:10,329
introduce you to. If you haven't seen it, this is what it's about. Warning, there's some

127
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:16,272
violence. We have swords. So it's not terrible, but there is some if you're sensitive to that.

128
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:18,253
Here we go. Oops, sorry.

129
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:42,487
This is a 4v4 multiplayer battlefield.

130
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:44,128
We also have a solo campaign.

131
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,050
The guys with shields over their heads are other players.

132
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:12,036
Oh, coward.

133
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,058
We have a system called the Art of Battle.

134
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,800
It's a whole new way to do melee combat. It involves stances on the right stick...

135
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:24,662
...blocks and attacks...

136
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:32,246
...and some rather spectacular executions.

137
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:34,508
Because yes!

138
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:39,150
Plays on an epic medieval battlefield.

139
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:48,234
and we can go on but that's the basic gist of the game. If you haven't seen For Honor that gives

140
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:52,517
you a lot of part of what you need to know for the rest of the talk. Okay, so where did it start?

141
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:55,900
How did this game get started? I'm going to give you a little bit of the background. I've told

142
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,704
the story to the press a lot so I'll do a fast version of this. But the idea, For Honor actually

143
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:07,570
began about 15 years ago when my wife bought the two of us a year's worth of stuff.

144
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:15,292
a subscription I guess, to a dojo, to a dojo in San Francisco that was teaching western martial arts.

145
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:21,594
Longsword, German longsword. And I studied this art of sword fighting, it's this really

146
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:28,056
rediscovered form, and I was walking home one day, and I was all impressed with how simple

147
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:32,297
the system was, and I thought what if we took these stances and we put them on the right stick.

148
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:35,558
And I had this new controller idea, like oh this is going to be great.

149
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:40,859
got really excited about it because I thought this would feel like real fighting and it would

150
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,380
move the fighting genre forward. Yay! Cool! So I pitched it and I pitched it to everyone who

151
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:53,923
would listen for 10 years. I pitched it. The answer was no. Again, no, no, no, no. We don't

152
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:58,404
make that kind of game. No, that will never work. No, I don't get it. Why would you want to

153
00:08:58,424 --> 00:08:59,804
do that? No, no, no, no, no, no.

154
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:07,302
I want to be clear.

155
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:09,583
I'm going to tell you why I think,

156
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:10,964
I'm going to spoil the ending a little bit.

157
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:14,085
I'm going to tell you why I think I failed.

158
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:17,686
But I wasn't, it took me longer than this

159
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:18,326
to figure this out.

160
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:22,188
This is the core principle I want you to understand

161
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:22,888
about pitching.

162
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:25,629
Don't pitch your idea, pitch your purpose.

163
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:29,090
I was pitching an idea that I had about melee combat.

164
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:32,932
I was not pitching a reason to make a video game.

165
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:35,553
To demonstrate what I mean quickly,

166
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,356
I'll give you the pitch.

167
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:38,638
Here was the cool pitch.

168
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:39,699
This is my original pitch.

169
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,425
I have an idea for a better way to do melee combat with a standard controller.

170
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,690
We're going to put the guards of martial arts on the right stick.

171
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,196
And if we do that in third person, we end up with a whole new experience where the fighting

172
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:58,299
feels more like real combat, but in an intuitive way.

173
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:05,715
That is a terrible pitch. It's horrible. It's awful.

174
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:12,279
It works if you're able to squint and visualize the whole system

175
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:13,680
and kind of reach towards a thing.

176
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,922
But of course, I was pitching to executive producers and business people

177
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:19,683
and even designers would be like,

178
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:22,945
I don't think, I don't really think that would work, right?

179
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:24,346
It's a bad pitch.

180
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:29,269
Because I wasn't pitching the reason why it mattered.

181
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:30,764
So what happened?

182
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:34,007
What happened is I met this guy, Yanis Milat,

183
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,008
managing director at Ubisoft Montreal.

184
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:37,649
I was working at Ubisoft Montreal at the time,

185
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:41,231
and after years of trying to pitch,

186
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:42,812
he took me to lunch one day.

187
00:10:43,032 --> 00:10:44,213
He took me to lunch one day, as he does,

188
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,735
he likes to, you know, let's go talk,

189
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:47,715
let's have our annual talk.

190
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,116
Like once a year he likes to go and talk.

191
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,797
And he looks at me and he's like,

192
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,059
so Jason, what do you really want to do?

193
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:57,541
What do you really?

194
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:08,492
want to do. And that's, his eyes are like that, they're creepy. He's really like, he's just

195
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:11,557
really like intensely compassionate but very dangerous man, right?

196
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,892
And I was pissed off. I had had a bad day.

197
00:11:16,912 --> 00:11:21,015
Okay, I was really, I was flaming. I was raging that day.

198
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,936
And I was like, you know what?

199
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:24,377
You, what would I do?

200
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:27,459
I'll tell you what I would do.

201
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,699
And I said to him, you know what?

202
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,541
I'm gonna tell you, but you're gonna say no.

203
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,482
You know why you're gonna say no?

204
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:33,923
Because you can't see it.

205
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:37,592
I want to change the way melee combat works.

206
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:40,914
I want to feel the way that I feel when I pick up a weapon

207
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,476
and I go out with my nerd friends and we fight

208
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,757
because yeah, man, I do that.

209
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:47,818
I want to feel those emotions of battlefield

210
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,719
and I have this idea about how to make that work

211
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,001
but you guys can't see it, so you're going to tell me no.

212
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:54,322
Mmm!

213
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:56,443
The middle of this restaurant.

214
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:58,144
It's a nice restaurant too.

215
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:00,526
He's like, whoa.

216
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:02,467
And so I told him the thing.

217
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:03,548
And at the end,

218
00:12:04,678 --> 00:12:14,681
He smiles at me. He says, no. And I'm like, I knew you were

219
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:19,543
going to. And he says, but. I have someone I want you to meet.

220
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:24,685
And he says, I want you to meet Stefan Cardin. Stefan Cardin was

221
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:27,926
the producer of a team at the time called the Fox team. They

222
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:31,167
had done Naruto and Prince of Persia and a bunch of fighting

223
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:34,008
stuff inside Ubisoft and they were looking for a creative

224
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:34,308
director.

225
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:39,710
And he had been going around asking and interviewing people, talking about, you know, he would

226
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,671
ask them this question.

227
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:42,012
He had this question that he wanted to ask me.

228
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:52,179
So we went to the bar across the street and Steph looked at me and he said, what would

229
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:52,959
be the game of your life?

230
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,381
What's the game that you would make?

231
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:57,903
What's the one thing you want to do?

232
00:12:57,963 --> 00:13:00,925
What's the game that would make your life have meaning?

233
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:03,752
And I was pissed still, but I told him.

234
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:05,293
I'm like, rawr, right?

235
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:08,956
And at the end of that, I explained it all to him,

236
00:13:08,976 --> 00:13:10,537
and he said, I think you should talk to my team.

237
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:13,799
So I put a deck together, and I gave this pitch.

238
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:14,360
I gave this pitch.

239
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,162
Now, it was a terrible pitch.

240
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:19,283
I want to be clear about that.

241
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:21,284
It was better than the pitch that I just gave you,

242
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:25,007
but I'm going to show you the key slide from the pitch

243
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:30,210
that I made so you understand what not to do.

244
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,833
I want to make Fight Club with Claymore.

245
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,558
Fight Club with swords, that's what I want to do.

246
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:42,140
I just want to fight with weapons.

247
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,804
Because I was so desperate, I was like, I just want to fight, I just want to do this

248
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:46,444
system, right?

249
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:50,828
I was like, uh!

250
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:52,550
So it's terrible, it's a terrible pitch.

251
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,893
But they said yes, they said yes, they said let's do this.

252
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:59,225
And there were a lot of reasons, I'm going to go through why that happened.

253
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:01,732
But the key thing again...

254
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:07,682
I had accidentally pitched my purpose because I was pissed.

255
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:10,764
I'd forgotten to talk about the controller part and I got so hung up on the,

256
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,465
God damn it, I just want to fight.

257
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:15,467
I want to feel the way I feel when I do this for real.

258
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:16,248
It's so cool.

259
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:18,209
And I don't feel that way when I play other games.

260
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:19,410
And I want to.

261
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,692
And I had accidentally put some passion and some thought

262
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:25,254
into some emotion into the context

263
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:26,855
and I connected with them accidentally.

264
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:31,007
So later, so we got a yes and we started.

265
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:31,967
And that's where it started.

266
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:33,527
That's where the game began.

267
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:35,788
So we kept going.

268
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:39,269
And, but at this point,

269
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:41,049
and this is the thing I want you to,

270
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:42,469
there's a key thing I want you to understand.

271
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:44,030
Remember the elevator pitch idea?

272
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,110
Right, you get in the elevator, ding $30 million, right?

273
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,071
Or the, you know, you stand up

274
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,351
and they ask for the $30 million.

275
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:51,851
So I had gotten the team.

276
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:53,372
I got the team and I got the green light.

277
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:54,972
With a terrible pitch.

278
00:14:56,693 --> 00:15:00,635
I had not yet learned how to do it well, the way I hope you will feel I did.

279
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:07,400
So it still didn't work, but the pitch turned into a really, really strong vehicle for the

280
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,482
project because the pitch is only the beginning.

281
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:12,863
So what happened next?

282
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:16,586
I'm going to take a quick moment and I'm going to do, this is going to be a straight up plug.

283
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:18,607
So brace yourself.

284
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:22,181
because somewhere in the first four months of the project,

285
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,964
this group called the Think8 came to our project

286
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:27,946
and they did a workshop on their process

287
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:31,669
and they haven't finished their fricking book

288
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:33,070
and you guys, finish your book.

289
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:34,632
Ugh, these guys.

290
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:36,073
I want to read the book.

291
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:38,015
When their book comes out, read it.

292
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:39,636
And if you can hire them, great.

293
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,337
They did this process for thinking about

294
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,238
what you're trying to accomplish.

295
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:43,179
I highly recommend it.

296
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,221
We came out of that process.

297
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:49,022
with a pitch that actually was the one

298
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,503
that carried us through the first 18 months.

299
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:52,084
I'm gonna do the pitch for you now.

300
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:55,305
I'm gonna do the pitch that I did at the first like,

301
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:56,725
you know, I don't know.

302
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:58,986
I gave the pitch like 100 times

303
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:00,066
over the course of the first two years.

304
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,587
So I'm gonna do the opening bit.

305
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,048
So this is the pitch that I think actually carried

306
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,148
for Honor through its opening bits.

307
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:05,608
Here it goes.

308
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:08,629
So I have a belief.

309
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:09,990
Why am I making this game?

310
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,571
I have a belief.

311
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:13,891
I have a profound belief.

312
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:14,891
I believe this.

313
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,707
I believe that combat is an art.

314
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,471
Capital A, art.

315
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:22,378
I believe that combat is an art form

316
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:25,625
where the artist sometimes gives their lives

317
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:27,229
in defense of what they believe in.

318
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:30,117
I have a military family.

319
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:33,339
My father was a Marine, my dad was an infantryman

320
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,180
in World War II, and I have all,

321
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,981
my brother was a ranger, and my son

322
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:39,923
was joined in the Navy early on in his life.

323
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:42,384
I was the black sheep, okay?

324
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,745
I deeply respect warriors, right?

325
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,807
Even if I understand that the army can be used

326
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,508
for horrible purposes, right?

327
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,990
I believe that combat is an art form.

328
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:55,091
Deadly, terrible.

329
00:16:56,054 --> 00:17:05,438
necessary, we don't want it yet, it is there. And I have a favorite style. It is this one. This is

330
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:11,721
a screenshot from Total War Medieval 2, which at the time, it's the actual screenshot I used for

331
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:16,283
the pitch, at the time was the only reference I could find to make my point. This is my

332
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:20,585
favorite style of combat. It is close, it is intense, you see her, you're right in there,

333
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:24,266
you're next to her, but I don't want to play this game. I mean, I do play this game, but this is

334
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:25,707
not the game I want to make, right?

335
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,140
I want to make this game.

336
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:30,742
I want to be that guy.

337
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:33,303
I want to be, or the guy that lives.

338
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,687
I want to be surrounded on the battlefield.

339
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,729
I want to know that my skill is what matters.

340
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,590
I can't do this.

341
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,732
I can't play that game at the time this game didn't exist.

342
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,434
Now it does, five years later, but that's the game I want to make.

343
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:51,657
That's a better pitch.

344
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:57,582
It's better. Even if you don't agree or you don't want to work with me on the project,

345
00:17:57,622 --> 00:17:59,644
at least now you understand why I want to make it.

346
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:03,567
What's its value? What's the problem that it's trying to solve?

347
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:07,611
It's better. To try and demonstrate to you how better it is,

348
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:12,215
I'm going to try and do a little experiment here where I do that same pitch without the Y part.

349
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:17,180
Without the combat as an art bit. So let's just erase our brains. I know you can't do that.

350
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:21,816
But this is a mental exercise, it'll be good for you guys.

351
00:18:22,156 --> 00:18:23,157
Try it out, we're gonna try this.

352
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:25,199
So here's a better pitch, here's the pitch without this.

353
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,280
I love this kind of combat.

354
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,403
Personal, it's brutal, difficult, exhausting.

355
00:18:31,704 --> 00:18:34,606
And I wanna make a game about this kind of combat.

356
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:37,248
But I don't wanna play this game, I wanna play this game.

357
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,352
And I have an idea about how to connect the player

358
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:44,514
through the controller to this character

359
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:45,895
in a way that will change the way

360
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:47,036
these kinds of melee games are made.

361
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:52,323
Yeah, it's okay.

362
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,625
Combat's a fucking art, right?

363
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:57,246
And I believe it.

364
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:02,870
So, never stop pitching, but pitch your purpose.

365
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:05,372
How did I learn this?

366
00:19:07,268 --> 00:19:10,251
I showed you the Think8. That was absolutely part of this. But I'm going to show you a slide.

367
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:13,694
And if you're on the internet, is anyone on the internet? Do you guys use the internet?

368
00:19:13,934 --> 00:19:20,220
Yeah, good. You may be familiar with this guy. So I learned this technique from a guy named

369
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,124
Simon Sinek. If you've seen this guy on your internets in the last six months, it's because

370
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:29,968
he went viral with a video where he was saying terrible things about millennials.

371
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:35,981
Please do not let that video prevent you

372
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:39,764
from extracting the awesome that is this talk.

373
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,526
How great leaders inspire action.

374
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:42,927
It's the thing about the golden circle.

375
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,409
When people ask me, how can I do what you do?

376
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:46,670
How can I learn to pitch?

377
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,072
I say, go watch this video 20 times.

378
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,335
And when you've digested the lessons of this video,

379
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:53,416
go in there.

380
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:55,618
The quick version of this goes like this.

381
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:58,160
He has a story he tells about Apple and Dell.

382
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,342
People don't buy what you make,

383
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:01,683
they buy why you made it.

384
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:05,230
Dell's pitch for a computer.

385
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,693
We have great computers, great hardware, great service,

386
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:11,635
delivered to your door, affordable,

387
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:13,937
we can, you know, great warranties.

388
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:15,558
Would you like to buy a computer?

389
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:16,659
It's great.

390
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:17,860
Apple's pitch.

391
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:21,262
We believe that technology can be used

392
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:24,985
to improve the human condition, and it should be.

393
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:27,927
We happen to make a computer.

394
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:32,991
It's not bad.

395
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,680
Watch this video. I learned all this from him.

396
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,061
So, so that was the first part of the pitch.

397
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:41,082
Now, so, pitch the why.

398
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:42,482
Those are your two tools so far.

399
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:43,623
First, you never stop pitching.

400
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:44,823
You're always pitching.

401
00:20:44,963 --> 00:20:46,224
Two, pitch your purpose.

402
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:48,004
Not your idea.

403
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:50,385
But you do have to do this.

404
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:51,365
The dreaded business case.

405
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:53,286
Do you need to make the dreaded business case?

406
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:54,707
Absolutely.

407
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,488
It is super easy to come up with a great pitch

408
00:20:58,528 --> 00:20:59,628
for a game that's already been made.

409
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:01,229
Right?

410
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:02,950
I want to make a game.

411
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,547
that immerses you in the adventure of being a soldier,

412
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,275
captures the fantasy of being in the middle

413
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:10,458
of a modern battlefield.

414
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,594
Right, we've made those before, right, we know.

415
00:21:16,154 --> 00:21:18,115
It's not okay goods, but what's something special

416
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:18,715
about that, right?

417
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:20,515
So I'm gonna give you the example

418
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:21,355
of the dreaded business case.

419
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,375
This is tool number three.

420
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:23,916
I've been sneaking my tools in on you

421
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:25,096
under all my stories.

422
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,436
Tool number three, the dreaded business case.

423
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:30,437
This is how I pitched the business case,

424
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:33,358
and it's an example of trying to point to

425
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:36,858
the problem that this game is trying to solve.

426
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:38,279
Here we go.

427
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,719
So I'm gonna do two charts for you.

428
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:43,091
First one was going to be gun games.

429
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:44,237
Second one would be melee games.

430
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:44,780
Do the same thing.

431
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:46,235
Here's an axis.

432
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,677
On this side we have PVP combat skill.

433
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:52,359
So the further out we go here, the more skill is required

434
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,019
to play this game.

435
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,961
The more skill the game asks of you, right,

436
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,662
or potential for skill expression there is.

437
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,003
And up here is immersion.

438
00:21:58,023 --> 00:22:01,185
The higher up here we go, the more the world is there.

439
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:02,726
I believe in the characters and the space,

440
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:03,346
and I'm really in there.

441
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:04,647
I mean, I feel like I've been transported.

442
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:06,048
Okay, so with gun games in the beginning,

443
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:07,769
there were always this balance between,

444
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:09,450
and we can argue about exactly where the dots go,

445
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,071
but there was always this balance

446
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:11,952
between skill and immersion.

447
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:14,113
We quickly discovered this zone here.

448
00:22:14,894 --> 00:22:16,395
where it was all about skill, right?

449
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,436
At the same time, we discovered this other zone up here

450
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:21,938
where it was all about immersion, right, generally.

451
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:24,120
But all along, there were these games.

452
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,081
These slides are a little bit outdated

453
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:27,762
because, remember, this project was five years long,

454
00:22:27,822 --> 00:22:28,803
so excuse me for that.

455
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:32,765
But there was these games that were the balance of both,

456
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:35,147
had the best of both, the highest potential for skill

457
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,848
and the highest potential for immersion.

458
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:42,071
All right, so let's do that for Melee games.

459
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:42,852
Same thing.

460
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:44,112
So in the beginning.

461
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,899
Again, trying to balance the both, there were some interesting experiments.

462
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:48,660
Bushido Blade.

463
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,141
Right off the bat,

464
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:53,002
we found a zone here where we can...

465
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:55,223
where it's all about skill, right?

466
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:56,483
And who cares about immersion, right?

467
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,264
It's all about just player skill, player versus player.

468
00:22:58,424 --> 00:22:59,544
And then we always had these games

469
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,925
that are about immersion, getting into the world, right?

470
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:03,826
A lot of these games you don't even play on hard, right?

471
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:06,767
There's no hard difficulty in Zelda or Assassin's Creed, right?

472
00:23:07,668 --> 00:23:08,408
So not about skill.

473
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,709
But when it comes to games that did both,

474
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:14,030
there's some interesting experiments.

475
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:16,541
Name one.

476
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:22,686
Name one game that has melee combat as its primary topic

477
00:23:23,287 --> 00:23:25,949
that has the immersion of a Call of Duty,

478
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:30,012
a Halo, Battlefield, and has a level of skill expression

479
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:31,553
of a Halo, Call of Duty, or Battlefield.

480
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:32,334
One game.

481
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,617
I've given this part of the presentation

482
00:23:35,637 --> 00:23:37,318
to probably over 3,000 people now,

483
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:38,659
and I just gave it to the entire internet.

484
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,100
So, I'm sure I'll hear about it.

485
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:44,088
But no one ever said one game, right?

486
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:47,931
Okay, well, my point is, what the fuck, man?

487
00:23:47,951 --> 00:23:50,333
I wanna play this game.

488
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:53,196
Like, I really wanna play it.

489
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:57,539
And I think that I'm not alone.

490
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,301
So that's the business case.

491
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:00,882
That was my entire business case.

492
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:03,124
But you see what I'm doing here?

493
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:07,530
I am pointing to a problem that I thought a lot of people might have,

494
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,593
which is the lack of a knights vs. vikings vs. samurai sword fighting game in their life.

495
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:17,355
And I am setting out to fill that void,

496
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:21,938
because damn it, the world deserves that kind of video game.

497
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,041
So make sure that you're solving a problem

498
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:27,262
that a lot of people have.

499
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:31,084
Now this doesn't just apply to your audience, of course,

500
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:32,945
because remember that pitch when I talked to Yanis,

501
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,246
and then I talked to Steph?

502
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,708
Well, I was also solving a problem that Yanis and Steph had.

503
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:38,848
Yanis had a problem.

504
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:40,889
He needed a new IP.

505
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,231
He was looking for something new to do

506
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,171
out of Ubisoft Montreal.

507
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:48,073
And he had a team that was looking for something to do

508
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:49,274
and didn't have a creative leader.

509
00:24:50,195 --> 00:24:53,678
That's a problem for him. He's burning money and he wants something cool.

510
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:57,902
Steph, my producer, had a problem. He was running a team with no creative leader.

511
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:02,166
So my pitch also solved their problems.

512
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:10,233
So, never stop pitching. Pitch your purpose and solve someone's problem.

513
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:15,518
I want to underscore this. For Honor didn't just happen because I had a good idea.

514
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:20,414
I think I had a good idea, but it wasn't good enough.

515
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:22,396
I needed an entire design team to help fix it.

516
00:25:23,777 --> 00:25:24,317
And they really did.

517
00:25:24,337 --> 00:25:26,679
I've got one of my designers here in the front.

518
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:27,299
She was like, yes.

519
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,401
Yes, we fixed your game.

520
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:31,582
I'm not that great of a designer.

521
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:37,647
But the reason For Honor happened

522
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:39,948
was because a whole bunch of people had a problem.

523
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:42,550
And they were all different problems.

524
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,453
And the pitch was a solution to a majority of those problems.

525
00:25:47,557 --> 00:25:51,498
So find someone who's got a problem that your idea solves.

526
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:53,898
And go talk to them.

527
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,039
And remember, I pitched to the team,

528
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:57,719
and it was the team that said yes.

529
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,320
Okay, oh yeah, so we had to, so now we have a pitch.

530
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,141
That's a pretty good pitch, and it carried us through.

531
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:04,781
So that was great, my part was good,

532
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:06,962
but we also had to build the, what's it called?

533
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:09,902
The video game, all right.

534
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,483
So we started doing that.

535
00:26:12,523 --> 00:26:13,903
Now this idea had...

536
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:19,211
there wasn't such a thing at the time. So we started doing, if

537
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:24,454
you guys have attended, quick hand, if I say fail faster and

538
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:28,977
follow the fun, who has, is that familiar to you? Great. All the

539
00:26:29,017 --> 00:26:30,438
rest of you if you are a designer.

540
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:36,180
or a producer or really want to make video games, attend Mark LeBlanc's lectures and learn

541
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,162
about fail faster, follow the fun. Because that's what we did. We did a series of prototypes. This

542
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:45,764
is the first prototype that was done. This was done in the first week of For Honor. This is our

543
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,445
two player experience here.

544
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:52,344
was two controllers and we had the guards in the middle there

545
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:56,566
and we could attack, little block windows and health bars

546
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:59,827
and stamina. That was where For Honor started, the very first

547
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:04,269
video game. Week one on the project. It was fantastic. Fail

548
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,250
faster, follow the fun means build as many prototypes as you

549
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:07,570
can.

550
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,094
over the course of the first 18 months of the project we made like 400 prototypes.

551
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:16,138
We would play every day, we'd rock and roll.

552
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:18,800
And as we played, as we built the game we evolved.

553
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:23,124
We played with stick figures for the first year, and it was great.

554
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:24,406
It was a lot of fun.

555
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:26,848
You can see us were experimenting with feedback systems and stuff.

556
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:29,270
One of the things that we learned is that when you play with stick figures

557
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,372
you can see the entire battlefield really clearly

558
00:27:31,673 --> 00:27:33,614
because nobody has any flesh to block.

559
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:39,058
the field. So when we put real skin on the characters, suddenly the game changed and we had

560
00:27:39,078 --> 00:27:42,380
to change all our maps and you know everything was... but we played with stick figures for a while.

561
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,103
This is a screenshot from an early game. Super Brain in the middle there, that's my producer,

562
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:50,525
that's Steph. And the Dark Lord, that's me.

563
00:27:54,027 --> 00:27:57,849
And unfortunately it was Kaylin who got the kill. I was so pissed!

564
00:27:59,246 --> 00:27:59,806
But it was great.

565
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:01,747
So what we were doing is we were iterating

566
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:02,688
and iterating and iterating,

567
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,188
but we were playing like this for a long time.

568
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,209
How do you know what the game looks like?

569
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,811
So remember that this talk is about keeping a team aligned.

570
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,671
How do you keep a team aligned, right?

571
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:11,992
We had a good pitch,

572
00:28:12,552 --> 00:28:14,353
but what's the game gonna look like now?

573
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:16,034
Everyone's bought in, what do we do?

574
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:17,815
What are we really building?

575
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:19,576
So while we were doing this,

576
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:22,277
while we were iterating and iterating and iterating

577
00:28:22,297 --> 00:28:23,137
and playing every day,

578
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:24,578
we had another thing we were building,

579
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:26,159
it was a thing called target gameplay footage.

580
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:31,252
You may have heard of this concept in other talks, I'm not sure.

581
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:35,357
But, what is a target gameplay footage?

582
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:37,000
It is an attempt...

583
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:44,161
to create, you create a video, a cinematic that shows you way in advance what the game

584
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:50,144
will look like. Or what it could look like anyway. Right? It's an attempt to sort of

585
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:56,608
explore the future through a video. And this idea sometimes gets a bad rep because of course

586
00:28:56,648 --> 00:28:59,429
the question is why are we wasting all this time on assets that we don't ship.

587
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:02,917
It's a huge amount of effort, it's expensive to make.

588
00:29:03,738 --> 00:29:04,539
What's it for?

589
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,822
And it seems like, often feels like to developers,

590
00:29:07,842 --> 00:29:09,124
like it's a waste of time.

591
00:29:10,305 --> 00:29:12,067
But in certain cases, and if you do it well,

592
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:14,810
I'm gonna give you a list of how you do it well in a second.

593
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:16,792
It can really help you.

594
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:17,793
I'm going to show you.

595
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,842
a little clip from the middle of the TGF that we built for For Honor.

596
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,806
This was done the second year, between the second and the third year of the project.

597
00:29:29,027 --> 00:29:29,728
And you're going to hear...

598
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:34,841
In this clip you're going to hear an announcer come in and start talking about points and

599
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:37,643
you know, oh he's got to take the thing and doing sort of commentary stuff.

600
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:43,868
That was our way of injecting the game design rules into this video so that

601
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:47,871
if people wanted to watch it and kind of understand how the mode was going to work

602
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,994
that there would be a way for them to do that, but it's not really a big deal.

603
00:29:52,014 --> 00:29:56,758
So this is the opening seconds, or opening minute and a half or so of the...

604
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:58,420
of the TGF we built.

605
00:29:58,861 --> 00:30:01,226
Key thing to know, all of this was rendered

606
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:03,871
inside the actual game engine with actual assets

607
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:05,614
three years in advance of shipping the game.

608
00:30:38,658 --> 00:30:41,259
Blades is really starting to overextend into that minion group.

609
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:43,119
If he's not careful, he's gonna get surrounded.

610
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,420
Our Astra Serpent and Blades are gonna tag team this Captain,

611
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,641
and that's gonna give their guys the push they need to really get this match started.

612
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:55,043
Now Blades is keeping it a little bit defensive right now.

613
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,804
He's waiting for his minions to join him so he can start this push against the Vikings.

614
00:31:02,114 --> 00:31:04,755
Those catapults are really gonna screw with Blade's plan.

615
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:06,196
He's gotta take that flag.

616
00:31:06,436 --> 00:31:08,497
It's also gonna give his team 200 points,

617
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:11,078
which is a solid step towards the 1,000 they need

618
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:12,739
to put the Vikings into sudden death.

619
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:16,000
Now, Blade should have an easy time

620
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,180
taking care of this point.

621
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,481
Nothing but minions here,

622
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:21,142
so his plan is exactly what he needs to take him out.

623
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:25,724
All right, the Knights take the lead!

624
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:26,184
Yes!

625
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:30,246
Oh, shit.

626
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:40,459
Ah, crap! Here comes Eric LaRouge. He wants to take back the catapult, and if Blades wants to hold against that axe with his flail, he's gonna need to keep the high ground. Let's see if he can pull it off.

627
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:10,176
that guy needs to practice. So that gives you a feel for that.

628
00:32:10,256 --> 00:32:13,798
All that was mocapped. We just got actors in the motion capture

629
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:15,799
stage and had them go through that. But when we did the mocap,

630
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:17,720
we were sitting there with our game director and game designer

631
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,661
and we were designing all the moves to be how we thought it

632
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:24,603
would work and try to fake it so it would all come together. But

633
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,424
if you think about what I showed you in the opening.

634
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,353
right, the first charge through, that was three years before that, right?

635
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,091
Pretty proud of that.

636
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:34,792
So how did that work?

637
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:37,454
How did we get this asset to be useful to the team?

638
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:38,674
There's a couple of key things.

639
00:32:38,794 --> 00:32:41,056
If you're going to do this, a couple of key things

640
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:42,657
that you really, you must do,

641
00:32:43,117 --> 00:32:44,098
or it will be a waste of time.

642
00:32:44,618 --> 00:32:45,379
Use real assets.

643
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,480
You have to be using the actual stuff

644
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,141
that you think you will be using in the game.

645
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:51,303
It has to be stuff that has the poly count,

646
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:53,204
has the right level of textures, right?

647
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:55,005
Something like the right process,

648
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:57,287
your best guess as to how you're gonna build

649
00:32:57,607 --> 00:32:59,928
the real assets in the game, if you possibly can.

650
00:32:59,948 --> 00:33:01,650
You need to use your real engine.

651
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,071
You're going to make a bunch of mistakes and there's going to be a bunch of conflicts

652
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:08,853
between your departments while you're making this TGF, right?

653
00:33:09,193 --> 00:33:10,093
Those need to be real.

654
00:33:10,813 --> 00:33:12,094
They shouldn't be fake, right?

655
00:33:12,114 --> 00:33:14,555
They shouldn't be having discussions about how to make the movie.

656
00:33:14,595 --> 00:33:17,776
They should be talking about, well, in the real game, we wouldn't do it this way,

657
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:19,397
and so we shouldn't do this now, right?

658
00:33:20,157 --> 00:33:21,918
You should have your arguments be real.

659
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:25,540
Use the real team so that when the arguments you have,

660
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,901
so that the arguments that you have are remembered.

661
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:35,210
by your team. That knowledge is embedded inside your group, right? And it's tricky because

662
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:41,892
your team is not 400 animators in another country, right? It can constrain you, but

663
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:46,654
there's nothing more valuable for the team than the lessons that they learned making

664
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:52,875
this stuff. So use the real team. Stick to the core player experience, okay? Follow the

665
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:56,916
player around. Force yourself to not cut. Don't take shortcuts.

666
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:02,336
It's not a trailer. You're not trying to sell this game with

667
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:05,817
this TGF. You're trying to inform the team, the whole team

668
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:07,857
and the company about what you're building. And if you do

669
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:12,258
those things, then this is not a waste of time. Especially if

670
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:15,319
you have nothing else to compare it to. If you have a game that

671
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:18,360
is a lot like your game, then you can often just point at that

672
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,241
and be like, well, like this but different. That can get you

673
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:23,901
through a lot. But if you're doing something new,

674
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:28,723
If you're working on a new IP and you've got ideas that you don't have good examples of,

675
00:34:29,104 --> 00:34:34,589
this is an incredibly useful tool for keeping people on track and aligned on the same idea.

676
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:36,611
Now, that's really expensive, right?

677
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:42,217
You're like, great, thanks a lot for rubbing it in our faces how big the budgets are at Ubisoft.

678
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:43,538
Thanks a lot, man, right?

679
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:47,101
Like, must be nice, right?

680
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:52,605
Well, we did that because we can, right?

681
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:54,726
But I'm gonna show you another clip

682
00:34:55,007 --> 00:34:58,328
that was actually the first TGF that we made.

683
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:00,830
And this clip, there's not gonna be any sound

684
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,411
on this video because we used a soundtrack

685
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:06,913
from Two Steps from Hell, which is a soundtrack group.

686
00:35:07,493 --> 00:35:09,895
And it's not, we didn't license it, right?

687
00:35:09,915 --> 00:35:10,995
It's all internal stuff.

688
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,276
So there's not gonna be any sound here.

689
00:35:12,496 --> 00:35:14,777
But this was made by one person, my animation director.

690
00:35:16,018 --> 00:35:17,199
And I'll talk you through what we got here.

691
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:18,800
Oops, hey, give me the thing.

692
00:35:20,254 --> 00:35:21,215
Give me my video.

693
00:35:21,976 --> 00:35:22,276
There it is.

694
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:23,177
Battle.

695
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:28,682
Imagine epic music.

696
00:35:29,423 --> 00:35:32,246
What we did is he went into, I think it was Maya.

697
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:32,886
Might have been Max.

698
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:37,070
And he stole a bunch of characters from Assassin's Creed

699
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:38,772
and posed them.

700
00:35:39,865 --> 00:35:43,967
in a series of vignettes. And then he just cut between them and moved the camera around

701
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:49,390
behind the round to try and get a feel for what this game might feel like.

702
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,252
And we chose sepia tone. Why? Because it's artistic and cool? No!

703
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:54,933
Because we didn't have to texture anything!

704
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:58,935
There was no work to be done! It was complete!

705
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:02,256
Because we didn't care about the texture at that point, right? We just wanted to get it done.

706
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,191
Now, that's not, there was more, it went on,

707
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,552
it had sort of a sense of loop,

708
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:09,313
but I just wanna use this as an example.

709
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,954
If you think creatively, you can do something

710
00:36:11,974 --> 00:36:14,436
that gives you 80% of the value that I just showed you,

711
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:18,698
of the previous thing, with 1% of the work, right?

712
00:36:19,018 --> 00:36:21,700
The point is, go through the thinking through it process.

713
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,241
So, never stop pitching, you're always pitching.

714
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,022
Hopefully by now I've convinced you of that.

715
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:29,204
Pitch your purpose, solve someone else's problem,

716
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:30,905
and describe the target.

717
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,283
Describe the target as accurately as you can.

718
00:36:34,323 --> 00:36:36,445
You've got a large team of people who need to be able

719
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,527
to make decisions when you're not in the room.

720
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:43,611
Last one, the last one and then there's two quick ones at the end.

721
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:45,572
Um, we're getting, we're alright, we're doing good.

722
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:49,615
Um, so, last, this one is a culture of play.

723
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:52,256
So now, where are we in the production?

724
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,077
We got the green light, yay!

725
00:36:54,138 --> 00:36:56,119
We did a bunch of prototypes, yay!

726
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:58,480
We made our TGF, we know where we're going, right?

727
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,121
Cool, this is good stuff.

728
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:01,242
Now we're making the game.

729
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:06,567
And while it's useful to see the TGF and know kind of what it's

730
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:08,629
going to look like and we get a feel for how we're going to play

731
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:12,714
it and we're making all these prototypes, there's an

732
00:37:12,754 --> 00:37:15,397
essential need that game developers have which is to

733
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:17,859
understand why their game is cool.

734
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:23,159
and to validate, to prove to themselves as often as they can

735
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:24,581
that what they're doing is working,

736
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:27,305
that they're succeeding today, not just in six months.

737
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:31,290
So the way we did this is instead of having milestones

738
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,412
on For Honor, we had tournaments.

739
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:37,734
Every three months we would all get together, we would have the

740
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:40,116
build and we would close the build. We would lock, stabilize

741
00:37:40,697 --> 00:37:43,819
the whole thing. And I can tell you the programmers were very

742
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:46,361
serious about being sure that the build was stable because

743
00:37:46,401 --> 00:37:49,204
they knew that on Friday the entire team was going to be

744
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:52,426
playing this game in a tournament and they didn't want

745
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:55,329
to be the one who was responsible for the game crashing

746
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:59,592
mid-match and then their friends coming over and being like, why

747
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:01,974
did they get it right? They put a lot of pressure on themselves

748
00:38:01,994 --> 00:38:02,395
to make it work.

749
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:04,601
But then we would sit and we would play.

750
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:07,062
And it was awesome.

751
00:38:07,442 --> 00:38:08,283
It was really fun.

752
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:11,084
I'm going to show you a quick video we made just to prove

753
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:11,864
that we actually did it.

754
00:38:12,264 --> 00:38:13,104
This is the actual team.

755
00:38:13,965 --> 00:38:14,745
So it's a quick video.

756
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:16,846
The end of the video that we made that shows the tournament.

757
00:38:16,866 --> 00:38:26,589
The two teams fighting for the championship are Hat and Crash

758
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:27,730
and the Pixel Shredder.

759
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,690
This is the second tournament.

760
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,091
You can see our.

761
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,747
Prototype running in the background there.

762
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:35,468
Yay, we're here.

763
00:38:35,488 --> 00:38:36,008
The champions of Warhammer.

764
00:38:36,028 --> 00:38:36,949
Yeah!

765
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,331
Let's go!

766
00:38:41,314 --> 00:38:43,297
The dev team would self-organize into teams,

767
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:46,060
and we would have just a, you know, normal tournament.

768
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:48,523
We'd have little trophies, and they would pass from team to team.

769
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:49,544
The trophies were great.

770
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:54,047
One of our devs took some clay one night and made a series of clay stick figures.

771
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:54,727
They were fantastic.

772
00:38:56,088 --> 00:38:57,729
So we played every week.

773
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,551
If you weren't playing every day, everyone would play on Friday,

774
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:02,172
and then every three months we would have a tournament.

775
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,614
And we were always playing the game,

776
00:39:04,694 --> 00:39:06,235
because for us, we were a multiplayer game.

777
00:39:06,475 --> 00:39:07,216
It was really important.

778
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:08,837
For a single-player game, you need to do it differently,

779
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:10,558
but the same idea applies.

780
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,099
Quick thing.

781
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,363
I mentioned Yanis Malat in the very beginning, the guy with the beady eyes, or the blue eyes.

782
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:20,165
He's so intense, ferocious, this guy.

783
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:26,549
I wanted to just give you a quick taste of what I was dealing with every day of my life.

784
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:27,990
So this is Yanis here in the middle.

785
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:29,932
In the tournament, we were playing against my team.

786
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:32,454
I'm on the left there, and they just won.

787
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:41,660
And I want to show you the grace and the modesty and the pure...

788
00:39:42,763 --> 00:39:43,084
Just.

789
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:51,406
Every day.

790
00:39:54,207 --> 00:39:54,447
So,

791
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:56,767
never stop pitching.

792
00:39:57,748 --> 00:39:59,908
Describe the target, culture of play.

793
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:02,189
The culture of play is one of the best ways

794
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:04,089
during the production to maintain it.

795
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:06,650
Of course you need to have all the other pillars in place

796
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,931
but it's a great way of maintaining and reinforcing it.

797
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,331
Alright we're getting near the end here, which is great.

798
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:16,467
There are two more tools that I want to mention quickly.

799
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:19,650
But one of them is obvious and you already know about them.

800
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,372
And the other one was, well, you'll see,

801
00:40:22,452 --> 00:40:23,513
is a talk that I gave already.

802
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:25,195
So the first one is key art.

803
00:40:25,515 --> 00:40:26,356
This is amazing.

804
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:26,976
You have to do this.

805
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:29,919
But duh.

806
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:33,582
So this was the very first image that my art director put

807
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,564
together that we all, when he came home one day

808
00:40:35,604 --> 00:40:39,387
from the weekend and had done this, and we all went, whoa.

809
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:43,520
That's our game, that's what we're doing.

810
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,501
It's really cool, right?

811
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,883
And I mean, if you've seen the collector's edition

812
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:49,105
that we released, it's literally that, right?

813
00:40:49,205 --> 00:40:51,286
It's three helmets together.

814
00:40:51,306 --> 00:40:52,768
It was an amazing way to communicate

815
00:40:52,788 --> 00:40:53,788
what we were trying to do.

816
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:54,929
This is the first image that we did.

817
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,472
This was an attempt to capture

818
00:40:58,492 --> 00:40:59,693
what made our fighting different.

819
00:41:00,254 --> 00:41:04,235
Um, because that style, that stance that that character is in comes from German Longsword

820
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:08,077
and is something that you don't see usually and there's kind of an intensity and a ferocity

821
00:41:08,097 --> 00:41:08,437
that's there.

822
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:14,020
The reason that that stance is so tense is because I'm, he dragged me into a corner and

823
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,103
took pictures of me and forced me to stand like that for several hours and the day after

824
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:22,504
we took that picture and he did a paint over, my back went out and I was on my back for

825
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:22,904
three days.

826
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:25,606
So I paid.

827
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:29,560
for that picture. But it really captured the essence of our fighting in some ways.

828
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,122
Our world, we did amazing stuff in this natural world with all this beauty.

829
00:41:34,043 --> 00:41:38,485
This was the first picture, the first time I saw a detailed render with all of

830
00:41:38,545 --> 00:41:41,827
our lighting stuff. When I came over to my art director's computer I said, why do

831
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:42,627
you have a photograph

832
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:46,570
of a sword and a shield on your screen? And then he turned the camera...

833
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:51,274
And I was like, well that's in the engine, oh my god.

834
00:41:51,294 --> 00:41:54,875
And I had this experience several times.

835
00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:59,036
So it really, we had been working on the look of the metal,

836
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:01,957
the look of the leather, this feel of aged material

837
00:42:02,017 --> 00:42:03,197
that we really wanted to capture,

838
00:42:03,297 --> 00:42:04,457
and it really guided us through.

839
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:08,078
So that's not my department, it's not my expertise.

840
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:10,059
We had an amazing art team, but of course,

841
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:14,800
key art is a crucial way for keeping people on track.

842
00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:16,741
Key art.

843
00:42:17,893 --> 00:42:18,394
Get some.

844
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:22,475
The last one I'll give you is this one,

845
00:42:22,515 --> 00:42:23,615
which is to know your audience.

846
00:42:24,955 --> 00:42:28,196
I gave a talk last year called The Engines of Play,

847
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:30,617
where I talked about, I don't know if you probably

848
00:42:30,637 --> 00:42:33,017
haven't seen it, but I talked about these things

849
00:42:33,057 --> 00:42:34,958
called taste maps and player motivation.

850
00:42:35,398 --> 00:42:38,418
We did this process, right, on the team.

851
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:39,979
I'm not gonna go through how we used it here

852
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:41,499
because that's what the talk was last year.

853
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:45,620
But it absolutely helps in defining

854
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,063
who you're making this game for and what they're going to get

855
00:42:49,143 --> 00:42:49,484
out of it.

856
00:42:50,024 --> 00:42:52,767
And that helps your design team enormously.

857
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,709
And it also helps your marketing team and your business team

858
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:57,331
understand how the design is going to work and function.

859
00:42:57,511 --> 00:42:59,373
But there's a whole other talk in the GDCP vault about that.

860
00:42:59,974 --> 00:43:01,335
So here we go.

861
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:07,821
Never stop pitching. I hope by now I've convinced you. Everything I was doing here was some

862
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:14,283
form of a pitch. The why is here in every one of these tools. Why are we doing tournaments?

863
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:18,024
Combat is an art form. I want you to understand combat. I want you to be in there and

864
00:43:18,044 --> 00:43:23,405
experiencing that art form every day as much as you can. Describe the target. TGF. So never

865
00:43:23,445 --> 00:43:24,986
stop pitching. Pitch your purpose.

866
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:27,899
Watch Simon Sinek's talk.

867
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:29,400
I know you probably think he's a dick.

868
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:29,941
He's not.

869
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:31,742
Or maybe he is, I don't care.

870
00:43:31,802 --> 00:43:33,082
He's smart, okay?

871
00:43:35,704 --> 00:43:36,304
I've never met him.

872
00:43:36,324 --> 00:43:37,165
I don't know.

873
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:40,967
Solve someone's problem, for honor happened

874
00:43:40,987 --> 00:43:43,709
because it solved like a lot of people's problem.

875
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:45,970
Not just because people believed in me.

876
00:43:47,623 --> 00:43:52,386
It's a great story, and my ego would love you to believe that I stood up in front of, you know,

877
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:58,050
Ubisoft, and that the brilliance of my genius is that that's not what fucking happened.

878
00:43:59,191 --> 00:44:04,295
That doesn't happen, right? And if they did do that, it would be a mistake, right?

879
00:44:04,635 --> 00:44:06,676
It should be more complex than that.

880
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:09,939
Describe the target clearly. Show your team where you're going.

881
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:11,940
Generate a culture of play. Play your own game.

882
00:44:13,348 --> 00:44:15,870
Make your key art so you know exactly what emotions

883
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:17,912
you want to evoke visually, how you're gonna do that,

884
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:18,873
and get to know your audience.

885
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:20,694
Last one I'm gonna do is this was,

886
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:23,577
I gave this presentation to Clint Hawking,

887
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:26,279
who was my advisor, and he pointed out at the end

888
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:28,941
something that there's one more reason,

889
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:31,844
there's one more place where all these pillars

890
00:44:31,944 --> 00:44:34,146
and all this pitch and all this work

891
00:44:35,026 --> 00:44:38,229
comes incredibly useful, and that is when you are

892
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:41,852
talking to your players, okay?

893
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:46,794
I showed you the TGF and I showed you the start,

894
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:48,615
that video is the way that the game starts.

895
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:50,957
That's how we did the same video,

896
00:44:51,057 --> 00:44:54,498
the same setup was on the stage at E3.

897
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,600
And all of my stuff about combat as an art form

898
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,242
and all that stuff about why I want to make this game,

899
00:45:00,342 --> 00:45:03,103
it's all in my interviews, right?

900
00:45:03,363 --> 00:45:04,324
And not just my interviews.

901
00:45:05,138 --> 00:45:07,040
This is Biazade's interviews, right?

902
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,042
When she goes on there and does her videos,

903
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:11,524
she sometimes does it better than me, right?

904
00:45:11,784 --> 00:45:13,886
These ideas spread, right?

905
00:45:14,206 --> 00:45:16,028
And if they're true, they're true.

906
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:18,530
They're gonna be as true to your business people

907
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,891
as they are to the players.

908
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:20,952
They should translate.

909
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:23,154
And so if you've gotten really honest

910
00:45:23,214 --> 00:45:24,355
about why you're making this game,

911
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:26,497
and as a creative leader, you need to be honest

912
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:27,998
about why you're making this game,

913
00:45:28,038 --> 00:45:30,360
because cynicism spreads, right?

914
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,261
You need to be honest.

915
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,603
If you've done that, then your players will hear.

916
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:35,829
the same vision that your team has heard,

917
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:38,714
and with any luck, it'll solve their problem too.

918
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:41,318
That's my talk.

919
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:44,343
I think we have time for a few questions,

920
00:45:44,443 --> 00:45:45,184
but thank you very much.

921
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:56,252
I think we've got 15 minutes, am I right?

922
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:58,294
We've got time for questions.

923
00:45:58,314 --> 00:45:59,255
Yo, questions.

924
00:45:59,515 --> 00:46:02,538
Hi, first of all, congratulations on the release.

925
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:05,881
Game picks ass, and it's super stable

926
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:07,482
and on all four wheels and running.

927
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:09,704
I have a question about key art.

928
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,227
What happens when you have...

929
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:17,192
key art that kicks ass and is awesome and is something very close to what you think

930
00:46:17,212 --> 00:46:23,215
that you want but you're not sure or you're maybe sure that it's not. It's really good key

931
00:46:23,255 --> 00:46:28,317
art but it doesn't show the destination that you want the team to be going towards.

932
00:46:28,717 --> 00:46:34,020
Well, two answers to that question. And it entirely depends on whether you're right or

933
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,461
wrong. So which is it?

934
00:46:37,568 --> 00:46:41,811
if okay let's see you're right or wrong you're right you're right the game doesn't want to go

935
00:46:41,831 --> 00:46:48,455
in that direction but the key art is saying that then you need to have a clear conversation with

936
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:53,979
your art team or your art director or whoever it is that is doing the art right um about these

937
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:58,662
values start at the values and say this is where i need to find where you think it's gone wrong

938
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:03,065
you you need to be able to as a creative leader you need to be able to illustrate to those people

939
00:47:03,285 --> 00:47:03,685
why

940
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:09,646
why you think it's off. You need to be able to do better than, well, I don't really get it. I

941
00:47:09,886 --> 00:47:14,648
just don't think this is right. And these tools, if you take the time to digest and really think

942
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:19,429
about your own personal why, what this game is about for you emotionally, and then you look at

943
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:24,170
what they've done, you should be able to identify why the emotions are different. Which is the

944
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:29,051
different emotion? And then talk about that. Talk about, well, I feel like this. This art makes me

945
00:47:29,091 --> 00:47:31,371
feel this way, but what I would like to feel is like this.

946
00:47:33,054 --> 00:47:34,915
The mistake that many people make is, I think,

947
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:38,676
is to ask for, is to give your team solutions

948
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:39,756
instead of problems.

949
00:47:42,918 --> 00:47:44,858
Everyone in the games industry, not everyone,

950
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:46,319
but almost everyone in the games industry

951
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:47,939
came in here because we're interested

952
00:47:47,979 --> 00:47:49,300
in solving difficult problems.

953
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,480
So if you have a team of people who are interested

954
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,521
in solving difficult problems,

955
00:47:52,921 --> 00:47:54,681
and then you walk up to them and you give them a solution,

956
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:57,082
what are they gonna do?

957
00:47:57,102 --> 00:48:00,323
You're gonna go, okay.

958
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:02,935
But if you walk up to them and you say,

959
00:48:02,975 --> 00:48:04,856
I have this problem, your art makes me feel like this

960
00:48:04,896 --> 00:48:05,797
and I need to feel like this,

961
00:48:06,277 --> 00:48:08,039
they're gonna be like, if they're interested

962
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:09,379
and if you've got good rapport with them,

963
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,402
they're gonna go, huh, I think I can do that.

964
00:48:13,002 --> 00:48:13,522
I'll show you.

965
00:48:15,384 --> 00:48:16,124
They'll give you something cool.

966
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:17,265
Thanks.

967
00:48:19,328 --> 00:48:19,529
Hey.

968
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:19,909
Yeah.

969
00:48:20,049 --> 00:48:20,249
Hi.

970
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:21,049
Yeah.

971
00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:24,570
Thank you for the amazing session, amazing talk.

972
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,951
I want to ask, how early in the development

973
00:48:28,011 --> 00:48:31,111
came this idea of mashing these different cultures together?

974
00:48:31,251 --> 00:48:36,633
And how this crazy idea that, well, everybody

975
00:48:36,653 --> 00:48:41,774
went along with it, and it came to the release?

976
00:48:41,934 --> 00:48:43,554
So you mean it's the Knights, Vikings, Samurai thing, yeah?

977
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:46,095
So Knights, Vikings, and Samurai.

978
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:47,595
What?

979
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:53,795
So what happened there was I came into the project with the desire to make the sword fighting

980
00:48:53,815 --> 00:49:00,517
part. From the beginning we were talking about what characters we could use. Who do we want to

981
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:05,258
be? Who do we want to be? And after a week or two of discussion along that track, the

982
00:49:05,298 --> 00:49:08,739
conversation was really like we should do samurai. I want to do this viking over here and

983
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:12,540
I want to do this knight. And we should do these things. Knight, viking, samurai, knight,

984
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:18,381
viking, samurai. I turned to my producer one day and I said, hey, Steph, what if?

985
00:49:20,312 --> 00:49:23,514
What if we did knights, vikings and samurai?

986
00:49:26,016 --> 00:49:27,477
And he looks at me and he's like,

987
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,819
I kind of love that.

988
00:49:33,441 --> 00:49:34,442
And he tried it out on people.

989
00:49:34,482 --> 00:49:36,243
He went around in the hall and he would try it out

990
00:49:36,283 --> 00:49:37,184
on people because he's like that.

991
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:38,485
He would go around and be like,

992
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:39,626
knights, vikings and samurai.

993
00:49:40,086 --> 00:49:42,228
And we just, it was so much fun.

994
00:49:42,388 --> 00:49:43,629
People just knew it.

995
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:44,590
They just loved it.

996
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,671
And the amazing thing about knights, vikings, samurai,

997
00:49:46,711 --> 00:49:47,652
yeah, let's do a quick test.

998
00:49:48,424 --> 00:49:50,105
I'll actually tell you why we're doing this.

999
00:49:50,165 --> 00:49:50,745
It'll show you why.

1000
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:53,847
Show of hands, knights, vikings, samurai, pick one.

1001
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:54,587
Show of hands, knights.

1002
00:49:56,728 --> 00:49:57,148
My people.

1003
00:49:58,269 --> 00:49:58,629
Vikings.

1004
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,030
Huah!

1005
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:02,451
Samurai.

1006
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:04,371
Always the most popular.

1007
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:06,232
Who did not raise their hand?

1008
00:50:07,073 --> 00:50:08,153
Who did not raise your hand?

1009
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,775
That's why we're doing knights versus samurai versus vikings.

1010
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:14,236
Everybody knows.

1011
00:50:15,576 --> 00:50:16,997
You picked when you were eight years old.

1012
00:50:23,235 --> 00:50:32,341
you. How did you keep a coherent vision for the game rather than just letting it become sort of

1013
00:50:32,501 --> 00:50:37,204
an interesting feature you came up with? Where did the, and when did the game come through

1014
00:50:37,264 --> 00:50:41,967
rather than just the combat system you thought? We, because we spent, we did it by spending the

1015
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:45,909
first 18 months of development almost exclusively on the combat system.

1016
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,071
We knew that this was going to be the breakthrough.

1017
00:50:48,091 --> 00:50:52,053
At Ubisoft, this moment is called a breakthrough.

1018
00:50:52,073 --> 00:50:53,854
It's something that we look for.

1019
00:50:54,814 --> 00:50:58,056
So there's a culture around Ubisoft for looking for things,

1020
00:50:58,496 --> 00:50:59,817
gameplay breakthroughs that are like this.

1021
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:03,119
And we knew that if we could crack this,

1022
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:05,040
that we would end up building the whole game around it

1023
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,701
because it would change melee combat in some ways for us.

1024
00:51:07,741 --> 00:51:10,122
So from the beginning it was clear that that's what we were going to do.

1025
00:51:11,703 --> 00:51:16,426
And we knew that we were going to be a new IP from the beginning.

1026
00:51:16,446 --> 00:51:19,067
So it was easy for us to define that from the start, right?

1027
00:51:19,187 --> 00:51:22,029
We weren't having to push other stuff out of the way.

1028
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:25,310
That's the nice thing about doing a new IP is that you have this blank slate.

1029
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,011
And so we were able to go, it's right there in the middle.

1030
00:51:27,492 --> 00:51:29,413
And then when other stuff would come in, we would be like,

1031
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:30,833
well, this needs to stay here in the center.

1032
00:51:30,874 --> 00:51:33,055
And then we were able to prevent that from happening.

1033
00:51:33,075 --> 00:51:33,515
It was nice.

1034
00:51:33,935 --> 00:51:35,776
There's other problems with having a new IP, though.

1035
00:51:36,276 --> 00:51:39,578
The most important one is, what's the genre of For Honor?

1036
00:51:41,049 --> 00:51:41,630
Does anyone know?

1037
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:42,871
Because I would like to know.

1038
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,736
It would be really useful for me to be able to tell people

1039
00:51:47,116 --> 00:51:47,677
what that is.

1040
00:51:47,697 --> 00:51:51,621
You have other problems when you're doing a new IP,

1041
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,784
but that's one of the great things about starting fresh.

1042
00:51:54,605 --> 00:51:54,805
Thanks.

1043
00:51:56,837 --> 00:51:58,118
Excellent talk, thank you very much for that.

1044
00:51:58,419 --> 00:52:00,081
I have a question about more details.

1045
00:52:00,281 --> 00:52:01,743
You talked about your weekly play test

1046
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:02,624
that you did on Friday.

1047
00:52:03,866 --> 00:52:05,608
About how long did you spend on that?

1048
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,070
Would it be the whole team at once?

1049
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:07,991
Would it be individuals?

1050
00:52:08,412 --> 00:52:12,237
And how did you balance that against deadline pressure?

1051
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:17,202
other studios with shorter times. So the answer is pretty

1052
00:52:17,222 --> 00:52:21,707
simple. We start at 4 o'clock and everybody plays. Actually we

1053
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:25,471
used to enforce that everyone plays. It used to be required.

1054
00:52:25,931 --> 00:52:27,693
But when the team got really big,

1055
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,362
we started to go, well, okay, maybe we don't have to have everyone play,

1056
00:52:33,402 --> 00:52:35,943
but you need to play every so often, and special cases were made.

1057
00:52:36,003 --> 00:52:41,366
So, we, and we would, the whole team would play from four to whenever the day was over,

1058
00:52:41,586 --> 00:52:44,367
and oftentimes people would stay and play until, you know, seven or whatever,

1059
00:52:44,387 --> 00:52:45,927
but they were just playing the game.

1060
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:50,869
The way we enforced it was because the producer, it was his idea.

1061
00:52:51,812 --> 00:52:54,515
Like, the producer was like, we're going to do this.

1062
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:58,738
Because he was, he was, he was, he had been on teams in the past

1063
00:52:58,778 --> 00:53:01,821
where the, where, where the team hadn't played their own game

1064
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:03,723
and he didn't like the results.

1065
00:53:04,163 --> 00:53:05,824
And so he was like, we're going to do this.

1066
00:53:06,145 --> 00:53:08,026
And so it was just in force. He just paid the cost.

1067
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:10,668
Steph just said, we're just going to pay that cost

1068
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:12,130
because it's part of my dev budget

1069
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,832
is having my team know what game they're making.

1070
00:53:15,495 --> 00:53:16,596
And so when you've got the producer

1071
00:53:16,616 --> 00:53:18,176
and the creative director and the technical director

1072
00:53:18,216 --> 00:53:19,297
and the art director all going,

1073
00:53:19,337 --> 00:53:20,598
this is what we're going to do everybody,

1074
00:53:20,858 --> 00:53:22,819
it's four o'clock, put your pencils down and start playing,

1075
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,640
it's a lot easier, right?

1076
00:53:26,962 --> 00:53:28,582
It's harder if you've got people who disagree,

1077
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,863
but in our case, that wasn't the case.

1078
00:53:30,203 --> 00:53:30,464
Thank you.

1079
00:53:30,644 --> 00:53:32,605
It was lucky, we were really lucky, yeah.

1080
00:53:32,665 --> 00:53:33,645
Thank you for the great talk.

1081
00:53:34,486 --> 00:53:35,987
My question is kind of more related

1082
00:53:36,007 --> 00:53:36,967
to the pitching part of it.

1083
00:53:37,087 --> 00:53:37,648
Yeah.

1084
00:53:38,268 --> 00:53:39,249
It's a two-part question.

1085
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:42,831
Did you, when you thought your idea was a brilliant idea.

1086
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:43,651
I never thought that.

1087
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:44,111
Oh, well.

1088
00:53:45,258 --> 00:53:49,361
I was terrified I would die and never have it out of my body.

1089
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:51,182
That was the only thing that I was worried about.

1090
00:53:51,502 --> 00:53:51,642
Oh.

1091
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:55,925
Well, the question was kind of, were you ever afraid that somebody who heard your idea was

1092
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,847
going to just take it and run with it?

1093
00:53:57,987 --> 00:53:58,307
Oh yeah.

1094
00:53:58,727 --> 00:54:01,910
And also, you know, what's the reality of that?

1095
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:05,932
You're actually pitching and then you're like, they're going to steal my idea, but instead

1096
00:54:05,972 --> 00:54:06,493
they're like, no.

1097
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:07,073
Great question.

1098
00:54:07,514 --> 00:54:07,694
Yeah.

1099
00:54:07,814 --> 00:54:08,074
Okay.

1100
00:54:08,394 --> 00:54:09,135
Well, okay.

1101
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:09,315
So.

1102
00:54:10,597 --> 00:54:15,981
I don't think you're going to like the answer. So here we go. Was I afraid that people would

1103
00:54:16,001 --> 00:54:22,545
steal my ideas? I spent ten years attending E3 going, please not this year. Please, I'm almost

1104
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:31,571
there. Please, please don't be, this is not the year. Please, no. The year before we announced,

1105
00:54:32,432 --> 00:54:38,616
I was at the Xbox, the Microsoft show, right? You know what the first game was?

1106
00:54:39,522 --> 00:54:40,464
at the Xbox show that year?

1107
00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:42,728
Rise, son of Rome.

1108
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:50,283
I thought, oh my god, that was a dark five minutes right there, right?

1109
00:54:50,784 --> 00:54:52,705
Like, oh no!

1110
00:54:52,725 --> 00:54:56,909
No, it was terrifying. I was absolutely terrified that someone would get there.

1111
00:54:57,209 --> 00:54:59,291
But the thing is, you don't own your designs.

1112
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:03,594
Design is not copyrightable. It's just an idea. It's a form, right?

1113
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:04,135
You don't own it.

1114
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:10,700
And I, what I wanted to do was I had this idea about how to get melee combat into video games

1115
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,742
and I actually didn't care how it got there.

1116
00:55:14,072 --> 00:55:17,174
If somebody else had the opportunity to build it, great!

1117
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:19,195
Because I wanted to play the game, right?

1118
00:55:19,956 --> 00:55:20,676
That was my goal.

1119
00:55:21,457 --> 00:55:23,818
So I told everyone, and of course I was afraid

1120
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:25,980
I wouldn't have a chance to make it, of course I was.

1121
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:29,062
But I had to just trust that if I was the right guy

1122
00:55:29,082 --> 00:55:32,264
to do it, if I was the best choice to lead that project,

1123
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:34,285
that it would happen, right?

1124
00:55:34,746 --> 00:55:35,066
For 10 years.

1125
00:55:38,472 --> 00:55:43,496
And so I took a gamble and I told everyone I could ever tell I told everyone who would listen right?

1126
00:55:43,576 --> 00:55:46,418
I think all my friends got sick of it. They're like yeah, we know you want to make a melee game

1127
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:47,659
We know like we get it

1128
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:50,982
Right

1129
00:55:52,272 --> 00:55:52,793
My friends here.

1130
00:55:54,773 --> 00:55:58,115
So the answer is you can't own it, you can't protect yourself, not with design.

1131
00:55:58,635 --> 00:55:59,796
Art is copyrightable, right?

1132
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:04,058
And, you know, the implementation, the engines, I mean, the code,

1133
00:56:04,078 --> 00:56:05,139
you own the code that you write, right?

1134
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:08,120
But design is ephemeral, it's ideas, right?

1135
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:11,001
And that, you know, you can disagree whether or not,

1136
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:13,002
like you can agree or disagree if that's a good thing.

1137
00:56:13,122 --> 00:56:14,463
It is the state of the world right now.

1138
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:15,323
So...

1139
00:56:16,761 --> 00:56:22,146
Yeah, it can happen. It sucks when it gets stolen. It's a horrible thing. In this case, I would

1140
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:27,030
happily have played someone else's melee game that used this system. Would have been great.

1141
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,792
All right. Thank you.

1142
00:56:28,812 --> 00:56:29,112
Yeah.

1143
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:34,397
Hey, so first off, when I'm not working, I'm main Lawbringer.

1144
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:35,458
Hey, Lawbringer.

1145
00:56:35,498 --> 00:56:37,760
Be mindful.

1146
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,520
I play Warden.

1147
00:56:40,134 --> 00:56:45,518
Okay. So long as you're not a warlord, I'm okay. No, so you

1148
00:56:45,558 --> 00:56:50,261
touched on this earlier with how For Honor being a relative, I

1149
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:54,605
mean, it's a unique gameplay style. So from when you're

1150
00:56:54,645 --> 00:57:00,429
trying to pitch that externally to potential players, I mean, do

1151
00:57:00,449 --> 00:57:03,471
you try to make the sale entirely based off of

1152
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,756
the feeling of the game since you can't articulate it through

1153
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:13,198
oh it's like dark souls plus XYZ. So the way that we did that

1154
00:57:13,258 --> 00:57:15,779
actually we knew from the beginning that you had to play

1155
00:57:15,819 --> 00:57:19,240
this game to understand it. To really get what the appeal was

1156
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,982
you needed to play it. But again you pick up the poster or you

1157
00:57:23,002 --> 00:57:25,963
pick up the box in the store or you download it you're not

1158
00:57:26,003 --> 00:57:28,944
playing it. So it's a problem. How do we overcome that? That's

1159
00:57:28,964 --> 00:57:30,645
what the knights and the vikings and the samurai are for.

1160
00:57:32,373 --> 00:57:34,514
Those three factions are the portal into the game.

1161
00:57:34,714 --> 00:57:36,475
That's the blue door, right, of magic,

1162
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:38,496
that we were like, hey, Night Viking Samurai,

1163
00:57:38,536 --> 00:57:39,877
come on in, you can be a warrior.

1164
00:57:41,078 --> 00:57:42,239
It's a pretty good pitch, right?

1165
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,580
So that was the lure, right?

1166
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,260
We're like, come on in.

1167
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,021
That's the thing that we're playing.

1168
00:57:47,182 --> 00:57:48,542
And then when they step through the door,

1169
00:57:48,582 --> 00:57:50,704
the very first thing we do is we hand them a controller.

1170
00:57:51,104 --> 00:57:51,284
Right?

1171
00:57:51,864 --> 00:57:52,325
Now play it!

1172
00:57:53,057 --> 00:57:54,478
and they're, oh, hey, this is cool.

1173
00:57:54,498 --> 00:57:55,339
And it's a surprise.

1174
00:57:56,379 --> 00:57:57,540
But normally people like it, right?

1175
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,321
And so it works out.

1176
00:57:59,461 --> 00:58:02,924
That was why we announced 2 and 1 half years before we started.

1177
00:58:02,964 --> 00:58:04,004
We had two E3s.

1178
00:58:04,324 --> 00:58:05,925
The first one was our multiplayer one.

1179
00:58:05,965 --> 00:58:10,108
And we had a 4v4 demo on the floor, running on PS4.

1180
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:12,329
We had 1,000 people come to the booth.

1181
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,151
And then we did the same thing at Gamescom.

1182
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:15,852
And we did the same thing on the next year.

1183
00:58:16,232 --> 00:58:18,653
And the whole PR and marketing push

1184
00:58:18,694 --> 00:58:20,094
has been about play the game.

1185
00:58:20,855 --> 00:58:22,216
So that when the game came out.

1186
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:26,737
If you picked up the box in the store and went,

1187
00:58:26,797 --> 00:58:28,757
nice versus Viking versus Samurai, that's weird.

1188
00:58:29,858 --> 00:58:31,959
Is this cool, hardcore friend?

1189
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,080
Hardcore friend would go, yeah.

1190
00:58:38,321 --> 00:58:39,502
Or, you know, nah, stupid.

1191
00:58:39,762 --> 00:58:40,642
I mean, who knows?

1192
00:58:40,822 --> 00:58:42,423
But they would have an opinion, right?

1193
00:58:42,443 --> 00:58:46,285
Because we knew that's how the word would get out at first.

1194
00:58:46,325 --> 00:58:47,425
And then once you tried it, it would be okay.

1195
00:58:47,445 --> 00:58:48,546
That's why we had a big open beta.

1196
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:50,707
We had five and a half million players in our open beta.

1197
00:58:51,407 --> 00:58:51,867
Amazing.

1198
00:58:53,022 --> 00:58:55,145
or like six, anyway, lots, many.

1199
00:58:55,946 --> 00:58:56,627
So that's how we did it.

1200
00:58:56,927 --> 00:58:58,749
Yeah, so basically in that case,

1201
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,332
rather than try and get bogged down in

1202
00:59:00,652 --> 00:59:01,253
No, the details.

1203
00:59:01,273 --> 00:59:02,174
Nitty gritty, it's just like,

1204
00:59:02,194 --> 00:59:04,197
no, no, no, just bypass the question entirely.

1205
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:04,918
Build a portal.

1206
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:05,979
Build a portal.

1207
00:59:05,999 --> 00:59:07,021
Build a portal of invitation.

1208
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:07,942
Right, what's the fantasy?

1209
00:59:08,322 --> 00:59:08,883
Warrior fantasy.

1210
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:16,445
Hey, so you were talking about these business cases and you were showing all these different

1211
00:59:16,485 --> 00:59:16,785
games.

1212
00:59:16,885 --> 00:59:20,428
You also mentioned that it took about five years to develop this game.

1213
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:25,073
So as you guys were developing this game, many other games come out.

1214
00:59:25,593 --> 00:59:31,719
So looking at all these other games, do they encourage or discourage any of the creative

1215
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:33,961
decisions that you take while in development?

1216
00:59:36,444 --> 00:59:39,508
What we were doing was so new. We learned early on with

1217
00:59:39,528 --> 00:59:42,312
for honor, I think we have time for just two more questions.

1218
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:43,854
What we learned was that we

1219
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:51,773
Stuff that worked really well in other games, if we tried to reproduce it in our game,

1220
00:59:52,313 --> 00:59:54,494
there was a 50-50 chance it would fall on its face.

1221
00:59:55,454 --> 01:00:00,256
Because the base assumptions of the gameplay was so different in what we were doing,

1222
01:00:00,656 --> 01:00:03,977
we had to kind of throw out a lot of our expectations about what would work and what wouldn't.

1223
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,918
So we learned to get really careful.

1224
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:09,639
about where we were drawing our inspirations from

1225
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:12,520
because it led to wasting a bunch of time.

1226
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,580
And we didn't have much time to waste.

1227
01:00:15,461 --> 01:00:18,441
So we of course were playing everything all along the way,

1228
01:00:18,461 --> 01:00:19,742
but what we were doing was so different

1229
01:00:19,762 --> 01:00:21,903
that it was hard for us to draw

1230
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:23,703
direct inspiration from other people.

1231
01:00:23,723 --> 01:00:26,304
We have two more.

1232
01:00:26,344 --> 01:00:26,964
Thank you.

1233
01:00:27,084 --> 01:00:27,404
Hello sir.

1234
01:00:27,464 --> 01:00:27,864
Oh, are we done?

1235
01:00:28,445 --> 01:00:29,505
Oh, we're done, okay, so we're done.

1236
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,265
Thank you very much for your time.

1237
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:32,286
Yay!

1238
01:00:32,826 --> 01:00:33,066
Good one.
