1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,703
Digital board games are fortunate to ride on the shoulders of giants.

2
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:18,767
Their source material often has thousands of fans, millions of hours of gameplay, robust

3
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:25,411
rule sets, well-developed art styles, all before a digital version has even been conceived.

4
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:30,174
But despite these advantages, bringing a beloved board game to the digital realm has its share

5
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:31,695
of challenges.

6
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:37,058
Players are going to demand features like asynchronous gameplay and robust AI opponents.

7
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:40,510
These are features that might not have been considered

8
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,251
in the original board game design.

9
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,374
Features like tactility and table talk

10
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,835
are difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce online.

11
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:50,778
But digital adaptations can offer

12
00:00:50,778 --> 00:00:52,379
some unique features of their own.

13
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,962
So things like real-time bookkeeping,

14
00:00:56,962 --> 00:01:00,165
embedded rules references, and contextual prompts.

15
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:03,347
These are some of the tricks from the TempleGates

16
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:05,969
games toolbox in digitizing some of our favorite board games

17
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:06,850
like Race for the Galaxy.

18
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,268
Roll for the Galaxy and Ascension,

19
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:11,149
and hopefully some of these will apply to your games

20
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:11,749
that you're working on.

21
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:13,510
Just to give a little bit of context,

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,011
this is Race for the Galaxy.

23
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:20,052
It's an engine-building card game set in space,

24
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:22,533
where players are playing cards

25
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:23,773
to place developments,

26
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:25,114
settle worlds,

27
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:26,854
and build the most prosperous empire.

28
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:27,914
This game was designed by Tom Lehman,

29
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,940
who is in the back there, he's pretty cool,

30
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,162
and published by Rio Grande,

31
00:01:44,162 --> 00:01:46,064
and it's since sold about a million copies

32
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,284
and more around the world.

33
00:01:47,284 --> 00:01:50,546
And my team has been responsible for digitizing this

34
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:53,148
for PC, tablet, and mobile.

35
00:01:53,148 --> 00:01:56,030
So three things you're gonna think about

36
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,791
when you're digitizing board games,

37
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,732
source, quality, and delivery.

38
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,293
Your source, what is the game

39
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:03,074
that you're gonna be choosing?

40
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:04,295
Quality, what are the features

41
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:05,856
that are gonna go into that game?

42
00:02:05,856 --> 00:02:08,398
And delivery, how are you gonna deliver those features?

43
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:11,118
So for Source, how are you choosing the game?

44
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:16,122
Realistically, this is going to be based on licensing rights.

45
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:20,806
But that being said, what's fun in an analog board game is

46
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:23,388
going to be really different from what's fun in a digital

47
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:23,988
board game.

48
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:25,930
So not all games are going to translate well.

49
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,592
It's going to be a subset of board games that are out there

50
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:30,574
that are still going to be fun on your phone.

51
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:35,958
So things like having one player feel like the expert

52
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,639
for 15 minutes as they're explaining the game to their

53
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,020
friends.

54
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:41,049
That's not really practical online.

55
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,489
Most of your online players are already going to know how

56
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,850
to play the game, or they're going to just jump into a

57
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,371
tutorial when they pick up the game on the App Store.

58
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:52,912
Also, tactility.

59
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:56,233
So those gorgeous glassy gems or pewter tokens that you're

60
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:59,634
rolling around in your fingers between turns, those are not

61
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:00,554
available online.

62
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:01,515
And those are really fun.

63
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,196
You're not going to be able to be upgrading your components

64
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:06,936
with things like a broken token.

65
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:12,593
Or painting minis online.

66
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:17,296
So you want to choose a game that's not wholly reliant on

67
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:19,678
these physical game features.

68
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:22,539
A game like Super Fight, in which you have players arguing

69
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:25,041
back and forth about who would win an imaginary battle

70
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,103
between characters, that's really reliant on Table Talk.

71
00:03:28,103 --> 00:03:31,345
And ironically, Table Talk is a feature that mobile board

72
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,487
games are not really great at, which is surprising because

73
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:35,428
phones are used for talking.

74
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:37,609
But players don't necessarily want to be chatting with each

75
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:38,790
other on a mobile game.

76
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:43,515
It's expensive to moderate and players are not expecting the chat.

77
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,476
Or a game like Mancala.

78
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:49,179
This is a game where you're going to be reaching into the cubbies and distributing tokens around

79
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:49,560
a board.

80
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,843
And that feels really good, but if you have no tactility, because you're missing that,

81
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:57,186
is there enough still left to make a digital board game out of it?

82
00:03:57,186 --> 00:04:02,930
And you want to lean into a game that's going to really rely on the features that are fun

83
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,592
in a digital space.

84
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:05,853
So things like AI.

85
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,494
Things like asynchronous gameplay.

86
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,143
So Race for the Galaxy is a Tableau builder,

87
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:14,625
which means you're playing a bunch of cards in succession

88
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,026
as permanent cards.

89
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:18,987
Those cards have a lot of information on them.

90
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:22,609
And that means that the AI can look at that information

91
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:26,331
and make meaningful predictions based on that information

92
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:28,152
with high degrees of surety.

93
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:31,374
And so that's a game that really works well with an AI.

94
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:33,415
That's in contrast to something like a deck builder.

95
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,817
like another game I've worked on, Ascension,

96
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:39,000
because in the deck builder, a lot of that information

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,262
is going to be hidden away in a player's hand,

98
00:04:41,262 --> 00:04:42,804
or it's going to be random through the deck.

99
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:44,746
So you might have performance issues with your AI

100
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:46,107
trying to make predictions there.

101
00:04:46,107 --> 00:04:49,191
So choosing a game that takes advantage of these features

102
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:52,314
takes advantage of things like asynchronous.

103
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,572
Your players, so asynchronous gameplay can be kind of controversial.

104
00:04:57,572 --> 00:05:02,094
Some people think that board games are meant to be played at a table with people in real

105
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:06,055
time and I think there's a lot of value to playing that way, but realistically if you're

106
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,137
digitizing a board game, many of your players are going to want to play asynchronously.

107
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:15,059
If they're stacking up games five or ten games deep, you want to make sure that those games

108
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,700
do not feel repetitive to the player.

109
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:20,748
So one way you can avoid that repetition

110
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:24,069
is choosing a game that has really different end game

111
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:24,589
states.

112
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:27,870
So in Race for the Galaxy, you might

113
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,190
have a rush military state at the end of the game,

114
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,311
and that's how you win.

115
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:34,251
Or you might build up a production engine.

116
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,052
And there's a lot of different kinds

117
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:37,252
of strategies towards winning.

118
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:39,352
If you're going to have a different end game state,

119
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:42,473
it probably means that on your way to getting there,

120
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:43,373
it was different as well.

121
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:45,413
So the path is going to be variant as well.

122
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:48,886
So Rays sometimes feels like a complex game,

123
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:51,308
but in actuality, you're not making a lot

124
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:53,269
of different decisions at once.

125
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,852
It's more of a stream of isolated decisions as you play,

126
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:58,973
and it doesn't matter if you haven't played the game

127
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:00,014
or if you're not familiar with it,

128
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:02,596
but it's just a stream of isolated decisions

129
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,738
because the game is broken up into phases.

130
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:09,320
So you're making a choice, then you're executing it,

131
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,262
then you make another choice, then you execute,

132
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:12,583
then you make another choice.

133
00:06:13,158 --> 00:06:16,759
And what that looks like in the game is, let's say the player's choosing an action.

134
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,681
They can choose explore, develop, settle, consume, trade, or produce.

135
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:20,841
They say they chose develop.

136
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:23,702
They choose develop, then execute.

137
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:26,764
Then they choose what card are they going to develop, then execute.

138
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:29,665
Then they choose how are they going to pay for that development.

139
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:30,705
What cards are they discarding?

140
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:32,326
And then they execute.

141
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:36,788
Because of that path, that stream of decisions, you can add a prompt into your game.

142
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:40,750
The prompt is going to tell them during the execution what they're supposed to be doing.

143
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:43,257
And this is really good for digital board games

144
00:06:43,257 --> 00:06:45,038
for a couple reasons.

145
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,219
One, it reduces analysis paralysis.

146
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:50,660
But two, it's really great for those asynchronous players who

147
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,422
have stacked up a lot of games at the same time

148
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:55,743
so they can come back and see what they were trying to do.

149
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,204
It just softens that re-entry for them.

150
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:01,685
This is in contrast to a game like Command and Conquer.

151
00:07:01,685 --> 00:07:03,526
Now, it's not a board game, but it

152
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:07,368
has a really different sort of path to play.

153
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:08,148
In Command and Conquer.

154
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,591
You can open up the build menu, and you

155
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:11,872
might have hundreds of choices of what

156
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:12,993
building you're going to make.

157
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:16,054
And that's not really necessarily related

158
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:18,015
to the next choice that you make in the game.

159
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,956
So there isn't this stream of choices.

160
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,616
And so it might be more difficult for a game

161
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:24,097
like that to offer a prompt that tells the player what

162
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:26,779
to do next, because it's not necessarily clear what

163
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,799
they're trying to do next.

164
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:30,100
So that's a little bit on how to choose a game that you're

165
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,020
going to digitize.

166
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,382
Quality, what are the features that you

167
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:37,143
want to implement in your digital version?

168
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,786
There's a lot of really neat features that you can get away

169
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:42,548
with digitally that you can't in an analog game.

170
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:48,492
One thing I see players who play board games, one thing I

171
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:51,835
see them do over and over, and I do this myself too, is they

172
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:54,436
don't take advantage fully of the abilities that they've

173
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:55,457
accrued throughout the game.

174
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:58,900
A lot of times this happens to new players, because there's a

175
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,520
lot of information.

176
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,602
It's a lot to juggle, and you might forget something.

177
00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:06,225
So if you have a card like Interstellar Bank.

178
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,900
in Race for the Galaxy in play in your Tableau.

179
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,502
This means any time any player has activated the

180
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:13,704
second phase, you're gonna get to draw a card.

181
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:16,507
Now, players might forget this if they're playing around

182
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,028
the kitchen table with their friends.

183
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:20,370
But digitally, you can just draw the card for

184
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,972
them.

185
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:23,914
Or, you have a choice as a developer if

186
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:27,477
you want to, if you, once you can prompt them

187
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,058
to draw the card.

188
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:30,680
So you're gonna make that decision because

189
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:34,912
You're going to want to have a balance between how much you're automating for the players

190
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:36,713
and how much you're letting them do themselves.

191
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:40,377
But either way you solve it, your players are going to have confidence that they're

192
00:08:40,377 --> 00:08:44,660
not going to accidentally screw themselves out of a win because they've accidentally

193
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,905
made an illegal omission of following the rules.

194
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:55,810
Another thing I see happening over and over with people is that they just learn the rules

195
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,410
of the game wrong.

196
00:08:57,292 --> 00:09:00,894
board games are often taught by a player to another player

197
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,795
who might teach their friends, who might teach their friends.

198
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:06,457
And because of that oral tradition in learning the game,

199
00:09:06,457 --> 00:09:09,579
little mutations in the rules can sneak in.

200
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,961
And I can't tell you how many emails I get about bugs

201
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,942
in Race for the Galaxy where it just turns out

202
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:16,803
that people have been playing the game wrong for years

203
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:17,984
and they didn't realize it.

204
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:22,426
But, you know, those emails are really helpful

205
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,047
because they can help you identify pain points.

206
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,589
So in Race for the Galaxy.

207
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,439
This one in particular came up a bunch, where players were confused on why they couldn't

208
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:32,880
play a particular card.

209
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,723
Now, the rules of the game state that if you already have a card in your tableau, you can't

210
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:37,904
play an identical copy of it.

211
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:44,010
But by paying attention to where people were confused, I was able to patch in this treatment,

212
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,691
which is a little bit of a dimming out.

213
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,493
And that just manages expectations.

214
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:48,954
Players see it's dimmed out.

215
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:50,575
When they try to drag it into play, it doesn't work.

216
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:52,397
But they can see there's a reason it didn't work.

217
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:53,378
It was dim.

218
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,152
And there is kind of a bonus feature in this, in that when

219
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:59,052
players are trying to figure out what are they going to

220
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:02,534
discard, they can just easily discard any dimmed cards.

221
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:03,634
They don't even have to read them.

222
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:06,495
They know these are not going to be legal cards to play in

223
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:07,095
the future.

224
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:11,197
So what other features should you be implementing in your

225
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:12,017
digital board games?

226
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:13,818
You don't have to be creative.

227
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:16,839
Your players are going to tell you exactly what they want.

228
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,680
So David Newman on statelyplay.com posted this

229
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,881
multiplayer manifesto.

230
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,154
It details about 20 different features

231
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:26,496
that are seen as baseline mandatory to include

232
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:28,178
in any multiplayer board game.

233
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:32,121
These are things like ELO, log, server status, timers,

234
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:34,263
notifications, et cetera.

235
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:37,045
So we hadn't planned to implement all of these features

236
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:40,928
when we first rolled out our Race for the Galaxy schedule.

237
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:43,330
But we posted the beta to boardgamegeek.com,

238
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,112
and the resounding response from the community

239
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,254
was that they wanted more of these multiplayer features.

240
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:51,077
So we ended up spending about four more months.

241
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:55,465
developing these and it was over half of our development time on these features.

242
00:10:55,465 --> 00:11:01,867
If you're following this manifesto and you're implementing features like asynchronous gameplay,

243
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:07,969
you're going to have players who are stacking up those games at once and you want to support

244
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:11,830
players being able to seamlessly glide from one game to the next.

245
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,852
So they can enter a game, take their turn, they're waiting for their multiplayer opponent

246
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:20,613
to take a turn, just hit a next game button to take the next turn.

247
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,704
wait, next game, et cetera.

248
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:25,344
And the question came up, what do you

249
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:29,105
do when a player has no more multiplayer games queued up?

250
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:33,886
There's a couple things you could do as a developer.

251
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:34,806
Oh, shoot, I should plug in my battery.

252
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:39,227
There's a couple things that you should do as a developer.

253
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:41,987
You can, hopefully it's fine.

254
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:51,847
You can either prompt them to create a new multiplayer game.

255
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:54,768
And that's great, because you are

256
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:56,929
going to want to populate your multiplayer lobby with lots

257
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:58,629
of games for lots of players to join into.

258
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:03,971
But there's actually kind of a cap on the capacity of games

259
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:05,751
your players are willing to play at once.

260
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:08,132
There's a sweet spot somewhere between five and 10 games.

261
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:11,493
They don't really want to be juggling more strategies.

262
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:13,054
It's a little much.

263
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:14,554
So you can pop them into an AI game.

264
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,100
And at first I thought about, well, do I want to open up a

265
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,462
configuration screen where they can choose what expansions to

266
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:24,483
play or how many players they want to play against.

267
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:30,486
But I ended up just implementing a very seamless,

268
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:33,427
popping them into a game that uses the last configuration of

269
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:34,608
a game that they played.

270
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:36,449
So it sort of just glides them into something.

271
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:37,809
They don't have to think about it.

272
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,490
And that will just let them take turns while they're

273
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,371
waiting for the next multiplayer opponent.

274
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:42,291
And I thought that worked out OK.

275
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:47,076
So what are you going to do with all these different

276
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:49,517
stacks of multiplayer games that are accruing?

277
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:51,218
Are you going to display those to your players?

278
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:52,839
Are you going to put them in the lobby?

279
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,340
At first I thought, no, I don't think so, because that's

280
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,200
just going to be spam.

281
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,301
It's going to be a lot of information.

282
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:00,462
People can't necessarily engage with a game that's

283
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:01,423
already in progress.

284
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:03,104
But I've since changed my mind.

285
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:08,566
Because what happens is if your matchmaking code is doing

286
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:11,187
a good job at sweeping players quickly into a game,

287
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:16,850
then the games fill up really quickly and you don't have a lot of games there so if you had

288
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,313
a new player who just steps into the lobby there might not look like there's a lot of games going

289
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:28,038
on. And so you're broadcasting an artificially low level of activity to your player community.

290
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:33,322
So since then I've started adding more of the multiplayer games into your player lobby. And

291
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:37,926
I see this kind of stuff everywhere now. I see it in Magic matchmaking, I see it in server lists,

292
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:38,767
I see these games you

293
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:41,453
have absolutely zero functionality.

294
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,034
You can't join them as a spectator.

295
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:44,655
You can't join them as a player.

296
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:47,958
But it broadcasts an activity level that encourages your

297
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,799
community, feels more vibrant, and I recommend doing it.

298
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,161
So after implementing all these features from the

299
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:56,223
multiplayer manifesto, at least half of our code has

300
00:13:56,223 --> 00:14:00,306
been dedicated to things like Friends List, storing

301
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,007
asynchronous game data, Elo.

302
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,948
Did it work out?

303
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:04,629
Was it a good idea?

304
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:09,554
At launch, only 5% of our players were engaging with multiplayer.

305
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:12,175
So we had ended up spending about half of our development

306
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:15,557
time on something that only a very, very small minority of

307
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,498
people were actually using.

308
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:19,599
And that was a pretty big bummer.

309
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,080
Eventually, that number has grown to 25%.

310
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,141
And it's still growing.

311
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:27,664
I definitely do recommend investing in these features.

312
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:32,446
Because even though this is a vocal minority, these players

313
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,247
are going to be the ones who are driving your community

314
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:35,548
forward, they're going to be the ones who are

315
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,212
posting tournaments.

316
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:41,694
They're going to be the ones who are posting YouTube videos

317
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:45,955
and moderating your forums and posting a lot of stuff that's

318
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:48,556
going to encourage your community to thrive.

319
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:51,317
That being said, if 95% of your players are playing in AI

320
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:54,678
games at launch, you're going to need to have a really

321
00:14:54,678 --> 00:14:57,959
robust AI to encourage that replayability of the game.

322
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,120
This is something we do with temporal difference learning.

323
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,061
Our AI is driven by a neural network.

324
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:04,722
If you're interested in more about that, I'm going to

325
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:08,276
chat a little bit more at 440 today about that.

326
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:11,957
But either way, I definitely encourage you to check out

327
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:13,338
kelden.net slash rftg.

328
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:18,659
This is the open source neural network AI that we used in

329
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:19,360
Race for the Galaxy.

330
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,040
If you're working on a digital board game, it's something that

331
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,202
you can look at the code and see if this is something

332
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:25,922
that's right for your game.

333
00:15:25,922 --> 00:15:29,623
All right, and finally, delivery.

334
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:32,444
So how best to deliver some of these features I've been

335
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:33,184
talking about?

336
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:36,754
First I'll talk a little bit about animation.

337
00:15:36,754 --> 00:15:39,656
You have a trade-off between speed and legibility

338
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:40,596
in your games.

339
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:42,197
You have to figure out how fast you're

340
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:43,217
going to animate everything.

341
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:46,879
If a lot of your players are playing against AI opponents,

342
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,340
how fast are you going to show those AI opponent moves?

343
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:51,880
And what are you going to show?

344
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,942
If we paused by the onesies and showed every single victory

345
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:57,564
point shit, or every single card that was acquired by a

346
00:15:57,564 --> 00:15:59,285
player, it would be really monotonous.

347
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:02,328
And actually, a lot of board game apps do this.

348
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,228
And we started this way.

349
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,990
We had a script that executed, and we would just show every

350
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,252
little thing flying across the screen one at a time.

351
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:11,174
Then I asked myself to dig a little deeper.

352
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:13,076
What are we trying to communicate

353
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:14,637
with these animations?

354
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:16,758
If you think about sitting around a kitchen table playing

355
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,800
board games with your friends, there's animations there.

356
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,541
You see.

357
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,413
when the cards are dealt out to each player.

358
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:25,974
That's the initialization of the game.

359
00:16:25,974 --> 00:16:29,196
Or you see maybe when the deck is depleted

360
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,357
and you have to reshuffle it.

361
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,018
Maybe that's like the halfway point of the game

362
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:33,779
and that's a signal to your players

363
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,620
of a state change in the game.

364
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,923
So, Race for the Galaxy has simultaneous turns

365
00:16:39,923 --> 00:16:40,563
if you've played.

366
00:16:40,563 --> 00:16:44,446
You know that every player is doing their turns at once

367
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:46,507
and as a UI designer, it kind of feels like this.

368
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:46,987
It's just like.

369
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:51,518
sort of crazy intersection where victory points and cards are flying all around.

370
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:56,120
And trying to make that clear what's going on to your players has been a challenge.

371
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,961
So we we came up with a system of locking attention tokens.

372
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:04,382
And what this really does is it helps us triage the events in the game

373
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:07,323
to focus on vignettes, to focus on the moments

374
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:09,344
that really matter to the player.

375
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:10,764
So if you have something.

376
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:12,705
that is a really important moment.

377
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:16,467
Let's say the AI is going to take over one of my worlds.

378
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,247
That's a really big moment.

379
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:18,968
I want the player to pay attention to that.

380
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:23,050
That event grabs the main attention token and locks it.

381
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,051
And no other event that would grab that main attention token

382
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:26,692
can proceed.

383
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:29,833
They get queued up behind it until that event has finished

384
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,734
animating, and then the next things can go forward.

385
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:36,636
At the same time, there are a system of lesser attention

386
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:40,258
tokens for things like the draw deck and the victory point

387
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:40,478
pool.

388
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:44,524
And these can proceed forward without detracting

389
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:46,105
from the main vignette that you're showing.

390
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:49,747
So you can see here, as the cards are drawn

391
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:52,068
into the player's tableau, nothing else major

392
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:53,729
is happening at that one moment.

393
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:56,991
But even when you're doing this triage,

394
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,232
if you do a system of locking attention tokens

395
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:01,333
like we've done, you have to figure out

396
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,015
how fast you're going to animate things.

397
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:06,897
A lot of people working on digital board games

398
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:08,517
have a video game background.

399
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:08,998
I worked on.

400
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:12,359
Spore, SimCity, and the Sims.

401
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,162
And I think that's probably pretty common.

402
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,384
And we know, as video game developers,

403
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:21,826
how to make pretty animations and 3D characters

404
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:23,788
and clever dialogue.

405
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:26,370
But for board games, a lot of that stuff

406
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,471
really gets kind of in the way.

407
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:31,013
Your players that are stacking up their asynchronous games

408
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:33,395
are just going to want to make decisions

409
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,517
and get that rapid decision making

410
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:36,958
and build their mastery of the game.

411
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,286
So they're not necessarily going to want to have a

412
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,287
cinematic moment or have a character pop up

413
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:44,228
and chat with them.

414
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:49,010
So as a result, you're going to want to offer a slider, even

415
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,390
still with the triage, to make your

416
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,411
animations go really fast.

417
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:54,952
Now with the slider, to make your animations go fast, you

418
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:57,133
have to determine what animations are affected.

419
00:18:57,133 --> 00:19:00,675
So traditionally, with video games, there's two animation

420
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:00,875
speeds.

421
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,936
There are things that happen at game speed, and there are

422
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,537
like the dragon flying across the screen.

423
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:06,777
That can be really slow.

424
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:07,978
It can be really monumental.

425
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:10,746
And then you're going to have UI speed.

426
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:11,867
And that's really lickety split.

427
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,769
You want that to feel fast and immediate for the user.

428
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:18,993
But with board games, how do you make that distinction?

429
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,634
Everything in a board game is basically UI.

430
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:25,318
And you really want to focus on what is reacting to a player.

431
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:27,220
Is a player clicking a card?

432
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,602
Is a player examining something?

433
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,823
Those animations need to be exempt from your spider.

434
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:34,593
If your slider is set to slow because the player is going to

435
00:19:34,593 --> 00:19:38,014
learn a lot of what's going on, they want that slow animation

436
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:40,654
teaching them, you still want to have some lickety split

437
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:42,115
reactive animations.

438
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:49,676
So visually, board games can be really laden with symbols

439
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:50,776
and iconography.

440
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:51,517
Race is no exception.

441
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:56,058
And typically, if a player doesn't understand what a

442
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:58,658
particular symbol means, they're going to consult the

443
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:00,578
rules, or they're going to ask a friend.

444
00:20:01,194 --> 00:20:05,338
But in digital land, you can embed the rules right there

445
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,540
within the game.

446
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,341
So this is what it looks like for Race for the Galaxy.

447
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:13,026
I put the plain text of what is going on with the rules

448
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:13,787
right there.

449
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:16,690
And you can expand any card in the game and figure out what

450
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,992
the symbols are trying to tell you if you don't remember.

451
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:21,215
Now, this helper text isn't new.

452
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:23,917
If you remember old Macs, they had the little question mark

453
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:24,898
icon in the corner.

454
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:29,284
And that could be dragged to anything on the desktop

455
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:31,406
to get a little bit more information.

456
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:34,809
Eventually, this evolved into tool tips,

457
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:35,830
which are really handy.

458
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,252
But tool tips cannot necessarily accommodate the

459
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:41,315
volume of text you want to communicate in a board game.

460
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:44,818
So we started adding this just on cards.

461
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:46,600
And then we added it on goals.

462
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,803
And eventually, we started adding it on the phases as

463
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:49,883
well.

464
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,689
We started putting it all over the place.

465
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:55,770
And even though we kept wanting it everywhere,

466
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,552
we weren't prepared for how much our players wanted it

467
00:20:57,552 --> 00:21:00,634
even more, to the point where in the beta,

468
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,016
one of the biggest requests that they had

469
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:06,078
was hotkeys or swipes so they could cycle

470
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,560
through this information.

471
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,961
Because as a developer of a game,

472
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:11,323
you see the game every day, you play it all the time,

473
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,544
you know how to play the game.

474
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:15,146
But it's easy to forget how much new players

475
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:17,387
are gonna really take advantage of this information.

476
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:17,427
So.

477
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:21,386
Think about something like Magic the Gathering.

478
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:23,207
They have keywords, right?

479
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:25,848
This basilisk has death touch, and on the left,

480
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:28,190
you can see this card has an explanation

481
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,131
of what that keyword does.

482
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:32,892
Any amount of damage this deals to a creature

483
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:33,913
is enough to destroy it.

484
00:21:34,657 --> 00:21:36,938
On the right, there's a different version of this card,

485
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:38,719
and they didn't explain the keyword.

486
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:41,180
So they have to make this trade-off of whether they're

487
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,220
going to explain it or not.

488
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,481
They want to sprinkle it in enough so that players can

489
00:21:45,481 --> 00:21:48,362
remember what the keywords do, but they don't want to do it

490
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:51,103
too much because they have to reduce the font size to

491
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:51,904
accommodate it.

492
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:55,045
They might not be able to put other abilities on the card

493
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:56,785
because there's not enough room.

494
00:21:56,785 --> 00:21:58,866
It just clutters things up a little bit.

495
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:02,307
So in digital land, you never have to make that trade-off.

496
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:03,188
You never have to decide.

497
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:06,058
You can always have the inspection available to your

498
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,840
players for board games.

499
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,502
And then just as the player masters the board game and

500
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:12,965
doesn't need it, they just never go into the inspection

501
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,166
mode.

502
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,388
So pretty soon, we started wanting this in all games in

503
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:16,908
general.

504
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:19,591
Like how cool would it be if you're playing League of

505
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:22,454
Legends, and you could just double click Zoe and know that

506
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,976
she does a bunch of burst damage before having to learn

507
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:25,497
the hard way.

508
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,814
Embedding rules references like this really alleviates a lot of

509
00:22:30,814 --> 00:22:34,318
the burden on a player doing that big teaching session

510
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:36,040
right up front at the beginning.

511
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,444
Usually you're going to learn a board game for 30 minutes, and

512
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:40,806
it can be a little bit of a slog.

513
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:45,831
So with video games, typically a lot of these rules are

514
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,673
embedded in wikis that are external to the game.

515
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:53,352
So if you're going to play Minecraft or Kerbal Space

516
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:55,914
program at the highest levels, you're

517
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:57,374
going to be accessing wikis.

518
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:59,075
It'd be really cool if some of this information

519
00:22:59,075 --> 00:23:00,556
could be accessed right within the game.

520
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:03,577
Now we're able to embed rules references with the cards

521
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:06,259
because we draw all of the cards on the fly.

522
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,660
So for any given card in Race for the Galaxy,

523
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,721
we're programmatically turning on and off

524
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:13,682
about 50 to 100 different pieces of UI at a time.

525
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,653
And the reason, there's a lot of reasons to do this.

526
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:19,473
Here's four of them.

527
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:21,134
If you have a card like Ancient Race,

528
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,574
this is a starting world.

529
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:23,955
And it has a starting world condition.

530
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:26,756
You have a little bit thinner of a starting hand.

531
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:30,857
But you might draw this card mid-game or late-game,

532
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:32,598
in which case it's not a starting world.

533
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:34,559
We can just programmatically turn off

534
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,999
that piece of UI that's related to the start of the game.

535
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,121
So you can have a little bit of contextual information

536
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:42,201
on whether you're going to show UI or not.

537
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,322
Also, it's really great for localization.

538
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:44,542
If you're

539
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,001
programmatically drawing your cards in your game,

540
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:49,663
you can easily translate them on the fly.

541
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:53,406
Also, if your players have different configurations

542
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:55,387
enabled, if they're turning on and off

543
00:23:55,387 --> 00:23:56,988
different expansions of your game,

544
00:23:56,988 --> 00:23:59,330
or let's say some players really like takeovers

545
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,471
in Race for the Galaxy, some players don't.

546
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:04,073
If you turn off takeovers, you can just never show

547
00:24:04,073 --> 00:24:07,015
any takeover UI to the players who don't wanna play with them

548
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:08,636
and it cleans up the game quite a bit.

549
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:11,338
And finally, drawing cards on the fly

550
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:12,599
is gonna save you texture memory.

551
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:16,263
which is actually a really big deal if you're making a board game in mobile

552
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:20,906
because you have a lot of card art, it's going to hog your texture memory.

553
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:25,188
Any savings you can get with reusing borders or icons is going to be a big deal.

554
00:24:25,188 --> 00:24:28,669
In Race for the Galaxy, we're on our third expansion now.

555
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,111
We're already having to start to move to a streaming texture solution

556
00:24:32,111 --> 00:24:34,432
because we're basically out of space.

557
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,194
So, our UI is a little bit insane.

558
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:39,875
This is the main UI for the game.

559
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:43,449
You want to design your UI so that it can accommodate

560
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:46,190
a very full end game state.

561
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,671
And we do this by having recursively nested UIs, where

562
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:51,913
we populate them into cards, into the tables, and that can

563
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:54,534
accommodate different aspect ratios, which is the fun of

564
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,775
making mobile board games.

565
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:56,115
Super fun.

566
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:59,916
And you might say, Teresa, that's crazy.

567
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,258
That's a lot.

568
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:04,879
Why not just not put everything on the screen?

569
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,920
These are a couple of my other favorite mobile board games.

570
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,761
This is Agricola and Lords of Waterdeep.

571
00:25:10,297 --> 00:25:12,277
In Agricola, they have a pagination system.

572
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:16,759
So you can paginate between your farm and your opponent's

573
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,259
farm and the worker placement area and get

574
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,440
your information there.

575
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,421
In Lords of Waterdeep, you can scroll around and pan around

576
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,641
across the screen.

577
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:27,122
And I love these games, but my problem with both of these

578
00:25:27,122 --> 00:25:29,743
solutions is that you're tasking your player to

579
00:25:29,743 --> 00:25:32,523
memorize a lot of information so that when they're making a

580
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:35,764
decision, they have to pull it from memory rather than seeing

581
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:36,465
it right on the screen.

582
00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:42,223
In Race for the Galaxy, we tried to give you as much information as is relevant to your

583
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:45,564
turn immediately available to you visually.

584
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:50,026
And we did that by having this system of abstracts, or little summaries of information.

585
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:55,409
So here, I have my main tableau in the middle, and I have my opponents that I'm playing against.

586
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:59,510
And there's a summary of what is going on in their tableau at the top.

587
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,232
That summary, you can see in the animation, it expands out, and you can always inspect

588
00:26:03,232 --> 00:26:03,532
it further.

589
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:05,292
So as a designer you have to decide,

590
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:09,013
what are you gonna communicate in this summary version?

591
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:11,074
So for us, we are communicating,

592
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:15,476
you know, the top left card for the AI here, costs two.

593
00:26:15,476 --> 00:26:18,057
And I'm showing it's a two-cost planet.

594
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:18,957
I just made a decision,

595
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:20,398
I'm not gonna show the victory points,

596
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:21,478
I'm gonna show the cost.

597
00:26:21,478 --> 00:26:23,039
But players know there's a correlation

598
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,219
between victory points and cost.

599
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:26,980
So hopefully that's enough information

600
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,100
for them to make their choices.

601
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,982
And this design decision is actually originally

602
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:32,942
from Tom and Keldin.

603
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,146
who made the AI and we liked it a lot so we implemented it.

604
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:38,769
We expanded a little bit more.

605
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:42,777
If you have different military powers in the game,

606
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:44,159
we condense them down into an icon

607
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,483
that can always be expanded out for more information.

608
00:26:47,513 --> 00:26:50,415
Another of my favorite games, Ascension, did a great job of

609
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:53,056
condensing down information by cropping cards.

610
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,097
You might ask, what can you get away with when you're

611
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:55,857
cropping a card?

612
00:26:55,857 --> 00:26:59,039
Can you get away with getting rid of keywords, icons,

613
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,680
abilities?

614
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,301
You can actually get away with getting rid of all of it, as

615
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:05,362
long as you keep artwork.

616
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:07,703
Because the artwork is going to be the shorthand that your

617
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:11,124
players are going to memorize that they remember all of

618
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:13,425
those other abilities and keywords and icons from.

619
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:13,465
So.

620
00:27:16,693 --> 00:27:19,794
In Race for the Galaxy, we're able to deviate a little bit

621
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:22,995
from the baked card art because we're programmatically

622
00:27:22,995 --> 00:27:24,135
drawing our cards on the fly.

623
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:26,256
And that lets us get away with something that's really

624
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:29,016
important, which is real-time bookkeeping.

625
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:31,317
And this is a big service you can do for your players.

626
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,517
You want to be judicious on when you're doing it.

627
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:36,358
So in Race for the Galaxy, there are six cost

628
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:37,318
developments.

629
00:27:37,318 --> 00:27:40,399
And these give a dynamic scoring victory point value

630
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,139
depending on the game state at the end of the game.

631
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:44,586
So this is Galactic Exchange, and on the left,

632
00:27:44,586 --> 00:27:46,567
you see the version that's in the card game

633
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:47,608
that you're going to play in analog.

634
00:27:47,608 --> 00:27:51,190
It has a question mark that represents that dynamic score.

635
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,712
And on the right, you see a version that we can do in game.

636
00:27:54,712 --> 00:27:56,753
We can just figure out what the score is.

637
00:27:56,753 --> 00:27:59,995
We can say, OK, this card gets some points

638
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:02,916
for every different color of world you have in play.

639
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:04,437
If you have a bunch of those worlds,

640
00:28:04,437 --> 00:28:06,138
you have nine points here, for example.

641
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:08,900
And we started by adding this just in the tableau.

642
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,141
And eventually, we started putting it in your hand.

643
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,671
We found that players really like having this information

644
00:28:13,671 --> 00:28:16,752
right up front, even before they've played the card.

645
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:23,594
And if you're going to ask your player to do the math and

646
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:25,575
figure out these scores, it usually takes about 30 seconds

647
00:28:25,575 --> 00:28:28,196
and pretty much no one does it.

648
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:30,997
They do about a five second approximation, which is pretty

649
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:33,998
good, but occasionally it's way off.

650
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:36,419
So we find by doing the real time bookkeeping for the

651
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,160
players, their scores are much higher and they like the

652
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,000
feature a lot.

653
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,580
So I recommend it.

654
00:28:42,161 --> 00:28:44,403
A lot of these features I've been talking about today

655
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:47,165
have been things that are going to help you get your player

656
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:49,226
comfortable and familiar with the game in a teacherless

657
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:51,148
environment where they don't have Table Talk.

658
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:55,551
But there is a digital platform where you can have Table Talk,

659
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:58,213
you can have a teacher, and that's in VR.

660
00:28:58,213 --> 00:29:02,617
That's one of the reasons that we're bringing Race for the

661
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:06,059
Galaxy to VR, and we brought Ascension to VR.

662
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:06,840
You can get Table Talk.

663
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,403
If someone's new, you can come up right behind them, look at

664
00:29:10,403 --> 00:29:11,223
the cards in their hand.

665
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,320
help them through what they should be playing next,

666
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,141
and just chat about your week while you're playing a board

667
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:18,041
game with people.

668
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:20,021
Like, I can play a board game with my sister

669
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:22,382
in South Carolina online with her

670
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:24,702
and just hear about her day, which is pretty cool.

671
00:29:24,702 --> 00:29:26,683
And we did this with Ascension, too.

672
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:30,523
Up next, we're going to be working on Roll for the Galaxy.

673
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:32,964
And maybe I'll be back next year with some ideas about how

674
00:29:32,964 --> 00:29:34,384
to make the AI performant for that.

675
00:29:34,384 --> 00:29:36,204
That's what we're struggling with right now.

676
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:38,145
And also, how much to automate for your players.

677
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,045
This is a DICE version of Race for the Galaxy

678
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:40,925
if you haven't played it.

679
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,652
So, anyway, that's my talk.

680
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:45,955
Come find me if you have any questions about board games

681
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:50,419
or like to digitize board games and play more board games.

682
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:50,920
That's it.
