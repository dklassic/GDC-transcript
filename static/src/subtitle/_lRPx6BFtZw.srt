00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:06,886
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:09,128
This talk is going to be on visual storytelling

3
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:11,510
and narrative design for Moon Studios' latest title,

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,371
Ori and the Will of the Wisps.

5
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:14,512
My name is Jeremy Gritton.

6
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:16,774
I was the art director and story lead for the game.

7
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:18,815
And I'm gonna be co-presenting with my colleague,

8
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:20,756
Chris McEntee, who was our lead designer.

9
00:00:20,756 --> 00:00:23,158
Now, because this is a remote presentation,

10
00:00:23,158 --> 00:00:24,579
we've split it into two parts.

11
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,421
So I will be covering the first portion,

12
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:27,641
which is on visual storytelling.

13
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:29,623
And then I'm gonna hand things off to Chris

14
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:30,804
for narrative design.

15
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:32,865
So let's go ahead and jump right into it.

16
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:37,395
And I think that there's no better place to start than with the prologue.

17
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:40,437
Now, if you've played Ori 2, you're probably familiar with this screen.

18
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:42,398
It's the opening scene in the game.

19
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:46,800
And something that's interesting about it is that this cliff used to be flipped horizontally.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,264
And the reason for that is that originally, when we were first prototyping things, I was

21
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:55,586
thinking that it would be nice to have a direct callback to Blind Forest.

22
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:58,868
So I thought maybe this cliff could be one of these cliffs from the original game.

23
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,751
But as we built our prologue prototype and we had an opportunity to play it,

24
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:07,193
I could tell that the flow didn't really feel correct and that if we were to forget about

25
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:11,597
that connection and to flip this cliff the other way around that it would flow much better.

26
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:17,360
And the reason why I think that it flows better is that it helps us to create a more consistent

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,642
visual vocabulary for the sequence, for the prologue as a whole.

28
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:25,085
And what I mean by that is that we begin to develop a pattern, which is that the direction

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,685
indicates the theme.

30
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:31,848
So anytime that the camera or the player moves to the left, that's indicating certain ideas

31
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:35,150
like returning to the past, towards security, or towards what is known.

32
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,192
And any time that the player or the camera is moving to the right,

33
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:41,273
that's representing a different set of ideas,

34
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:45,375
such as pushing forward into the future towards uncertainty or the unknown.

35
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:48,596
So let's walk through the different portions of the prologue

36
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:51,157
and see how they align to these big ideas.

37
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:55,259
So in the beginning, Ori is beckoned by Gumo to come to the left

38
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,100
and to go to the Swallows Nest Cave,

39
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,761
which is a very familiar area from the first game.

40
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:02,582
So we're really returning to the past.

41
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:06,030
And then once we get there, we meet the baby owlette coo,

42
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,732
this new addition to the family.

43
00:02:07,732 --> 00:02:09,975
And the camera begins drifting slowly to the right

44
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:12,858
as we can see how the cave accommodations are changing

45
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:13,939
in accordance with that.

46
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:21,548
Afterward, Ori exits the cave and we begin this big seasonal montage, which is this sweeping

47
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:26,993
camera with a strong rightward momentum as we're pushing forward in time and space across a series

48
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:33,039
of family bonding moments. And then at the end of the montage, Ku attempts to fly and fails,

49
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,463
and so the player is tasked with their first objective, which is to try to help Ku,

50
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:40,566
and so we push forward to the right in an effort to do so.

51
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,376
Now, once we get there, the solution isn't immediately available,

52
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:47,657
and the narration tells us that the answer lay in the past.

53
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:49,477
So which way does Ori look?

54
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:52,698
To the left, and so we return back to the treehouse

55
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:54,558
that we passed by earlier,

56
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:57,518
and there Ori is able to recover a key story item

57
00:02:57,518 --> 00:02:59,999
from the first game, which is Kuro's feather.

58
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,019
Now, once we've retrieved that item,

59
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:05,100
Ori brings it back with them to the right, back to Ku.

60
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,881
We're bringing it from Blind Forest now into Will of the Wisps

61
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:10,061
to play a key story role.

62
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:16,124
The feather is fixed to Koo's wing and then Ori and Koo take off from a cliff to the right to

63
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:20,331
begin the flight sequence to begin this new chapter in their lives. And this is the cliff

64
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:21,633
that we were talking about earlier.

65
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,167
Now at this point we go into the flight sequence

66
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,268
and this has a strong rightward direction.

67
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:30,230
And you can see here at the end that Ori and Ku

68
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,192
are pushing forward into the right, out into the unknown.

69
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:35,893
And Ori takes this one last look back to the left

70
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:39,536
to the landmarks from Nibel receding in the distance.

71
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:41,277
This is basically where we're saying goodbye

72
00:03:41,277 --> 00:03:42,077
to the first game.

73
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:47,499
Now, those were a lot of overarching ideas

74
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,762
that really help to inform the visuals

75
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,607
that we're gonna create for the prologue as a whole,

76
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,811
but let's take a moment and talk about

77
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,696
just a specific section, like the seasonal montage.

78
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:02,682
I was originally very inspired by the bridge-building sequence in Blind Forest.

79
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:07,306
I thought that this was just a great character-bonding moment, and I wanted us to have our own version

80
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:07,747
of that.

81
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,889
So I was thinking, why don't we really blow it out?

82
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,851
We'll really make the budget bigger.

83
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:16,716
And instead of having a sequence that takes place over the course of a single day, we'll

84
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:20,000
have something that spans an entire year, and we'll have all the different seasons.

85
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:27,263
And this is very useful because it allows us the opportunity to create a balance between what is nostalgic and what is new.

86
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,705
And that's something that I was always looking for in different moments in the game as a sequel.

87
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,127
I always thought that that would be great if we could strike that balance.

88
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,181
And so what's useful is that we're back in these familiar spaces that we know from Blind Forest,

89
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,682
but they have fresh new looks because we're seeing them in different ways because of the

90
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:50,344
passing of the seasons. So let's look at one of those specific vignettes, and that's this one

91
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:56,187
at the start, which is the family picnic. And this is about a 15-second scene, and we can talk about

92
00:04:56,187 --> 00:05:02,249
this one specifically because it's a good way to discuss telling stories without words. So

93
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:07,674
The way that I have constructed this scene is that I have arranged the characters very

94
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,797
specifically in an order, one, two, three, four, and each character takes a specific

95
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:17,422
action that is meant to be read sequentially in order to tell a story. So what I'm going to do is

96
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:21,986
I'm going to pull up the original sketches that I had when I was pitching the idea to the team,

97
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:26,791
and we'll walk through these steps one by one to see how this was constructed.

98
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:35,957
So the first step, Gumo takes a large exaggerated bite of the berries, a big exaggerated scoop

99
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:36,957
and bite.

100
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:41,338
And the reason why I'm doing this is because I want to draw the viewer's attention to him.

101
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:44,460
Gumo is the first person in the lineup that I want you to look to.

102
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,881
And it's also conveying some of the information, which is that the family likes to eat the

103
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:49,502
berries.

104
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,275
Now the next character in the lineup is Naru, and she offers the berries to Kuu.

105
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:59,358
And so this is telling us that Kuu is a part of their family, that they share what they

106
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,039
have with her.

107
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,376
And then next is Koo's response.

108
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:03,557
She rejects the berries.

109
00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:06,800
And what we're learning is that Koo is growing up

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,083
and we're seeing some of her individuality,

111
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,044
what makes her different.

112
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:12,246
She's an owl and maybe she has her own ideas

113
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,028
about what's good to eat and what's not.

114
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:16,150
So maybe when she was very young,

115
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,812
she was okay with eating the berries,

116
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,574
but now as the seasons are changing,

117
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:21,636
she's growing older and she's starting to develop

118
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:22,997
her own identity more and more.

119
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:26,460
And then Ori, who's been patiently waiting their turn

120
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,723
on the right-hand side of the screen,

121
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:31,227
recognizes the problem and directs our attention

122
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:32,368
to screen right, saying,

123
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:34,151
hey, I think the solution is over there.

124
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:37,035
And that's going to actually cause the camera to pick up

125
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:38,316
and to flow to the next scene.

126
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,445
And speaking of the camera, you can see how,

127
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,687
because it has a very slow rightward drift

128
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:45,668
throughout this moment,

129
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:48,631
it's basically framing the characters

130
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:51,875
during their key actions

131
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,857
at the place and frame where I want them to be.

132
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:56,120
So this is also something that's very useful.

133
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:04,938
Now, just to sum things up, getting value from just 15 seconds, each action is very deliberate.

134
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:09,739
It's providing us with new information and all of these as a series are developing the character

135
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:14,741
bonds. We're also telling a small encapsulated story about what Ku likes to eat and that she

136
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:19,322
doesn't want to eat the berries and it's also working as a precursor to the larger story as a

137
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:20,682
whole because...

138
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:24,883
This is setting up that Ku is different and that she has different desires as an owl,

139
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:30,525
and that's going to continue to build throughout the prologue as we can see that she longs to fly.

140
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:35,447
And Ori's desire to help her achieve that dream, that's a driving part of the prologue.

141
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:35,507
So

142
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:40,712
Let's move on to the flight sequence

143
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:42,433
while we're talking about her desire to fly.

144
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:45,134
And this was a fun sequence that we worked on.

145
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:47,175
I really enjoyed it because we were pushing the boundaries

146
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,495
with what we could do.

147
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:51,256
And let's discuss how it was constructed

148
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:53,537
and what the big ideas were behind it.

149
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:55,618
So it was really a blend of three ideas

150
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,539
and those were a daytime transition,

151
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,200
the mastery of flight and a goodbye letter to Nibel.

152
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,541
And it's the combination of these three things

153
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,322
that creates a unique flight sequence for us.

154
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:08,363
So the first one, the daytime transition.

155
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,704
When I first worked on the script,

156
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:12,544
I had this taking place entirely at night.

157
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:15,665
And I mean, it seemed like a good idea at the time,

158
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:17,226
but as we were starting to build things out,

159
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:18,526
the art team came to me and said,

160
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:20,466
you know, they really felt like

161
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,647
having a daytime transition that would provide them

162
00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:25,868
with a lot more visual variety,

163
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:27,608
because they thought that if it was all at night,

164
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,288
things were falling too flat.

165
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:31,569
So we discussed it, and what we settled on was,

166
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:36,853
let's have Orion coup take off right at the crack of dawn and then we'll have the sun is rising

167
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:40,516
during the first portion of the flight sequence and so things are getting brighter as they're

168
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:45,420
getting happier and then they will get darker at the end with a storm coming in and everything gets

169
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,224
really dangerous. So one of our artists based on that discussion painted this color script and I

170
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:56,469
remember when I saw it I thought yep you guys are absolutely right this is looking awesome and let's

171
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,910
definitely go in this direction.

172
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,413
Now, I don't think that there's anything that revolutionary about this idea conceptually,

173
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:08,216
which is tying the environmental state to the emotional state. It's something that you see

174
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:12,158
all the time in film and TV. But the reason why you see it all the time is because it's

175
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:17,101
effective as a device. And so it's one of the ideas that we leaned on for our flight sequence.

176
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:26,059
The second one is the mastery of flight and this is something that the animators and I had discussed quite a bit how to convey

177
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:30,024
this and and so I'll run through some of the the different moments of that.

178
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:36,233
So in the beginning we have a shaky takeoff where they leap from the cliff and it actually doesn't go entirely as planned.

179
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:42,788
and then following through on that, lacking total control. They're flying by and they're clipping

180
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:47,991
into the treetops and they're sending the leaves swirling around and then again clipping into the

181
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:52,394
waterfalls as they're winding around the ginso tree, but then they're beginning to gain confidence

182
00:09:52,394 --> 00:09:57,958
soaring higher and higher up into the clouds and then plunging back down through the clouds and

183
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,940
then weaving in and out of the floating rocks at Forlorn Ruins. We can see that they're gaining

184
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,302
confidence and beginning to perform more dangerous maneuvers.

185
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:09,510
And then in this sequence, this is something

186
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,471
that I had boarded originally, which

187
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:13,953
was that Ori and Koo would descend down and join

188
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:17,334
this flying V, and that Koo would feel like she was finally

189
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:18,455
one with the flock.

190
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:20,136
And one of our animators had this idea,

191
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,297
and if you pay attention closely to the wings,

192
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:24,359
Koo's wing beats are out of time with the other birds,

193
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,000
and then she hesitates and watches them,

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,961
and then she beats her wings in unison with theirs.

195
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,583
And I thought, when he showed me that, I thought,

196
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:32,704
What a smart idea.

197
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:36,487
Like this is a perfect way to convey the emotion of the moment.

198
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:40,030
So I think that this is a really good example of visual storytelling.

199
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,413
And that's also a great example of how things get better and better over time.

200
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:51,021
The next one that we have is saying goodbye to Nibel.

201
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:54,044
And so with this one, we always saw the flight sequence

202
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,826
as sort of a goodbye letter or a love letter

203
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:57,988
to the first game.

204
00:10:57,988 --> 00:11:00,230
And so we wanted to honor the different landmarks

205
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,073
in the first game as we were leaving that location behind.

206
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:05,675
So here we can see the Spirit Tree,

207
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:08,618
and then the Ginseo Tree, the Forlorn Ruins,

208
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:10,560
the Sunstone and Mount Horu.

209
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:15,893
And then this moment, the one last look, this is what we talked about earlier.

210
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:20,883
So you can see how Ori is looking over their shoulder to the left, and then they push forward

211
00:11:20,883 --> 00:11:22,125
and to the right.

212
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:29,763
And so I think that this is probably a good place to close things off for the prologue.

213
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:34,166
The next section is going to be a little bit different because I want to talk about our

214
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:38,830
decision-making process and story and how that informs the visuals that we create. So

215
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:44,935
this next section is going to have spoilers, but what we're going to be discussing is this

216
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:46,937
big emotional beat in the middle of the game.

217
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:53,361
And it's when our main antagonist, Shriek, attacks Ori and Ku in the Silent Woods.

218
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:56,643
And Ku becomes gravely injured because of this encounter.

219
00:11:56,643 --> 00:12:02,886
Now, what a lot of people might not know is that for the majority of development in this sequence,

220
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:06,248
Ku died, and that was it. She was out of the script.

221
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:11,091
And in order to properly explain everything that happened over the course of development,

222
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:14,733
the decisions that we made, I'm going to have to go all the way back to the very beginning.

223
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:18,264
So let's talk about the early drafts.

224
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:20,527
So when I was first working on the script,

225
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:23,030
Shriek was essentially the same character,

226
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,113
but her relationship to Ku was completely different.

227
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,275
So she wasn't violent towards Ku,

228
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,738
and instead she was actually protective of Ku.

229
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:35,909
Now I had always seen these two characters as mere images of one another.

230
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:41,532
They were both orphans and while Ku was adopted by a family that loved her and accepted her

231
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:47,234
for who she was, Shriek was rejected by anyone that she ever crossed paths with and essentially

232
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,515
treated as a monster.

233
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:50,896
And so there was an interesting comparison and contrast there.

234
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:54,961
Also, they were both damaged while they were inside their eggs.

235
00:12:54,961 --> 00:13:00,388
Koo was damaged by an overabundance of light from the events in Blind Forest, and then

236
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:05,415
Shriek was damaged by an overabundance of darkness from the decay in Will of the Wisps.

237
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,413
I thought that there was just this really interesting connection between the two characters,

238
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,215
and that's really what I was trying to play up.

239
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:18,339
So this image here, this shows Shriek's introduction as it used to be.

240
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:24,083
So we had something completely different where Ku was getting hunted by Howl in the Silent

241
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:30,348
Woods and then Shriek comes out and protects her in a really terrifying way by petrifying

242
00:13:30,348 --> 00:13:30,688
Howl.

243
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:39,153
And we had a whole animatic for this moment, and I really liked it quite a bit.

244
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:45,018
But we also had these other moments that followed that, where it was different character bonding

245
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:48,882
moments between the characters. And I thought there was some interesting stuff there, but...

246
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:54,981
Really, the story in general was falling flat in the middle of the game, and it wasn't really

247
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:57,923
coming to a strong conclusion at the end of the game.

248
00:13:57,923 --> 00:14:00,244
So there were definitely issues with this.

249
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:03,206
So what ended up happening was we had this big story meeting.

250
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:09,089
It was brought up in the meeting that things weren't really coming together yet.

251
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:14,693
So let's try flipping things around and let's have, instead of Shriek protecting Ku, let's

252
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:20,438
have Shriek attack and kill Ku because that has the opportunity for a big emotional beat

253
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:22,920
in the middle of the game.

254
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,323
I remember this meeting very well because I was probably the one who, more than anyone,

255
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:27,783
was saying,

256
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:30,045
Whoa, no, no, no, no, no.

257
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:31,606
We can't do this.

258
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:34,627
That is too dark.

259
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:37,369
Players are going to lose motivation

260
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:38,389
in the middle of the game.

261
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:41,671
It's going to undermine Kuro's sacrifice from the first game.

262
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,732
And on top of everything else that we

263
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:46,554
know is going to happen at the end of the game,

264
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:47,774
this is just going to be too much.

265
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:49,475
This is going to be overkill.

266
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:51,396
We can't pile this onto everything else

267
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:52,296
that we know will happen.

268
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:55,106
So I was really immediately against it.

269
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:57,747
But the outcome of the meeting was,

270
00:14:57,747 --> 00:14:59,987
look, we're kind of getting creatively blocked

271
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:03,528
at this point, and what we have isn't working.

272
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,690
So let's just try this and see what happens.

273
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,490
So I said, okay.

274
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:16,139
And it was actually really funny because that night after work, I was feeling bummed out.

275
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,823
And so I, and my wife could tell that something was wrong.

276
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:23,385
So she's asking me, you know, what's the matter?

277
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:24,686
Did you have a bad day at work?

278
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:26,368
Like what's going on?

279
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:27,008
And I told her,

280
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,530
you know, work, they, they want these script changes, and I

281
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,034
don't really want to do it. You know, it's fine. Don't worry

282
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:39,278
about it. It'll be fine. But it was kind of funny because I

283
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,083
actually was really, really upset about the fate of this

284
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,467
fictional baby owl, which is probably weird, you know, or not,

285
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:48,769
I don't know. But

286
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:56,278
But you really do start to get attached to these characters as you're working on the game.

287
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,480
And it's not that I have an issue with killing characters, I think that's a good story device to employ,

288
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,822
but I really was concerned about how that would balance out with everything else that we were doing.

289
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,636
And so what happened was, I went back to work the next day,

290
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,317
and I had to focus.

291
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:16,378
And so I was starting to do some little sketches for ideas.

292
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:18,739
And I was actually really surprised

293
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:22,661
to see that I was very inspired, and I wasn't expecting that.

294
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:25,322
And so I was doing these sketches,

295
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:26,723
and then I was sharing them with the team.

296
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:29,104
And they were getting excited by them.

297
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,285
And so they were starting to give me ideas and saying,

298
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:33,346
oh, what if we add this or change that?

299
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:35,287
And I was getting excited by what they were saying.

300
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:41,154
So we started getting a lot of moments like these with Shriek slamming down and then stalking

301
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:46,440
towards Ori and Kuu, or Shriek backing Kuu up against the cliff and then it's very tenuous

302
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,888
because she's unable to fly. Or this moment here that I had discussed quite a bit with our animators

303
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:53,729
where

304
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,133
Shriek attacks Ori and then Ku with zero hesitation attacks Shriek.

305
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:05,677
And this is another example of something that I wanted because I think it's a good way to

306
00:17:05,677 --> 00:17:07,018
do visual storytelling.

307
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:12,001
It's a small action that can say so much that even though Shriek can do nothing, or even

308
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:17,145
though Ku can do nothing against Shriek, that she has zero hesitation and attacks her when

309
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:18,626
she sees Ori's in danger.

310
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:22,789
And that just shows the love that she has for Ori, the bond that there is between the

311
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:23,289
two of them.

312
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:26,718
Now, we also had more sketches like these ones,

313
00:17:26,718 --> 00:17:30,281
which included Ori finding Ku in the aftermath

314
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:32,122
and the Moki are surrounding them,

315
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:35,604
or the wisp coming out and floating around Qowlok's pool

316
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,765
and all the flowers are blooming,

317
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,507
or Ori going to Qowlok and it's dark and gloomy

318
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:42,869
and Qowlok's eyes are glowing in the darkness.

319
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:44,470
And so all of these moments, I thought,

320
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,631
really had a lot of potential.

321
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:50,433
And then we also have, just to come back to this moment,

322
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:54,650
This is a color script that I had painted for this.

323
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,511
And it's one of my favorite moments in the game,

324
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:59,012
but the wisp comes out and it floats around

325
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,833
and all the flowers are blooming.

326
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,434
And I liked this because it's very reminiscent

327
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:07,115
to the prologue of Blind Forest when Ori is resurrected.

328
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:08,596
And so I thought this might be perfect

329
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:10,297
to give players that sense of hope

330
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,158
after this big event happens.

331
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:16,703
but it can segue perfectly into Quolock telling us that the light here is too weak,

332
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,727
that it's become fractured, and that we have to make it whole once more.

333
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:24,854
So it will bleed right into the quest that the player has to go on.

334
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,318
But I never would have even come up with this moment if I hadn't been prompted to

335
00:18:28,318 --> 00:18:30,681
by other people on the team to explore in this direction.

336
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:35,295
Now, we also had this portion of the sequence

337
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:37,716
where all of the Moki are bowing their heads

338
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,598
as Ori is making their way to Kualuk.

339
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:41,339
It's sort of like a cascade.

340
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:43,261
And this was another thing that I really wanted,

341
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,883
even though it was technically challenging to set this up.

342
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:48,104
But one of the things that you'll notice is

343
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:50,286
if the player holds their stick to the left,

344
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:52,768
Ori just stops and looks back to the left.

345
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:54,369
And this is a callback to the prologue

346
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:56,451
because we can't go back to the past

347
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,812
and change what happened.

348
00:18:57,812 --> 00:18:59,053
The only thing that we can do

349
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:00,634
is push forward to the future, to the right.

350
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:08,394
So what really happened at this point was that I had essentially been converted, that I realized,

351
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:11,796
yep, you guys were right. There's a lot of great potential here. There's a lot of strong story

352
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:17,922
moments that I think are working really well. But I couldn't shake the feeling that the ending was

353
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:25,488
just too dark and too bitter with Ku dying. And so I basically did an alternate version of the

354
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:29,351
ending where I said, we can still have all of these beats in the middle, but we can bring Ku

355
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:30,152
back at the end.

356
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:36,617
And in this way, we would also still honor Kuro's sacrifice from Blind Forest.

357
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:42,641
So I presented it to the team, and it actually caused quite a big debate, which I was not

358
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:47,605
expecting. So about half the team agreed with me and thought, yes, Kuu should come back.

359
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:51,608
And about half of the team disagreed and thought, no, Kuu shouldn't come back. That's just,

360
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:55,351
you know, that's just chickening out. We should kill the character. That's the bolder story move.

361
00:19:55,871 --> 00:20:03,496
And so because there was this real debate on the team and we couldn't come to an agreement,

362
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:07,458
things stayed as they were, which was the default that Koo died.

363
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,720
And it stayed that way for probably about two and a half years.

364
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:16,405
So what ended up happening was towards the end of development, we began doing UR playtesting,

365
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:20,849
and the feedback from the playtesters was confirming what I had been worried about,

366
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:24,833
which was that people were losing motivation in the middle of the game,

367
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,815
and they were generally dissatisfied with the ending.

368
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:34,672
So because of that, we had more discussions in the team, and I was pushing for us to,

369
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:40,175
can we please try the alternate ending just to see how it tests for comparison's sake? Because

370
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:45,818
at this point, we only had one playtest session left. So we decided to go ahead and do that.

371
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:54,003
And when it was playtested, it tested much better. And so that really reignited this whole

372
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,283
two-year debate on the team.

373
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:58,746
And nothing had really changed.

374
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:01,850
Some people agreed with me and thought, yes, KU should come back.

375
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,913
And other people thought, no, KU shouldn't come back.

376
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:08,680
And it's way too late to make a change this big, this late into development.

377
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,125
So we were kind of gridlocked at this point.

378
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:17,550
Moon is very democratic. It's one of the great things about Moon. Everyone is highly encouraged

379
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,373
to speak up about everything, whether or not it's their department. And it's really how

380
00:21:21,373 --> 00:21:27,519
we drive quality in the company. But usually we're able to come to some form of a consensus.

381
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,682
And with this one, we just weren't able to do it. So what ended up happening was

382
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,845
I spoke with our creative director, Thomas,

383
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:36,766
and he told me, you know,

384
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,827
if the team really can't make a decision,

385
00:21:38,827 --> 00:21:41,488
then I'm gonna let you make the final call.

386
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:42,588
What do you wanna do?

387
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:44,949
And I told him, well, if it's up to me,

388
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:46,390
then I wanna bring her back.

389
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,191
And so that's what we did.

390
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:49,992
We went back to the team and we told them,

391
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:51,912
okay, everyone, final decision.

392
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:53,533
We're gonna bring Kou back.

393
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:56,274
And, you know, half the team was happy.

394
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,655
Half the team was celebrating.

395
00:21:57,655 --> 00:21:59,596
Yay, yes, Kou's coming back, awesome.

396
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:02,678
And half the team wasn't, and they were saying,

397
00:22:02,678 --> 00:22:04,179
ah, you chickened out, you know,

398
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:06,721
we should have just killed the character and owned it,

399
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:09,142
and that would have been the bolder story move.

400
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:11,344
And I think that that's just the reality, you know,

401
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:14,566
that half the people agreed and half the people disagreed,

402
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:15,947
and if we had done it the other way,

403
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:17,408
that just would have been flipped.

404
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:20,050
So I think that there's a few key takeaways for me

405
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,150
from this whole experience.

406
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,183
And the first one is to just keep an open mind to new ideas.

407
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:33,828
I was so locked in to this angle that I wanted to play with Shriek and Coo that I essentially

408
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:34,709
had a blind spot.

409
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:36,891
And there was a lot of things that I was missing.

410
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:41,114
And I really needed other people on the team to point out to me that, hey, we can do this

411
00:22:41,114 --> 00:22:42,935
in an entirely different way.

412
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:47,018
And even though I didn't agree with everything that they were saying, for me to say,

413
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:53,081
okay, I'm going to truly explore this and to try to make it work. And then because of that, I was

414
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:57,683
able to realize, wow, they were really right. Like I'm having a lot of ideas related to this

415
00:22:57,683 --> 00:23:03,086
that I really like. And so I think that that's really the power of collaboration, that you need

416
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:07,127
people with different perspectives and different ideas, and it's how you bring all of that together

417
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:09,068
that's what's really going to yield a good result.

418
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:12,671
But at the same time, when you have all of these differences of opinion,

419
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:18,075
that means that not everybody's always going to agree. And sometimes if you're in a spot where

420
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:22,319
you have to make a big creative decision, like this one was for us, because it completely changes

421
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,522
the tone at the end of the game, you have to be comfortable with the fact that you might not make

422
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:31,326
everybody happy. And I think that it's a lot easier to be okay with that if you really do feel

423
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,866
that the right decision was made. And for me personally, I do think that we made the right

424
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:41,234
decision to hit the right tone and balance for the end of the game. So speaking of the ending,

425
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:42,676
let's move on.

426
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:48,670
and talk about the willow ceremony. So this was a sequence that I had pitched to the team early on

427
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:54,152
and everybody liked it so we ended up incorporating it into the game and let's discuss how this was

428
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:58,913
conceptualized. So I knew that we wanted to have this big moment at the end of the game. There was

429
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:02,914
going to be this big thing that we were building up to which was the changing of the guard between

430
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:04,435
the old spirit tree and and.

431
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:10,682
Ori. And so I knew that we wanted to have something big and mombastic and magical. And I was thinking

432
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:15,849
about what the sequence was about conceptually, and it's about the life cycle of a spirit tree.

433
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:20,935
And so when you think about a spirit tree, these glowing leaves form in the canopy.

434
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:27,738
and they break free and they disperse across the land and then they turn into spirits which

435
00:24:27,738 --> 00:24:32,440
then inhabit the forest. And so what I was thinking was if all the spirits have died out

436
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,902
then maybe that light, like their essence, is still there scattered throughout the land. And

437
00:24:37,902 --> 00:24:42,003
maybe this whole sequence, this ceremony, can be a reversal of that life cycle.

438
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:48,148
that essence of light can be drawn back to its point of origin back to the dead branches

439
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:54,274
and as it touches them it reforms back into leaves uh creating a like a spiritual

440
00:24:54,274 --> 00:24:57,737
apparition of what once was and so we see this like spirit canopy

441
00:24:58,257 --> 00:25:00,078
And I thought, yeah, this has a lot of potential.

442
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:01,278
I really like where this could go.

443
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,900
And then also for the Spirit Tree itself,

444
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,841
in the early versions of the script,

445
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:09,302
we always had just called it Spirit Tree number two,

446
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:11,243
which obviously, you know, that's really bad.

447
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,624
And so I was trying to think of a way,

448
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:17,065
how can we make this tree unique to the tree in Nibel?

449
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:18,426
And so what I was thinking was,

450
00:25:18,426 --> 00:25:20,286
I was looking at the title of the game,

451
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,127
Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and I thought,

452
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:25,911
What if we made it, what if we did a play on words

453
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:28,913
and we made it about a willow tree and its wisps?

454
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:30,894
So it was a willow and its wisps.

455
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:32,895
And this could work out pretty well

456
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:35,657
because I like the way that the text spirit willow looks

457
00:25:35,657 --> 00:25:37,138
together on screen.

458
00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:38,919
And I like the way that it sounds.

459
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,441
And this would give us a very unique style of canopy

460
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:44,703
that would be very distinctive from the original spirit tree.

461
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:46,624
And that could play really well with this whole ceremony

462
00:25:46,624 --> 00:25:48,886
that I wanna do because it might almost look like

463
00:25:48,886 --> 00:25:51,207
some kind of a bioluminescent jellyfish

464
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:52,108
or something like that.

465
00:25:52,188 --> 00:25:54,613
So that's really where a lot of those ideas came from.

466
00:25:56,483 --> 00:25:58,904
And here's some of the sketches that I had done initially

467
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:00,964
while I was selling the idea to the team.

468
00:26:00,964 --> 00:26:02,485
And this one in the top middle,

469
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:04,005
I think is valuable to talk about

470
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:06,805
because this was another example

471
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:08,926
where I had an idea and it was improved.

472
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:10,666
So when I first sketched this,

473
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:12,167
I was picturing it as,

474
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,947
Ori was sort of buffeting themselves

475
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,967
against the magnificence that was appearing before them.

476
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:19,068
But when one of our animators took this

477
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:20,028
and started working on it,

478
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:22,369
he had interpreted my sketch differently.

479
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:24,809
And so he ended up animating this.

480
00:26:26,596 --> 00:26:28,036
which was much more serene.

481
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:29,957
And it was really already just soaking in this,

482
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:31,857
you know, the beautiful visuals

483
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:34,078
of what was unfolding before them.

484
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:36,499
And so it was just, it was much more calm and beautiful.

485
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:38,980
And I remember when he showed it to me, I thought,

486
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,820
wow, this is much different than what I was expecting.

487
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,981
Let's do that.

488
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,641
So that's another example of how things get better

489
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:48,762
and better as more and more people's ideas come into play.

490
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:52,944
Let's talk about the epilogue

491
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,404
because we're starting to run short on time.

492
00:26:55,394 --> 00:27:00,075
And really, the game as a whole, we always saw it as being an allegory.

493
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:04,876
So, Blind Forest is about the child-parent relationship with Ori and the role of the child,

494
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:08,657
and Will of the Wisps is about that transition from childhood into adulthood.

495
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:12,578
And so, you see Ori gaining more and more responsibility throughout the game.

496
00:27:12,578 --> 00:27:18,279
It starts out where Ori becomes an older sibling and has this strong desire to protect and to save

497
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:24,941
and to help Ku, and then later inheriting this guardian role of the Moki from Qo'Lok,

498
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:25,261
and then...

499
00:27:25,341 --> 00:27:30,386
even later inheriting a protector role for all of Niwen by becoming a new spirit tree.

500
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:34,931
So it's really about how Ori moves forward in terms of responsibility.

501
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:40,138
Now, regardless of whether or not somebody has played Blind

502
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:42,539
Forest, we wanted the game to feel like it was coming around

503
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:44,040
full circle at the end.

504
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,261
And so what you'll see is that towards the very end

505
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:49,581
of the game, we have a series of callbacks.

506
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:51,882
And they're meant to work depending, either way,

507
00:27:51,882 --> 00:27:53,163
however your experience is.

508
00:27:53,163 --> 00:27:56,144
So here you can see the memories that are showing up

509
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:57,684
during one of these final moments.

510
00:27:57,684 --> 00:27:59,405
And this is a direct callback to the memories

511
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:00,945
from the prologue of Blind Forest.

512
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:05,087
But the memories themselves are of moments in Will of the Wisps.

513
00:28:05,087 --> 00:28:06,587
So it kind of works for both.

514
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:12,912
And then also, here we have a direct Blind Forest callback. Ori is making their way through the

515
00:28:12,912 --> 00:28:18,696
brambles. We're really going for it here. We're really trying to drudge up all the nostalgia that

516
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:23,080
we can. And then here, another Will of the Wisps callback. We're playing on the left-right themes

517
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,565
from the prologue and from after Shriek's attack. And Ori really, if the player holds the stick to

518
00:28:29,565 --> 00:28:33,608
the left, can only look back, and the only option is to keep moving forward towards the future.

519
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,430
And then we have this moment, which one of our animators

520
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,212
had suggested and I really liked,

521
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:43,396
which is right before Ori embraces the light,

522
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:45,238
they take out the feather, Kuro's feather,

523
00:28:45,238 --> 00:28:46,740
and they look at it one last time,

524
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,884
and then they just let it go and let it drift away.

525
00:28:49,884 --> 00:28:51,886
And I thought that that was another good example

526
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:52,927
of visual storytelling,

527
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:55,410
because it really captures the emotion of the moment.

528
00:28:57,873 --> 00:29:00,575
And then here, the final image in the game,

529
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,736
this is a direct callback

530
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:04,437
to the beginning of Blind Forest Prologue,

531
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:06,398
and it's the birth of a new spirit,

532
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:08,219
the birth of a new generation.

533
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:11,081
And this is, when I started at Moon,

534
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:13,663
this was one of the first things that Thomas ever told me,

535
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:15,544
that this was going to be the final image of the game,

536
00:29:15,544 --> 00:29:18,026
and that it was gonna be about that circularity,

537
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:19,507
about that cycle of life.

538
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,807
And I remember when he told me that,

539
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:23,349
I thought, wow, what a cool idea, I really like that.

540
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:30,314
And so I think that on the subject of circularity and things ending where they began,

541
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:35,378
there's no better way to end this portion of the talk than by going back to that starting screen

542
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:37,440
and talking about that one more time.

543
00:29:38,684 --> 00:29:40,965
So let's go ahead and do that.

544
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:43,787
Now, if you watch this screen, the camera's pulling back

545
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:45,868
and we can see Ori on the left hand side

546
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,090
representing childhood and the Spirit Tree of Nibel

547
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,091
on the right hand side representing adulthood.

548
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:55,333
This is really telling us about the life cycle of the spirit.

549
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,654
And crossing between the two,

550
00:29:56,654 --> 00:29:58,475
we can see this flock of birds flying by

551
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:02,016
and they're representing Kou's dream of flight.

552
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:06,539
And so it's only through Ori's acceptance of this responsibility

553
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:09,380
and willingness to move forward into the next phase of life

554
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,703
that the light that is born from that is able to atone for the damages to heal

555
00:30:14,703 --> 00:30:18,525
Ku's wing and to allow her to achieve that dream

556
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,567
of flight. And so I thought that it was really cool

557
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:25,948
that we were able to incorporate all of these different ideas right into the

558
00:30:25,948 --> 00:30:27,869
first few seconds of the game that we're telling you

559
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,611
everything that the game is going to be about right here.

560
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:34,593
And those are the kinds of discussions that I really enjoy having with our team.

561
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:38,555
And it's not that it's something that I think that players are going to pick up on,

562
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:44,057
but maybe as someone continues to play the game, if they happen to play it a second time or even

563
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:48,459
a third time, that it's possible that they might start to pick up on some of these little tidbits

564
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:54,782
that we have sprinkled throughout the experience. And I think that that's just a really cool extra

565
00:30:54,782 --> 00:30:56,503
that we added into everything. So.

566
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,972
I hope that this was enjoyable.

567
00:30:59,972 --> 00:31:01,313
I hope it was interesting.

568
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:03,973
It was a lot of fun for me to walk back through

569
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:06,174
a lot of these sequences with you.

570
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:07,154
I think that that's it for me.

571
00:31:07,154 --> 00:31:10,055
I'm going to be wrapping things up now

572
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:12,996
and handing it off to my colleague, Chris McEntee,

573
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,696
who's gonna be going over narrative design.

574
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:15,356
Thank you.

575
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:19,317
So while Jeremy went over the sort of storytelling.

576
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:23,818
the visual storytelling aspects from Maury and the Will of the Wisps, I kind of want

577
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:28,602
to go into a few case studies from sort of the more narrative design and sort of even

578
00:31:28,602 --> 00:31:34,367
in level design side of things, because there were a number of compromises and issues and

579
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:39,631
things that needed to sort of get resolved along the way throughout production on both

580
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:44,255
the story and the design side to sort of make the most meaningful and impactful overall

581
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:46,277
experience as possible.

582
00:31:49,817 --> 00:31:54,883
One of the very first examples that comes to my mind when I'm looking back on the production of

583
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:59,968
Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the Silent Woods. Because the Silent Woods, it's an area

584
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:06,555
that Claire discovers at the end of Act 1 during the game, and a lot of very important emotional

585
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:07,276
beats happen.

586
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:14,383
in that location. As Jeremy has explained earlier, that's where our friend Ku gets injured,

587
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:20,969
originally died. Very strong emotional beat. It's where we introduce our antagonist, Shriek,

588
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:27,435
which is also very important so that we sort of ensure that her arc is as impactful throughout

589
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:32,420
the entirety of the game as possible. She needs to be introduced in a very good, impactful way.

590
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:40,551
And we really have to endear the player to Kuu and make them feel lost when she's taken from us

591
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:47,535
and feel motivated to push forward with the rest of the game to want to sort of save her pretty much.

592
00:32:47,535 --> 00:32:52,878
And so sort of the core aspect of this was that the player would discover Kuu,

593
00:32:52,878 --> 00:32:56,580
they would enter this sort of tandem gameplay mode where Ori is riding on Kuu's back,

594
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,563
and they would explore the Silent Woods to try to find a way out to escape. Now they've been

595
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,764
reunited pretty much.

596
00:33:04,197 --> 00:33:07,938
But very early on, well, sorry, actually not very early on,

597
00:33:07,938 --> 00:33:10,259
actually it's the opposite, quite late in the project,

598
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:12,000
when we started to piece together the world

599
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,881
and we were having people play test the full experience

600
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:17,582
from start to finish, we started to realize that people,

601
00:33:17,582 --> 00:33:20,683
that this environment was not resonating with people.

602
00:33:20,683 --> 00:33:22,824
As you can see, this is some earlier footage

603
00:33:22,824 --> 00:33:24,065
from the environment, the way that it was

604
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:25,445
at one point in the game.

605
00:33:26,144 --> 00:33:28,885
And you can see that it's just full of spikes and danger.

606
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:30,246
It feels mazy.

607
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:31,747
It feels claustrophobic.

608
00:33:31,747 --> 00:33:35,028
It doesn't feel pleasant to be exploring.

609
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:36,989
It had these explosive monsters, which

610
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:39,570
are in the final environment, but far fewer of them.

611
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,572
And it's just explosions everywhere, just danger

612
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:45,173
around every corner.

613
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:49,435
And also, it was focused really on challenge and precision

614
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:52,456
platforming and this sort of oppressive feel,

615
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:53,856
and not necessarily on.

616
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,520
appreciating the fact that we have our friend,

617
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,700
that we have this new ability to glide in the wind.

618
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,361
We didn't get a chance to do it in a comfortable sense,

619
00:34:01,361 --> 00:34:03,562
to sort of get a feel for how we're controlling

620
00:34:03,562 --> 00:34:05,122
our character and stuff.

621
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:06,883
Basically, we just amped up the challenge

622
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:10,484
right back to where it was before you entered this mode.

623
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:15,966
But the issue is that you're in this tandem situation.

624
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:18,327
What we ended up having to do was remove a number

625
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:20,387
of Ori's abilities when you're in this mode,

626
00:34:20,387 --> 00:34:21,888
where you're playing as Ku and Ori.

627
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,911
because you obviously can't do everything

628
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:25,992
with a different character controller

629
00:34:25,992 --> 00:34:27,633
like this with two characters.

630
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,574
And so many of the moves that the player

631
00:34:29,574 --> 00:34:31,795
was used to actually using, they weren't

632
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:34,556
able to actually use anymore in this environment.

633
00:34:34,556 --> 00:34:38,297
So they felt a little bit nerfed in a way, right?

634
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:40,698
And that's not necessarily a great thing.

635
00:34:40,698 --> 00:34:42,399
But the main reason that they felt nerfed,

636
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,460
one of the main factors at least,

637
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,641
was the fact that in the environment that we had

638
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:49,282
designed, we were placing gameplay elements.

639
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,354
that were encouraging the use of abilities

640
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:52,995
that we had taken from you.

641
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:54,816
Because we were so concerned about what happens

642
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:58,218
if a player backtracks here after the sequence is finished.

643
00:34:58,218 --> 00:34:59,259
What happens if they come back,

644
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:01,460
they need to have new, cool, exciting gameplay things to do.

645
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,122
But it was actually hurting the initial experience,

646
00:35:05,122 --> 00:35:08,164
which arguably is the more important of the two.

647
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:11,245
But you have to nail that initial impression

648
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:14,127
and that first storytelling beat that you have

649
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:15,908
when you're going through the Silent Woods the first time.

650
00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:21,027
And then on top of that, because we had nerfed the controller so much,

651
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:23,129
literally Ori was doing nothing.

652
00:35:23,129 --> 00:35:28,413
It really felt like you were basically just playing as Kuu and not Kuu and Ori together.

653
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:31,575
And so we decided to shift the focus and take a step back.

654
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:33,757
And we reworked the environment.

655
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:38,261
We put a much larger focus on more open, empty spaces,

656
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:42,704
fewer spikes, less oppressive shapes, fewer explosives and things,

657
00:35:42,704 --> 00:35:45,487
and larger, more open wind zone spaces.

658
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:48,857
where the player can just appreciate the fun of gliding

659
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,378
and flying with Koo.

660
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:52,259
So that way they didn't feel nerfed,

661
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:53,841
but instead they felt the opposite.

662
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:54,861
They felt empowered.

663
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,663
They felt like they were able to do something

664
00:35:56,663 --> 00:35:59,045
that they couldn't have done before finding Koo.

665
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:01,287
They felt powered up and they wanted to explore

666
00:36:01,287 --> 00:36:03,688
and see all the new cool things they can do

667
00:36:03,688 --> 00:36:05,350
with this additional ability.

668
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:10,454
But now that we had made the environment less intrusive

669
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:12,576
and we made the gameplay with Koo more fun,

670
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:18,333
what did we do with that space that we sort of opened up?

671
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,974
Because usually when we occupy the space in our levels,

672
00:36:20,974 --> 00:36:23,556
we fill them with challenge and gameplay and dangers

673
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,796
and things like this and puzzles.

674
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:27,077
But we didn't really have that here

675
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:29,358
because we were trying to simplify.

676
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,260
And so what we ended up doing was we thought,

677
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,021
well, how can we enhance and improve on the story beats

678
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:37,962
and the narrative thread going from the beginning

679
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,402
of the Silent Woods until the end?

680
00:36:40,183 --> 00:36:43,885
And so we started to have a look at what we actually had with regards to story beats.

681
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:45,445
It was pretty bare bones.

682
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:50,307
And that actually was a partially a contributing factor to the very strong

683
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:54,168
emotional beat, not landing the way that we wanted to, but the end of the environment.

684
00:36:54,168 --> 00:37:00,011
So at number one here at the beginning of the Silent Woods, we introduced Shriek from behind like this.

685
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,391
So just a very simple introduction.

686
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:06,493
She doesn't see us, but we see her and we're introduced to the fact that there is a pretty

687
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:09,814
significant threat in the Silent Woods that we need to be aware of.

688
00:37:10,883 --> 00:37:14,225
Then a little bit later, I'd say about a third of the way

689
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:19,287
through the environment, the player finds Kuu, they reunite,

690
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:21,449
and then they're basically confronted

691
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:23,830
with our antagonist Shriek again,

692
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,210
but they luckily are out of view

693
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,211
and they don't get spotted pretty much.

694
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,873
But she walks right through the center layer

695
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:33,374
and it basically gives the player this extra feeling

696
00:37:33,374 --> 00:37:35,635
of like, wow, we really are in danger.

697
00:37:35,635 --> 00:37:37,016
We really have to tread lightly

698
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:39,357
in this very quiet environment to not get noticed.

699
00:37:39,892 --> 00:37:45,094
But then basically we completely dropped all of that until the very end of the environment.

700
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:48,755
After all the tough gameplay we had done and everything else.

701
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:50,536
And then boom, Shriek shows up.

702
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:54,337
She somehow knows that we're there despite never seeing us.

703
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,918
And then she basically stomps on our friend Ku.

704
00:37:55,918 --> 00:37:58,779
And it felt unearned and not satisfying pretty much.

705
00:37:58,779 --> 00:37:59,880
So how did we?

706
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,605
improve this? Well, as you can see, we basically introduced pretty much five new story beats

707
00:38:06,605 --> 00:38:14,330
throughout the experience of the silent woods to sort of create a more consistent thread throughout.

708
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:19,094
So, for example, at point number three here, we added yet another shriek moment where we see her

709
00:38:19,094 --> 00:38:24,018
very close to the foreground in search of prey, pretty much being us, but she luckily gets

710
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:29,282
distracted by a howl off in the distance and flies away so we can then pass safely, pretty much.

711
00:38:31,117 --> 00:38:46,930
Then at A, it's not a full story beat, but basically you have to use your ability to shoot your bow and arrow pretty much that we now added to the tandem controller, so that way you feel more like you're Ori and Ku playing together, not just playing as Ku.

712
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:54,237
You can use this bow to shoot this obstruction that causes this giant skull to crash to the ground and make a bunch of noise.

713
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:59,256
And what actually then happens after that is we hear a shriek crying out in the distance

714
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:01,877
from Shriek, who hears the noise that we're making.

715
00:39:01,877 --> 00:39:06,298
This is again just to sort of reinforce in the player's mind that these silent woods

716
00:39:06,298 --> 00:39:11,820
are hers and that we're intruding on her territory and we're not being subtle about it.

717
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:16,062
Then at B, a little bit later on,

718
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,924
we actually introduce another story beat

719
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,966
that ties back to an earlier point in the game.

720
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:23,386
This one actually serves a dual purpose,

721
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:25,368
because at the beginning of the game,

722
00:39:25,368 --> 00:39:27,329
you fight this giant wolf called Howl,

723
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:30,150
and at the end of the fight, it escapes.

724
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,412
It gets away alive, partially unscathed, I would say.

725
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,174
And players always kind of wondered,

726
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,614
what happens to Howl?

727
00:39:37,614 --> 00:39:38,855
Like, when does Howl come back?

728
00:39:38,855 --> 00:39:41,517
When do I get my round two, pretty much?

729
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:43,498
But the thing is, we never designed a round two.

730
00:39:44,104 --> 00:39:47,547
because at the end of the day, we didn't have the budget or the time to do a round two.

731
00:39:47,547 --> 00:39:50,850
And we kind of just left it as this open thread for a long time.

732
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:56,115
And then when we were looking to introduce more story beats to sort of increase the intensity and

733
00:39:56,115 --> 00:40:01,200
really sell the threat that Shriek was in the Silent Woods, we realized that we could actually

734
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,225
take Howl and petrify them and have them present in the environment as sort of a testament to just

735
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:10,208
how powerful and threatening Shriek is.

736
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:20,339
So that howling that we heard off in the distance earlier that sort of drew her attention was that this creature was intruding on her territory, and she went to basically put a stop to it.

737
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:30,585
So it's this sort of, there's always a bigger fish moment where it feels like there is an antagonist that you saw before, but the real antagonist is the one that you're dealing with right now.

738
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:32,686
And you have to watch out pretty much.

739
00:40:35,581 --> 00:40:40,504
Then, at number four here, we always had this kind of owl statue that just crumbled when

740
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,605
you would walk on it.

741
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:46,288
So you would get close, you'd try to run across, it would start to fall underneath your feet,

742
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:53,012
and it was this sort of little moment of suspense, little exciting set-piece moment.

743
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:55,133
But by itself, it was maybe a little bit dry.

744
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:59,816
And so we decided, well, we're already adding in these beets, we're already trying to continue

745
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:02,017
this thread from where you saw her at the start of the woods.

746
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:07,646
until she catches us at the end, why don't we have her be the one that causes this to collapse?

747
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:12,108
But obviously we couldn't have her discover us yet because that has to happen near the very end.

748
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:17,611
So we had her chasing some prey through the foreground into the background, but then that

749
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:23,313
force of her flying through is what actually destabilizes this sort of petrified owl structure

750
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:24,614
and causes it to collapse.

751
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:32,008
And then continuing that thread, we had her waiting just to the right side when we continued

752
00:41:32,008 --> 00:41:36,590
munching on that prey that she was chasing after. So again, it feels like there's this

753
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:41,812
linear progression of things happening as we're exploring, in parallel pretty much, and we have

754
00:41:41,812 --> 00:41:46,995
to sort of sneak past through these sort of fallen tree trunks and things to avoid detection. But

755
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:49,996
then ultimately, we create this final.

756
00:41:54,063 --> 00:41:57,965
you hit a trigger and boom, she comes out through the environment in a sort of

757
00:41:57,965 --> 00:42:03,287
here's Johnny moment that catches you off guard and shows us, okay, she's

758
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:07,689
finally caught sight of us, she knows that we're here, we're trespassers, we're

759
00:42:07,689 --> 00:42:11,751
in trouble. And then we eventually continue forward and get to the moment

760
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:15,833
where Coop gets stomped and suddenly all of it starts to make sense and it feels

761
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,433
more earned.

762
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:20,053
And the combination of all of these things put together

763
00:42:20,053 --> 00:42:23,354
meant that the Silent Woods finally landed as an environment.

764
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:25,735
And players were actually enjoying playing

765
00:42:25,735 --> 00:42:27,236
with Ku and Dory together.

766
00:42:27,236 --> 00:42:30,257
They were actually feeling the tense build up

767
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,857
to that final moment.

768
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:34,118
And that emotional beat at the very end

769
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,339
was resonating with people.

770
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:37,740
And so we hit our mark.

771
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,481
And this was one of the most impactful story beats

772
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:42,161
in the entire game.

773
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:44,442
And if we had not done those changes to the Silent Woods,

774
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:47,513
it never would have landed the way that it needed to.

775
00:42:47,513 --> 00:42:52,656
Another interesting case study I want to talk about

776
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:56,638
is this big Tony friend we have who we named Polok.

777
00:42:56,638 --> 00:42:59,439
We knew very early on that we wanted

778
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:04,361
to have a sort of mentor figure, a very friendly NPC that

779
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:08,483
eventually goes bad, eventually becomes a monster or a boss

780
00:43:08,483 --> 00:43:11,145
that we have to fight later in the game.

781
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:17,658
So, you know, we did the concepts and things of this sage-like giant toad creature. Seems like

782
00:43:17,658 --> 00:43:22,142
something out of The NeverEnding Story. You know it fits the bill. You know exactly what he's going

783
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:27,307
to be there for. But then we wanted him to eventually become corrupt in some way that

784
00:43:27,307 --> 00:43:31,570
was kind of vague at the time. And then we'd eventually have to fight and kill him. And

785
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:36,275
then we would feel sad because we had to put down our friend from earlier on in the game.

786
00:43:38,044 --> 00:43:43,606
So that was the general arc. We would encounter and meet Qo'Loc, we would do some quests for him,

787
00:43:43,606 --> 00:43:49,467
and then eventually after Qo' would get injured, you know, he would say that he's going to help

788
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:55,749
us on our quest to go and restore the light to to sort of help her survive pretty much.

789
00:43:55,749 --> 00:44:01,291
But then somewhere along the way, this starts to get vague, he got corrupted, became a monster

790
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:07,033
pretty much, and then we have to sort of dispose of him and have a very strong emotional beat,

791
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:07,593
pretty much.

792
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:11,033
So what was that looking like?

793
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:14,655
Well, he asked us when we met him to go clear the corruption.

794
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:18,896
Basically, the water in the entirety of the world of Nihlwin, the game world,

795
00:44:18,896 --> 00:44:21,337
was corrupted at the beginning of the game.

796
00:44:21,337 --> 00:44:25,139
And it actually hurts you if you're trying to swim in it.

797
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:29,661
And so he tells us there's a reason for that.

798
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:33,062
It's that this old water mill called the Wellspring,

799
00:44:33,062 --> 00:44:35,263
the wheels have stopped turning years and years ago.

800
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:38,076
And if we can find a way to clear that corruption

801
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:40,877
and start the wheels flowing, turning again,

802
00:44:40,877 --> 00:44:43,177
then the water would flow clear.

803
00:44:43,177 --> 00:44:45,098
And so that's our objective.

804
00:44:45,098 --> 00:44:47,059
And we would go to the water mill,

805
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,999
we would unblock whatever is blocking it,

806
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:50,500
the water would rush clear

807
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,701
and we'd have this epic escape sequence.

808
00:44:52,701 --> 00:44:54,101
And then we would go back to cool lock

809
00:44:54,101 --> 00:44:57,983
and everything would be great pretty much.

810
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,883
But then basically after that,

811
00:44:59,883 --> 00:45:02,684
we would do the whole thing in the silent woods.

812
00:45:02,684 --> 00:45:03,965
He would say, he's gonna go help us on our search.

813
00:45:04,615 --> 00:45:08,598
The idea was that at that point in this sort of darker sort of

814
00:45:08,598 --> 00:45:12,000
scene that we have of him on the left there, that was sort of the

815
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,002
signifier that something's not right, that he's already been

816
00:45:15,002 --> 00:45:18,484
corrupted by the water from sitting in it for so long. But

817
00:45:18,484 --> 00:45:21,767
that also felt kind of weird, the fact that he asked us to

818
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:24,949
clear the water, but actually it was too late anyway, we couldn't

819
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:28,931
have changed the outcome, right. But in any case, then all of a

820
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:32,193
sudden, later in Act Two, when we're exploring one of those

821
00:45:32,193 --> 00:45:33,074
Act Two areas,

822
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:37,730
at the very end of an area, he would pop up out of nowhere,

823
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,511
suddenly corrupted, suddenly dangerous,

824
00:45:39,511 --> 00:45:41,012
and we have to fight him.

825
00:45:41,012 --> 00:45:44,854
And it was too difficult for the player to remember,

826
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:47,995
you know, the last time they saw Kolok,

827
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,716
to understand why he might've been corrupted,

828
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:52,318
did it come from the water and all this kind of stuff.

829
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:54,639
Basically, ultimately, what we wanted

830
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:57,801
was going to require a lot more work.

831
00:45:57,801 --> 00:46:01,883
It was gonna require a lot more story beats, sort of.

832
00:46:02,442 --> 00:46:05,903
intertwined throughout this experience and a little bit more justification.

833
00:46:05,903 --> 00:46:12,184
So on the front of justification, rather than just saying that it was just this sort of ambiguous

834
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:17,306
corruption that was happening to him because of the water, we decided to create a parasite,

835
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:22,947
pretty much, called the foul presence or the stink spirit, that basically was the thing that was

836
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:27,708
clogging up the mill. And this served, you know, it solved a number of problems, pretty much,

837
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,829
because it added sort of a face to this corruption.

838
00:46:30,374 --> 00:46:34,015
It made the escape sequence a lot more interesting.

839
00:46:34,015 --> 00:46:36,336
We started to integrate these sort of corrupted

840
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:39,817
parasite-like objects on all the different wheels

841
00:46:39,817 --> 00:46:42,757
throughout the watermill that you

842
00:46:42,757 --> 00:46:45,258
have to unblock to get the wheels turning again.

843
00:46:45,258 --> 00:46:48,059
And so it all started to sort of make sense.

844
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:50,760
And then the idea being that this foul presence eventually

845
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,021
would get washed out of the watermill

846
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:55,681
and then eventually corrupt QuoLock.

847
00:46:55,681 --> 00:46:57,001
But I'll get there.

848
00:46:58,356 --> 00:47:01,057
And so the idea being that after that escape happened,

849
00:47:01,057 --> 00:47:02,358
you have a small cut scene.

850
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:03,799
And in that cut scene in the background,

851
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:06,520
you can see on the left that the stink spirit is kind

852
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,941
of swimming under the water.

853
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:09,482
And that's sort of for observant players

854
00:47:09,482 --> 00:47:12,643
to realize that the stink spirit isn't quite gone yet.

855
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:13,984
It's still around.

856
00:47:13,984 --> 00:47:16,725
But that doesn't pay off until much later in the game.

857
00:47:16,725 --> 00:47:21,068
But then in Act 2, when the player is exploring and then

858
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:22,728
going through the different environments

859
00:47:22,728 --> 00:47:23,849
they can find in the game.

860
00:47:24,448 --> 00:47:30,973
they start to enter an area called the Luma Pools, and that's the area where Qolok is the boss of.

861
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:36,798
And so that's where we needed to start this journey of like justifying the transition from

862
00:47:36,798 --> 00:47:41,142
friend to foe and how do we sort of lay the breadcrumbs pretty much to make that work.

863
00:47:41,142 --> 00:47:46,927
And so we can already start seeing some more of these signs of the foul presence present.

864
00:47:47,587 --> 00:47:52,308
in the luma pools that we have to break and destroy and unblock things and stuff.

865
00:47:52,308 --> 00:47:55,629
And so once again an observant player might put two and two together

866
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:59,090
and start to realize that this thing is not dead and it's gone

867
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:03,832
this way pretty much. Then the other part of the puzzle

868
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:10,774
is that we we add small NPC moments that basically explain that Kolok has

869
00:48:10,774 --> 00:48:13,795
actually gone to this location. So you have these

870
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:15,195
little Mokey characters.

871
00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:17,949
that basically say, have you seen Qoloq?

872
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:19,550
He's gone to the luma pools.

873
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:22,350
And that already from the very beginning

874
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,271
of the environment tells the player

875
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:26,592
that this is where Qoloq is.

876
00:48:26,592 --> 00:48:28,972
If I keep going forward, I might eventually find him.

877
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:32,993
And that sort of helped to bring him back into your mind

878
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,954
from so long ago in the game and make you realize,

879
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,115
oh, actually I should be expecting something

880
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,435
with Qoloq coming up soon.

881
00:48:40,186 --> 00:48:42,607
And then even near the end, right before we find him

882
00:48:42,607 --> 00:48:45,589
in his corrupt state, we added another cheap NPC moment

883
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,250
to sort of reinforce that something's wrong here

884
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:53,792
and amp up the suspense in the lead up, pretty much.

885
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:55,733
And then in the middle of the Luma Pools,

886
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:58,575
to sort of finish this trail of breadcrumbs, pretty much,

887
00:48:58,575 --> 00:49:02,817
we decided to invest in adding a full QoLock interaction

888
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:05,478
moment, where we would clear out the space that otherwise

889
00:49:05,478 --> 00:49:06,378
was filled with gameplay.

890
00:49:06,963 --> 00:49:11,206
plop this giant toad in there and actually interact with him like we did in the early

891
00:49:11,206 --> 00:49:12,127
sections of the game.

892
00:49:12,127 --> 00:49:14,308
And at the end of this interaction...

893
00:49:14,804 --> 00:49:18,526
He basically says that he will continue searching for this wisp

894
00:49:18,526 --> 00:49:19,727
that we're looking for as well.

895
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:24,350
And he physically moves further through the environment,

896
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:27,112
signifying this is where we probably need to go.

897
00:49:27,112 --> 00:49:29,213
But actually, in terms of gameplay,

898
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:33,496
we need to find another ability that allows us to follow him.

899
00:49:33,496 --> 00:49:35,877
So that gives us a little bit of breathing room

900
00:49:35,877 --> 00:49:38,899
where things might have gone wrong off screen, pretty much.

901
00:49:38,899 --> 00:49:43,322
So with all of those breadcrumbs in place,

902
00:49:43,322 --> 00:49:44,263
we've justified.

903
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:51,267
Polak getting corrupted through having this parasite that eventually makes its way to him.

904
00:49:51,267 --> 00:49:58,111
We've laid the breadcrumbs so that the player feels the progression from the water mill and

905
00:49:58,111 --> 00:50:03,273
where Polak was originally, to his path that he's taken through the Luma Pools, and the same thing

906
00:50:03,273 --> 00:50:12,618
for the foul presence, pretty much. So now we're down to the introduction of Polak in his antagonistic

907
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:14,259
state, pretty much, the reveal.

908
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:17,568
And so our very first test for the reveal,

909
00:50:17,568 --> 00:50:20,370
we just went for what we'd done up until this point,

910
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,672
which is sage-like friendly Qo'lok.

911
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:26,674
Being sage-like and friendly, he found the wisp for us.

912
00:50:26,674 --> 00:50:27,054
What a dude.

913
00:50:27,054 --> 00:50:28,895
What a bro.

914
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:30,096
But then at the very last second,

915
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:33,378
when we're about to get the wisp, it gets captured.

916
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:37,521
And so it was Qo'lok by the Fowl of Presence.

917
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:42,744
And then basically, he emerges in this parasitic state

918
00:50:42,744 --> 00:50:44,485
where now we have to fight him pretty much.

919
00:50:45,404 --> 00:50:50,707
But one of our animators thought that wasn't good enough, that that wasn't working, wasn't impactful.

920
00:50:50,707 --> 00:50:56,050
And so he tried a different approach where we actually see that Kolok is noticeably

921
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:02,314
out of it pretty much. And he actually already spilled the beans a bit by showing the foul

922
00:51:02,314 --> 00:51:06,257
presence wrapped around him, but that was an approach that he wanted to try

923
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:09,839
to sort of show that clearly something is off here pretty much.

924
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,441
But already, Kholak isn't speaking.

925
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:14,122
He's not giving the player this feeling of,

926
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:15,904
oh, I found the thing for you.

927
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:18,987
It really feels like it's a trap placed by this parasite,

928
00:51:18,987 --> 00:51:19,928
pretty much.

929
00:51:19,928 --> 00:51:21,949
And so already, we start to see that we're going

930
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:23,531
in a much better direction.

931
00:51:24,337 --> 00:51:27,918
But then for the final game, the compromise that we made

932
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:33,301
was we wanted to save the reveal of the foul presence being

933
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:37,803
a part of this fight and have it be a little bit of a surprise

934
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,004
still while still retaining that something's

935
00:51:40,004 --> 00:51:43,186
wrong with Quo Lock vibe that we had in the previous animation.

936
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:46,728
And here we also decided to lean more into the fact

937
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,869
that he's a toad and use the tongue rather than

938
00:51:48,869 --> 00:51:50,470
his little froggy hands and stuff.

939
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:54,651
But as you can see here, now we show the player

940
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:56,512
with this reveal with the tentacles

941
00:51:56,512 --> 00:52:00,435
that Kolok has become corrupted by this familiar face

942
00:52:00,435 --> 00:52:02,216
from earlier in the game.

943
00:52:02,216 --> 00:52:04,598
And this is where the player could maybe start to realize,

944
00:52:04,598 --> 00:52:06,920
had they not cleared the mill, this might not

945
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,401
have happened to their friend.

946
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:09,862
I'm a horrible person.

947
00:52:09,862 --> 00:52:11,903
But then also, he asked me to do it.

948
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,925
So it was his own demise.

949
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:17,968
Like, he was the architect of his own demise, pretty much.

950
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,789
So there's a lot more layers to it now.

951
00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:23,868
that we've done the work to really make this land better.

952
00:52:23,868 --> 00:52:27,751
So then in the fight, obviously, we

953
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:31,112
still want to have this touching reunion moment with him

954
00:52:31,112 --> 00:52:32,073
that lands emotionally.

955
00:52:32,073 --> 00:52:34,014
And that's not going to happen if he's just

956
00:52:34,014 --> 00:52:36,795
basically a monster for the rest of the time

957
00:52:36,795 --> 00:52:37,496
that we have with him.

958
00:52:37,496 --> 00:52:40,717
So at the end of the fight, we made this conscious decision

959
00:52:40,717 --> 00:52:42,358
that Pollock fights back.

960
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:44,519
We do the final hit, and then he starts

961
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:47,501
struggling against his captor and gets pulled off screen.

962
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:53,534
And then from that point on, we need to sort of follow Kowlok up there and sort of see what the

963
00:52:53,534 --> 00:52:57,858
resolution is. We're concerned at this point, but we know that we've completed the fight,

964
00:52:57,858 --> 00:53:04,322
so all that's left is the resolution. And what we discover is that Kowlok basically overtook the

965
00:53:04,322 --> 00:53:11,968
Stink Spirit off screen, and he basically gets to finish that arc. He gets to have that last laugh,

966
00:53:11,968 --> 00:53:12,408
pretty much.

967
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:17,269
And we found that that was very important for Koloch to have this little triumph of his own,

968
00:53:17,269 --> 00:53:22,112
as opposed to us killing the thing and just freeing him. So that way, you know, he fights

969
00:53:22,112 --> 00:53:27,395
back a little bit more and it feels more endearing for him as a character and everything he's been

970
00:53:27,395 --> 00:53:33,378
through pretty much. And then basically we wrap and we get the Wisp back as he sort of dies and

971
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:40,182
fades away. We can continue our quest, but emotionally it really stings because we sort of

972
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:42,503
paved the way for this moment to be able to happen.

973
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,044
And then we completely undermined all that work by filling this path that the player goes back

974
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:55,147
afterwards with enemies, because we were focused on, oh, we don't want a long, boring stretch

975
00:53:55,147 --> 00:54:00,751
filled with nothing to do. Let's put enemies in combat and things to keep you busy. But then

976
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:03,493
we realized very quickly, seeing people play this,

977
00:54:03,856 --> 00:54:10,240
that it was a complete emotional whiplash because they were still completely taken by this emotional

978
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,522
moment. Some of them were still crying at this point. We have this beautiful emotional music

979
00:54:14,522 --> 00:54:18,384
that our composer wrote and we completely undermined it by filling this path with

980
00:54:18,384 --> 00:54:22,927
dangerous things and enemies and stuff. And so similar to the silent woods, we stripped away

981
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:28,851
all of those layers and we just let the emotional moment breathe and it was far more powerful as a

982
00:54:28,851 --> 00:54:29,291
result.

983
00:54:32,306 --> 00:54:36,888
So this final set of smaller case studies I want to share,

984
00:54:36,888 --> 00:54:39,349
it all has to do with that final point I kind of just

985
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:42,730
mentioned with having breathing room, letting moments breathe,

986
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:45,971
but just sort of like global pacing as well.

987
00:54:45,971 --> 00:54:49,173
Because we realize we design levels on a very micro flow

988
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:52,214
level where everything has to be very tight and fun

989
00:54:52,214 --> 00:54:54,695
and challenging.

990
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:57,876
But then when you start to put a lot of these micro flow chunks

991
00:54:57,876 --> 00:54:58,396
together.

992
00:54:58,897 --> 00:55:05,580
to make a world, suddenly the macro flow matters in a big way, and the way that you flow from one

993
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:10,763
of those sections to another and the pacing between them becomes very significant. So for example,

994
00:55:10,763 --> 00:55:18,107
at the well spring, the water mill that I mentioned earlier, the room right before that big

995
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:23,850
water escape sequence that we have with the foul presence used to look something like this,

996
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,932
where it was this very tight, very spiky, maze-like

997
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:29,913
challenge heavy environment, very oppressive.

998
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:33,013
And honestly, it wasn't all that fun.

999
00:55:33,013 --> 00:55:35,694
And very late in production,

1000
00:55:35,694 --> 00:55:38,774
we finally got the okay to try breaking

1001
00:55:38,774 --> 00:55:41,415
this entire level apart, this room,

1002
00:55:41,415 --> 00:55:44,415
and doing something very different there.

1003
00:55:44,415 --> 00:55:46,095
And so we opted for was creating

1004
00:55:46,095 --> 00:55:48,236
an environmental storytelling space,

1005
00:55:48,236 --> 00:55:49,436
which served multiple purposes.

1006
00:55:49,436 --> 00:55:53,317
One, it was allowing us to actually give more insight

1007
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:56,257
into the lore of the world through environmental storytelling.

1008
00:55:56,843 --> 00:55:59,365
but two, it also served as a pacing break

1009
00:55:59,365 --> 00:56:02,487
right before this very challenging escape sequence.

1010
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:05,169
The player was already spending so much time

1011
00:56:05,169 --> 00:56:07,470
in challenge mode climbing up to this part

1012
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,751
of the water mill.

1013
00:56:08,751 --> 00:56:11,072
They didn't need another room of challenge

1014
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:12,813
right before another challenge.

1015
00:56:12,813 --> 00:56:13,614
They needed a break.

1016
00:56:13,614 --> 00:56:15,415
They needed to be able to relax a little bit,

1017
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:18,677
soak in the environment and appreciate this place

1018
00:56:18,677 --> 00:56:21,538
that's been so oppressive to them up until this point.

1019
00:56:21,538 --> 00:56:23,940
And so we just let the artists and storytellers

1020
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,701
go wild with a big empty room.

1021
00:56:26,112 --> 00:56:27,893
and make it whatever they felt was going

1022
00:56:27,893 --> 00:56:29,353
to be the most interesting.

1023
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:33,074
And ultimately, it made for a much better experience

1024
00:56:33,074 --> 00:56:34,895
for the Wellspring as a whole.

1025
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:40,756
Bar's Reach is another example where

1026
00:56:40,756 --> 00:56:42,597
we needed to pay attention to pacing

1027
00:56:42,597 --> 00:56:44,898
environmental storytelling and art as well.

1028
00:56:44,898 --> 00:56:48,979
Originally, Bar's Reach, it's our frosty peak environment

1029
00:56:48,979 --> 00:56:49,899
in the game.

1030
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,620
snow peak themed pretty much.

1031
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,901
And one of the gameplay elements we have in there

1032
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:57,342
are these sort of cauldrons that you heat up

1033
00:56:57,342 --> 00:57:00,043
by flapping some air onto them like a bellows,

1034
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:01,864
and then they shoot out a projectile.

1035
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:03,705
So when this area was designed,

1036
00:57:03,705 --> 00:57:05,846
this was the entrance to Bar's Reach,

1037
00:57:05,846 --> 00:57:07,087
and it was designed purely

1038
00:57:07,087 --> 00:57:08,808
from a mechanical gameplay standpoint,

1039
00:57:08,808 --> 00:57:11,729
which is I'm introducing this gameplay element,

1040
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,390
it's going to open the door.

1041
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:15,451
I know that the player has understood the element

1042
00:57:15,451 --> 00:57:17,032
because they opened the door.

1043
00:57:17,032 --> 00:57:18,493
Cool, now let's go forward

1044
00:57:18,493 --> 00:57:20,033
and explore the rest of Bar's Reach.

1045
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:24,440
The thing is, we had something far more interesting

1046
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,581
that we could use to gate that area.

1047
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:29,462
We had already done a prototype of Bar.

1048
00:57:29,462 --> 00:57:33,443
He's a large story NPC that I can't go into detail on right

1049
00:57:33,443 --> 00:57:33,783
now.

1050
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,764
But he's significant for the game in a number of ways.

1051
00:57:37,764 --> 00:57:39,684
And we thought it would be fun to be

1052
00:57:39,684 --> 00:57:43,665
able to tickle his nose and have him sneeze and open up a path

1053
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:45,045
pretty much to move forward.

1054
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:48,106
But the thing is, when the designer was putting together

1055
00:57:48,106 --> 00:57:50,667
the environment, they didn't really

1056
00:57:51,078 --> 00:57:54,839
the novelty of that or the significance of having that in a prominent location.

1057
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:58,480
So they placed it somewhere in the middle of the environment,

1058
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,921
just sort of like to have it, but not really to use it properly, let's say.

1059
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:07,743
And so then looking critically on the environment near the end of the project,

1060
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,344
we realized that the artists needed more room to breathe.

1061
00:58:10,344 --> 00:58:12,584
They needed more room to transition.

1062
00:58:12,584 --> 00:58:15,505
And so what we did was we gave them more flat space

1063
00:58:15,505 --> 00:58:18,426
that they could use to sort of almost crossfade the environments.

1064
00:58:19,146 --> 00:58:24,611
into each other, and we also decided to replace that very gamey gating system with the cauldron

1065
00:58:24,611 --> 00:58:32,477
with this more interesting, memorable, striking bar gate that actually used the exact same input,

1066
00:58:32,477 --> 00:58:37,422
the same kind of gating, the same ability, just in a much more contextualized and interesting way.

1067
00:58:37,422 --> 00:58:41,865
And actually the fact that you can discover this gate so early in the game.

1068
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,361
it adds this sense of wonder and mystery to the environment

1069
00:58:45,361 --> 00:58:48,482
because you discover this snoring giant bear in a cave

1070
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:50,683
and you wonder what lies beyond,

1071
00:58:50,683 --> 00:58:53,364
but you can only discover it later on in act two of the game

1072
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,885
when you have a new ability.

1073
00:58:54,885 --> 00:58:57,586
And so that was a much, much stronger gate

1074
00:58:57,586 --> 00:59:01,027
and a much better transition and build up

1075
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:02,588
pretty much than what we had originally.

1076
00:59:05,138 --> 00:59:08,100
Our sort of dark, insect-infested environment,

1077
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,002
called Moldwood Depths, it had a similar issue

1078
00:59:11,002 --> 00:59:14,185
where the entrance was this giant spider statue,

1079
00:59:14,185 --> 00:59:17,367
but it was gameplay-focused, covered in spikes.

1080
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:20,249
Player has to do these sort of tricky maneuvers

1081
00:59:20,249 --> 00:59:22,711
to then unblock some random door.

1082
00:59:22,711 --> 00:59:26,374
It didn't really feel all that interesting or memorable,

1083
00:59:26,374 --> 00:59:27,515
pretty much.

1084
00:59:27,515 --> 00:59:30,778
And so while we had this nice transition zone,

1085
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:32,619
certainly different from Bar, what we

1086
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,519
was just really a better gate.

1087
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:38,380
And so Jeremy did some paint overs

1088
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,183
and suggested that we have just this giant spider statue

1089
00:59:42,183 --> 00:59:45,866
as purely an environmental landmark in the background.

1090
00:59:45,866 --> 00:59:47,987
And when we eventually have the ability

1091
00:59:47,987 --> 00:59:49,949
to come here in the story,

1092
00:59:49,949 --> 00:59:51,090
that we have some little friends

1093
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,731
that come and unlock this big gate.

1094
00:59:53,172 --> 01:00:00,515
So we decided that the story was that the Moldwood Depths was sealed off years ago because it was so corrupted and infested,

1095
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:04,896
but they're going to open it for us because the Wisp is down there and we need to find it, right?

1096
01:00:04,896 --> 01:00:10,058
And so what we ended up doing was leaning into this and created this sort of opening in the floor,

1097
01:00:10,058 --> 01:00:13,179
sort of to have that, to emphasize that feeling that you're going underground,

1098
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:18,520
and then this sort of, you know, wind would bellow up when it opened and spores were coming out.

1099
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,462
So it really feel like this place, this temple hasn't been opened in a very long time.

1100
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:26,322
And again, similar to Bar, you can discover this statue

1101
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:29,304
very early on in the game and have the sense of wonder

1102
01:00:29,304 --> 01:00:32,345
and wondering what's going to happen here eventually.

1103
01:00:32,345 --> 01:00:35,927
And when you come back and it actually does get unsealed,

1104
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:37,108
it feels magical.

1105
01:00:37,108 --> 01:00:39,869
And again, we just put it, the design

1106
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,431
took a backseat for environmental storytelling

1107
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:44,132
and pacing, and it really paid off.

1108
01:00:44,132 --> 01:00:47,754
And the final example, I'm running low on time.

1109
01:00:48,722 --> 01:00:49,982
is the Wintorn Ruins.

1110
01:00:49,982 --> 01:00:52,442
So the Wintorn Ruins was meant to be

1111
01:00:52,442 --> 01:00:54,383
the final dungeon of the game,

1112
01:00:54,383 --> 01:00:57,224
a full dungeon just like the other ones that we had,

1113
01:00:57,224 --> 01:01:00,024
but due to production concerns and scope issues,

1114
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:02,065
we decided to trim it down heavily.

1115
01:01:02,065 --> 01:01:04,125
But we still didn't want to give up on the fact

1116
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:07,986
that it was meant to be a very tricky gameplay challenge

1117
01:01:07,986 --> 01:01:09,626
like everything else in the game.

1118
01:01:09,626 --> 01:01:11,367
And so we combined all these elements,

1119
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:15,268
like darkness and explosions and lasers and spikes,

1120
01:01:15,268 --> 01:01:16,948
and people in the team hated it.

1121
01:01:16,948 --> 01:01:17,868
It really felt out of place.

1122
01:01:18,117 --> 01:01:19,498
And also because it was leading up

1123
01:01:19,498 --> 01:01:22,460
to the final escape sequence of the game, which is very, very

1124
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,781
challenging in itself.

1125
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:27,103
And similar to the well spring and the water mill,

1126
01:01:27,103 --> 01:01:30,305
leading up to the final challenge with a challenge,

1127
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:32,506
pacing-wise, felt very inappropriate.

1128
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:35,107
And so we decided to take a similar note from the well

1129
01:01:35,107 --> 01:01:38,249
spring and take this very linear section

1130
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:40,431
that we streamlined it to and fill it

1131
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:43,032
with sort of environmental storytelling,

1132
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:46,174
beautiful frescoes that our art team put together.

1133
01:01:46,598 --> 01:01:48,159
And this also gave us an opportunity

1134
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,742
to tell more about the history of the world of Ori

1135
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:53,643
and the Will of the Wisps, and also

1136
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:57,085
foreshadow the final conclusion and Ori's fate,

1137
01:01:57,085 --> 01:02:00,168
pretty much, in a very interesting and memorable way.

1138
01:02:00,168 --> 01:02:03,550
And ultimately, playing through this longer story sequence,

1139
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,652
very linear, lacking in challenge,

1140
01:02:05,652 --> 01:02:09,915
all focused on story, it really ended up, pacing-wise,

1141
01:02:09,915 --> 01:02:12,317
being the best thing to create that sort of calm

1142
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:13,177
before the storm.

1143
01:02:13,585 --> 01:02:16,988
right as you then approach that final escape sequence,

1144
01:02:16,988 --> 01:02:19,390
and then challenges you for a few hours, pretty much.

1145
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:24,394
So just like with all of these examples,

1146
01:02:24,394 --> 01:02:26,835
ultimately, creating Ori and the Will of the Wisps

1147
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:28,657
and making it the way that we made it,

1148
01:02:28,657 --> 01:02:31,719
it really ended up having to be a marriage of story,

1149
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:32,580
and design, and art.

1150
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,462
And we had to really compromise on all fronts

1151
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:38,705
to kind of make that the best possible whole

1152
01:02:38,705 --> 01:02:40,806
that it could be so that this story resonated

1153
01:02:40,806 --> 01:02:42,928
with the players in the way that we wanted it to.

1154
01:02:44,152 --> 01:02:45,595
I appreciate your time.

1155
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,859
Thanks on behalf of Jeremy and myself.

1156
01:02:47,859 --> 01:02:51,906
You can find more from both of us on our Twitters, basically.

1157
01:02:51,906 --> 01:02:54,510
And I hope you have a great GDC.

1158
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:55,812
