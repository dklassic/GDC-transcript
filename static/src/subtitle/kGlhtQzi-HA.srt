1
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:15,119
Thanks you guys, thanks.

2
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:39,682
I'm Sky Lewin, music director and composer at Bungie. It's my pleasure to introduce to my

3
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:43,584
left Michael Sechrist, our senior technical audio designer who's also doing some

4
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:49,648
composing and to my right, good friend, uh 15 year Bungie veteran, now an independent

5
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:55,312
composer, C Paul Johnson. He's gonna kick off our talk with a look back at what the ambient

6
00:00:55,352 --> 00:01:00,335
music system was in Destiny, what we changed and enhanced for Destiny 2 and why.

7
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:03,217
Alright, thanks Sky.

8
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:06,937
Okay, so why are we here?

9
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:11,040
Well, we had to modify our tools and our music implementation

10
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:14,844
and our scoring process for Destiny 2 in response to scope

11
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:16,266
and scale and gameplay changes.

12
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:19,168
And we thought you might find our approach

13
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:21,851
to solving the particular problems that we ran

14
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:25,514
into interesting and helpful in your own music solutions.

15
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:29,822
Why is this talk called Linear Music in an Open World?

16
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:33,685
Because during the development of Destiny 2, as we started

17
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:35,507
to understand more and more about how much freedom the

18
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:38,489
player would have and how the needs of the gameplay evolve

19
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:42,153
from Destiny, both in, Destiny 1,

20
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,975
both in the explorable gameplay space and in the number

21
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:47,237
of unique highly scripted linear activities

22
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:48,738
that we were building, we realized we needed

23
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,340
to find a more efficient way to score.

24
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:59,809
our game that didn't compromise the musical experience we still wanted to retain. So...

25
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,572
Okay, so before we look at what we changed, let's start by looking back at how our ambient

26
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:12,335
music worked in the original Destiny game. Destiny, and Destiny 2 for that matter, consisted

27
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:17,257
of several different explorable destinations. Here you can see a few of the destinations.

28
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:25,671
in Destiny. Each destination was given its own collection of linear pieces that act as the

29
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:33,237
locations ambient music and defines the feel for each environment. So it's a typical open

30
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:38,961
world solution. These pieces of music acted as a randomized playlist of music with

31
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:40,762
stretches of silence after each piece.

32
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,125
Each piece consisted of an ambient layer that was played and then an action layer that would

33
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:49,087
come and go based on engagement with enemies.

34
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:55,794
In Destiny, when we wanted to custom score a mission or a specific encounter, we were

35
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:59,718
required to custom implement and script all the music for that mission as a one-off event.

36
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:10,287
Okay. So what did we change for Destiny 2? In Destiny 2 we have a multitude of activities in

37
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:18,210
the destinations that feel very linear but could be kicked off by players in the world or not.

38
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:25,392
And that left us with a whole bunch of linear gameplay that needed to be able to come out of

39
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,353
the open, of the destination content.

40
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:32,317
Those were also pretty easy for designers to set up,

41
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:34,957
and it left us with a whole bunch, way more linear content

42
00:03:34,977 --> 00:03:37,658
than we could reasonably support custom scoring everything.

43
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,619
So we needed to support unscripted environmental

44
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,300
gameplay, more curated content, and we

45
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,781
needed to do both those things with high production values.

46
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,962
At the same time, we didn't want to lose our tailored linear

47
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:53,902
music experience, given the fact that a lot of the gameplay

48
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,562
was still linear.

49
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:58,732
we were discovering that the original method we had in

50
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,733
Destiny of scripting out the ambient music and bringing it

51
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:03,294
back in wouldn't scale.

52
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:07,016
So our approach to Destiny 2.

53
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:09,217
How did we propose to move forward?

54
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:12,239
Well, we had ambient music playing based on which

55
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:15,000
environment already, and we had ways to turn it on and off

56
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,021
when we wanted to score something.

57
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:19,302
So we wondered how much mileage we could get out of

58
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,603
giving that ambient music more things it could do.

59
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:26,756
Once we did that, could we score whole story missions with this new system?

60
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:30,939
Could we set things up so designers could easily experiment with timing and

61
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,681
intensities and pacing without us getting involved?

62
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,865
Could we build that designer tool in a way that would let us go back and

63
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:43,389
fix what they did in a way that, without having to touch the game scripts,

64
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,571
which is really important for us in the late stages of development.

65
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,232
Creatively, wanted to have the ambient music

66
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:52,452
when the player was wandering around, activated by AI

67
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,333
like before, custom music tailored

68
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:58,714
to our linear flagship content, and this middle layer

69
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:02,775
of music that felt linear to score the rest of the gameplay.

70
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,215
And we were asking ourselves, could we make that

71
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:07,396
into one cohesive system?

72
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,656
I don't know.

73
00:05:08,756 --> 00:05:10,256
Could we make it all easy to use?

74
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,437
Those were our goals, and now Sky and Michael

75
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:14,877
are going to talk about where we landed.

76
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:26,211
Cool. So this part of our music system we're really literally just focusing in on is what we play in the

77
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:31,076
destinations when you're exploring in the game. So our flagship content really retains the same

78
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:35,300
aesthetic as it always has and we're still scoring that the same way. So this part of the talk is

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,724
really focused on one piece of our puzzle, if you will.

80
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:42,889
So for Destiny 2, we retained the same randomization,

81
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:45,051
the same ambient playlist functionality

82
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,492
that was established in Destiny,

83
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,376
with the same vertical ambient and action layers

84
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:50,577
that C. Paul already mentioned,

85
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,360
but we actually expanded it by composing additional

86
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,362
linear horizontal sections of music

87
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:58,465
for each of these ambient pieces that play in a destination.

88
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:06,312
And these intensities, such as action or high action, actually expand what that music can do

89
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:10,835
so that they can cover more gameplay activities that traditionally would have needed custom

90
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:16,760
score. And we call each of these a music system. And what a music system is, is a single

91
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,183
expanded piece of music or a collection that contains all of the necessary different

92
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:27,567
intensities to play, um, at the same key or related keys and tempos. And, uh, that's

93
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:32,263
we build these different intensities out with transitions

94
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,944
so that they can transition nicely from each piece

95
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:36,845
to any other piece.

96
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:39,385
And in this system, it actually has to be able

97
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:42,447
to go from anywhere to anywhere or end at any time.

98
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:50,650
And this by itself is not necessarily unique.

99
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:55,515
What makes this unique is the way we combine it with other aspects.

100
00:06:55,835 --> 00:07:01,696
So each system is effectively a cue in the destination's music,

101
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:06,438
the music that defines the feel of the destination, as C. Paul mentioned earlier.

102
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:12,639
And so the suite of systems that goes into that destination includes several of these,

103
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,660
these music systems.

104
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,021
So our music system contains a bunch of music systems,

105
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:19,341
if that's not confusing enough.

106
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:20,501
That's how we call it.

107
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:25,663
Um, but again, like I said, none of these by themselves are unique, but when we combine

108
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:31,025
them together that gives us this solid linear score in the destination game experience,

109
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:33,006
which is exactly what we were trying to do with this.

110
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:39,248
Basically taking that linear feel of our flagship content, that blueprint, and imposing it upon

111
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:42,969
the feel of the activities in the destinations in our game.

112
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:49,913
And basically, one of the big benefits of this is that because this suite of music systems

113
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:57,419
contains music at a variety of different keys and tempos, we are able to keep ourselves

114
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:03,523
from being limited to one or two keys and related tempos, and that gives us a lot of

115
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:05,105
mileage with this music.

116
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:14,076
So how did this change our scoring process? Of course the big thing here is that none of this will work without good content

117
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:19,761
So we still try and focus on writing the music the same as we always have that part really hasn't changed

118
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:23,885
We're just developing new ways to put it into the game and to play it back

119
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:30,089
when we're playing the game. So in Destiny, we would spot an activity with the designer, we'd

120
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,531
start composing or in some cases use that information to alter what we were already

121
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:40,354
composing if something was already in flight. Um, and then we would go in and temp the

122
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:44,357
activities as they were being built with temp music. So for those of you who are familiar

123
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:48,439
with that, you know what that means. If, if you don't, it's just temporary music that's not

124
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:52,321
gonna stay. It's some placeholder to show what the functionality is gonna be like.

125
00:08:53,276 --> 00:09:00,464
Um, excuse me. And then a designer or Michael would script in the music into the activity. We

126
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:05,669
would orchestrate and record and produce the music, mix it, get it all ready. And then...

127
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,710
finalize it, put that real music into the game in place of the

128
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,432
temp music and polish, review, make tweaks as necessary. And

129
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:18,512
that was basically our process. And that same process we carry

130
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:22,973
forward for flagship content, that more or less doesn't change

131
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:26,134
with a few tweaks, but there's some benefits to this new

132
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:29,135
process that actually streamline that and that's what I wanted to

133
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:33,076
show you here. Is that in Destiny 2, we actually start off

134
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,896
with letting the designer script the activity.

135
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:45,803
And they're actually building the activity score as they build an activity, whether it's a mission or a strike or a raid or something that might play in a destination.

136
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:46,804
And so

137
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:52,963
we're actually kind of skipping the temp step because they're able to temp while they script

138
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:57,406
and hear that music immediately as they're building the activity. And then our spotting

139
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:04,871
session really becomes more of a review and tweak and change or update than, you know, that

140
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:07,993
initial step that kicks the whole process off for these activities.

141
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,234
And then of course we record, orchestrate, or orchestrate record in that order. Um, mix, get the

142
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:18,537
music ready, put it in the game, review and the rest of the process is more or less the same.

143
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,304
So once our music systems are ready to go into the game, there are three main steps we need to

144
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:30,725
take to get it implemented.

145
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:35,024
First, we build the music systems in Wwise,

146
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:36,824
and then second, we assign the music

147
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,145
to the various destinations.

148
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:41,045
And then last, the designers can then use that music

149
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:42,006
to score their content.

150
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:46,847
As Sky mentioned earlier, each of our music systems

151
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:49,088
is composed of several different sections of music

152
00:10:49,588 --> 00:10:51,028
for the various intensities that we have.

153
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:55,866
The way that looks in Wwise is each music system becomes a switch

154
00:10:56,446 --> 00:11:00,087
with all the various sections composed for the system as the different values

155
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:03,028
or if you're familiar with Wwise, a playlist within that switch.

156
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:08,530
Once all of our music systems are built as switches in Wwise,

157
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,071
they're ready to be assigned to the various destinations.

158
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:16,232
The way we do that is by grouping them into something we call ambient music sets.

159
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:23,125
These are custom files we've created to act as collections of music which we then assign

160
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:26,906
to destinations or parts of destinations to provide their music.

161
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:33,088
Each of our destinations in our game have at least one ambient music set, while some

162
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:33,688
may have more.

163
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:35,309
It all depends on what the environment calls for.

164
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:41,650
For example, our destination Titan has two ambient music sets, one for the exterior space

165
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:43,591
and another for the interior.

166
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:48,295
Once we've assigned an ambient music set to a location in the game,

167
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:52,138
we've achieved the same ambient playlist behavior we had in Destiny,

168
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:56,902
and that's done by randomly cycling through the various music systems in the set

169
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,843
and playing their ambient sections.

170
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:03,267
But thanks to all the additional sections we've composed into each music system,

171
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:06,189
that music can now be used by designers to score their content.

172
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:11,153
And the way they do that is by using another one of our custom files called a music score.

173
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:17,321
Now these files are comprised of a series of sections that are added by the designer

174
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,462
to determine the flow of the music through their content.

175
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:24,645
Each section has a name, which is what the designer calls in script to trigger that section

176
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:29,088
to play, and an intensity value, which is literally a drop-down selection of all the

177
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,950
different switch values we use to build the music in Wwise.

178
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,773
So action, high action, tension, all of the different intensities that we have.

179
00:12:38,354 --> 00:12:39,875
Now let's pretend I'm a designer and I'm...

180
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:41,986
Building an adventure for Destiny 2,

181
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:44,007
which is essentially a side mission.

182
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:47,030
My music score might look something like this.

183
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:51,133
Here I've created three sections of music,

184
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:54,055
starting with light action, going to action,

185
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:55,176
and then ending with end,

186
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:56,998
which will play the appropriate ending

187
00:12:57,038 --> 00:12:58,619
for whatever music is currently playing.

188
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,260
That's all determined in the transitions

189
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,121
we've built in Wwise.

190
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:03,763
Now that I have my score,

191
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:05,384
I just need to do a little bit of scripting

192
00:13:05,424 --> 00:13:07,566
in my adventure script to make it all function,

193
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,428
and that could look a little like this.

194
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,248
This is totally real right here.

195
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,452
The first thing I do is I define my sections at the top

196
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:18,313
using their names.

197
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:22,657
Then I simply call or activate those wherever it is I want

198
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,117
them to play.

199
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:27,661
And that's the whole process for implementing our music

200
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:28,121
systems.

201
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:31,984
Before I hand it back to Sky, let's go over a quick

202
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:34,686
graphical representation of this entire process so you

203
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:36,568
guys can have a little bit better understanding.

204
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:41,198
Here's another one of our destinations, I-O.

205
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:44,239
The first thing we do is we build I-O's music systems

206
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,119
in Wwise as switches.

207
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,440
We then assign those switches to an ambient music set,

208
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:52,761
which is then assigned to I-O.

209
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:55,582
At this point, if a player lands on I-O,

210
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:58,063
the engine will randomly pick one of the music systems

211
00:13:58,123 --> 00:14:00,463
in the set and start playing its ambient section.

212
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:05,145
Here you can see it's choosing the second system in the set.

213
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:07,566
Now let's say the player comes across

214
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,566
the adventure we just created.

215
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:12,675
Here you can see our adventure's music score and the script.

216
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,816
The player kicks off that adventure,

217
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:17,317
that first music call for light action will be made

218
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:19,899
by referencing the first section's name.

219
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,580
At that point, the first section's intensity

220
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,861
is sent to the engine, and the piece of music

221
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:26,882
that was playing its ambient section

222
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:28,403
transitions to the new intensity,

223
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:29,603
in this case, light action.

224
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:35,641
And one of the great and most powerful things about this system is if we decide that that call

225
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:39,103
for light action is not what we want, it's super easy for us to go in there,

226
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:41,445
open up the music score, click on that.

227
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:44,347
It's literally just a drop down selection of the different intensities

228
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:45,267
that we can make the change to.

229
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:48,690
We don't have to touch wise and most importantly we don't have to touch the script.

230
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,472
So therefore we can make these changes as late in the game as we need to.

231
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:58,297
So let's take a look at what this actually sounds like in the game.

232
00:14:58,317 --> 00:14:59,918
I'm going to play you a couple of examples here.

233
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,819
But before I do, let me give you a couple heads up as to what we're going to see.

234
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:10,004
So first of all, as we mentioned, you can actually hear this transition occur

235
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:13,207
from either the silence between pieces of music in a destination

236
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:14,809
or from a piece that's playing.

237
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:16,750
And so one of the videos, the first one we're going to show,

238
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,754
is going to actually demonstrate a transition from music that's already playing.

239
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:23,437
The second one is going to start from the silence in between the pieces.

240
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,319
So we're going to look at that in the examples.

241
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:40,136
We're also going to, I want to point out that this, because the system is actually randomly cycling through different pieces of music in a destination's playlist, we're actually randomly picking a cue and the activities then can be scored by different pieces of music.

242
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:43,520
But we can actually choose to limit that to a specific piece if we want.

243
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,223
So, if we say this activity needs this piece of music every time.

244
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:51,657
then we just make a bucket with that piece in it and it has its

245
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:55,119
score. But we can also let it randomize and pick and the

246
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,820
great thing about it is you can scale what it can pick from. So

247
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,101
it can be the whole destinations playlist or a sub-playlist from

248
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:04,542
that destination or just a single piece. Um, another thing

249
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:08,164
to point out here is that the, uh, the videos we're gonna watch

250
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:11,485
are drastically shortened just for digestibility. So you're

251
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:14,306
gonna see the burn-ins on the screen that say time cut. That's

252
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:15,327
where we cut a lot of time out.

253
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:20,056
Um, and in between those, you're going to see script calls on the screen.

254
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:22,298
You're not going to hear the music transition right on the script call.

255
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:24,259
You're going to hear it afterwards because obviously the

256
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:25,639
transitions have to be musical.

257
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,282
And if you're familiar with wise, that may in some cases be next beat, next bar,

258
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:33,944
whatever the next grid setting is, or maybe a custom queue, but, um.

259
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:38,455
the transitions will follow as the music dictates. And so on

260
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:41,498
the first one we're gonna watch, it's just gonna be music only,

261
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:44,761
I'll kinda talk through a couple of them and we can watch that.

262
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:48,644
And the second one, we'll take a look at it in context. Um, let's

263
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:49,044
take a look.

264
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:55,970
Okay.

265
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:18,938
So there's the script call for action.

266
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:22,020
When you hear the transition starting.

267
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:25,842
And now we're actually in action.

268
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:29,865
There's a time cut transition to light action.

269
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,328
And now we're actually in light action.

270
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:20,313
Thanks for watching, make sure to like and subscribe!

271
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:50,855
So in the next video, we're going to see the exact same activity, but a different play

272
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:52,137
through, a different piece of music.

273
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:55,543
This one's going to actually have the full game mix, sound design, everything in there.

274
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:59,689
But I'll point out that the music mix is a little hot, just so you can hear it a little

275
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:00,871
more clearly in context.

276
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:18,066
Hey Zavala, guess who pinged our beacon near that Fallen Pike Gang?

277
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:19,507
Fallen?

278
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:26,992
These vehicles aren't as maneuverable as a Sparrow, but they pack a punch.

279
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:32,995
Keep punching. You have a golden opportunity to put the Red Legion down for the count.

280
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:38,639
Remind me never to get into a boxing match with a Titan.

281
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,861
That Fallen Pike Gang is still a threat.

282
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,733
Took the words right out of my mouth.

283
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,634
Let's not make this a habit, huh?

284
00:19:46,674 --> 00:19:50,256
We'll see.

285
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:52,136
Be careful out there.

286
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:54,598
Those pikes were rebuilt with scavenged technology.

287
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:23,231
I'm pretty pissed.

288
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:27,654
Whatever they throw at us.

289
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:29,436
They deployed a walker to your position.

290
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:10,548
back to the scratch. And a victory like this will ensure a respite for us as well. Excellent work.

291
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:19,252
Cool. So some of the challenges that we had in actually making this work and building it out is

292
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:25,195
that it does require a large amount of music. Now there's a sweet spot at which the amount of

293
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:28,797
music that doing this requires is actually less than doing it

294
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:32,899
the way we did in Destiny, which is basically custom scoring every single activity in the

295
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,960
game. And the reason that it was beneficial for us is because we were over that sweet

296
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:43,503
spot. So if, if your team is, um, gonna attempt something like this, you may wanna find where

297
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:48,345
that is for your project, because it, it could be that doing this actually requires more

298
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:49,726
content than you need to put in.

299
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:52,743
So depending on the needs of the game, that's something to be aware of.

300
00:21:53,443 --> 00:21:57,306
Another big one that we found is that designers need some education on this.

301
00:21:57,326 --> 00:22:01,928
You can't just put the tool there always getting the result that you expect because sometimes

302
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:08,412
a designer is going to maybe do transitions a little too closely together or there's often

303
00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:12,234
a misunderstanding of, oh, I called it, it didn't transition right away, I want to hear

304
00:22:12,274 --> 00:22:13,175
it right there and then.

305
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,436
And so making the...

306
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:20,847
making the understanding of how this thing works really clear was important.

307
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:21,549
And there's also

308
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:24,977
just the basic need of making sure that the script itself

309
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,039
actually supports what the mission is going to be doing.

310
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,940
And so that's what the spotting session

311
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,661
is incredibly important for,

312
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:35,683
is making sure that what the designer's script is calling

313
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:38,124
and the music flow following the mission

314
00:22:38,184 --> 00:22:40,646
is actually scoring the mission the way it needs to.

315
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:44,708
And then of course, there's the need for handcrafted moments

316
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:48,050
and the ability to handcraft is still incredibly necessary.

317
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,212
So we occasionally need to combine using the system

318
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:52,292
with custom scoring.

319
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,812
And on the advantages side, there's quite a lot of great things that we discovered with

320
00:22:58,852 --> 00:22:59,052
this.

321
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:04,276
And the big one for us was that we were able to use this to score action in the familiar

322
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,437
dramatic and linear fashion that we set out to do it.

323
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:08,058
It did what we wanted it to do.

324
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:13,761
As I pointed out earlier, the designers can easily temp their own activities and being

325
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:18,985
able to immediately hear the activity and the changes in their music in their activities

326
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:23,267
as they're building them is really huge and it cuts down on iteration time for them and

327
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:28,466
it takes us out of that step in the process almost entirely because they can now use music

328
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:34,311
from an older, uh, destination or another destination to temp an activity as they're

329
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:38,134
building it. It may not be the right piece of music, but temp music rarely is, so that

330
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:43,759
it really worked in our favor there. Um, another big one is that because the randomization

331
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:49,445
aspect of this happens to be something we can control, we can use the...

332
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:54,108
randomization to enhance the replayability of some of these missions when we want to.

333
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:59,569
And a really big one is that the implementation work is a lot less redundant.

334
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:03,590
So let's say we had a piece of music that we wanted to use in three different activities

335
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,571
and maybe part of it was going to be used here and another part there and this part

336
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:07,071
overlapped.

337
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:10,912
If we did this by hand the way we used to do it, we would have to...

338
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:13,593
and basically implement each piece three times.

339
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:16,053
But with the system, we just implement it once,

340
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,574
and the script points to which part we're going to play.

341
00:24:18,654 --> 00:24:21,015
And so it's a lot less work to set it up.

342
00:24:21,055 --> 00:24:22,135
I mean, it's still a lot of work,

343
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:24,876
but it's a lot less than doing it the other way.

344
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:27,377
Yeah, of course it's still work.

345
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:31,438
But it's a much more efficient means

346
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:35,679
of making that music available to the game.

347
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:40,657
Another big one is that the more activities that are added in a destination, the more

348
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:45,682
value we actually gain from using this system approach, since the randomization can stretch

349
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,223
and cover more activities.

350
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:52,209
And the scalability ratio of music to activities is a huge asset for us.

351
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:56,633
But the biggest one, I think, hands down, is that late changes to music...

352
00:24:57,194 --> 00:25:04,359
have less risk associated with them because the content is already hooked up and functional and literally all we're doing is we're changing the music

353
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:07,322
intensity values in a drop-down menu like Michael mentioned.

354
00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:11,965
We can do this completely on our own as late as the last check-in in a mix and

355
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:15,708
the script does not need to change so there's no risk to the project.

356
00:25:16,812 --> 00:25:22,637
And on that note, um, we are going to be moving to, uh, one of the wrap up areas. If you guys have

357
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:27,180
any questions, I just want to remind you, please fill out your surveys and I have to say that

358
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:31,764
GDC's been awesome. This is my first time here. The game audio community is awesome. You guys

359
00:25:31,804 --> 00:25:34,126
are all great. Please keep it up. Thank you.
