1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,741
Hey, welcome to playtesting God of War.

2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:13,225
And to put it pretty simply, playtesting this game,

3
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:15,186
it wouldn't be the same without playtesting.

4
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:18,188
Playtesting provided us and our game a huge advantage,

5
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:20,830
and hopefully you'll see that by the end of this presentation.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,072
And so we hope going through this journey of playtesting

7
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:26,834
with you guys that we can either help inspire you

8
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:29,936
or maybe even do something similar to us

9
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:31,337
or even just learn about what it takes

10
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:32,778
to playtest a big game like God of War.

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,800
And so just to hone in the focus a little bit,

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,361
the playtesting I'm talking about is external playtesting,

13
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,942
because there's a lot of different types of playtesting

14
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:42,442
that you can do.

15
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,304
You can have internal reviews, you can do focus groups,

16
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:46,344
you can do market research,

17
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:48,225
but that's not what we're gonna talk about.

18
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:50,646
The playtesting I'm talking about is when you go in

19
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:53,487
and you recruit people to come in and play your game

20
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,988
when it's in development, and then they give you feedback.

21
00:00:55,988 --> 00:01:00,329
And so the people I'm with here today

22
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,150
is G.E. Shroff and Kevin Kieger.

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,531
Jeet's the Gameplay Director at Santa Monica Studio,

24
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:06,731
and Jeet was heavily involved

25
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:08,412
and helped drive the playtesting process

26
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:10,052
from a creative leadership point of view.

27
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:15,333
Kevin Keeker was a Principal User Researcher at SIE,

28
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,414
and still is, and he's right now

29
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:18,994
focused on PlayStation exclusives.

30
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:21,335
His responsibilities were he planned our research strategy,

31
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:23,275
he guided our data collection,

32
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:25,196
and he helped us conduct analysis and reporting

33
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:26,316
for all the God of War studies.

34
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:28,837
And me, my name's Ed Deerian.

35
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:31,918
I'm on the Production Team at Santa Monica Studio.

36
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:36,465
One of my primary responsibilities was to coordinate all of our external playtests,

37
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:41,906
and I worked as the bridge between our team and Kevin's team as the user researchers.

38
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:48,128
And so when I'm finished with this presentation, we'll have a little bit of time for Q&A in

39
00:01:48,128 --> 00:01:49,828
case you guys have any questions.

40
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:55,590
And note to everyone, there is spoilers in this talk, so I hope you weren't expecting

41
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,170
no spoilers.

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,131
And I do spoil the last boss fight, so getting that out of the way right now.

43
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,867
And so before I get into the mechanics

44
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,888
of what we were doing in our playtesting process,

45
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:11,090
I'd like to give you some quick backstory

46
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,091
and what kind of prompted us to rethink

47
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,772
our playtesting process to begin with.

48
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:18,735
And so it really all starts with this image.

49
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:21,116
This image represents God of War's new vision.

50
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:24,398
And it's not exactly what made it into the final game,

51
00:02:24,398 --> 00:02:26,560
but it embodies the spirit of what

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,581
creative director Cory Barlog wanted to achieve.

53
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,603
And the vision for this game was very substantially

54
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:34,505
different than the other past God of Wars.

55
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:37,453
It had a more intimate and grounded approach,

56
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:39,834
and it was centered on the relationship of Kratos

57
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:40,714
and his new son, Atreus.

58
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:44,657
And at the center of this vision,

59
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:48,779
brought this idea of character growth into the franchise.

60
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,440
And surrounding character growth,

61
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,961
you had the three game pillars,

62
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,021
narrative, combat, and exploration.

63
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:56,603
And so it's an important point to make here

64
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:59,345
that this game wasn't a remake or reboot.

65
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,026
It was a reimagining,

66
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:03,187
and it was a continuation of Kratos' story.

67
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:06,636
which means that at its core, this was the same Kratos

68
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:08,377
that players have spent over a decade with.

69
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:11,299
And I'm pointing this out because whether or not

70
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:13,321
people had played the previous games,

71
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,663
we knew that some people would come in with expectations,

72
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:18,325
ones that were based on how these past games were.

73
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:22,628
And so the studio was faced with all these challenges

74
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:23,869
with reimagining this game.

75
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,451
The first challenge being that it was just

76
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:27,132
a brand new vision.

77
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:29,293
It had a new weapon.

78
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,215
It was in Norse mythology.

79
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:32,896
It had a no-cut camera.

80
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:34,653
And it also had a boy.

81
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:41,075
I was afraid my voice would crack when I did that,

82
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:42,595
so I'm glad that worked out.

83
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:48,497
In addition, since this was not a new IP,

84
00:03:48,497 --> 00:03:51,238
we knew that there were gonna be new

85
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:52,578
and old player expectations.

86
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:55,399
Ones from people who have played the previous games

87
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,840
and ones who were new to the franchise.

88
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:01,412
And we also knew that this was just gonna be

89
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:02,913
a difficult game to make,

90
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:04,434
because this was a really big game

91
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:06,494
with an extremely high quality bar.

92
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:08,235
This was the studio's first game on the PS4,

93
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:10,676
which in and of itself required

94
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:12,117
new technology and infrastructure.

95
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:15,278
And since this new vision was so vastly different

96
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:16,079
than the previous games,

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,620
it meant that a lot of extra effort

98
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,820
would have to be spent early on

99
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,241
just designing and prototyping.

100
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:25,737
And so all of these challenges basically made

101
00:04:25,737 --> 00:04:27,577
the early development for the game very difficult.

102
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:29,959
And all these things were kind of clashing

103
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,640
and colliding with each other all the time.

104
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,821
And as a result, the early effort was spent

105
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,622
on just kind of building these components up,

106
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:41,184
just to get it playable in the first place.

107
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:43,125
And so this journey from pre-production to alpha

108
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,706
that we had was very long and difficult.

109
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:47,448
And there was this huge mountain of doubt and frustration

110
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:48,328
boiling up on the team.

111
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:51,630
And it culminated with a couple of pretty serious questions.

112
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:54,638
Is this even God of War anymore?

113
00:04:54,638 --> 00:05:00,719
And then more importantly, is it any good?

114
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:03,320
And so we carried this burden all the way to late 2016,

115
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,680
which is when our alpha was.

116
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,400
And this is when we'd set out to play the game

117
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,961
from start to finish for the first time.

118
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:10,861
But it was still alpha.

119
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:13,082
We knew that not every feature would be completely in.

120
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:15,922
But this would be where the first time that we as a team

121
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:18,763
would see the whole game being played from start to finish.

122
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:19,943
And so what was the result?

123
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:23,148
Well, to put it frankly, the game wasn't very fun.

124
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:26,110
And like many game alphas are,

125
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,431
we, there, you know, that's just kind of how it is.

126
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:31,173
But there was still a lot of friction

127
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,394
and frustrating moments in our game.

128
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:35,516
And it was very easy to tell that there were some things

129
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:36,977
that were a lot further along than others.

130
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:40,239
And kind of an example at this time,

131
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,500
the cinematics and the key narrative aspects of the game

132
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,181
hadn't been fully realized.

133
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:46,343
And so there was a lot of gaps and holes in the game

134
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:47,303
that had yet to be filled.

135
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:50,274
And so this huge and complicated puzzle

136
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:51,534
that we were trying to piece together

137
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,615
just wasn't really fitting.

138
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:56,016
And we kind of needed to speed up because we were at alpha

139
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:57,676
and there wasn't a lot of time left for us.

140
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:01,558
And so the state of the game at this time

141
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:03,578
was telling us that we needed to accelerate.

142
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:09,460
But not only accelerate, doubt was starting to sink in

143
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,981
about the game, about the process.

144
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:14,042
And so we began to even question the mechanisms

145
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,422
for how we were validating our work.

146
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:17,103
But we knew one thing.

147
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,698
What we were doing clearly wasn't enough,

148
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:21,639
so we had to rethink our approach.

149
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,280
So this is when we kinda took a look

150
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,601
at our current playtesting process.

151
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,422
Because we were conducting these playtests,

152
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,482
and the studio had been doing playtests all the time,

153
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:33,543
all the way since the original God of War.

154
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,564
But we noticed that these playtests

155
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:36,844
weren't being very effective.

156
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,845
There were some problems with them.

157
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:40,345
And so I'll dig into them real quick.

158
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:42,706
The first problem was that playtests

159
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:45,587
weren't really telling us any new information.

160
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:48,344
Sometimes it kind of felt like we were just looking

161
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:49,104
for sand in a desert.

162
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:52,186
The feedback we had was pretty surface level,

163
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:55,267
but most of the time it explained to us in a different way

164
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:56,548
what our problems already were.

165
00:06:56,548 --> 00:07:00,130
People would say things like it's hard to control the camera

166
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,291
or that they were having a hard time to track the enemies.

167
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,393
And at the time we knew these were problems.

168
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,914
We weren't getting any feedback beyond that.

169
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:11,595
And our second problem was that we didn't have

170
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:12,476
a global process.

171
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:15,946
Because like I said, the team was playtesting,

172
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:17,326
but it was happening in isolation,

173
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:20,208
and nothing was really looking at the whole game together.

174
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,649
So we'd get feedback on levels,

175
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,809
we'd get feedback on combat,

176
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,851
but nothing was really looking at them together.

177
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:26,851
And as a result of this,

178
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:30,313
we were getting this conflicting feedback.

179
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:31,914
And this was very difficult to determine

180
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:33,274
what the next steps forward would be.

181
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:38,717
Well, you know, because I think this beast was different.

182
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:41,198
Like this was a much different game than we were used to.

183
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:43,580
And it was a very different game, a bigger game.

184
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:47,369
And this new game had a new vision,

185
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:50,432
it had more complexity, it had a deeper narrative.

186
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:53,554
And so playtesting the game, how we were doing it before,

187
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:54,415
just wasn't really working.

188
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:59,479
And so some just started questioning playtests as a whole.

189
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,201
And this valley of doubt on the team grew even more.

190
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,863
Why were we even doing it?

191
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,804
We just keep getting the same feedback,

192
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:09,206
it's a waste of time.

193
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:12,769
And so around this time, our sister studio, Gorilla Games,

194
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:14,850
had finished up wrapping a game of their own.

195
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,522
Horizon Zero Dawn.

196
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:19,424
And they heard that we were looking at revamping

197
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:20,485
our playtesting process,

198
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:24,308
and they offered to give us some advice.

199
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:27,631
And so we jumped on a call with Matthias and Lambert

200
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:29,913
to hear more about what they had to say.

201
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:32,875
And they too said that they were having similar struggles

202
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,857
with getting a game just as big as ours stood up.

203
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:37,839
And they had similar experiences with the challenges

204
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,480
associated with playtesting such a game.

205
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,923
And they told us about working with Kevin,

206
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,785
and how this partnership with the Experience Lab

207
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,201
helped them create a playtesting process

208
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:48,342
that was very effective.

209
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:52,585
And so like we were experiencing,

210
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:53,986
they also had doubt and they questioned

211
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:55,707
how much they should even rely or invest

212
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,508
in playtesting to begin with.

213
00:08:57,508 --> 00:08:58,609
And ultimately what they learned

214
00:08:58,609 --> 00:08:59,509
and what they shared with us

215
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,871
can be summed up in this one sentence.

216
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:03,032
You have to go all in.

217
00:09:03,032 --> 00:09:06,314
And if you fully commit, it will be the difference

218
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:07,175
and it will pay off.

219
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:10,977
And so this call with them inspired us.

220
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:14,019
We immediately contacted Kevin's team and we got to work.

221
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:16,847
And at this time, I would like to say

222
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,187
that it would be a huge understatement

223
00:09:18,187 --> 00:09:20,348
if I didn't acknowledge how much of a direct impact

224
00:09:20,348 --> 00:09:21,749
Kevin and his team had on the game.

225
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:25,271
But at the same time, I know that not many studios

226
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:27,992
don't have access to such a user research team.

227
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:31,654
And so I've tried my best to focus this presentation

228
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:36,476
on the concepts which hopefully are universally relatable.

229
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,917
And so let's dig in and let's start out

230
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:40,358
by outlining our playtesting process and what we did.

231
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,495
So I'll start with some broad strokes of why we playtest,

232
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:46,236
what our testing goals were, and then dive in deeper

233
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,596
into the different types of playtests

234
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:48,917
and how we analyzed our data.

235
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:53,298
And so I'll start by asking this question,

236
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:55,599
why are we even playtesting in the first place?

237
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:59,460
Well, the first part is we're trying to validate

238
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,900
how well we've realized our vision.

239
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,781
And note I didn't say validate our vision.

240
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:06,322
The vision of the game was set.

241
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:07,943
We weren't looking for feedback to tell us

242
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:10,263
that Kratos should have a mustache instead of a beard.

243
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:14,271
We wanted to see how well we had realized our vision

244
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:15,492
through our implementation of it.

245
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:18,715
And so we needed to make sure

246
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,937
that we were getting actionable data that we could use.

247
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:22,438
Because as I mentioned earlier,

248
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,300
we were struggling to get this information

249
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,281
beyond what we already knew.

250
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:28,344
And finally, we're doing all this

251
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:29,565
in order to make the game more fun.

252
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:32,247
And maybe that's a bit obvious.

253
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:33,949
But I don't mean just going into a playtest

254
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,270
asking, is the game fun?

255
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,690
For us, it was about extracting and understanding

256
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,772
this feedback in order to make meaningful steps

257
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:41,952
towards making the game better.

258
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:46,096
And thinking about it this way was very important to us

259
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:48,137
because it set the tone that these playtests

260
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:50,579
weren't just to tell the dev team if they were right

261
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:51,380
or if they were wrong.

262
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,442
These playtests were helping us get data,

263
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:56,143
and then it was up to the dev team

264
00:10:56,143 --> 00:10:58,105
to ultimately decide what to do with that.

265
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:01,588
And so we made sure that the dev team

266
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:03,589
was getting the data that they needed

267
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,991
in order to help make the best decisions.

268
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:10,879
And so this whole process began with defining

269
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,359
good play test goals.

270
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:15,261
And so we made sure that the goals were clear and measurable

271
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:17,562
because before this new process,

272
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:20,064
we'd go into test just asking, is the UI intuitive,

273
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:21,245
and then just kind of stopping.

274
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:24,586
But we learned that asking the UI is intuitive

275
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:25,827
is pretty a good starting point,

276
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:28,428
but we had to learn how to focus our feedback

277
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:31,110
towards the crux of what we were actually looking for.

278
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,752
For example, we'd ask more details about the menu flow

279
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:37,453
or how well people understood the tutorials.

280
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,576
And second, we began to realize how much overall work

281
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,277
that this would require, and so we began to treat

282
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:47,638
playtesting as a game feature in its own right.

283
00:11:47,638 --> 00:11:49,718
This meant that we had to support it

284
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:51,799
with a strong production backbone,

285
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,120
because just like any other features,

286
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,181
it needs advocates and it needs people to fight for it.

287
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:59,142
And so we created a playtest strike team.

288
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:02,083
This was led by creative director Cory Barlog

289
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,844
and our director of product development, Yumi Yang.

290
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:06,725
Because it was important to us that the leadership

291
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,466
was right there in the middle of it,

292
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:09,846
weighing in and driving it forward.

293
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:13,157
and they were advocating for the process across the team

294
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:15,058
the whole time.

295
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:17,700
Because you will run into problems along the way,

296
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,861
and you'll need a mechanism for being able to adapt

297
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:21,742
and react to these changes as they happen.

298
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:25,544
And so finally, we needed to be able to find a way

299
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,646
to measure success, to see if these changes

300
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,487
that we were making in the game were actually working.

301
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:31,508
And so we took it one play test at a time.

302
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:34,490
Because just doing one test wasn't gonna fix

303
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,990
all of our problems.

304
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,391
And so we were using these play tests

305
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,932
to make incremental steps forward.

306
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:42,998
And so we also closed out, we made sure that we closed out

307
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:45,479
every test with a debrief, where the researchers

308
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,720
would present us some top line summaries

309
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,521
and some key takeaways.

310
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:51,402
And this gave us a good place to start targeting goals

311
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:51,822
for the next test.

312
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:55,984
And so remember these things when you're defining

313
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,205
your playtest goals, because it's important

314
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:01,406
to start off playtest with a purpose.

315
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,686
What are you trying to achieve?

316
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:06,048
And this was a good way of kind of helping us

317
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,288
springboard that way of thinking.

318
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,037
And so our next hurdle was defining how often

319
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:13,298
we should test to begin with.

320
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:16,462
And so this is the playtest calendar

321
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,604
that we originally proposed.

322
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:20,946
And I made this around when we started revamping

323
00:13:20,946 --> 00:13:22,588
our process around March 2017.

324
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:25,851
And this shows the playtest through November.

325
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:27,573
The blue tests are our usability tests,

326
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,056
and the tan tests are big game playtests,

327
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:31,217
which I'll go into those shortly.

328
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:34,979
And then like most calendars that producers make,

329
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:37,701
as soon as we started doing things, it actually changed.

330
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:39,782
So it's not the exact calendar that we used.

331
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:41,743
But there's a few key takeaways from this

332
00:13:41,743 --> 00:13:43,945
that we think are pretty important to share.

333
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:47,187
The first is to reinforce to the team

334
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:48,648
that there's always another playtest.

335
00:13:48,648 --> 00:13:51,229
It's important that the team is confident,

336
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:54,031
and that they feel like they can rely on playtests,

337
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:56,673
which means that consistency is key.

338
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,700
Because if you keep canceling or moving your playtests,

339
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,101
it creates instability,

340
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:03,161
and then the process just loses credibility.

341
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:05,742
And so we made sure up front

342
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:08,162
that when we confirmed a playtest, we stood behind it.

343
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:09,942
And we did everything in our power

344
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,383
to ensure that it actually happened.

345
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:15,144
And for us, that meant that we had to be okay

346
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:15,964
with taking risks,

347
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:19,625
and balancing new feature integrations with build stability.

348
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,485
Because we were in development,

349
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,725
and that's just kind of part of it.

350
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:24,762
And so it was important for us to make sure

351
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:27,124
that the leadership was on the same page

352
00:14:27,124 --> 00:14:28,184
with this way of thinking.

353
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:32,628
And so this did lead to some heated back and forths

354
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:34,449
about some last minute check-ins.

355
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:37,772
And sometimes we broke very significant parts of the game.

356
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:39,313
There was a time where we broke a trace

357
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,874
in one of these playtests.

358
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:41,995
And after you killed a Draugr,

359
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:44,096
he would just yell Draugr over and over again.

360
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,697
He'd be like, Draugr!

361
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:45,958
Draugr!

362
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,439
Seriously.

363
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:49,180
It was terrible.

364
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,882
But we had to push through this.

365
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,625
Because in almost all cases, it was better for us

366
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,866
to playtest the new things that might break stuff

367
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:59,066
than to leave it out and then miss out on the feedback.

368
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,367
And so this mindset helped kick us into high gear

369
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,668
because every playtest was really important.

370
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:08,729
And lastly, it was important that we took

371
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:11,410
incremental steps forward, each test building upon the last.

372
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,231
This meant that we used the different types

373
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:15,851
of tests to our advantage.

374
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:17,231
So we'd look at big picture issues

375
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:19,332
and we'd figure out where the pain points were

376
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,372
and then we'd dive in deeper.

377
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,977
Because for example, you're not just going to nail the camera

378
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:25,497
after one test.

379
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:28,038
We were fine-tuning it all the way to the end.

380
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:30,579
And so we had to make sure that we were constantly

381
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:31,959
making that meaningful progress.

382
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:38,141
And so now let's take a look at the different types of tests

383
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:40,722
we used and what types of feedback that they produced.

384
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:45,404
So we primarily used two different types of tests.

385
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,165
We used unguided playthroughs and usability tests.

386
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:51,419
And both of these tests have very specific goals

387
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,099
that they achieve.

388
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:55,042
And using them strategically helped us find

389
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:57,304
and focus in on the core issues.

390
00:15:57,304 --> 00:16:01,808
And I'll start by talking about unguided playthroughs.

391
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:04,009
Put simply, unguided playthroughs

392
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,291
try to find your pain points.

393
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:10,155
They look at the whole game and how well you've realized it.

394
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:11,376
And generally, they'll give you an idea

395
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:13,458
of where people are having the most trouble

396
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,199
and where you need the most attention to spend.

397
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,586
And the goal of these tests is to have as little interaction

398
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:21,807
with the playtesters as possible,

399
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:23,748
much like how they would be playing the game at home.

400
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:26,490
This meant that we would only help them

401
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,351
if they specifically asked us for it,

402
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:31,053
or if we knew that they were encountering a bug or an issue.

403
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:37,117
And so these tests helped us identify and validate

404
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,518
the holistic components of the game.

405
00:16:38,518 --> 00:16:42,681
An example of these are like measuring the overall pacing

406
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:44,002
or the narrative comprehension,

407
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:46,663
or the difficulty balancing, just to name a few.

408
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:50,512
And looking at it this way gave us a nice mental image

409
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:52,153
of where the top issues were in our game.

410
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:57,596
And that's where the usability test came in.

411
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,257
We would take these pain points that we found

412
00:16:59,257 --> 00:17:01,538
in the unguided playthroughs and then we'd dive in deeper.

413
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:05,520
And these usability tests were meant to isolate

414
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,321
the root cause of where this friction or pain

415
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:08,041
was coming from.

416
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,803
And it lets you investigate alternate solutions

417
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:11,863
in a quick and iterative way.

418
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:14,627
Because in a full play test, you'll

419
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:17,408
get this noise that is created by other game systems, which

420
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,970
can lead to generalized feedback.

421
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,271
For example, someone might say the combat isn't fun.

422
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:24,692
But then you use ability tests, and you find out

423
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:26,813
that the real problem was in the camera sensitivity.

424
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:30,696
And so it was important for us, that since it

425
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:33,357
was such a big game, that we had to have a proper mechanism

426
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:35,478
to be able to filter out this noise

427
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:36,759
and then hone in on our core issues.

428
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,321
And so these tests, these usability tests,

429
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,882
were conducted in small one-on-one sessions

430
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:46,143
where a user researcher would be paired up with a playtester.

431
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:48,564
And these playtesters were encouraged

432
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:51,306
to have an open dialogue with the user researcher.

433
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:52,646
We'd ask targeted questions about

434
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:55,168
what they were thinking moment to moment.

435
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:56,528
And even though we were mainly looking

436
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:58,589
for constructive feedback in these usability tests,

437
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:01,411
things that were wrong with the game,

438
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,971
it was also helpful to hear feedback

439
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:04,612
that was telling us that we were on the right track.

440
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:08,792
And so here's a list of the features

441
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,512
that we did some kind of usability testing on.

442
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:13,013
And as you can see, many of these things

443
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:14,714
are very core components of the game,

444
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:16,974
and that's very intentional.

445
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:19,695
And since we only had a limited amount of time left,

446
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:21,396
we needed to make sure that we were constantly

447
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:28,378
moving these features in a right direction.

448
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:30,899
Which leads me to this next question.

449
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:33,520
How do you extract meaningful data

450
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,700
from this process which leads to positive results?

451
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:40,327
And for both types of these tests,

452
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,029
we learned that this depended on how we were asking for it.

453
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:47,412
And so we used two primary ways to our advantage.

454
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:49,754
Feedback that was volunteered to us,

455
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,655
or feedback that we explicitly asked for.

456
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:55,958
And so we referred to this volunteered feedback

457
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,719
as undirected feedback.

458
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,581
We got our undirected feedback

459
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:02,002
from either in-person interviews that we conducted,

460
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:04,264
or what Kevin called the red button.

461
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:08,258
Because at any point, a play tester could essentially

462
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:10,479
just pause the game and then just type in a comment box

463
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,621
about any epic, frustrating, or confusing moments

464
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:13,321
that they were having.

465
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:16,904
And doing it this way, this undirected feedback

466
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:19,206
gave us the moment-to-moment feedback.

467
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:20,386
This was all unprompted.

468
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:22,868
And this often led to follow-up questions

469
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:25,010
that we would have from the dev team to dive in deeper.

470
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,113
And the directed feedback that we got

471
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:32,295
refers to things that we specifically asked for,

472
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:33,936
usually in the form of a survey.

473
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:36,543
And so we would always try to get this

474
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:37,903
undirected feedback first,

475
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:40,403
because we didn't want to bias the players

476
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:41,844
towards thinking that there were problems

477
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,864
with these game systems that we were asking about

478
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:48,005
in these questions.

479
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,126
And so here's some of our real data

480
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:52,946
filtered by undirected and directed feedback.

481
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:54,227
And as you can imagine,

482
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,647
we got lots of data from these tests.

483
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:57,468
It was pretty daunting at times.

484
00:19:57,468 --> 00:20:01,588
But Kevin and his team proposed a methodology

485
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,929
of filtering this data using adding and subtracting.

486
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,627
So we'd ask these questions through the lens of whether something added,

487
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:11,788
meaning enhanced, or subtracted, meaning reduced,

488
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:14,009
from the game experience as a whole.

489
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:18,010
And we did this for both the directed and undirected feedback.

490
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:23,592
Asking the question through this lens helped us not overcomplicate things,

491
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:26,793
and it gave us a nice sorting mechanism to be able to see the top issues.

492
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:30,195
And for us, this kept the feedback manageable,

493
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,535
and we were able to move things into action very quickly.

494
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,040
And so here's a list of the things you just saw

495
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,141
on the top undirected subtracts of one of our tests.

496
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:42,881
And this top example is that four people told us

497
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:45,702
that the Valkyries were too difficult.

498
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,722
Yeah, I know, what a surprise.

499
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:52,163
And this list, this whole list,

500
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:54,343
came from the red button comments

501
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:56,264
in the interviews that we were conducting,

502
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:59,304
and this was all unprompted.

503
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:00,965
And now looking at our directed feedback.

504
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:03,942
you can see that people were struggling the most

505
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:06,124
in this test with the enemy difficulty.

506
00:21:06,124 --> 00:21:07,004
45% of people were saying that.

507
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:11,728
And so overall, looking at it this way

508
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,550
and seeing enemy difficulty on top

509
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,451
was prompting us to look deeper into the feedback.

510
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,773
We would see this, and then so then we'd sometimes

511
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:20,914
pull the playtesters out and ask them further questions.

512
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:24,296
Or we'd target more and more tests in the future

513
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:26,118
to hone in on figuring out what that problem was.

514
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:31,980
And so overall, organizing the sheets like this

515
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,281
between directed and undirected,

516
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:35,643
adding and subtracting, helped us build this consensus.

517
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:38,585
Because they showed us the state of the entire game.

518
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:41,467
Because if you're on the team and your feature

519
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,349
was just one of those things on the list,

520
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:45,250
seeing everything kind of together in this way

521
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,771
showed you the full perspective.

522
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:49,913
And this made it very clear

523
00:21:49,913 --> 00:21:51,595
where we needed to direct our focus.

524
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:55,532
And this was a huge win when we saw something

525
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:58,212
go from heavily subtracting all the way up

526
00:21:58,212 --> 00:21:59,473
and then adding to the experience,

527
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:00,253
and that was awesome to see.

528
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:06,595
And so as the needs of the game changed and evolved,

529
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:08,616
the data that we were wanting to know and learn

530
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:10,636
also was changing with it.

531
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:12,057
And so we were constantly iterating

532
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:13,277
and changing these data sheets

533
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:14,877
as the game became more polished.

534
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:17,118
Because it's an important point to make

535
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:18,819
that each department's gonna be kind of looking

536
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:19,739
for slightly different data.

537
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,803
Level design might care more about seeing the breakdown

538
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:24,384
by the level, or the combat might

539
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,926
want to see the breakdown by the player.

540
00:22:25,926 --> 00:22:28,929
And so make sure that you spend a lot of time

541
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:30,530
with your departments in order to understand

542
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,374
what their needs are and what data that they need,

543
00:22:34,374 --> 00:22:40,620
because it's hard to generalize some of this stuff.

544
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,841
I love this boxed water.

545
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:42,122
It's great.

546
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:51,406
And that's a broad overview of what our process

547
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:52,386
ended up looking like.

548
00:22:52,386 --> 00:22:54,947
And to recap some of our takeaways,

549
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:58,668
make sure you have clear and measurable goals.

550
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,388
Develop a good playtesting cadence and stick to it.

551
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:03,429
Use the strengths of the different types of tests

552
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:05,229
to your advantage, and then make sure

553
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:07,090
when you're getting the feedback

554
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:12,811
that you're considering the whole team.

555
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:14,312
But a process is really only as good

556
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:15,272
as the people who use it.

557
00:23:15,272 --> 00:23:18,573
And part of our learning process was just doing it.

558
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:21,367
And so I'll give you some real examples that we went through,

559
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,388
which taught us some pretty valuable lessons.

560
00:23:23,388 --> 00:23:28,031
And so starting this off with a little context,

561
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,692
when we're designing features, our team

562
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:33,714
likes looking at it in terms of fantasy and function.

563
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:37,316
The fantasy kind of refers to the intended player experience.

564
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:40,438
The function refers to the more mechanical things,

565
00:23:40,438 --> 00:23:43,600
like the controls and the camera.

566
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,322
And so when we apply this usage that we have on our team

567
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:47,343
of fantasy and function.

568
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:49,965
We can see that it maps pretty well to the tests

569
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:52,287
that we were also conducting.

570
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:53,728
The unguided playthroughs were helping us

571
00:23:53,728 --> 00:23:55,410
validate this fantasy.

572
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,432
The usability tests were helping us validate the functional.

573
00:23:58,432 --> 00:24:03,396
And so I'll use a boat as an example.

574
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:07,539
I was able to dig up a pretty early brainstorming

575
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:09,521
document of the boat, describing the early vision.

576
00:24:09,521 --> 00:24:13,524
And the boat was designed to allow the player to explore,

577
00:24:13,524 --> 00:24:16,486
to collect, to hear story, and to experience combat

578
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:17,867
in that order of priority.

579
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:20,886
And if you played this God of War,

580
00:24:20,886 --> 00:24:23,848
which I hope all of you have, it stayed pretty close.

581
00:24:23,848 --> 00:24:27,150
Except for the last one, combat,

582
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,472
which didn't make it into the game.

583
00:24:29,472 --> 00:24:30,112
So what happened?

584
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:33,414
The past God of Wars had combat in everything,

585
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:34,214
literally everything.

586
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:37,376
Even Pegasus in God of War II,

587
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:43,160
which was a heavily scripted moment, had combat.

588
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm just gonna let that finish,

589
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,861
because that's awesome.

590
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:50,704
Well, to put it frankly, we cut combat from the boat

591
00:24:50,704 --> 00:24:51,585
because it was overscoped.

592
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:55,448
The boat's core purpose was a way to explore

593
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:56,488
and to hear more about the world.

594
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:59,391
And so when it came down to making this production decision,

595
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:04,014
the boat combat being the last thing in order of priority,

596
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:05,755
that was gonna be the first on the chopping block.

597
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:09,258
But that was a hard decision for the team to make.

598
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,198
God of War was combat.

599
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:13,200
And so after this decision was made,

600
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,202
there was absolutely doubt on the team.

601
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:18,264
Because this kind of broke the classic formula.

602
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:22,527
But we continued on without boat combat.

603
00:25:22,527 --> 00:25:23,748
And we got to alpha,

604
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:26,711
and the boat wasn't in a very good state.

605
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:28,212
The controls and the steering hadn't really

606
00:25:28,212 --> 00:25:29,554
had a proper tuning pass yet,

607
00:25:29,554 --> 00:25:31,716
and the story and the narrative components

608
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:32,997
just weren't even really in at all.

609
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:35,940
And the story and the narrative components

610
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,741
referring to the back and forth banter

611
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:39,503
that Kratos has with his son while on the boat.

612
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:43,447
And so we had ran some playtests recently,

613
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:44,728
and the general consensus was

614
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:46,590
that people didn't want boat of war.

615
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:50,062
It was too slow, it was too boring, they didn't like it.

616
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:52,044
It was terrible.

617
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:54,405
And so the feedback that we were getting around Alpha

618
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:58,447
was constantly calling out the boat as a bad experience.

619
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:01,929
And so all of this negative feedback brought back up combat.

620
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:03,310
See, they hate it.

621
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,211
Put back in the combat.

622
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:07,112
And this was brought up many times in meetings,

623
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,534
even in the form of an ultimatum.

624
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,314
Sometimes it would be like,

625
00:26:10,314 --> 00:26:12,055
either you put the combat back on the boat,

626
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:13,436
or we'll just cut the boat all together.

627
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:16,658
Well, let's look at the feedback.

628
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:19,810
And summarizing it, you can kind of end up

629
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,991
with these two statements.

630
00:26:21,991 --> 00:26:24,232
Players were either saying there was too much boat,

631
00:26:24,232 --> 00:26:25,312
referring to the fantasy,

632
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:28,634
or they said that it was too slow and difficult,

633
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:29,814
referring to the functional.

634
00:26:29,814 --> 00:26:32,075
Well, like I said earlier,

635
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:33,776
the fantasy of the boat wasn't even in,

636
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:36,517
and so it makes sense that the playtesters were saying

637
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:37,498
that the boat was boring.

638
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:41,360
And in this moment, we kind of had to remind ourselves

639
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,620
not to address this feedback

640
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,061
that was talking about the boat's fantasy.

641
00:26:46,028 --> 00:26:47,590
But we could address the feedback talking

642
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,910
about the functional.

643
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,392
And so we asked ourselves, what can we do right now

644
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,474
to start improving this experience?

645
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:56,996
While we wait for this fantasy elements to come in?

646
00:26:56,996 --> 00:26:58,637
Well, we have these usability tests

647
00:26:58,637 --> 00:27:00,418
where we can dive into this exact type of thing.

648
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,460
And so we did.

649
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,382
And we made many great quality of life updates to the boat,

650
00:27:06,382 --> 00:27:07,703
like you see here, as a result

651
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:08,904
of some of these usability tests.

652
00:27:08,904 --> 00:27:11,246
And doing this helped us confirm

653
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:13,527
and drive some of these things into the game,

654
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:15,028
and that was really cool to see.

655
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,221
And then finally, once these narrative elements

656
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:19,182
of the boat did come in,

657
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:22,263
we were able to get feedback on the big picture.

658
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:24,004
And then you were able to hear about

659
00:27:24,004 --> 00:27:25,985
Kratos' amazing storytelling.

660
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:29,047
So, no any good stories to pass the time?

661
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:32,548
There was one that concerned a hare and a tortoise.

662
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:34,349
So what happens?

663
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:36,450
They wager on a race between them.

664
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,332
The hare is too confident to victory and foolish,

665
00:27:39,332 --> 00:27:42,273
while the tortoise is steady and disciplined.

666
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:44,535
The tortoise wins.

667
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:50,554
You haven't told a lot of stories, have you?

668
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:55,297
That's one of my favorite stories.

669
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:57,138
And also, like Kratos, I have a pretty good story

670
00:27:57,138 --> 00:27:58,159
about the boat.

671
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,461
So let me paint you a picture real quick.

672
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,122
We'd just come off a playtest where

673
00:28:04,122 --> 00:28:05,342
we had an issue with the docks.

674
00:28:05,342 --> 00:28:07,864
You just couldn't use the docks or the beaches.

675
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:09,645
So once you got on the boat, we had

676
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:12,026
to help the playtesters off the boat every single time

677
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:14,828
they wanted to get off, because we had to do this debug flying.

678
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:15,248
It was terrible.

679
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:17,482
And so this whole test was a wash.

680
00:28:17,482 --> 00:28:19,464
We couldn't get any feedback on the boat.

681
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,286
And so we started preparing for this next test,

682
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:24,808
because we were putting in these boat stories

683
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:26,589
for the first time, just like the one you saw.

684
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:30,252
And this was a big moment for the team,

685
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:32,514
because it'd be the first time that we'd

686
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:35,176
be seeing people react to this intended experience

687
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:36,917
that we had for the boat.

688
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:38,678
And so we're about two hours into this play test,

689
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:41,941
and the first player that got on the boat

690
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:43,322
was rowing up next to a dock.

691
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:45,958
And then they just sat there.

692
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:46,998
They just sat next to the dock.

693
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:51,439
And there were people watching this back at the studio.

694
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:54,900
And they were like, it was kind of heartbreaking.

695
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,120
It was like, oh, I guess it's broken again.

696
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,981
Like, you know, what are we gonna do?

697
00:28:57,981 --> 00:28:59,341
I guess we have to wait for the next play test.

698
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:02,622
But then we realized when the next person came in,

699
00:29:02,622 --> 00:29:03,642
the docks weren't broken.

700
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,822
They got off the boat just fine.

701
00:29:04,822 --> 00:29:06,603
So what was this person doing?

702
00:29:06,603 --> 00:29:09,803
And so we interviewed this person,

703
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:12,024
and they stopped the boat right next to the dock.

704
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:18,655
because they were waiting for Kratos to finish his story.

705
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:20,276
And so for us, that was kind of the moment

706
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:23,498
that we realized that this boat was fulfilling

707
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:25,479
that intended experience.

708
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:27,140
And that people could enjoy this boat

709
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,440
without having the combat.

710
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,123
And so what did we learn from this?

711
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:35,124
Is that, well, we could have just added back combat

712
00:29:35,124 --> 00:29:35,825
at any time.

713
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:38,166
This feedback was sometimes even telling us

714
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,246
to directly add in combat.

715
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:41,628
People would write in the surveys, add boat combat.

716
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:46,244
But in these moments, the play testers didn't really know

717
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:49,646
what our final intended boat was supposed to look like,

718
00:29:49,646 --> 00:29:51,667
because it wasn't fully implemented.

719
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:56,630
And so we learned not to prematurely react to feedback,

720
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,832
especially since the design intent that we had

721
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:00,373
for the boat wasn't fully realized.

722
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:05,256
All right, so for the next story,

723
00:30:05,256 --> 00:30:08,278
I'll be talking about the final boss.

724
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,871
So we're about to go into a play test

725
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:13,931
where the first time,

726
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:17,313
players would see the full ending of the game.

727
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:18,514
And we felt pretty good about it.

728
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:21,735
And to give this a little context,

729
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:24,477
Kratos and Atreus met Freya pretty early in the game.

730
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:27,618
And Atreus immediately became attached to her

731
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,459
because Atreus had recently just lost his mother.

732
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:32,821
So we began to see Freya as a maternal figure

733
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:34,742
throughout this game.

734
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:36,803
Well, in this scene, Freya's son Baldur

735
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:37,943
is about to take her life.

736
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:41,330
Yeah, it's complicated.

737
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:51,038
But Kratos steps in to save Freya by having to kill Balder.

738
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:52,979
So let's see what Freya had to say about that.

739
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:54,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, my boy.

740
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:00,925
My dear sweet boy.

741
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,168
Freya, he chose this.

742
00:31:07,922 --> 00:31:19,225
I will rain down every agony, every violation imaginable upon you.

743
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:25,928
I will parade your cold body from every corner of every realm,

744
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:30,629
and feed your soul to the vilest filth in hell!

745
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:33,630
That is my promise!

746
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,551
He saved your life!

747
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:37,331
He robbed me of everything!

748
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:48,191
It's everything.

749
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:49,833
Yep.

750
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,914
After watching the scene,

751
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:54,436
playtesters were telling us directly in the feedback,

752
00:31:54,436 --> 00:31:58,240
they didn't like how Freya suddenly turned into a villain in the end.

753
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,060
They actually said that.

754
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,003
And we're like, what? Freya's not supposed to be a villain.

755
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:06,766
She had this impossible situation. What was she supposed to do?

756
00:32:08,102 --> 00:32:09,643
Well, we looked at the feedback and we noticed

757
00:32:09,643 --> 00:32:11,324
that there was this divide.

758
00:32:11,324 --> 00:32:13,246
Some playtesters were empathizing with Freya.

759
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:15,388
And some didn't at all.

760
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:16,749
And they were even calling her a villain.

761
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:20,732
And so we kind of asked ourselves,

762
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:24,515
why would the playtesters think that Freya's a villain?

763
00:32:24,515 --> 00:32:28,558
Maybe the problem was in that moment,

764
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:31,721
they were identifying more with Atreus, not Freya.

765
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:34,603
And so we thought, why might that be?

766
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:40,658
And we thought that people identifying strongly with Atreus might not be parents,

767
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:46,300
or they might not understand the impossible situation that Freya was in.

768
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,022
And so we added a new part immediately after the cinematic.

769
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:49,462
I don't understand.

770
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:56,145
I know saving her was the right thing, but she seemed all evil at the end.

771
00:32:56,145 --> 00:32:56,485
Not evil.

772
00:32:56,485 --> 00:33:00,147
You killed her son, lad.

773
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:00,687
Her son.

774
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:05,533
That death of a child is not something a parent gets over easily.

775
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:06,614
But he was gonna kill her!

776
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:09,074
She would have died to see him live.

777
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:11,634
Only a parent can understand.

778
00:33:11,634 --> 00:33:14,155
So you'd let me kill you?

779
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:15,595
If it meant you would live.

780
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:16,515
Yes.

781
00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:19,716
Look, there was no easy choice.

782
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:20,856
For anybody, brother.

783
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:24,397
But I think we can all agree you did the right thing.

784
00:33:24,397 --> 00:33:27,617
The world's a better place with Freya in it.

785
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:28,237
Just...

786
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,558
Give her time, lads.

787
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:31,238
She'll come around.

788
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:36,448
And so in this new part, we had Atreus ask this question

789
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:39,170
back to Kratos, as if he was one of the playtesters

790
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,211
who was calling Freya a villain this moment.

791
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:44,053
So he'd let me kill you?

792
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:46,735
To have Kratos answer, yes, yes he would.

793
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:48,656
And that only a parent can truly understand

794
00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:50,777
what Freya was going through.

795
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,979
We noticed that after we added this bit of the game,

796
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:56,261
it worked, we stopped seeing negative feedback

797
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:56,981
talking about Freya.

798
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:59,723
It was pretty, pretty cool.

799
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:02,425
It was great.

800
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,110
So what do we learn from this?

801
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,651
Well, sometimes you might go into a playtest

802
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:11,753
and you think that you've got everything figured out.

803
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:14,475
And then suddenly you might get feedback

804
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:15,956
that you don't expect at all.

805
00:34:15,956 --> 00:34:18,058
It might even be the complete opposite

806
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:21,641
of what you were intending it to be.

807
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:23,342
And you know, everyone who plays games

808
00:34:23,342 --> 00:34:24,924
will have their own unique perspectives,

809
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:26,585
and as a result, they could misinterpret

810
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:28,967
something like this.

811
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,968
And so playtesting showed us what it really meant

812
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,550
to listen, to hear people out.

813
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:35,299
Because we could have just said, oh, well, those players

814
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:37,922
don't get it, possibly missing out on a legitimate issue

815
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:40,624
that maybe was isolating a big chunk of our players.

816
00:34:40,624 --> 00:34:45,429
And it's an important point also here that play testing

817
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,870
isn't just about testing gameplay.

818
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,753
Because we found that it also can be a pretty useful tool

819
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:53,836
for helping measure narrative comprehension.

820
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:58,901
You don't know what this means yet.

821
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:04,799
but I'll talk about our good friend, the olive pizza guy.

822
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:09,242
And so what if somebody comes in and they play your game

823
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:12,964
and they just absolutely hate it?

824
00:35:12,964 --> 00:35:14,765
So much that they write about it

825
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:16,687
in very painstakingly specific detail

826
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:19,088
in all of the feedback that he gives.

827
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:21,750
Well, lucky for us, this happened in one of our playtests.

828
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,191
And now before I read his comment,

829
00:35:23,191 --> 00:35:27,193
I'd like to say that we're very open about sharing

830
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:30,195
the data that we're getting from these playtests

831
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:30,756
with the team.

832
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:34,513
And we'd send out the data every night after every test

833
00:35:34,513 --> 00:35:36,834
with a basic daily report, kind of with the top findings.

834
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,155
And so now you saw it a second ago.

835
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:40,796
But let me read his comment to you.

836
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:41,036
And I quote,

837
00:35:41,036 --> 00:35:42,897
"'The puzzle solving is a bore.

838
00:35:42,897 --> 00:35:45,738
"'What's worse, the amount of puzzle solving

839
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:50,339
"'significantly outweighs the action.

840
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,581
"'And when the game is called God of War,

841
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:54,621
"'that's just not acceptable.

842
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:57,502
"'Imagine you called Pizza Hut

843
00:35:57,502 --> 00:35:59,003
"'and you ordered a meat lover's pizza.

844
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:03,716
And when your pizza arrived, there was more olives

845
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:04,936
on the pizza than meat.

846
00:36:04,936 --> 00:36:08,317
That's how I feel about this section,

847
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:10,257
and just about in every other section of this game.

848
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:14,578
I went in expecting lots and lots of action,

849
00:36:14,578 --> 00:36:16,719
lots of meat on my pizza.

850
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,119
But no.

851
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,680
I got lots of puzzle solving.

852
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,880
The pizza arrived stacked with olives.

853
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,621
Who the hell wants more olives than meat

854
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:27,181
on their meat lover's pizza?

855
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:28,001
Nobody.

856
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:28,622
That's who.

857
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:35,476
Now who wants Kratos to spend the majority of his time as an imitation Laura Croft doing

858
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:40,939
puzzles versus being a badass and killing everything that moves?

859
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:42,720
Also nobody.

860
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,183
More action, less stupid generic puzzles.

861
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:49,364
And oh, that's another thing.

862
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:52,466
The puzzles are so boring and generic.

863
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:56,188
Ring, ring, 1998's Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time called.

864
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:04,745
It wants its basic, outdated, 20-year-old dungeon platforming

865
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:13,167
puzzles back.

866
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:23,591
And so naturally, like I said, the dev team read this comment.

867
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:28,392
And so halfway through the test, the olive pizza guy

868
00:37:28,392 --> 00:37:29,693
was a celebrity on the team.

869
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:36,902
And it was very clear from his feedback

870
00:37:36,902 --> 00:37:38,743
that he was a fan of the past God of War games,

871
00:37:38,743 --> 00:37:40,884
because he kept referencing these games

872
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,585
in all of his comments that he was making.

873
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:46,586
And so on one hand, we kind of saw the thing that we feared.

874
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:48,166
There was a passionate God of War fan

875
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,627
that just didn't like the new game.

876
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:53,948
But on the other hand, the Olive Pizza guy's intensity

877
00:37:53,948 --> 00:37:57,069
clearly came from a place of love.

878
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:59,650
He was a self-proclaimed huge fan of Kratos in the franchise.

879
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:01,802
And when he wrote this comment,

880
00:38:01,802 --> 00:38:03,382
he boldly and directly challenged

881
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,683
our new vision for the game,

882
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,203
when he referred to the puzzles in the combat.

883
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:11,604
And so we learned a couple things from this.

884
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:13,324
The first being that not everyone

885
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,745
would resonate with this new game.

886
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:17,585
We were making a reimagining of God of War,

887
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:19,545
one which had more puzzles and combat,

888
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:20,946
and that wasn't changing,

889
00:38:20,946 --> 00:38:22,886
and not everyone would like it, and that's okay.

890
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,746
And we also had plenty of evidence

891
00:38:25,746 --> 00:38:26,747
to support from our play tests

892
00:38:26,747 --> 00:38:29,167
that we were doing a pretty good job.

893
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:32,174
People loved the characters, the setting, and the narrative.

894
00:38:32,174 --> 00:38:34,516
And we had made enough progress through iterating

895
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:35,837
on these play tests that the problems

896
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:39,320
weren't in the mechanics, they were in the balance.

897
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,002
Which leads me to the next learning,

898
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:42,924
is how to strategically look at the feedback.

899
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:45,786
Because the Olive Pizza guy even told us

900
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:47,227
that he hated puzzles in general.

901
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:49,329
So why would any of his feedback

902
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,992
about our puzzles really help?

903
00:38:52,992 --> 00:38:54,173
But he did like combat.

904
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:57,076
And so we looked at his combat feedback.

905
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:00,047
And in his own hilariously accurate,

906
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:03,429
but mildly anger-inducing way,

907
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:05,011
the olive pizza guy had a lot of great points.

908
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:08,133
Because he was trying to tell us

909
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:09,794
how slow the combat pacing was

910
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:10,835
during the beginning of the game,

911
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:13,477
and that we needed to retune the pace,

912
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:15,439
and that our decision was that we needed

913
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,900
to retune the pacing so that someone like him early

914
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,162
could get enough of a combat challenge

915
00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:21,083
that they were looking for,

916
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:24,365
while still being able to engage with the puzzles,

917
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:25,827
even if he didn't really like them.

918
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:29,051
And so this was really valuable feedback to us

919
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:33,394
because it helped call out a legitimate issue.

920
00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:35,056
But I'm not done.

921
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:38,539
I received a text the day after we got this feedback.

922
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:44,504
And it said, before he eats his normal lunch tomorrow,

923
00:39:44,504 --> 00:39:49,548
you should buy this guy a pizza.

924
00:39:49,548 --> 00:39:53,972
But put olives on it.

925
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:54,492
And so I did.

926
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:08,864
And we made sure it had a lot of olives.

927
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:18,248
And for the record, just so you don't think we're complete jerks,

928
00:40:18,248 --> 00:40:20,449
he was smiling under this picture, I promise.

929
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:24,151
And we also bought him a meat lovers pizza also

930
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:25,771
that he actually ate for lunch.

931
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:25,891
So.

932
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:33,675
And my final example is about our difficulty.

933
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:37,677
Our game has many different difficulty settings.

934
00:40:37,677 --> 00:40:39,958
You can even switch the difficulties around at any point.

935
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:41,919
So let's say you start by choosing

936
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:43,481
the balanced experience or normal,

937
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:46,282
but then you thought the game wasn't enough of a challenge.

938
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:47,523
You could then bump it up to give me a challenge.

939
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:49,945
Well, the feature for switching

940
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:51,766
this difficulties wasn't in yet.

941
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:53,367
So for a long time, we were relying on

942
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,348
the balanced experience to give us a baseline.

943
00:40:55,348 --> 00:40:57,810
And so in one of these play tests,

944
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,751
we intentionally tuned everything way harder

945
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,352
because we knew from the previous test

946
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:02,733
kind of what too easy looked like.

947
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:05,233
But we were looking for this sweet spot.

948
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:08,155
We needed to find out where the hard ceiling was.

949
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:08,895
And so we tuned it way up,

950
00:41:08,895 --> 00:41:10,917
and we found out after that play test

951
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:13,098
that that was too hard, so we tuned it back.

952
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,340
Well, the next play test,

953
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,301
we were about to go into this play test

954
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:19,943
after the hard play test,

955
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:22,784
and we'd have this switching difficulty feature in.

956
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:26,207
And this made the combat designers very excited.

957
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:28,468
Because this would be the first time

958
00:41:28,468 --> 00:41:30,749
that they'd see how people were utilizing this feature.

959
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:35,593
especially how they would react to the harder difficulties.

960
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,774
And so there was a player in this test that we were having,

961
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:40,155
and they were absolutely raving about the game.

962
00:41:40,155 --> 00:41:41,935
Everything was perfect.

963
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:43,656
The game was perfect.

964
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:45,737
The difficulty was perfect.

965
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:46,297
10 out of 10s.

966
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:50,838
Well, our combat designers were very interested

967
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:53,179
in this player, because they were making

968
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,700
all of these comments about how well and balanced

969
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,840
they felt like the difficulty was.

970
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,281
And based on his feedback,

971
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:02,933
This player sounded like they were very proficient in the game.

972
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:05,594
He had detailed analysis of fights.

973
00:42:05,594 --> 00:42:07,494
He was talking about strategies in the arenas.

974
00:42:07,494 --> 00:42:10,535
Surely this player was a combat game expert.

975
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:15,936
Well, I've personally learned working on a game like God of War

976
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:18,637
that combat designers treat the harder difficulties

977
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:21,337
like the magnum opus.

978
00:42:21,337 --> 00:42:24,358
Like this is why they wake up in the morning,

979
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:25,698
for the hard difficulties.

980
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:30,715
And I don't think I've ever seen a more disappointed look

981
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:34,136
in anybody's face when they realized

982
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:35,256
after looking at the telemetry

983
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:37,017
that this player was playing on easy.

984
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:40,078
Give me a story.

985
00:42:40,078 --> 00:42:46,100
So we learned a couple things from this.

986
00:42:47,152 --> 00:42:49,034
The first is get critical features

987
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:50,696
in front of playtesters as soon as possible,

988
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,439
because our game was designed from the beginning

989
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:54,660
to be able to switch difficulties

990
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,722
through the middle of the game.

991
00:42:56,722 --> 00:42:59,385
And this actually changed how people engaged with our game.

992
00:42:59,385 --> 00:43:02,829
And we saw a huge amount of engagement with people

993
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:04,831
and people using it once we put it in.

994
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:09,373
And for a long time we were only testing balanced experience,

995
00:43:09,373 --> 00:43:11,654
the kind of middle normal difficulty.

996
00:43:11,654 --> 00:43:14,456
And this made us, it made it very difficult

997
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:16,717
for the combat designers to action on any feedback

998
00:43:16,717 --> 00:43:19,039
we were getting that was saying it was too easy or too hard.

999
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:20,800
Because we weren't really sure

1000
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,161
what the skill level actually was.

1001
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:25,423
And the second takeaway from this is that

1002
00:43:25,423 --> 00:43:29,485
we needed to look at feedback from all sides.

1003
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:31,887
Because we assumed from this player's feedback

1004
00:43:31,887 --> 00:43:33,688
that they were playing on a harder difficulty

1005
00:43:33,688 --> 00:43:36,029
because of how descriptive and analytical they were.

1006
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,411
And so this reminded us to make sure that we cross-checked

1007
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:42,252
all of our feedback with the videos, the telemetry,

1008
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,372
the difficulty settings, and create this player profile

1009
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,933
to make sure that we painted the most accurate picture

1010
00:43:47,933 --> 00:43:50,114
of these people that were playing our game as possible.

1011
00:43:50,114 --> 00:43:54,875
And finally, difficulty does not equal enjoyment.

1012
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:57,636
And just because they were playing on easy

1013
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:00,136
doesn't mean that they still couldn't have a good time

1014
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:01,316
and enjoy the game systems

1015
00:44:01,316 --> 00:44:03,977
and still provide us valuable feedback on them.

1016
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:09,505
And so if I can sum everything up,

1017
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:11,086
and hopefully you kind of started to see

1018
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:12,066
the reoccurring pattern,

1019
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,828
is that we weren't playtesting to question

1020
00:44:15,828 --> 00:44:18,229
our vision for the game.

1021
00:44:18,229 --> 00:44:20,991
We were using it to see how well we had realized it.

1022
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:25,673
And this is an important mindset that we had to shift to.

1023
00:44:25,673 --> 00:44:28,575
Because reading through this feedback can be frustrating.

1024
00:44:28,575 --> 00:44:31,617
But know that you can get valuable feedback

1025
00:44:31,617 --> 00:44:33,117
that will help you make your game better

1026
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:33,978
through playtesting.

1027
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,006
You just have to be in the right mindset

1028
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,086
to receive this feedback.

1029
00:44:37,086 --> 00:44:40,368
And not everyone's gonna like the game, and that's okay.

1030
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:44,069
And so we told ourselves from the beginning

1031
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:46,030
that we'd go all in, but it took time,

1032
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,771
and it took practice to get into a rhythm.

1033
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:49,831
And we saw this after every test,

1034
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:51,852
that we got better and we got more efficient at it.

1035
00:44:51,852 --> 00:44:53,933
And we started seeing what data was valuable

1036
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:54,793
and what data wasn't.

1037
00:44:54,793 --> 00:44:59,755
And so now I'll close this out with some final thoughts

1038
00:44:59,755 --> 00:45:02,476
that hopefully you can take back to your teams

1039
00:45:02,476 --> 00:45:04,397
to help improving your play test process.

1040
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:06,616
Now this is with the understanding

1041
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:07,456
that all teams are different.

1042
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:10,098
And so while these work for us, you'll

1043
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:12,299
have to be the one to determine if it will work for you.

1044
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:16,322
The first thing that we think is team-wide accessibility really

1045
00:45:16,322 --> 00:45:17,583
helped.

1046
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:20,105
We streamed the playtest live to the entire dev floor,

1047
00:45:20,105 --> 00:45:21,826
which anyone could watch.

1048
00:45:21,826 --> 00:45:23,547
And this was valuable to us in a couple ways.

1049
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:26,750
It was valuable to see the content being played

1050
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,891
from a dev perspective, so you could reference back

1051
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:29,571
to the videos.

1052
00:45:30,805 --> 00:45:33,206
And it encouraged people to ask a lot of questions,

1053
00:45:33,206 --> 00:45:35,807
which then they would relay to the researchers

1054
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:37,628
or anybody who was at the test for the next day

1055
00:45:37,628 --> 00:45:38,968
to look into more.

1056
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:42,509
And the second was that it reinforced the idea

1057
00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:45,611
that these play tests were for the team

1058
00:45:45,611 --> 00:45:48,652
and that we encouraged people to make their own assessments

1059
00:45:48,652 --> 00:45:49,552
on what was going on

1060
00:45:49,552 --> 00:45:51,833
and to bring those ideas to their leads.

1061
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:57,787
Second, it was reinforced through the leadership.

1062
00:45:57,787 --> 00:46:00,049
Corey was highly involved in the playtest process,

1063
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,611
and he strongly believed in it.

1064
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:05,154
And you could almost always hear somebody on the dev floor

1065
00:46:05,154 --> 00:46:06,936
talking about the feedback from the last playtest

1066
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:07,877
or the upcoming playtest.

1067
00:46:07,877 --> 00:46:11,240
And this all starts with the leadership being on board

1068
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,401
and all in on this process.

1069
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:17,806
And third, the relationship with QA is really critical.

1070
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:19,923
because you will hit problems with builds

1071
00:46:19,923 --> 00:46:20,643
right before a test.

1072
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:22,504
And you might integrate something

1073
00:46:22,504 --> 00:46:24,966
that breaks something down the line somewhere else.

1074
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:27,107
And that's just a part of making games.

1075
00:46:27,107 --> 00:46:29,228
But what helped us a lot was that QA

1076
00:46:29,228 --> 00:46:31,569
was in these triage meetings with us.

1077
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:32,770
They were at the play tests,

1078
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,851
and they were part of the process for preparing the builds.

1079
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:38,193
Because their perspective is very valuable,

1080
00:46:38,193 --> 00:46:40,194
and I can't stress enough the importance of that.

1081
00:46:40,194 --> 00:46:44,957
And fourth and last but not least,

1082
00:46:44,957 --> 00:46:46,558
reduce barriers for user research.

1083
00:46:47,478 --> 00:46:49,539
And for us, just getting a user research team

1084
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:52,140
was a critical component to helping make the game better.

1085
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,141
But it doesn't stop there.

1086
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:55,782
The key was to ensure that we kept the researchers

1087
00:46:55,782 --> 00:46:57,243
as up to date as possible,

1088
00:46:57,243 --> 00:46:59,464
whether that meant sending them updated build notes,

1089
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:01,646
or there even several times where during a play test

1090
00:47:01,646 --> 00:47:02,966
we would call them up on the phone.

1091
00:47:02,966 --> 00:47:05,848
Because the more context that they have

1092
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:08,669
about the game and the systems,

1093
00:47:08,669 --> 00:47:10,010
the better that they can help you.

1094
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:15,033
And so if there's one thing that you take

1095
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:15,913
from this talk, it's this.

1096
00:47:16,747 --> 00:47:18,847
Just keep doing it.

1097
00:47:18,847 --> 00:47:20,788
Because we had a very similar experience

1098
00:47:20,788 --> 00:47:22,508
to what Lambert and Mattias described

1099
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:23,968
when we first jumped on a call with Guerrilla.

1100
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:28,129
Because there were times that it was very painful.

1101
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:30,190
And we did have to move things around in the schedule

1102
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,071
a little bit to help accommodate.

1103
00:47:32,071 --> 00:47:34,231
But it also significantly impacted the game

1104
00:47:34,231 --> 00:47:37,492
in a very tangible and positive way.

1105
00:47:37,492 --> 00:47:39,232
So that concludes the presentation part

1106
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,893
and we'll be sticking around for any questions.

1107
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:57,135
We're also doing a lot of talks here at GDC, in case you're wondering.

1108
00:47:57,135 --> 00:47:59,677
And we're hiring.

1109
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:03,759
All right.

1110
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:06,421
Question time.

1111
00:48:06,421 --> 00:48:07,241
Hello.

1112
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:08,122
Oh, sweet.

1113
00:48:08,122 --> 00:48:13,625
In addition to the external playtests with testers that you brought in, did you have

1114
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,246
any internal playtests as well?

1115
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:25,760
Yeah, so prior to the external playtest, we did do a lot of internal playtests within the team on a sort of

1116
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,923
grouped levels like combat for example would do their own internal playtests, level design did some

1117
00:48:30,923 --> 00:48:36,648
specific feature teams like the boat or like the axe. We were doing some small internal playtests around that as well.

1118
00:48:37,978 --> 00:48:45,944
And then it's not that we completely stopped that, but we made the sort of bigger leap and bigger transition into doing more, you know,

1119
00:48:45,944 --> 00:48:53,610
longer-term external playtests given that the game got so big and it took literally sort of five days just to get through the whole game.

1120
00:48:53,610 --> 00:49:00,515
So you sort of used the internal playtests for rapid iteration and then the external was more for the fine-tuning of the features near the end?

1121
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,468
No, I'd say probably that at a specific point, like kind of how Ed describes that alpha,

1122
00:49:05,468 --> 00:49:09,655
we sort of made the full transition to just doing external play tests.

1123
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,016
Thank you.

1124
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,328
Hi, very good talk, by the way.

1125
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:17,791
I'm a bit curious about the playtest strike team

1126
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:21,333
that you talked about that's led by Corey Barlog and Yumi Yang.

1127
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:24,996
I was curious if you could go into why that was necessary,

1128
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:25,897
what their roles were.

1129
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:28,999
Was it enforcing the consistency that you talked about?

1130
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:31,501
Was it kind of choosing what topics were tested over?

1131
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,643
Like, why did you think it was necessary to create them?

1132
00:49:37,294 --> 00:49:39,975
Well, I mean, it kind of went into it a second.

1133
00:49:39,975 --> 00:49:42,296
It was important to have, like, you know,

1134
00:49:42,296 --> 00:49:44,497
production and the people kind of on top of everything,

1135
00:49:44,497 --> 00:49:47,059
like being that driving force,

1136
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:49,740
because, you know, kind of our problem was that

1137
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,181
it was just kind of happening all over the place.

1138
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:54,342
So it was kind of important to make sure that,

1139
00:49:54,342 --> 00:49:56,303
and even G, you know, being our gameplay director,

1140
00:49:56,303 --> 00:49:58,264
it was important for him to be there as well,

1141
00:49:58,264 --> 00:49:59,564
because it was one of those, like,

1142
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:01,385
you gotta have the big players in there

1143
00:50:01,385 --> 00:50:04,107
in order to help make sure that these things happen, right?

1144
00:50:04,632 --> 00:50:04,932
Gotcha.

1145
00:50:04,932 --> 00:50:06,052
So there's, oh.

1146
00:50:06,052 --> 00:50:06,753
I don't know.

1147
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,073
Can I hop in on that for a sec?

1148
00:50:08,073 --> 00:50:10,674
The other thing is, it was a new process,

1149
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,315
or they were undergoing a new process.

1150
00:50:13,315 --> 00:50:16,677
So having a strike team that could essentially fan out

1151
00:50:16,677 --> 00:50:19,078
throughout the entire studio and connect the studio

1152
00:50:19,078 --> 00:50:21,919
with the research group and to make sure

1153
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:24,540
that everyone was heard was super important.

1154
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,481
So having an organized and broad approach

1155
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,422
to that is really key.

1156
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:32,188
And I think for us, I guess, like to Ed's point, I mean, like, I was one of the engineering

1157
00:50:32,188 --> 00:50:33,149
leads on God of War.

1158
00:50:33,149 --> 00:50:37,194
And so for us on the strike team, it was really important to have the other leadership as

1159
00:50:37,194 --> 00:50:42,862
part of that process to decide, because again, like, because it's such a big game, everyone

1160
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:43,703
is running.

1161
00:50:43,703 --> 00:50:46,586
And in a lot of ways, everyone is kind of running with their piece.

1162
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:51,472
And so you can have everyone kind of going in a different direction to some degree.

1163
00:50:51,472 --> 00:50:55,436
And then playtesting was kind of a way for us to unify and centralize.

1164
00:50:55,436 --> 00:50:58,539
Like, hey, we all need to run in that direction right now.

1165
00:50:58,539 --> 00:51:03,744
And a big part of this, I think, is also just making sure that relationships

1166
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:05,185
are key in this process.

1167
00:51:05,185 --> 00:51:08,869
Like, even with user research, but even internally in your own studio.

1168
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:14,614
the leadership team has to have a very unified and strong sort of relationship

1169
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:18,817
with production, with all the other devs, and with user research, because you really want to

1170
00:51:18,817 --> 00:51:23,762
make sure again that like everyone has each other's back, given that things are going to be really

1171
00:51:23,762 --> 00:51:28,405
bumpy, and everyone's going to want to look at like why that didn't work, or you know what was

1172
00:51:28,405 --> 00:51:32,589
the problem there. So I think the Strike team helped us kind of get everybody on the same

1173
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,592
page, making sure everyone knew these were the goals, these were the areas, and then we could.

1174
00:51:36,852 --> 00:51:43,274
to help us prioritize how we were going to get to the best possible build for the next playtest.

1175
00:51:43,274 --> 00:51:44,374
Thank you very, very much.

1176
00:51:44,374 --> 00:51:45,515
Hi. Thank you for being here. It was a good talk.

1177
00:51:45,515 --> 00:51:50,296
So just when I'm playtesting stuff, if one person points out a problem, I'm like, okay.

1178
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:53,997
But if a second person points out a problem, that's when I'll consider it.

1179
00:51:53,997 --> 00:52:00,178
But with you guys, I'm assuming you guys probably get a lot more playtesters.

1180
00:52:00,178 --> 00:52:04,740
So I was just wondering how many people have to point out a problem before you consider it like an issue.

1181
00:52:05,855 --> 00:52:09,617
Yeah, it's not so much a matter of how many people, to be honest, it's a matter of kind

1182
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:14,839
of understanding where that problem is coming from and how relevant it is and how important

1183
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:17,980
it is to the overall experience of the game.

1184
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,682
So in our cases, the larger group playtests were 20 people at a time.

1185
00:52:23,183 --> 00:52:35,598
And as you can see from some of the data up there, the fact that four people out of that 20 had an issue with the Valkyries was enough to be taking a look at that particular balance item.

1186
00:52:35,598 --> 00:52:36,299
But...

1187
00:52:36,443 --> 00:52:41,028
At the same time, the olive pizza guy, in a certain sense,

1188
00:52:41,028 --> 00:52:43,952
sort of single-handedly brought that issue to the fore.

1189
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,955
It wasn't that we hadn't seen that before from other people,

1190
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:51,460
but oftentimes you'll see a similar issue

1191
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,482
just spoken about in very different ways

1192
00:52:53,482 --> 00:52:54,844
across a wide variety of people.

1193
00:52:54,844 --> 00:52:55,865
So it's the job of all of us

1194
00:52:55,865 --> 00:52:57,386
to try to put those things together.

1195
00:52:58,185 --> 00:52:59,585
Okay, and one last thing.

1196
00:52:59,585 --> 00:53:01,866
In that data, there was one point

1197
00:53:01,866 --> 00:53:03,566
about Kratos kicking the chain down,

1198
00:53:03,566 --> 00:53:06,947
and he goes down automatically, and that was a problem.

1199
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:08,967
And I've seen online that that bothered a lot

1200
00:53:08,967 --> 00:53:12,128
of other people, so did you guys not consider that

1201
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:15,969
because it was one person, or just not change it?

1202
00:53:15,969 --> 00:53:17,010
I'll take that one.

1203
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:22,655
It was brought up and again, like to Kevin's point,

1204
00:53:22,655 --> 00:53:25,418
it's about looking at that sort of pain

1205
00:53:25,418 --> 00:53:27,560
and then kind of prioritizing it across

1206
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,742
all of the other pain that we're also receiving

1207
00:53:29,742 --> 00:53:32,585
and then seeing like, okay, is this going to...

1208
00:53:33,506 --> 00:53:38,411
significantly subtract the experience compared to everything else that we have to prioritize and get to,

1209
00:53:38,411 --> 00:53:44,517
and what does that impact have? So I guess it is great to kind of assess that feedback,

1210
00:53:44,517 --> 00:53:48,962
make it very clear that we understand it, and then, you know, do the estimation of like,

1211
00:53:48,962 --> 00:53:52,425
what will it take to actually address it? Okay, thank you. Great talk, thank you. About the Freya scene.

1212
00:53:57,557 --> 00:54:03,382
I might come across as a super villain, but I would not have gone into explanation myself

1213
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:07,385
like, oh, you know, let's understand she lost someone.

1214
00:54:07,385 --> 00:54:12,789
I would just leave it to the audience and I want to know how much of your...

1215
00:54:14,331 --> 00:54:20,260
design and work rotates around the sensibilities and sensitivities of your audience.

1216
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,987
And would you be comfortable looking back at trusting your audience to actually just go at it

1217
00:54:24,987 --> 00:54:30,175
and just have it a talk at Discord or just, you know, I don't know, Steam chat or something like that?

1218
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:31,710
Can I start that one?

1219
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:31,790
Yeah.

1220
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:35,554
So that's one of the biggest reasons.

1221
00:54:35,554 --> 00:54:37,355
You're touching on one of the biggest reasons

1222
00:54:37,355 --> 00:54:40,759
why we do have 20 people come in for a play test at a time.

1223
00:54:40,759 --> 00:54:43,441
It's the practical limit for us in the first place,

1224
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:45,723
but why do we want a wide number of people?

1225
00:54:45,723 --> 00:54:48,706
It's not so much that we have then lots of numbers

1226
00:54:48,706 --> 00:54:50,387
of people saying they have an issue,

1227
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,348
but that we get a broad.

1228
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:55,492
spectrum of the kinds of people who are going to play the game, honestly.

1229
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,534
And one thing we noticed, just as a sort of a...

1230
00:54:57,534 --> 00:55:01,257
This doesn't actually answer your question, but it's an observation that might kind of get at it.

1231
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:02,258
I'll have a follow-up if...

1232
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:08,543
So, one of the things we did was we decided to ask people a little questionnaire at the start

1233
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,525
about how much they knew about Norse mythology.

1234
00:55:11,459 --> 00:55:16,002
so that we could find out, you know, are these people who are experts in knowing who Freya is,

1235
00:55:16,002 --> 00:55:21,806
for example, or who Baldr is, for example. And we right away found out that people don't know

1236
00:55:21,806 --> 00:55:22,967
a lot about Norse mythology.

1237
00:55:24,295 --> 00:55:26,416
And it has a big impact on potentially

1238
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:27,978
how you're trying to communicate things

1239
00:55:27,978 --> 00:55:29,459
and how people will perceive things.

1240
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:32,962
So it's those elements of perception

1241
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,203
are really important, I think,

1242
00:55:34,203 --> 00:55:37,665
and trying to gauge and meet people halfway

1243
00:55:37,665 --> 00:55:39,387
in cases where they don't necessarily

1244
00:55:39,387 --> 00:55:41,829
have the right perspective or a full perspective

1245
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:44,371
to get the impact you wanna try and drive.

1246
00:55:44,371 --> 00:55:46,573
So you added that as a stretch

1247
00:55:46,573 --> 00:55:49,675
to basically help people have empathy

1248
00:55:49,675 --> 00:55:51,556
to situations like these?

1249
00:55:52,832 --> 00:55:57,554
Yeah, I mean, yeah, to kind of follow up on what Cameron was saying, I think for us ultimately

1250
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:01,436
kind of, you know, you were touching on sort of the design process in relation to kind

1251
00:56:01,436 --> 00:56:07,219
of having to either explain or not explain, but I think we're a very vision-driven studio,

1252
00:56:07,219 --> 00:56:11,161
and so we fall back to sort of the creative director's vision on kind of...

1253
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:17,548
what does he or she determine that we want to communicate or not communicate?

1254
00:56:17,548 --> 00:56:21,954
And when we posed this question to Corey, when he kind of looked at that feedback on like,

1255
00:56:21,954 --> 00:56:24,597
hey, you know, people are starting to perceive Freya as a villain now,

1256
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:28,281
you know, it was really up to him and the narrative team to go like...

1257
00:56:29,325 --> 00:56:30,326
do we want to take this on?

1258
00:56:30,326 --> 00:56:32,908
Do we feel like it's necessary to explain this point?

1259
00:56:32,908 --> 00:56:36,771
And from his vision's mindset,

1260
00:56:36,771 --> 00:56:38,352
he was like, no, I want to explain this.

1261
00:56:38,352 --> 00:56:39,693
And so we're going to double down on that.

1262
00:56:39,693 --> 00:56:42,275
So I think for us, it becomes about sort of

1263
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:44,997
what is the vision we want to communicate?

1264
00:56:44,997 --> 00:56:48,199
And in that instance, I think the way Ed describes it,

1265
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:49,821
it's we hadn't executed that yet.

1266
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:56,968
We hadn't fully realized that part because for him, it was super important that people empathize with Freya in that moment.

1267
00:56:56,968 --> 00:57:00,531
So that's kind of how we find our way, I guess.

1268
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:05,872
Hey, hi, thank you very much for the game, it's amazing.

1269
00:57:05,872 --> 00:57:09,894
First of all, yeah, and my question would be about

1270
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:12,396
how did you get, how did you make decisions

1271
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:14,977
based on all this feedback, maybe sometimes arguable

1272
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:17,179
or contradicting that you got?

1273
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:20,281
So whose role was that, who kept, for instance,

1274
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:22,282
team focused on not making the combat

1275
00:57:22,282 --> 00:57:27,185
when it was like so many ideas and opinions that we should?

1276
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:28,706
So how did you make decisions like that?

1277
00:57:29,997 --> 00:57:34,138
I think that really was everyone's job and that's part of why it's so important to have

1278
00:57:34,138 --> 00:57:38,859
that strike force, why it's important to get everyone involved.

1279
00:57:38,859 --> 00:57:43,041
From my standpoint, I mean, a big part of my job is, at least especially at the start

1280
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:49,223
of the process, to try to help the team understand that we're working for them, we're working

1281
00:57:49,223 --> 00:57:51,203
with them in terms of research and we're not trying to...

1282
00:57:51,732 --> 00:57:54,134
change the game, we're trying to make them realize their,

1283
00:57:54,134 --> 00:57:55,815
help them realize their vision.

1284
00:57:55,815 --> 00:58:00,860
So basically, that's what's driving a lot of the

1285
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:05,143
prioritization of different issues that you see.

1286
00:58:05,143 --> 00:58:06,304
Trying to weigh it against, kind of,

1287
00:58:06,304 --> 00:58:07,866
where's the game right now?

1288
00:58:07,866 --> 00:58:10,028
What is it that the team cares about right now?

1289
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,931
What kind of impact are we seeing it have on players?

1290
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:17,214
All of those things are gonna go into the decision making

1291
00:58:17,214 --> 00:58:18,855
on which things you tackle and which things you don't.

1292
00:58:19,734 --> 00:58:23,739
So it was like a group decision making, it wasn't one person.

1293
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:24,940
Well, exactly.

1294
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,582
Yeah, well, I mean, I'll give you a kind of quick example.

1295
00:58:27,582 --> 00:58:33,288
We get a lot of data, like Kevin mentioned, they'd help prioritize it, give us a big debrief.

1296
00:58:33,288 --> 00:58:36,912
We take that information, have a playtest strike team meeting where we look at all the

1297
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:37,092
data.

1298
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:42,354
Corey would ask each one of the leads to look at the data that directly impacted their team

1299
00:58:42,354 --> 00:58:45,534
and come and talk about it in a very direct way of like,

1300
00:58:45,534 --> 00:58:48,095
why is this happening, what do you think the next step should be,

1301
00:58:48,095 --> 00:58:51,596
confer with your teammates and then represent your team as a lead.

1302
00:58:51,596 --> 00:58:55,036
From that we would look at all of that and then assess what would the impact of this change

1303
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:59,497
actually have in the entire game and then ultimately it would be up to Corey to decide

1304
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:02,938
if we're going to act on it or not. I see, okay, thank you, got it.

1305
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,532
Great talk, awesome game, really appreciate it.

1306
00:59:07,532 --> 00:59:10,853
So we have access to a usability lab and a research lab.

1307
00:59:10,853 --> 00:59:15,496
And so for Kevin, when do you think people should come to your lab?

1308
00:59:15,496 --> 00:59:16,937
Is it pre-alpha?

1309
00:59:16,937 --> 00:59:21,579
And I guess for Kevin, do you wish you guys started sooner versus where you're in alpha,

1310
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:23,220
and you're like, where's the fun?

1311
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,283
So that's my first question.

1312
00:59:25,283 --> 00:59:27,326
And then the second question was a small thing.

1313
00:59:27,326 --> 00:59:30,390
It was that on the chart for the unguided for the combat, it was a negative four.

1314
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:33,875
You pointed that out, but it was also a positive four on the plus side.

1315
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:36,298
So it was an even split on the eight testers.

1316
00:59:36,298 --> 00:59:39,182
So how do you kind of divide in the middle on that?

1317
00:59:39,182 --> 00:59:39,403
So.

1318
00:59:40,572 --> 00:59:43,535
Okay, first question about when to start.

1319
00:59:43,535 --> 00:59:46,857
And yeah, as early as possible,

1320
00:59:46,857 --> 00:59:49,600
but don't do it for no reason, of course.

1321
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,902
It's expensive, so spend your dollars at the right places.

1322
00:59:52,902 --> 00:59:57,986
But that said, we have worked with people

1323
00:59:57,986 --> 01:00:01,129
in the concept phase, and especially if you're coming up

1324
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:02,931
with a brand new set of mechanics,

1325
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:04,632
or you have things that you think are particularly risky.

1326
01:00:04,632 --> 01:00:07,935
So like a vertical slice would be sometimes even doable?

1327
01:00:07,935 --> 01:00:09,616
Before vertical slice even.

1328
01:00:10,437 --> 01:00:13,319
For example, I worked on Gears of War with that team.

1329
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:14,520
I shouldn't say anything about them.

1330
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:19,004
Particularly, we did work on elements of taking cover,

1331
01:00:19,004 --> 01:00:21,166
for example, and other things that were really crucial

1332
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:22,807
and new to that game.

1333
01:00:22,807 --> 01:00:25,449
And a similar thing happened here.

1334
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:27,491
I'm guessing that in your case,

1335
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:31,294
that it happened more as a matter of internal testing

1336
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,496
and internal processes, but there's no reason

1337
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:34,837
why we couldn't have probably benefited

1338
01:00:34,837 --> 01:00:38,300
from having consumers take a look at some of those things

1339
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:38,800
at the right time.

1340
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:38,880
Cool.

1341
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:42,002
Second question I forgot.

1342
01:00:42,002 --> 01:00:46,690
It was the positive four and the minus four on combat for the unguided.

1343
01:00:47,923 --> 01:00:49,685
Oh, plus what happens if you get something

1344
01:00:49,685 --> 01:00:51,386
that people like and hate?

1345
01:00:51,386 --> 01:00:54,808
Yeah, part of the strategy for asking those questions

1346
01:00:54,808 --> 01:00:57,330
is that we expect that these things that we're asking about

1347
01:00:57,330 --> 01:01:00,092
are so big and so important to the game

1348
01:01:00,092 --> 01:01:02,894
that people can love them and hate them at the same time.

1349
01:01:02,894 --> 01:01:05,316
So people aren't actually saying,

1350
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:08,098
I don't like this or I do like this.

1351
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:10,940
They're saying, they're potentially saying things

1352
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,702
that there are things about it that they do like

1353
01:01:13,702 --> 01:01:16,323
and things about it that they don't like.

1354
01:01:16,463 --> 01:01:20,085
The key is just to figure out what those things are within that.

1355
01:01:20,085 --> 01:01:26,187
For example, in the enemies, let's say that they love the trolls and they hate the Valkyries.

1356
01:01:26,187 --> 01:01:27,647
I don't think that's true, actually.

1357
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:29,728
But you see what I mean?

1358
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:30,648
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1359
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:30,909
Yeah.

1360
01:01:30,909 --> 01:01:31,049
Cool.

1361
01:01:31,049 --> 01:01:31,869
Thanks.

1362
01:01:31,869 --> 01:01:32,229
Thank you.
