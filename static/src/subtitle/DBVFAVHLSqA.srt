1
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:10,991
The talk is called Gunner, the sound of Gunner, exploring the intertwined relationship between

2
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:12,091
sound and game design.

3
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:17,294
If you have a comment or question during the talk, please tweet at us at our handle seen

4
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:17,854
a bit later.

5
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:22,137
We won't read it until after the talk, but you know, we'll be happy for it.

6
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:26,899
Also we'll probably do a Q&A afterwards here or in your next room.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,182
My name is Martin, and I was a sound designer and producer on the project.

8
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,980
I've been involved in a number of indie games and work most notably with Quillway Studio.

9
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:42,862
We've done Among the Sleep and The Plan, working on Mosaic.

10
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:46,683
Among the Sleep is the most famous, most known as the baby horror game.

11
00:00:49,844 --> 00:00:51,204
And my name is Ditto.

12
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:58,727
I used to do a bunch of game jams before sort of moving to Stugan and like Kalsan briefly in Sweden

13
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,628
where I was working on this bigger project that we're not talking about today.

14
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:09,316
But as a side project to that one I started Gunner because I needed something to like

15
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:10,216
blow off steam on.

16
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,057
Yeah, so we'll get into that more later.

17
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:15,317
Yeah, what is Gunner?

18
00:01:15,637 --> 00:01:16,577
What is this game?

19
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:18,497
That's a tough question.

20
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:20,998
It looks sort of like this.

21
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:22,038
Yeah.

22
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:36,106
So Goner is a platformer shooter with randomised roguelike elements.

23
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:43,751
It focuses a lot on the minute-to-minute running and gunning and shooting and action aspects

24
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:45,712
of a roguelike game like that.

25
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:54,257
It's a cacophonous game.

26
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:57,960
It's filled with visually and auditory candy from the first splash screen you see.

27
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:02,547
to pretty much the last death animation Tally scoreboard where you give up in frustration.

28
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:17,097
So making this bad boy took like 12 months, 18 if you count the porting to switch part

29
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:24,102
of that that happened just after releasing on Steam. And it was published by Raw Fury.

30
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:37,144
Last year we won the IDF for best audio, excellence in game audio, and it was super nice.

31
00:02:37,644 --> 00:02:42,008
Thank you.

32
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:48,653
But we basically felt that this project was something we were really proud of, and after

33
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:53,457
the fact we wanted to also explore a bit maybe what made this game work so well, and why

34
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:56,500
we're so content with what we had made ourselves in a way.

35
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,883
So we figured out that doing this talk we could have the chance to...

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,141
explore and analyze a bit why the sounding game clicked as well as it did.

37
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:10,003
So for today we'll be exploring our working relationship both professionally and personally

38
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,485
and kind of how related how the game ended up where it is.

39
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:25,029
So yeah, first things first, I used to be so alone before this project, like I never

40
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:26,190
really worked with a group before.

41
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:31,568
I did a bunch of game jams, but it was always just me doing them.

42
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:37,192
And that has a lot of both benefits and flaws to it.

43
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:41,995
To begin with, I never collaborated with anyone else before, so for this project I had to

44
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:47,439
learn how to communicate, which you can sort of see that I'm still struggling with, so

45
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,359
I'm working on it.

46
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:55,264
The good thing about doing so many game jams is that I did try both.

47
00:03:55,684 --> 00:04:00,447
Apart from programming and animating, I did a bunch of game design and sound design as

48
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:00,668
well.

49
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:05,512
So even though that was always on a hobby level, I had some previous experience with

50
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:06,873
sound design already.

51
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:10,336
I've never been alone.

52
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:14,599
I mostly work with a lot of different teams and it's super fun.

53
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:20,024
I like it quite a lot and I worked with anything from medium-sized studios to around 15 to

54
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:20,224
10 people.

55
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:26,836
All the way down to a project like this where we were essentially, most of the part, three

56
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:27,177
people.

57
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:34,863
And through a lot of these different games, I've developed quite a lot of different tools

58
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:37,505
for being able to work on a number of them at the same time.

59
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:41,548
And one of them is very relevant and we'll talk about a bit today because it's relevant

60
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:46,812
for the process of making sounds for Gunnar, which is what we like to call constraints.

61
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:48,854
Oh, shit.

62
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:50,696
Yes.

63
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:51,776
So.

64
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:56,196
Starting up any project, I set up a bunch of constraints for myself,

65
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,518
and I guess this is pretty common for creative projects in general.

66
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,941
Those constraints then inform every decision that you make throughout the project,

67
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:15,104
since they will be things like the motto that we had for this particular game was,

68
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:17,905
if you can't do it quickly enough, there's probably a better way of doing it.

69
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:23,230
Which sort of means that since this was a side project from this bigger project that I was talking about,

70
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:30,977
everything I did for this one had to be really quick because it was like a late night project for me.

71
00:05:33,138 --> 00:05:37,202
And that motto kept throughout the whole project.

72
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:40,084
So everything we did was because of that.

73
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:46,870
And so, for instance, to further on the constraints that I set up,

74
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:49,635
Everything was placeholders.

75
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,556
It just actually had one line of code

76
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:54,178
that would call everything sound-related

77
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:54,679
in the whole game.

78
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,040
So every time you hear sound in the game,

79
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,602
it's because of this one line.

80
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:00,823
Because I thought I was changing it later,

81
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:02,384
so who cares what it looks like right now, right?

82
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,827
But it just never ended up being changed.

83
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:08,409
Yeah, we were going to look at the F model

84
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:11,711
while doing some sort of middleware function.

85
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:14,213
But we kind of never got around to it, and it sounded good.

86
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,434
So it was sort of, yeah.

87
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:16,372
kind of works.

88
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:18,833
Like, don't flog a dead goat, as you say in Norway.

89
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:27,878
And another one of these constraints was these, like, wobbly graphics that the game

90
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:29,038
are built upon.

91
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:35,342
And this also came from, like, I draw these animations in absolutely max half an hour.

92
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:40,204
So if I couldn't draw a thing in less than half an hour, I would, like, scrap that idea

93
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:41,425
and try to draw something else, right?

94
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,730
A good example of that is like this.

95
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,691
You have a big friend on a hill in the game

96
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,692
that was supposed to be a friend living in a house

97
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:49,453
but I couldn't draw a house quickly enough

98
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:50,673
so I turned it into a whale.

99
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:51,854
So that's Sally.

100
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:54,054
Yeah.

101
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:54,675
Yeah.

102
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:01,837
Yeah.

103
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:03,638
Yeah.

104
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:04,258
I also

105
00:07:04,438 --> 00:07:05,579
worked for a number of restraints.

106
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:11,310
I think the most important one that got to define this game was, I was basically working

107
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,194
mostly off this synth, which I'd had around for a while and was not really happy as a

108
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:22,079
compositional tool, but I wanted to limit myself to using exclusivity for making sounds.

109
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:32,268
It basically meant that the way I work with games usually is, I put a constraint that

110
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:34,970
I like to call frames, where it's sort of like the philosophical...

111
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:38,772
what the sound sort of means in this game, what it sort of tells you.

112
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:43,133
Like if a door opens, what sort of feeling should the door have in the context of the

113
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:43,374
game?

114
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:48,495
And for the pure sound aspect of this, the frame basically means that if you imagine

115
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:53,916
this screen over there as being the 2D plane of every possible sound that exists because

116
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:58,878
of physics limits, what you can hear, then a frame would be like a smaller part of that

117
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:01,858
which is placed somewhere rather than not arbitrary.

118
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:12,062
And when I'm experimenting, whenever a sound kind of ends up within that frame, this is the right sound for that game, because it's sort of predetermined in a way.

119
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:13,843
And it enables me to experiment a lot.

120
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:22,288
So, for this specific project, I was focusing mostly on the sounds synthesizers can make.

121
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:28,371
And it was fun. We'll get back to the process of that.

122
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:33,799
But we also had a different kind of frame, which was the philosophy of implementation.

123
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,883
Basically, we decided pretty early that realism is not really our strong suit.

124
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:41,704
I don't know how to make gun sounds.

125
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:45,807
So we kind of decided that we could rather go for whatever felt good.

126
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:49,670
A sound didn't have to be the right sound to fit on anything.

127
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,633
It just had to be sort of like, imagine having a hand of popcorn, and you take one popcorn

128
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:55,514
and it feels really good.

129
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,955
And you kind of want to have another bit, so you take another bit.

130
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:02,777
So the context of the sound was more, does it feel pleasing?

131
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:03,857
Do I want to hear another?

132
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,478
Rather than, does this successfully

133
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:09,699
replicate the sound of a double-barreled shotgun

134
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:10,199
from 1922, you know?

135
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,279
Because who cares?

136
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,580
At least for this game, it was pretty funny.

137
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,381
So make it candy was the kind of thing

138
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:21,282
that I always kind of want to juice it up to make it kind of

139
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:22,963
fit Ditto's school animation style.

140
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:27,104
Also, another limitation which I'm pretty strict for,

141
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:29,105
and this is the reason why I even started on this game,

142
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:30,836
I really don't like footsteps.

143
00:09:31,157 --> 00:09:34,538
It's the most boring thing that I know, really.

144
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,619
The way this game works, as you can see here...

145
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,302
Yeah, I didn't have a better animation for it, but you can sort of hear it when the drop

146
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:44,342
that falls down on that thing.

147
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:48,644
You can see the world is being made around the character.

148
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:57,648
That pretty much means that instead of the indication of movement coming from the character

149
00:09:57,688 --> 00:09:58,228
moving itself...

150
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,841
is the sound of the world building around you.

151
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:03,622
And conceptually, I found that really interesting

152
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:06,403
and got super hyped up on working on this game.

153
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,464
That was like the last little bit of Constraint.

154
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:11,085
It's more like a pet peeve than anything else, but it's fun.

155
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:17,327
So Constraints for us was actually a super good thing,

156
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,929
because we could make billions of sounds.

157
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:21,709
Like already before, while you guys were sitting

158
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,330
to wait to hear us talk, I was sitting with this

159
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,151
and playing around a bit.

160
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:28,765
It sort of very quickly turned into...

161
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:32,528
Let's see now.

162
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:35,070
This is pretty much a process of me making sounds for this game.

163
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,793
I'm sitting here and just kind of putting in random sounds from the synth.

164
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:42,356
And then I play through them randomly and record what I play through.

165
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:44,298
And I take out whatever I like in the end.

166
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:57,458
And so the finished product would sound something like this sound you hear right now.

167
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,940
And if you listen closely enough, you can hear the double-barreled shotgun in there.

168
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:14,142
So basically, I mean, the OP1 made it like a super narrow aesthetic, but I could work

169
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:14,942
really fast.

170
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:20,684
And we had a huge pile of sounds within a pretty short month or two, because for every

171
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:22,424
five sounds we would need, I would make a hundred.

172
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:27,259
So we would have basically billions of sounds, and with that came a lot of freedom to work

173
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,359
within the bounds of the constraints.

174
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:36,645
It sort of felt in a way that, because the aesthetic was so predetermined, we couldn't

175
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:38,566
really make sounds that were really wrong because...

176
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:41,428
We had to have a really clear frame for that.

177
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:45,490
Yeah, and it felt like we were playing with one of those boxes where you kind of recognize

178
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,113
and put in the shapes, but we basically had all squares and all square holes, so it was

179
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,154
just...

180
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:53,035
No matter where you put what, it sort of...

181
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:56,327
fitted or at least were the basis of something we could use.

182
00:11:59,367 --> 00:11:59,567
Yeah.

183
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:03,748
And we both have really fast ways of working.

184
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:07,829
Like me from coming from Game Jams, obviously like everything I do have to be really quick.

185
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,011
So the way I've learned to make Game Jams is very, how I've learned to make games is

186
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:20,632
very quick and iterative and quickly discarding of things that doesn't work and quickly just

187
00:12:21,212 --> 00:12:22,493
harboring of things that sort of work.

188
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:27,584
And Martin having worked on so many different projects, he has to be able to jump in between

189
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,367
projects very quickly, sit down and work for a couple of minutes on this thing and then

190
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:32,348
jump into something else.

191
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:39,092
So all of the constraints and all of the processes we came up with for this project was always

192
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:39,873
with that in mind.

193
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:43,956
I was talking about earlier that it was a side project from the beginning.

194
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:44,916
And that sort of...

195
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:50,304
feeling kept through the whole project, where everything we did was just to try to make

196
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:51,805
the iteration as quick as possible.

197
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,826
And that became sort of a process.

198
00:12:55,547 --> 00:13:02,171
We sort of had the good luck of being funded and getting help from a publisher, Raw Theory.

199
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:07,714
And basically being a small team and having a very low living cost, as I always did, and

200
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:13,017
it was a very low risk for everyone involved, and it enabled us really like a low pressure . .

201
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:18,540
development as we had a low burn rate. And it also enabled us not to kind of have

202
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,243
the focus on other aspects like marketing business which none of us have

203
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:27,907
a lot of experience in and we don't really feel that we're that good in it

204
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:32,890
either. And we realized that this is a luxury that of course not everyone has

205
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:38,554
and so it was worth mentioning that for us it really worked and made this

206
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,215
project work the way it did.

207
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:46,930
Yeah, because of these conditions, we had these cushions to keep Goner from being like a...

208
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:54,116
It was like a game jam for the whole production of it, which was more than a year.

209
00:13:54,256 --> 00:14:04,564
It was like a year-long game jam, which sort of resembles pre-production in other more classical ways of looking at it,

210
00:14:04,664 --> 00:14:07,486
but this was like pre-production for all of the production.

211
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,603
And this was very comfortable for me, since I thought I was always working on placeholder.

212
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:20,445
And since, like, if what you're doing is placeholder, it doesn't really matter how you do it.

213
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:23,186
So you just do it quickly rather than well.

214
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:30,367
And then, like, if I wouldn't have been that free, like, if I didn't think it was placeholder,

215
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:32,788
I would probably have become more hesitant to experiment like I did.

216
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:35,529
And I think that goes for all of us.

217
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:42,176
It's also good to know that we never really had any strict story to begin with.

218
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:46,960
We didn't have any core of the game other than the actual genre of a platform shooter.

219
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:53,145
So everything, because of this feeling of jamming on it, just grew organically out of

220
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,127
experimenting what felt right there and then.

221
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:59,811
We never had this, this is the master document of what this game is.

222
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,715
Although it became a quite profound and deep game for us.

223
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:06,136
That came out of...

224
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,510
frustrations and good things that happened along the way.

225
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,514
So in a sense, we kind of explored a concept we felt rather than produce an actual product,

226
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:13,954
you could say.

227
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:19,079
So as an example, we have a few different ways we worked.

228
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:24,704
Yeah.

229
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:26,265
So this one is a bit weird.

230
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:29,648
This is maybe the staple of our process.

231
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:32,110
So every Friday we would have this.

232
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:34,642
A little challenge towards ourselves.

233
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:37,183
Like, can we come up with something that totally breaks this game?

234
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:43,228
Because we're working so strictly within frames all the time, is it possible to break these

235
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:45,629
frames for how we're designing this game?

236
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,753
So every Friday we would try to come up with an idea that could potentially break it.

237
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:53,735
Something that is stupid enough to do that.

238
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:56,797
And we call these Fridays the Fuck You Fridays.

239
00:15:57,878 --> 00:15:58,739
Or FIF for short.

240
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,680
Absolutely.

241
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:04,600
Things that came out of that that was really cool was like the...

242
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:08,343
Well, actually that was really shitty, was the poop head.

243
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:11,985
That just turns everything in the game brown.

244
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,326
Everything sort of sounds like...

245
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:16,508
Yeah, everything sounds like...

246
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:17,529
Yeah.

247
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:18,950
Nothing good.

248
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,593
And it's probably like the worst example of what ended up in the game

249
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,774
in the sense that it sort of fitted, so we put it in,

250
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:30,497
but we both felt that this is a really shitty thing to put in the game.

251
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:35,545
But then again, we had other things that really defined the game for later.

252
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:41,190
In the beginning, making more masks and heads, because heads give you abilities.

253
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:44,473
We had something called the Flip Head, and it's basically...

254
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:49,097
Whenever you would jump, it would also start somersaulting you around,

255
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:52,460
enabling you to do sick trick shots and have a lot of fun.

256
00:16:53,888 --> 00:17:00,410
Yeah. And suddenly you can kind of shoot yourself up in the air with a shotgun or do like, yes,

257
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:05,693
last minute saves. And it was... That's a good example versus the poophead which wasn't

258
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:14,776
the best example of all. But yeah. This is kind of like another example which is basically

259
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:22,219
what we decided to call the loop. So Ditto is basically super good at... It has a knack

260
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:22,980
for a lot of things, so...

261
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:33,624
The loop is basically us iterating and editing off each other, whereas he would select and find things that we had made, or I would come up with an idea, a suggestion.

262
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:46,034
And quite often it could have worked really well in the context and came out of the blue, especially with the sound when they chose things.

263
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:51,578
He basically had a part of curating the huge hoards of sounds we had.

264
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:56,641
And it would also make it easier for me to look at the sounds in retrospect, seeing it

265
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:59,163
as like, okay, so this is a cool sound for that.

266
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:03,946
I didn't know we could use it for that because it was called 1922 Shotgun, but we're using

267
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:04,967
it for jump sound.

268
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:06,308
But it's fine, you know?

269
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,490
Within the context, it works really well.

270
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:16,115
Yeah, and so like, this is sort of what the loop would look like for us.

271
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,457
We have two examples of those, which are...

272
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:22,009
And we'll go through really quickly.

273
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,952
So the example one is I make some kind of content.

274
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:30,015
Martin sees the new content, and he makes like 100 sounds

275
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:32,676
on his open one in 20 minutes.

276
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:35,358
He throws the sounds at me, and I

277
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:38,160
will sort of try to throw the sounds in as placeholder

278
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,462
on the game, wherever I see fit.

279
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:44,345
And then I come in and give feedback, and it sort of

280
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:45,045
iterates.

281
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:49,354
It will be quite consistent that whatever we did or put in the game, like a third was

282
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,976
kind of throwaway and we needed to work more on.

283
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:55,478
A third was pretty good and we can work on and iterate it to make it something good.

284
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:59,860
And a third would be, like we just basically mentioned, that the third would be something

285
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,803
that you would find, like a little nugget amongst all the poop, that was just like the

286
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:08,145
right kind of sounds that I wouldn't have been able to see.

287
00:19:08,706 --> 00:19:13,088
So that was a very interesting and liberating thing for me because I was just, you know,

288
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:14,769
when you make something yourself.

289
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:16,033
you get very tight on it.

290
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:19,154
And it's actually nice to have someone see it from a distance

291
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:20,655
and be able to pick up stuff like that.

292
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:25,916
The other example is basically.

293
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:28,357
No, let's show an example of it in real person.

294
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:34,699
So an example of this in the works is when I made the snake.

295
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,960
And Martin would make a bunch of sounds for the snake.

296
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,781
But none of them really fit with how the animation looks.

297
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:42,022
You can see when he jumps into the snake and it swallows you.

298
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:43,582
So it would take.

299
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:50,850
random sounds that were made from something else and sort of mash them up and see what

300
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,391
fit until I find something that worked together with the animation.

301
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:58,432
Then he would remove a third of that.

302
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:03,113
And the second example is, basically we have all these sounds.

303
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,654
I would be pleased to have these sounds because I love it.

304
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:06,854
Can we please use it for something?

305
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:09,395
And Dito would be nice and put it somewhere.

306
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,115
Usually he made something that would go with it.

307
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:15,423
The second world, which is like Janko Robo, are mostly made around these ideas because

308
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:16,904
we had a lot of rusty, weird sounds.

309
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:21,845
They kind of informed the decision of how the enemies would react and stuff, which made

310
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:22,666
me really happy actually.

311
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:23,906
And one of the examples is that.

312
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:26,007
It's what we call chicken legs.

313
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:29,288
And chicken legs, we decided he should have these cool sounds that sound like a little

314
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:35,091
bit of panicked Russel when he gets hurt and he starts running around and he will spawn

315
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,412
like exclamation marks and they will blow up.

316
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:39,432
You can kind of see it here.

317
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:45,296
So I have to jump on the other guy first.

318
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:48,778
Hang on, hang on, it's coming.

319
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:53,421
Here we go.

320
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:56,363
Yeah, it's coming through.

321
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:01,026
Yeah.

322
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:05,268
You know, Ditto is perfect to me.

323
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:06,069
No, no, man.

324
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:06,729
You're perfect.

325
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,231
Dude.

326
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:09,991
The thing is...

327
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:16,766
During the production we basically started really becoming each other's heroes in a way.

328
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:22,331
I would actually at some point recommend Ditto to test a game I really like the sound design for.

329
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:26,674
And he was like, are you shitting me? That's my game.

330
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:35,802
And we basically grew to kind of know and appreciate each other's tastes and ways of working that kind of fed off each other.

331
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:37,163
And the best thing is...

332
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:41,034
I could work on the game design and throw ideas and try out things

333
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:43,855
because I knew that whatever Dido would choose out of that,

334
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:47,536
if he chose one of a thousand ideas, it would be the perfect idea.

335
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:51,318
I always believe there is a correct way of doing everything.

336
00:21:51,838 --> 00:21:54,099
Martin obviously knows the correct way of doing sound design

337
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,919
because he is the god of sound design.

338
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
Which meant that I could do whatever...

339
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:00,981
It's true.

340
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,762
That meant I could do basically what I wanted with the sound design

341
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:07,643
and if he did something wrong, then he would...

342
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:11,887
And I can pick up on that and remove it before we actually release the game.

343
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:20,091
Which means that I can do a bunch of naive and blue-eyed things that would then fit the game for what it is.

344
00:22:22,552 --> 00:22:27,115
I think it's worth mentioning with Ditto, sitting and actually implementing things and trying and failing,

345
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:29,956
I think for you it doesn't work too much with game audio.

346
00:22:31,557 --> 00:22:36,780
Basically the most important thing about sound for games is basically realizing that the implementation...

347
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:41,616
is extremely important and you could have the best sounds in the world, but if you don't

348
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:45,439
actually put them in correctly and if they don't kind of make sense in attenuating the

349
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:50,383
way someone plays and informing the player what happens, it's sort of everything all

350
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,664
for nothing, you might say.

351
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:57,549
So it was a very helpful thing to kind of be able to play around with implementation

352
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,534
and not having to do it myself again because then we kind of had to, I could sort of sit

353
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:06,176
over and say, like, this works, this doesn't feel right.

354
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:10,195
We tried doing this and yeah, we kind of tried and failed all the way.

355
00:23:11,676 --> 00:23:15,879
But we kept on trying to try to impress each other, but it wasn't all good because, you

356
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:18,380
know, Ditto actually burned out at the end of production.

357
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,502
Yeah, turns out like jamming takes its toll on you.

358
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:26,004
We always thought like the, so from the beginning we thought the game was going to be like a

359
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:30,447
month more and whenever that month ended we added a month to the deadline.

360
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:32,568
You probably know how this goes, everyone know you.

361
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:37,674
Which meant that I was game jamming, or rather, crunching for a year.

362
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:41,197
And that's not too good on your health.

363
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:47,563
And it was also a big part of the way we were jamming off of each other, where we always

364
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:50,845
tried to impress and surprise each other.

365
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:56,150
That's really hard if you don't even know what's expected of you, like I was.

366
00:23:58,532 --> 00:24:02,775
And also I was trying to be a producer on the team, but I wasn't a very good producer

367
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:08,877
Every team is different, and Ditto had, of course, a few needs that I sort of neglected

368
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:09,277
to see.

369
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:18,725
And it sort of ended up with us being very fond of each other, but we didn't still share

370
00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:22,188
the tough things all the time, which led to this pressure on Ditto that made him burn.

371
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:27,933
I think it's worth, though, that when you're analyzing a process and presenting it to others,

372
00:24:29,574 --> 00:24:31,536
it's not always that valuable as it is.

373
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,322
of course what worked for us wouldn't necessarily work for other people.

374
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:38,784
And it's not really exact science, so we can look at this and we don't really know what

375
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:40,505
would have happened if we had done anything differently.

376
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:44,307
But in our experience, this is kind of what we did that we want to keep doing forward.

377
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:47,688
Complete trust is nice.

378
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:50,189
Like, it's super nice to work with someone and you just...

379
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:56,632
They would catch you if you fall, they would catch a bullet for you, they would take your

380
00:24:56,672 --> 00:25:01,335
stupid ideas and make them beautiful, and give you a pat on the head and tell you everything

381
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:01,715
is fine.

382
00:25:02,673 --> 00:25:12,416
It was super beautiful that, and it's definitely one of the better work relationships that

383
00:25:12,436 --> 00:25:16,958
we've ever been in, and it really fed into the whole creative process of working together.

384
00:25:16,978 --> 00:25:22,680
Yeah, and on top of that, having such explicit constraints means that you can be as crazy

385
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,541
as you want with the decisions that you make, because you have something that informs you

386
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:29,542
if you're still within the frame of what you're doing.

387
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:34,354
And we have a few things we would have liked to have done differently.

388
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:35,575
And it's taken notes.

389
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:36,895
We should have...

390
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:39,496
We want to be better at communicating in the future.

391
00:25:39,516 --> 00:25:41,176
We want to actually take care of each other.

392
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:42,717
And instead of just being tough and cool,

393
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:44,277
we also want to share feelings.

394
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:46,658
And when things aren't going that well,

395
00:25:47,498 --> 00:25:48,479
actually help each other a bit.

396
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,739
And also actually plan a little bit ahead.

397
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,880
You know, have kind of dead milestones

398
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,320
that we actually enforce.

399
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,021
And even if we don't have to follow them all the way,

400
00:25:57,241 --> 00:25:58,622
at least we can have the perspective

401
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,042
so we are better at facing ourselves.

402
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:06,911
And for you, we kind of recommend trying out these things that we found working pretty well.

403
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:13,795
First thing is hierarchy is bullshit, like, at least it's old school, so you can try to work on it and try...

404
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:19,499
Just because you do sound design, or just because you're a game designer, or just because you do marketing in a game,

405
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,682
doesn't mean that you can't tinker with something else, and that again is based on trust,

406
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:27,925
and it's a beautiful thing when everyone in a team feels they can contribute on everything, really.

407
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:32,820
Yeah, and once again, have some sort of plan, maybe.

408
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,721
It's always good.

409
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:38,465
And so actually, trust the loop.

410
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:39,526
Trust each other.

411
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,088
See what happens if you leave something completely

412
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:42,848
to the other person.

413
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:48,833
At least when you have this tight collaboration,

414
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:52,476
like we do, leaving something to your partner

415
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:54,898
and seeing what happens if you leave them completely with that.

416
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:56,919
It's really cool.

417
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:57,640
Yeah, try that out.

418
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,721
And if nothing else, like.

419
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:04,996
do something Friday's yes yeah but it is actually a the most important take away

420
00:27:05,016 --> 00:27:08,399
with for key Friday's every fun is that it's nice to not be super serious about

421
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:13,082
the game all the time so trying to actually actively destroy your game

422
00:27:13,562 --> 00:27:19,887
where does it sound it could be fun at the at the worst at the best maybe yeah

423
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:23,830
with some ideas that you never thought about otherwise yeah that is for us

424
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:24,490
thank you so much
