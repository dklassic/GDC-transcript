Hi, I'm Richard Carillo, a game director at Ubisoft Toronto.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,882
Back in 2015, I gave a talk titled,

3
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:10,183
Designing Your Design Team.

4
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:12,265
It was my theory that there's four different types

5
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:14,267
of game designers, each with unique perspectives

6
00:00:14,287 --> 00:00:16,249
when solving problems, with the idea

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,771
that if you understand your design team,

8
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:18,812
you'll make better games.

9
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:22,335
This time around, I wanted to make a talk that was more practical

10
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,977
and could be used to solve problems like we're facing in our studio

11
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:26,459
with interviewing game designers.

12
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,521
Some interviewers will focus on the experience of the candidate,

13
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:32,264
others will focus on the processes and documentation,

14
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:33,945
while many more will say,

15
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:36,347
hey, can you design a cool idea for your favorite game?

16
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:39,230
But most of these interviewers will miss out on one fundamental question.

17
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,871
Are you a game designer?

18
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:43,733
My talk, titled Interviewing for Game Design,

19
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:45,235
will focus on that question

20
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:47,457
and help you understand what to look for in the answers.

21
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:50,907
This talk is for interviewers and candidates alike.

22
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:51,870
Hope to see you there.
