00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,341
Hello everyone. Welcome to Slime Rancher, a preemptive post-mortem. I'm Nick Popovich, I'm the

2
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:19,383
CEO of Monami Park, and before we begin I'm supposed to say please turn off your phones. I

3
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:25,304
will be in the wrap up room after this if anyone has any questions, and then I'll also be

4
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:33,126
uploading the presentation to the GDC vault and in PDF format as well. So if you want access to

5
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:35,587
these slides, they will be available for you.

6
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:40,572
So this is a preemptive post-mortem for Slime Rancher.

7
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:41,694
We're not done with it yet.

8
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:44,016
We're still in early access.

9
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:47,621
And so we're being a little cheeky with the name here.

10
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:48,802
But let's get right into it.

11
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:52,026
I'm going to cover how we made the game.

12
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:55,968
our sort of prototyping process and everything,

13
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:59,310
and our first year in early access,

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,092
and share all the tips and everything that I have for that,

15
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:05,354
as well as a lot of information on YouTube

16
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:05,974
and things like that.

17
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:07,755
So hopefully you get something out of it.

18
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,152
To start, I am the co-founder and CEO of Monami Park.

19
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:14,093
I designed Slime Rancher and Spiral Knights,

20
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:16,054
and there's me on Twitter.

21
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:19,596
And that's everything that you need to know

22
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:20,416
about me right now.

23
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,957
Let's hear about Slime Rancher.

24
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,078
So has everyone played it?

25
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:27,280
Slime Rancher, yeah, yeah, cool, all right.

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,561
Well, I'm still going to introduce the game anyway, so bear with me.

27
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:33,782
It's a first-person farming, ranching game with slimes.

28
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:36,443
The name is totally appropriate.

29
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:43,005
It's super heavy in the physics department, and the world is completely open and non-linear,

30
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:45,846
very Zelda-like in that sense.

31
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:50,208
But let's see a trailer of Slime Rancher to kind of understand it if you've never heard

32
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:50,328
of it.

33
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:32,108
That's Slime Rancher.

34
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:35,390
So let's look at the development data.

35
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,111
We worked on this for two years

36
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:39,013
before it went into early access

37
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:42,055
in a little apartment somewhere.

38
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:46,158
And after releasing it, two became five.

39
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:48,139
We're super proud of that.

40
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:53,423
It uses Unity and UFPS, which is a Unity asset package

41
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,185
that allowed us basically to make a first person shooter

42
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:56,965
like overnight.

43
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:00,107
At this point, it would probably be more efficient

44
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:03,208
if we weren't using it, but it got us to this point,

45
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,069
so we're gonna stick with it.

46
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,530
We also used Sector to break up our world

47
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,291
and let it kind of load on the fly.

48
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,313
It was totally bootstrapped, no funding,

49
00:03:12,313 --> 00:03:14,694
and we never crunched, and that's super important

50
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,795
because you don't need to.

51
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:22,418
In the retail, it's PC, Mac, Linux, and Xbox One, 20 bucks,

52
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:24,239
and it's done super well for us.

53
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,360
This is probably why I'm giving this talk.

54
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,081
And yeah, I mean it completely took us by surprise.

55
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,602
And so sort of the purpose of this talk

56
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:38,083
is to figure out why maybe that is the case.

57
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,284
So let's start by talking about creating Slime Rancher.

58
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:43,765
And the points we're gonna cover.

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,343
are the original idea, which had nothing to do with Slime Rancher,

60
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:51,906
our approach to development and constraints.

61
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:57,069
That sounds boring, but let's get right into the seed that grew into it.

62
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,751
And this isn't boring, this is a lot of fun.

63
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:03,394
This is how Slime Rancher all started. It was with a bug in Oblivion.

64
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:10,624
There was a bug in Oblivion that allowed you to put a mundane object into a bow

65
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,072
and shoot infinite amounts of that into the environment and break it.

66
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,195
So you can do that with melons, and I think that's like a...

67
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:23,657
a worm cult priest trying to be very serious while melons are just like filling the environment.

68
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:25,458
I always thought that was really hilarious.

69
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:30,379
You could do lots of silly things with it like fill inns full of cabbages and cause

70
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:34,881
everyone to fall over and then the town guards would try and come after you.

71
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:37,122
And they're tripping on cabbages as well.

72
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:41,625
and that was super silly, and so I thought, you know, ball pits are really, really fun.

73
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,107
Maybe we can make a game about a ball pit.

74
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:47,630
But that was long before Slime Rancher came to be.

75
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,551
When it was...

76
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:51,093
That was always sort of simmering in the back of my mind, and then when it was time for

77
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:58,379
us to create our own thing, Slime Rancher was sort of the marriage of this kernel of

78
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,042
an idea and a couple other things that made sense to us.

79
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:05,504
Plus, I just liked slimes, they were cheery, and I wanted to do something that was happy.

80
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,254
But then we were faced with a development reality.

81
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:11,038
We were only two people.

82
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,828
We could not make a better version of any kind of known.

83
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:20,501
property out there. It didn't matter if I had a great idea for a military shooter,

84
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:24,904
like a first-person military shooter, it wasn't going to happen. I didn't think it

85
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:30,409
was worth competing because they're always going to win. So we took a

86
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:35,193
different approach and it is to be better than anyone. We decided we can

87
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:38,856
make a better slime ranching game than anyone ever. That was something that we

88
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:44,180
could actually do and this might seem obvious but we really had to kind of

89
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,601
stick with it.

90
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:49,822
And the way that you do that is you make your own Calvin Ball.

91
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:52,323
I don't know if anyone has ever read Calvin and Hobbes.

92
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:53,483
I'm sure a lot of you have.

93
00:05:53,483 --> 00:06:00,045
A running joke in it was Calvin Ball, which is where Calvin and Hobbes would take a game

94
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:02,206
and invent stuff on the fly and just kind of run with it.

95
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:06,348
And there was a couple of comics where they talked about how they were world champions

96
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:09,610
in Calvin Ball, and that always kind of stuck with me.

97
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,712
So we made our own Calvin Ball, and by default, we were the best at it.

98
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:21,436
And the other important thing to note about Calvin Ball is it's using a lot of known elements

99
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:22,876
from existing sports.

100
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:27,643
So you know how to interact with parts of Calvin Ball,

101
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:30,267
but you don't necessarily know the whole rules yet,

102
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:33,291
but you can get comfortable because you can interact

103
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,776
with pieces of it that you're very familiar with it.

104
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:37,037
And so.

105
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:41,241
What this amounts to is sort of on the weirdness spectrum.

106
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:43,342
You have something like Call of Duty,

107
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:45,924
which people are super familiar with,

108
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:47,565
and that represents the thing,

109
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:49,847
the mousetrap that we couldn't build a better version of.

110
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:51,368
There was no chance for that.

111
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:52,589
But with something like Call of Duty,

112
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:54,390
if you have a great version of that.

113
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,413
people not only know how to play it already,

114
00:06:57,413 --> 00:07:00,536
but they're going to like the theme of it walking into it.

115
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:02,798
On the other end, you have Katamari,

116
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:06,021
in which at the time, no one knew how to play it,

117
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:07,883
no one understood what the theme was,

118
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:11,627
the art style wasn't mainstream.

119
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:12,908
And you can do that.

120
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:15,370
You can make your, you know, start an indie company

121
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,732
and try and make the next Katamari.

122
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:23,275
good luck to you because it's like, you know, a real shot in the dark.

123
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:26,437
And when you get that, you're going to go huge with it,

124
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:29,318
but the chance of you getting that is much slimmer.

125
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:32,760
And so we were looking to mitigate risk, and so we went somewhere in the middle.

126
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:38,265
where Slime Rancher has a lot of familiar elements

127
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:41,407
of existing games, but then we kind of hold on dearly

128
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:44,970
to this core of weirdness that isn't too off-putting

129
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,932
because much like Calvin Ball,

130
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,574
people can be familiar with a soccer ball

131
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:51,496
or a mallet or something like that

132
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:53,017
and kind of ease themselves into it.

133
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:54,538
It's a way of getting your player

134
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:55,819
to kind of let their guard down.

135
00:07:56,905 --> 00:08:01,567
And we used these constraints that we were faced with as two people.

136
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:07,828
I can't animate for a dam, so we used limbless slimes as the central actors of our game.

137
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:13,170
By making an FPS, there was no character model other than a hand to animate.

138
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:17,151
The FPS, as I've said, mainstream muscle memory.

139
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,031
It allowed people who...

140
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:24,335
maybe would have never played a first-person slime ranching game to play it

141
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:28,698
because when they see a trailer of it, as I just showed you, it's first-person and you're shooting stuff.

142
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:32,020
And so that, you know, works for a lot of people.

143
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,442
It's open world because scripting is hard.

144
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:39,645
Making sequences and hoping they don't break and having to check that every time you do,

145
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,127
you know, add more content to the game is super hard.

146
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:44,688
So we did the easier thing, which is open world.

147
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,493
and I think that helped the game's reception.

148
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:51,537
And then, as I said, farming is relatable.

149
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:52,998
The rest of it is weird.

150
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:56,042
So that gets people who could at least say,

151
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:58,425
oh, I see they're growing vegetables in this game.

152
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,388
I play games where you grow vegetables.

153
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:02,010
This seems like perhaps it's a game for me.

154
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:07,374
So the takeaway here is that Slime Rancher is a weird concept played in a familiar way,

155
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:11,316
it's wrapped in a familiar theme, so two of the three battles are already won,

156
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:15,219
and the last battle is a game of Calvin Ball, which by default you win.

157
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:21,604
So, you know, doing the too familiar and then whatever it is you're trying to say or be

158
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,185
is a pretty good cocktail.

159
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:28,264
So next, we're gonna talk about building guarantees

160
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:30,006
into Slime Rancher's design,

161
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:32,367
and this seems super presumptuous, but bear with me.

162
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:36,511
The points to cover are our approach to prototyping

163
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,814
and how we evaluate it, how we build fun loops,

164
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,816
which sounds like breakfast cereal,

165
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:46,479
and how this all guarantees a strong foundation

166
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,700
for the final product.

167
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:59,251
So when we first began, before we had any sort of working anything, probably even before we opened up Unity for the first time,

168
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:04,156
I made a kind of an image of what I wanted Slime Rancher to be.

169
00:10:04,156 --> 00:10:05,457
Thank you TF2 Assets for that.

170
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:09,441
But we knew it was going to be like kind of lower poly and painterly.

171
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:10,863
That all made sense, so...

172
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,093
As you can see, it's kind of close to what we ultimately did.

173
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:20,915
But then, you know, this is what we started with.

174
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:24,517
This is sort of raw UFPS in action,

175
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:26,258
or as, you know, I like to think of it as

176
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,700
meat handgun versus the devil spheres.

177
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,281
That was our initial prototype.

178
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:39,430
And it worked, and it was what sold my partner, Mike Thomas, on the idea was that

179
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,953
even in this very, very crude state, like, there was something there.

180
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:47,338
Like, especially when you had all these spheres inside a corral and they're bubbling over

181
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:51,102
and it was almost like popcorn popping, and you were trying to manage that with your...

182
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:53,084
you know, marine hand with a pistol.

183
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:56,267
It actually was kind of fun.

184
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:59,029
But we didn't go right from that

185
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,111
into developing the full-on game.

186
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,273
Our approach to prototyping is a bit different.

187
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:06,696
Instead, we built a prototype

188
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:10,780
that kind of looked-ish like a final game.

189
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,241
And so this is where we were at,

190
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:13,642
including, thank you again, TF2.

191
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:21,490
So we had slimes who were expressive and they chirped and did all the kind of things that they do now in the game.

192
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,672
They were eating food and making plorts.

193
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:30,279
There was even Largos at this point and you see there's some corrals back there and even the tar.

194
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,661
And the reason for this is our prototype focused entirely

195
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:39,342
on the core game loop and not the vertical slice.

196
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:41,983
And our prototype's loop and final game loop

197
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:42,964
was exactly the same.

198
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:45,304
So we got this thing propped up and we said,

199
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,806
let's just make sure that the core action in the game

200
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:52,667
is fun and then we'll move on from there.

201
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,327
And there's an additional reason why we kind of

202
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:56,708
polished it up a little bit more than maybe we should have

203
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,568
that I'll get into later.

204
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:05,874
So this approach is because almost every game has what I like to think of as a 90% loop.

205
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:09,296
It's the thing that you're doing 90% of the time over and over and over.

206
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:13,599
Almost every game has this with very few exceptions.

207
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:19,102
Some of them are just pretty much purely the 90% loop, which is I guess 100% loop,

208
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,503
but you get my meaning.

209
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:25,667
So this loop is the machine that makes players want to play and replay your game.

210
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:26,728
It is that thing.

211
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:29,769
that players want to interact with.

212
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:33,171
If your game had a, ugh, it's that.

213
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,972
It's like, I just wanna play that.

214
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:37,133
And it's not thinking about achievements

215
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:40,074
or long-term objectives or anything like that.

216
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:42,836
And it's not perceived as the experience as a whole,

217
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:46,558
but it is absolutely what is going to drive your experience.

218
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,058
And I'll give you a great example

219
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,900
of how that can be so strong, nothing else matters.

220
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,081
So here we have Destiny.

221
00:12:54,723 --> 00:13:00,366
I believe it came out in like 2014, and when it did, you know, it had some problems.

222
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:06,130
There was some questionable performances by Peter Dinklage, and, you know, loot didn't

223
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,210
exactly feel great.

224
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,732
There was a bunch of things that you could chalk up to as like, oh, I'm familiar with

225
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:13,974
what they're trying to do here because I've played other games where they do this stuff

226
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,555
and they're not doing it quite right.

227
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:21,137
However, the fun loop, that 90% of you engaging with an enemy,

228
00:13:21,137 --> 00:13:23,338
shooting them a bunch of times, taking cover

229
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:26,899
when your shields break, throwing a grenade

230
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,480
to disperse them, and running in and doing melee,

231
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,020
you could do that 50,000 times.

232
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,441
And it felt just as good on the 50,000th time

233
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:35,341
as it did the first time.

234
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:38,802
And that's why it was just completely arresting for me

235
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:41,943
for like a year and why it totally dominated the news.

236
00:13:41,943 --> 00:13:44,404
I think Kotaku, I believe, even did a story which was like,

237
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:50,527
We'll stop doing stories on Destiny when everyone stops reading them because everyone just wanted to read about Destiny.

238
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:55,529
And there was, again, no shortage of complaints, but what they made was magic.

239
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:58,170
And it was the thing that was driving that experience.

240
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,812
The other thing to note is that it is absolutely in all forms of play.

241
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:06,453
If you're choosing teams in basketball and you happen to be holding a ball...

242
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,855
You're not just sitting there like this, holding a ball, deciding what you're going to do.

243
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:12,396
You're going to be dribbling it because that action is just so satisfying.

244
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:16,438
And even when you're playing a board game, divorce from all strategy, you want to roll

245
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,579
that die.

246
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:22,061
Not only is that a satisfying action, but it means something's going to happen to me,

247
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,942
and I'm hooked on knowing what's next.

248
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:28,425
And it's all the parts of the game that just feel good.

249
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:35,078
So let's get back into our testing approach now, which was we presented the prototype

250
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:37,880
as a mostly finished game.

251
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,884
I think some of our friends were definitely looped in that there was much more to do,

252
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:46,309
but for other folks we said, here you go, what do you think of this game?

253
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:48,191
Because that prototype that I showed you earlier

254
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:51,433
had like a beginning, middle, and end.

255
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,634
It even had, you were supposed to last about 15 minutes,

256
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:57,036
see how long you can survive,

257
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,777
and then how many points you can get.

258
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:01,979
There was even an event at the end.

259
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:05,381
And we asked them to evaluate only what they see,

260
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,402
and then asked if they would buy it.

261
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:08,763
And we were very happy to find out

262
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:10,644
that lots of people were like, yeah, this is cool.

263
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,045
You should probably add a little of this

264
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,707
or a little of that, but otherwise, you know, it's cool.

265
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:17,508
So, why this approach?

266
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:21,010
You can't hide behind cool features that aren't yet implemented.

267
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,171
I see this happening all the time.

268
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:29,594
You make a prototype and you say, ignore this, pretend this is there, and just keep in mind

269
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:33,196
this crafting system will make all of this stuff more meaningful later.

270
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:35,699
How on earth can anyone evaluate that?

271
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,961
Especially because a lot of the times

272
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:39,563
when you're playing someone's prototype

273
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,604
and they're talking about things

274
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,285
that have nothing to do with that 90% loop,

275
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:46,710
there's no way of really evaluating that stuff

276
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,152
in the vacuum that you currently exist.

277
00:15:49,152 --> 00:15:51,795
So it's just additional noise that isn't necessary.

278
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:56,359
I also think that you can't really trust your friends' feedback, especially developers.

279
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:59,742
The reason for this is I do this all the time.

280
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:05,407
I'm playing someone's prototype or demo and I see something that is like, oh, wow, they

281
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:07,489
should fix that, but they're an experienced developer.

282
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:08,210
Of course they'll fix that.

283
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,691
I don't need to mention that.

284
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:14,336
Or it would seem silly if I said you're really going to change the art, right?

285
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,456
is this temp, is this not temp?

286
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:18,277
I don't want to insult them or anything.

287
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:23,538
So I think you have to kind of be as naked as you can

288
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:27,359
and just give them something and say, this is what it is.

289
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:30,140
There's nothing else that I'm kind of hiding behind.

290
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,860
And because if you're successful with that,

291
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,821
more cool features on top of a solid foundation

292
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:36,981
will just make it better.

293
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:40,402
Assume you don't add features that somehow detract.

294
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:44,906
like it's a first-person shooter and you add a kart racing minigame or something to it.

295
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:48,810
But if it's a first-person shooter and it's rock solid like Destiny was,

296
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,073
and then you add some sort of progression system that people like,

297
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:57,078
it's only going to be better. But you have to be really true to yourself and say,

298
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:03,083
I evaluated that loop in the beginning and it was solid and I'm not moving on until it is.

299
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:11,231
So the takeaway is to build a prototype that proves whatever the player is doing 90% of the time is fun.

300
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:14,554
Prove this by testing it for what it is, not for what you hope it will become.

301
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:17,357
And the fun loop should be fun on its own.

302
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:22,217
So again, just put it out there.

303
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:23,957
Don't pretend it's anything that it's not.

304
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:26,978
If you need it to be something that it's not,

305
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,799
wait and get it to that point.

306
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,319
But don't assume that your friends

307
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,060
are going to give you honest feedback

308
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,641
when lots of the puzzle is missing.

309
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,262
So next, a little bit of a diversion here,

310
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,822
a quick biology lesson.

311
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:50,555
So this is a great white shark.

312
00:17:50,555 --> 00:17:53,376
Everyone can see that's a great white shark.

313
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:56,617
Here's some cool shark facts.

314
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,258
They have razor sharp teeth, which is rad.

315
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:04,700
They can detect blood in an impossible amount of water.

316
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,141
They have had few evolutionary changes.

317
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:11,222
I think I heard once that they're like older than trees.

318
00:18:11,662 --> 00:18:13,324
which is pretty wild.

319
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:15,706
And then even their dorsal fins are super scary.

320
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:17,148
Like sharks are totally rad.

321
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:20,611
So the summary is every part of the shark's design

322
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:22,353
makes it better at being a shark.

323
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:23,654
Look at that thing.

324
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:25,936
So next, this is a pug.

325
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,744
And here's some stupid pug facts.

326
00:18:29,744 --> 00:18:32,346
They have trouble breathing.

327
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:35,650
They can't give birth without human intervention.

328
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,272
Their eyes can literally pop out of their head.

329
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:39,694
I'm not making this up.

330
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:42,076
And they were known to wear dumb costumes

331
00:18:42,076 --> 00:18:43,758
even in the 16th century.

332
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,600
At that point, like in the Victorian era,

333
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,343
they were actually further bred to look ridiculous.

334
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:52,705
And I apologize to pug owners, I love dogs, but it is a necessary example.

335
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:58,788
That, in summary, pugs are loaded with features that hinder its ability at being a successful dog.

336
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,510
I'm sorry, guy.

337
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,991
So, what I'm talking about here is lean game design.

338
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:10,114
Every aspect of Slime Rancher's original design informed the core gameplay.

339
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:15,576
It created a very focused, confident game right off the bat, and it's cheaper to do that.

340
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:17,317
I cannot stress that enough.

341
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:23,620
If you are early on in development of your game, and you were like us, and you're not getting paid for years,

342
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,543
you shouldn't be working on a crafting system unless your game happens to be about crafting.

343
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,364
Don't just work on the stuff that you think is fun.

344
00:19:31,364 --> 00:19:34,025
Work on the stuff that makes it strong.

345
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,548
So here's some pub features that we ditched early on in development.

346
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:41,230
The world was randomly generated at one point.

347
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:47,835
We ditched this because it wasn't creating spaces that made that sort of intimate interplay

348
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:51,758
between slimes fun, or happen at all in a lot of cases.

349
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:56,582
But it seemed like an answer, it seemed like free content, and it totally wasn't.

350
00:19:56,582 --> 00:20:02,306
Even though there was procedurally generated vegetation based on plorts sinking into the

351
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:03,987
ground and creating fruit.

352
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:11,154
I could go on, but it was like at the end of the day, we just said we'll just place the fruit trees on our own.

353
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:16,839
It was a very open world and a vehicle was required, and I still am wondering why we thought that was a good idea.

354
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:24,686
It was like, here was an interesting space, and then you just have to drive for like five or ten minutes to get to the other interesting space.

355
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,390
I don't know.

356
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,932
So there was dozens of unique tar.

357
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:31,414
I still think this is a cool idea,

358
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,536
but it's proven completely unnecessary

359
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,758
where when a tar would form,

360
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:40,362
it would actually have elements of the previous tar.

361
00:20:40,362 --> 00:20:42,324
So if you're familiar with the game,

362
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,746
if it was like a phosphor rad.

363
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:52,295
tar creation and plus a third one it would be a flying irradiated tar that and at the end of the day we just realized

364
00:20:52,295 --> 00:20:56,981
Like it's just gonna be noise like all the players gonna care about is like I'm getting killed

365
00:20:56,981 --> 00:21:00,566
But I thought it would be really cool to have the player like really have to live with their mistakes

366
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:04,731
and like, this is what you made me, you know,

367
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,594
but it was totally unnecessary.

368
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:10,597
And then there were even more enemies, because why not?

369
00:21:10,597 --> 00:21:12,680
Because you start making creatures

370
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,881
and it's fun to make creatures,

371
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:16,264
and then you say, oh, we could just repurpose it in this way

372
00:21:16,264 --> 00:21:18,366
and it was a lot of bad ideas.

373
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,789
So the takeaway here is to make your game a shark.

374
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:25,290
Every feature informs the core experience

375
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,051
and makes it a killing machine.

376
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:28,552
Cut your crafting systems, multiplayer,

377
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:32,814
whatever nice to have you have until the game matures.

378
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:36,096
That does not mean that you just cut it completely

379
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,977
or you add it as DLC or something.

380
00:21:37,977 --> 00:21:40,758
We're still in early access and we're adding features

381
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,779
that we would have never dreamed about adding

382
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:43,860
or that we cut.

383
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,161
early on in development.

384
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:47,881
But we're stable now.

385
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,802
We can afford to do these things.

386
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:52,623
So, you know, it's a marathon, not a sprint,

387
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:55,364
especially if you're doing early access.

388
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:58,405
And so just save that stuff for later.

389
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:01,987
So now we'll get into the release in our first year.

390
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:05,954
And the points that I'm gonna cover

391
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:08,636
are pre-release strategy, the early access plans

392
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:10,076
and how they got thrown out,

393
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:12,318
and then how early access actually works.

394
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:16,060
Yes, I have the secret information.

395
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,722
So pre-release was version 02,

396
00:22:18,722 --> 00:22:20,683
gave it to friends and family.

397
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:23,264
We knew it would leak because we gave it to some.

398
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:27,528
internet friends who we really don't know and they were strangers to us

399
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:31,271
and then it was a small file size too

400
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:34,935
the first one, I'm probably going to get this wrong, but I think it was like 38 megs

401
00:22:34,935 --> 00:22:40,239
it was tiny and it allowed people to share via email we found out which is

402
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:45,264
really cool because that's super old-school and then suddenly it was on YouTube

403
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:48,467
we were anticipating that hey maybe it would get on YouTube but then

404
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:53,534
It kind of happened very quickly on us and we had to react quickly

405
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:57,640
So we moved right into green light to utilize that momentum

406
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:04,624
We probably came into Greenlight earlier than we would have expected, like maybe a few weeks.

407
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:09,928
But we rushed into it knowing that, or thinking anyway, that well, it's going to be in Greenlight

408
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:14,712
for a while, we have everything that we can show right now, there's already people around

409
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:16,853
playing the game, this is smart.

410
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:21,697
And instead of making a trailer to be as efficient as possible, we actually took

411
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:28,760
a trailer or a let's play from YouTube that I really liked and use that as our trailer

412
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,901
on Greenlight.

413
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:36,064
And I'll get more into this with YouTube later, but this was kind of a perfect video for us.

414
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:40,226
It was made by a guy named Metallics and he did lots of videos on Slime Rancher.

415
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:45,388
But this is really what you want to look for if you're looking to curate YouTube videos.

416
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:48,250
It's someone being entertaining and informative.

417
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:51,459
and kind of showing your game in a really good light.

418
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:55,711
So this is the first 30 seconds or so of that video.

419
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:03,398
Hello, dissinters, and good morning to you.

420
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:05,079
Welcome to The Ranch.

421
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,860
This is Slime Rancher.

422
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,720
It's a game due out in 2016.

423
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,263
No set release date or price so far as I can tell.

424
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:15,225
But I have the opportunity to give you a sneak peek

425
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:18,207
into an in-development build of Slime Rancher,

426
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,808
and I am really happy to do so,

427
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:22,689
much like these pink slimes bouncing around.

428
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:25,451
These guys, you're not supposed to be out here.

429
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:27,392
Get back in the backpack.

430
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,603
That's what this cut is for.

431
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:32,467
Where it attached to my back like a backpack is the backpack

432
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:35,512
and we gotta take these guys to a safe place

433
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:37,996
because we're charged not just with protecting

434
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:42,262
these little slimes, but also ensuring their profitability.

435
00:24:43,907 --> 00:24:46,629
So that was our first big video.

436
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:49,832
And that's what kind of helped us take off.

437
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:53,034
A really important thing to note in this is he's just

438
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,716
explaining the game, and he's being entertaining.

439
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:59,739
I know there's a temptation to have your video in front of

440
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:01,761
someone who kind of like screams at a game and is

441
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,782
really funny and has tons of.

442
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,765
subscribers, and we'll take that too.

443
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:12,488
But in a lot of ways, that isn't even as useful to us

444
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:13,468
as a video like this, who at the time,

445
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:15,850
I think he had like 125,000 subscribers or something.

446
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,593
And the reason for that is, I think when you're someone

447
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:24,975
who screams at a game you're playing on YouTube,

448
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:27,757
your audience is largely coming to see you scream

449
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:29,558
and see that personality.

450
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:33,601
with Italics, the way he does his videos,

451
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:37,423
I could definitely see people wanting to come to that,

452
00:25:37,423 --> 00:25:40,705
to subscribe to him in order to learn about new games

453
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,125
and get his take on it.

454
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,487
I think there's a huge difference there.

455
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:48,329
So our early access plans after we were greenlit

456
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:51,411
were we outlined them and we said small updates,

457
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:53,232
big ones we'll announce

458
00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:54,933
and they'll be worth coming back to play.

459
00:25:55,393 --> 00:25:58,054
And we expect people would walk away.

460
00:25:58,054 --> 00:25:59,874
In fact, we told them to walk away.

461
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:03,415
There was some great advice by a guy from Bioware once

462
00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:06,557
that said with your MMO, let people walk away,

463
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:08,417
just don't let them quit.

464
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,198
But give them natural breaks in it

465
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:12,318
because you're never gonna have someone stay entertained

466
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:14,539
for like the 10 years that you hope to run this game.

467
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,660
We said we were a small team, updates would take time,

468
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,202
and this hinged on players understanding development,

469
00:26:22,202 --> 00:26:23,382
which was our big mistake.

470
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:29,987
So then, early access reality, players complained if updates were too infrequent or too small.

471
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:38,533
YouTubers who were actively making videos at the time needed a very clear signal as to when to come back and make videos.

472
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:43,257
No one is going to come back to your game and make a video about balance changes,

473
00:26:43,257 --> 00:26:49,841
unless it's a guy who makes videos about competitive games and those would have a really huge impact on the game experience.

474
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,464
You have to give them something meaty.

475
00:26:52,464 --> 00:26:54,487
We realized that we needed a new strategy,

476
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,370
and we actually turned to our MMO development experience.

477
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:01,174
Both Mike and I worked at Three Rings and Sega

478
00:27:01,174 --> 00:27:04,318
on Spiral Knights and Puzzle Pirates,

479
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:06,240
and so we started looking at, well,

480
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,223
how did we keep players engaged with something like that?

481
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:13,981
So the new approach was treating early access development like a running, released, live game.

482
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,724
It was no longer in development to us, it had shipped.

483
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:22,430
The big updates became like content updates in an MMO,

484
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,173
and it had an effect on sales in YouTube when we promoted this.

485
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:31,657
It was a change of messaging and it resulted in changing, like, waiting for the developers

486
00:27:31,657 --> 00:27:37,060
to, like, get off their asses and release new content into hype for this new update.

487
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:42,524
All updates, like the one we're coming out with next week, are centered around a core

488
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:47,767
piece of content that we can take pictures of and kind of wrap that as, like, this is

489
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,168
the thing you should be excited about.

490
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:51,829
not a list of things that include balance changes,

491
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:54,310
everything, people find out about that in the patch notes.

492
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,852
We don't care about that in terms of messaging.

493
00:27:57,852 --> 00:28:03,615
Which leads me to my somewhat provocative takeaway.

494
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,996
That early access doesn't work,

495
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:08,278
or at least not as intended.

496
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:09,739
And so let me unpack that.

497
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:11,620
This is what you might expect.

498
00:28:12,131 --> 00:28:15,193
that players are going to join the devs on a magical journey in game development

499
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,515
and everything is okay because it's all in development and everyone understands

500
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:20,015
that and they get the memo

501
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:23,377
that it's in development and things might change

502
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:28,420
and that's normal but the cold reality

503
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,723
is that players expect regular content updates yesterday

504
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:36,725
and this is important. The second point is that

505
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:40,487
if your game is in development in early access

506
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:49,154
Two players, they will think that anything is still possible.

507
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:54,759
So a big feature that they think would make your game great and gets talked about a lot

508
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:59,203
on the forums and that, that is still a possibility to them, even if you tell them otherwise.

509
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:01,324
And the reason is, it's still in development.

510
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:07,228
If you ship a 1.0 version of your game to Steam, it doesn't have that early access tag.

511
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:11,810
Players might say, for example, that multiplayer would make this game a lot better.

512
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:15,072
Maybe they'll add that in DLC down the road.

513
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:20,755
But when it's in development, there is a completely different kind of mindset, and that is, they

514
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:25,257
are along for the journey to make their suggestions, and they expect that some of these are going

515
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:29,219
to make it in, and also you'd be crazy not to add this in the final game.

516
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:29,640
And also...

517
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,662
it might not be worth the money you're asking for if you don't add this in the final game.

518
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:37,224
And that's something that you really have to be aware of.

519
00:29:37,224 --> 00:29:39,925
So, additionally, if when you... I love this,

520
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:42,107
if someone says, I understand it's early access,

521
00:29:42,107 --> 00:29:45,528
but they're about to say something where they don't understand that it's their, you know,

522
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:47,850
the development and everything.

523
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,950
But you'll see that a ton.

524
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,553
And then players actually dislike changes, however small.

525
00:29:53,553 --> 00:29:55,974
You've probably seen this in a number of early access games

526
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:58,596
where a big new feature was added that kind of...

527
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:02,218
fundamentally change either, fundamentally changes the game

528
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,619
or the feature within the game.

529
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:05,860
Players don't like that.

530
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,161
And I kind of get it,

531
00:30:07,161 --> 00:30:08,982
they've already paid money for your game.

532
00:30:08,982 --> 00:30:12,544
So they expect that it's what they paid for

533
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,705
and it's not a development journey.

534
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:16,326
I'll give you a great example of changes

535
00:30:16,326 --> 00:30:17,507
that they don't like.

536
00:30:17,507 --> 00:30:19,908
This was our, this is our pink slime on the left.

537
00:30:19,908 --> 00:30:21,589
There's something called a puddle slime in the game

538
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,090
and when we first shipped,

539
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,652
they were literally a huge shift on the pink slimes.

540
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,921
It was very obviously temp.

541
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:32,824
The new Puddle Slime, much to the chagrin of a lot of players,

542
00:30:32,824 --> 00:30:34,706
looked like a puddle.

543
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:36,067
And it was a new model.

544
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,388
It had fancy new graphics and everything.

545
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:38,148
They're adorable.

546
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:40,210
They even blush when there's too many slimes around,

547
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,751
because they're super shy.

548
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:42,692
They're one of my favorites.

549
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:46,054
But to this day, there are little petitions

550
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,236
to bring back the original Puddle Slime.

551
00:30:48,236 --> 00:30:51,078
And it's because at the time, those folks paid money

552
00:30:51,078 --> 00:30:53,780
and got the blue smiley slime, and they

553
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,121
wanted to keep it that way.

554
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,221
So the takeaway here is that releasing into early access

555
00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:00,901
is releasing your game, period.

556
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,062
There is really no exceptions to this.

557
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,823
An early access game should be treated like a live game

558
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,523
with content updates that drive excitement.

559
00:31:09,523 --> 00:31:11,264
This might mean changing your development style.

560
00:31:11,264 --> 00:31:12,704
It did for us.

561
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,765
Fortunately, we were able to revert to a style

562
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:17,985
that we're really familiar with had we not had that experience.

563
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:20,026
I don't know.

564
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:23,248
But excitement equals more YouTube videos and more sales.

565
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,729
We've seen this with every time we've done a major release,

566
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:27,389
it happens.

567
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:29,290
Big spike, good tail, we're in good shape.

568
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,232
So speaking of players and their thoughts on the game,

569
00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:37,494
let's do a quick review roundup, because I

570
00:31:37,494 --> 00:31:38,854
feel like a lot of the points here are

571
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:40,915
very relevant to early access.

572
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:46,237
The positive reviews for Slime Rancher typically mention these four things,

573
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:51,739
the slime animations and personality. This is where you could really score with your game

574
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:58,762
because I feel like a lot of actors in video games, like the entities that are in there,

575
00:31:58,762 --> 00:32:05,104
lack personality and a lot of that is not really a fault of the developer, it's that the...

576
00:32:05,885 --> 00:32:10,167
those actors are centered usually around the player's death.

577
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,108
So they're very focused in what they're doing.

578
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:15,210
Slimes are totally unfocused in what they do,

579
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,872
and it allows them to kind of breathe in a space

580
00:32:18,872 --> 00:32:22,774
and exhibit behaviors that are really pleasing to look at.

581
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,876
So it's something to keep in mind.

582
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:29,198
I think, going back to the wonderful folks at Bungie,

583
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:33,240
I think everyone remembers the cast of villains

584
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,941
from that game.

585
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:38,363
a lot more than other games because of their behaviors, like when the grunts would freak

586
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:44,347
out and decide it was all over and pull out two grenades and run at Master Chief.

587
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:51,291
That was just not only fed into the gameplay, but it was unexpected and it gave those characters

588
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:56,214
some personality as opposed to the million soldiers that you're just shooting from behind

589
00:32:56,214 --> 00:32:56,494
cover.

590
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:00,958
Exploration and discovery-based.

591
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:03,301
It's all discovery-based learning,

592
00:33:03,301 --> 00:33:04,682
and players really respond to that.

593
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,045
And I think this is a trend that we're

594
00:33:07,045 --> 00:33:13,112
seeing happen in the game industry in general,

595
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:14,854
probably starting with Dark Souls,

596
00:33:14,854 --> 00:33:16,476
with people becoming really aware of this,

597
00:33:16,476 --> 00:33:18,418
where it's like, hey, you don't need to make.

598
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:21,800
golden breadcrumbs leading everywhere.

599
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,743
And it's happy, and most games, I'm sorry,

600
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:26,404
just aren't happy.

601
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:30,067
And then also that it's a chill or zen game.

602
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:30,988
People say that a lot.

603
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:33,570
And the funny thing about that is we never set out

604
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,771
to make that kind of game.

605
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:45,659
I guess think about that for your next game, when the pressure is kind of off and you just

606
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:52,483
have this opportunity to kind of relax in a game space and still be entertained, rather

607
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:57,647
than just stopping the killing to check your inventory or something like that.

608
00:33:57,647 --> 00:34:02,050
But in Slime Ranch you could stop and just observe and the slimes are going to kind of

609
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,912
entertain you and I think that's important.

610
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:05,873
Now the fun part.

611
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,196
with negative reviews.

612
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:13,038
This is something I'm a little sensitive about,

613
00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:14,538
but that is a $20 price tag.

614
00:34:14,538 --> 00:34:18,180
We frequently see folks saying that indie games

615
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,901
should be no more than $15.

616
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:21,961
That still exists, and again, I think.

617
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:26,622
games are being released that are pushing that back a little bit.

618
00:34:26,622 --> 00:34:30,202
But that's something that you're going to have to live with.

619
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:35,003
I don't know if we would have made as much money at 15 versus 20.

620
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:37,504
I think for us, I stand by the $20 price tag,

621
00:34:37,504 --> 00:34:42,305
because even though a lot of negative reviews say lack of content,

622
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:43,585
the average play time is 12 hours.

623
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:48,486
And for many, many players, it is way above that.

624
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,266
So for me, that's a pretty good $20.

625
00:34:52,107 --> 00:34:53,388
It can't run on their system.

626
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:55,250
You're going to run in this problem all the time.

627
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,352
This is not really new, but it's worth pointing out.

628
00:34:57,352 --> 00:35:00,455
We get so many Chromebooks that are trying to play

629
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:01,216
Slime Rancher.

630
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:06,301
And specifically, though, with Slime Rancher, it's that it

631
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:07,462
has colorful graphics.

632
00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:10,646
We will get support responses that say, but it's cartoony.

633
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:14,009
I thought you don't need a good card to run a cartoony

634
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:14,370
game.

635
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:18,176
Okay, so the last thing is that there's no multiplayer

636
00:35:18,176 --> 00:35:19,817
and pretty much every game in existence

637
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:20,977
that doesn't have multiplayer

638
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:23,519
probably gets this as a complaint.

639
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:25,059
And so, you know, we're thinking about it,

640
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:26,220
but we're not sure it's possible.

641
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:31,042
One more thing is your negative reviews

642
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:33,423
are gonna stick around from early access.

643
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,044
So if you have an early access game

644
00:35:35,044 --> 00:35:36,845
and you're missing a giant feature

645
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:40,547
that is core to the experience,

646
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:41,947
don't release your game yet

647
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:43,648
because all those negative reviews that say,

648
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:48,833
all it is is crafting right now and they haven't added the exploration element of the game

649
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:49,654
are going to stick around.

650
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:53,117
And the ones that everyone agrees to are super helpful.

651
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:57,161
That is going to sit there at the top of the heap forever.

652
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:58,582
So you have to live with that.

653
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:03,447
You should ship your early access game in a state where it's going to feel like the

654
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:05,449
final product, largely.

655
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:07,051
It doesn't mean it's content complete.

656
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:10,493
but it shouldn't be a racing game missing its wheels, so to speak.

657
00:36:10,493 --> 00:36:13,875
Like, you gotta make sure that the, you know, at least for me,

658
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:20,058
I want these reviews to reflect the kind of game that I think I made,

659
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:23,560
not the one that I'm promising to people.

660
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,042
So next we're gonna get into YouTube,

661
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:29,524
because that was a huge aspect of our success.

662
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:32,866
We're gonna talk about Slime Rancher's YouTube success,

663
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:35,167
why it works on YouTube, what else works on YouTube.

664
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:40,092
And as you know, streaming and YouTube plus the internet is free marketing.

665
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:41,593
Probably everyone is saying that.

666
00:36:41,593 --> 00:36:45,476
And you just have to be comfortable with people making really weird faces while they play

667
00:36:45,476 --> 00:36:46,576
your game.

668
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:50,359
It's the strangest sort of ambassador for this thing that you did that I've ever seen,

669
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:52,741
but you just got to get used to it.

670
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:55,503
Slime Rancher on YouTube, it's a big hit on YouTube.

671
00:36:55,503 --> 00:36:57,444
We get over a million views a week.

672
00:36:57,804 --> 00:37:01,386
and when we do big releases we'll get a lot more than that.

673
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,167
YouTube is our de facto marketing.

674
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:06,088
We generally we don't go to shows.

675
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:08,810
We don't have a PR person or anything like that.

676
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,851
We completely leverage YouTube.

677
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:14,192
We do have some Twitch presence, but it's very bursty.

678
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:16,353
YouTube works way better for us

679
00:37:16,353 --> 00:37:20,315
because we can get video series and things like that.

680
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:21,536
And we don't buy YouTube coverage.

681
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,357
I know you can do that.

682
00:37:22,677 --> 00:37:24,498
And I've had people ask me about that.

683
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:26,840
I don't know really a lot about that.

684
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,482
I guess if someone else is paying for it, you should do it.

685
00:37:29,482 --> 00:37:33,245
If you have a publisher who wants to buy YouTube coverage, go for it.

686
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:36,267
But I think if you're on your own, and especially money is tight,

687
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:43,112
like it was with us, just have it naturally go up the chain.

688
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:44,473
I'll explain in a minute here.

689
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:48,336
This is why I think Slime Rancher works on YouTube.

690
00:37:48,336 --> 00:37:50,078
Slimes have charisma, they're fun to watch.

691
00:37:50,078 --> 00:37:52,700
The action happens towards the camera.

692
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,442
This is super important.

693
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:58,925
That when someone is watching the game,

694
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:00,766
the game is kind of watching them back.

695
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,292
and I think that contributes to it being fun.

696
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:06,095
It's discovery-based learning.

697
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:09,320
The audience observations feel rewarding.

698
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,381
So much is happening on the screen,

699
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:13,326
a lot of times the audience might see something

700
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:15,990
that the player didn't or the host of the Let's Play didn't.

701
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:19,273
and there's lots of unpredictable events that keep it fresh

702
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:21,934
and customization features that make videos unique.

703
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:25,056
That's really important because it will make someone

704
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:28,158
seek out other videos of your game

705
00:38:28,158 --> 00:38:32,841
versus happen to watch other subscribers

706
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:34,061
that they are subscribed to

707
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,163
that happen to be playing your game.

708
00:38:36,163 --> 00:38:39,945
So if I follow these two YouTubers

709
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,746
and they're both doing a series on Slime Ranch,

710
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:43,987
I'll probably watch both because I like both of them

711
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,448
and I wanna see how they interpret the game.

712
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:51,111
But if there's customization and I get a clue from watching the video

713
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:54,452
or anything that makes another video possibly unique,

714
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:58,354
I might find another YouTuber that is showing off Slime Ranch

715
00:38:58,354 --> 00:38:59,834
and want to find out how they did their thing.

716
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:04,437
So how this could apply to your game is what else works on YouTube?

717
00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:08,681
I think games that allow you to start projects are super valuable

718
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:11,162
because that creates a video series.

719
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:12,503
Many videos are better than one,

720
00:39:12,503 --> 00:39:17,347
especially because at some point the viewer gets invested, they want to finish it.

721
00:39:17,347 --> 00:39:18,868
So if your game has something where...

722
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:23,111
The YouTuber is saying, so this is day three of us building our lava fortress.

723
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,854
And as you can see, we're blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

724
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:28,335
You know, that really works.

725
00:39:28,335 --> 00:39:29,376
Because that's going to take time.

726
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:30,657
And it's going to be slow.

727
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:33,720
And it's going to get you a lot of coverage.

728
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,041
Games that leave the audience with a question to answer.

729
00:39:36,302 --> 00:39:38,784
Detective stories are like the greatest stories ever

730
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:41,145
because there's always that question.

731
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,747
So survival and exploring the unknown,

732
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,868
it's no surprise that survival games are big

733
00:39:44,868 --> 00:39:46,550
because there's this open question of,

734
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,171
will this guy survive?

735
00:39:48,171 --> 00:39:50,493
It seems super basic, but it's true

736
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:54,396
versus anything that kind of has a foregone conclusion to it.

737
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:58,791
Anything that prompts interaction with the audience, if you're ever here, let me know

738
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:00,452
in the comments what I should do next.

739
00:40:00,452 --> 00:40:05,835
That's awesome because they're going to be checking what players are saying about the

740
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:10,998
game and generally speaking, they're always positive on it because they like this person

741
00:40:10,998 --> 00:40:14,401
to begin with and so they're happy that they're playing this new game.

742
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:17,803
They're saying, oh my goodness, go farm phosphor slimes or something like that.

743
00:40:18,343 --> 00:40:21,284
So it gets them prompted to do another video.

744
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:25,125
And then games that leave the audience with something to try on their own.

745
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:28,106
So this is where Uncharted doesn't really work.

746
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:33,788
If it's just a linear experience, there's really no reason for me to go out and buy the game on my own.

747
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:37,709
You want there to be a reason for me to run out and try it myself.

748
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:40,991
So some additional YouTube thoughts.

749
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:43,632
I wouldn't consider developing a game that isn't YouTube friendly.

750
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:44,853
Period.

751
00:40:44,853 --> 00:40:48,055
Make it easy for people to request keys.

752
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:51,057
Using Keymailer, Promoter App, Distribute, those are all really great.

753
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,618
The best thing about those is they confirm identity.

754
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,799
You're going to get a lot of people trying to...

755
00:40:55,139 --> 00:41:00,745
scam you out of your game and really don't sweat that early on, give it away for free early on. Steam keys are free.

756
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:07,092
So just, you know, give it give it out until you can get some momentum and then be more selective. We basically just have a

757
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,934
subscriber

758
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:12,818
limit at any given time which would guarantee that person a key or not.

759
00:41:13,379 --> 00:41:17,102
And then games will move up the YouTube food chain,

760
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:18,183
we totally see this.

761
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:21,946
So the people at the very top of the heap on YouTube

762
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:26,810
are subscribed to the people that are just below them.

763
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,790
And so on and so on and so on.

764
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:32,014
So as long as you can kind of get a snowball effect started

765
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:33,695
it's going to naturally move up the chain

766
00:41:33,695 --> 00:41:35,717
assuming your game is good and fun to watch

767
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:39,440
and it's getting lots of views.

768
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,682
So you don't have to worry about like,

769
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:43,023
oh my goodness, I gotta get PewDiePie

770
00:41:43,023 --> 00:41:45,525
like on day one or something like that.

771
00:41:45,525 --> 00:41:47,968
We got our biggest, like when we had Markiplier

772
00:41:47,968 --> 00:41:49,589
and Jacksepticeye and all those people doing videos,

773
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:50,690
we never talked to them.

774
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,692
We just assumed that it trickled up.

775
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:55,715
And then I went and dug through all the videos

776
00:41:55,715 --> 00:41:58,397
and indeed, it was like the tier before

777
00:41:58,397 --> 00:42:00,599
and the tier before separated by like a week.

778
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,341
You know, everyone's catching up on each other's content.

779
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:03,622
They go, they find the video,

780
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,084
they make their videos on their own.

781
00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:09,969
And also videos get about 10% views to subs in about three days time.

782
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:17,376
So use that as basically your impression value for when you're determining whether or not

783
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:20,539
it's worth it to give your $20 game away to someone.

784
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:21,681
You know, it's about 10%.

785
00:42:23,671 --> 00:42:27,713
So the takeaway is YouTube and streaming is the best way to market your game.

786
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:30,754
Being YouTube friendly will give your game a much higher chance of success.

787
00:42:30,754 --> 00:42:37,438
This seems super obvious, but as I just detailed, there is kind of a little bit smarter way

788
00:42:37,438 --> 00:42:41,079
of approaching this, and your game has to be kind of a good fit for it anyway.

789
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,844
If it is a puzzle game that takes place just on a single screen, you have a much harder

790
00:42:47,844 --> 00:42:54,410
battle than someone who has something that is scaring the YouTuber or something.

791
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,932
Hopefully none of this seems too crass.

792
00:42:57,932 --> 00:42:59,994
It's just the reality right now.

793
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:04,717
If this were 15 years ago, maybe I'd be talking about best way to get a commercial deal through

794
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:10,042
your publisher or something, but this is way easier and way cheaper, so should do that.

795
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:14,290
Anyway, in summary, be better than anyone.

796
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,191
Don't be limited by your constraints.

797
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:16,931
Embrace them.

798
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:18,873
Pep talk kind of stuff.

799
00:43:18,873 --> 00:43:20,654
Don't compete with established games and genres,

800
00:43:20,654 --> 00:43:22,054
especially as an indie.

801
00:43:22,054 --> 00:43:23,675
I feel like that's suicide.

802
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:25,997
And then invent your own Calvin Ball.

803
00:43:25,997 --> 00:43:28,638
And Calvin Ball does not have to be Katamari.

804
00:43:28,638 --> 00:43:31,720
Calvin Ball can be Rocket League, which is just

805
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,501
replace the people with cars.

806
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:35,662
I mean, that's perfect.

807
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:40,704
because we know how to drive, we know soccer, it just works.

808
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:42,244
So that's a great example of that.

809
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:48,426
Prototype for success, Slime Rancher focused entirely on that 90% loop early on.

810
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:52,887
We tested it as a complete game and it allows us to be very confident early on in our design.

811
00:43:52,887 --> 00:43:57,989
That is super important going back again to two years of sitting in an apartment and no one's paying you.

812
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:01,890
To be as confident as we were that we really had something is meaningful.

813
00:44:02,491 --> 00:44:07,335
One, because it actually gives you the energy to just keep going day in and day out.

814
00:44:07,335 --> 00:44:14,482
And two, because it felt like, you know, we were actually building towards something as

815
00:44:14,482 --> 00:44:17,084
opposed to like we're just living in the unknown every day.

816
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:21,448
That would be terrifying, so avoid doing that as much as you can.

817
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:27,591
Next, to make your game a shark, shark features inform the core design.

818
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:30,332
Pug features are nice to have but not essential and bloat your game.

819
00:44:30,332 --> 00:44:33,174
Nothing against pugs, add pug features later.

820
00:44:33,174 --> 00:44:36,255
It's fine, just don't do that in the beginning.

821
00:44:36,255 --> 00:44:40,517
Shark design is more focused and cheaper to develop because you're only adding these sort

822
00:44:40,517 --> 00:44:44,579
of lean, mean things that feed directly into your core design.

823
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:51,768
ensuring that the player is going to be experiencing it regularly and you're going to get great feedback on that.

824
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:55,833
Don't add stuff that, like, they're going to be doing 10% of the time.

825
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:58,816
So, next is Early Access is a live game.

826
00:44:58,816 --> 00:45:04,223
Players expect regular content updates, build updates around exciting stuff, and generate hype.

827
00:45:04,564 --> 00:45:08,446
I know sometimes you want to be quiet, especially when you're developing a game, but you're

828
00:45:08,446 --> 00:45:09,847
selling a game.

829
00:45:09,847 --> 00:45:10,988
Don't fool yourself.

830
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:12,589
You've sold a game.

831
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:16,912
It's up to you now to effectively market it, and you're marketing your development.

832
00:45:16,912 --> 00:45:20,755
So make a big deal out of all the hard work that you're putting in.

833
00:45:20,755 --> 00:45:24,657
Build up to a monthly release, and then go for broke with it.

834
00:45:24,657 --> 00:45:28,200
Just keep trumpeting your achievements.

835
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,082
This may require restructuring how you would otherwise develop your game.

836
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:37,630
YouTube and Twitch, there are qualities and game designs that are YouTube friendly, there

837
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:43,053
are some that are not, and for those folks, you just have a harder battle, because a lot

838
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:46,895
of attention is driven by YouTube these days.

839
00:45:46,895 --> 00:45:52,178
Audiences want to feel engaged, not just a spectator, and make it easy to request keys,

840
00:45:52,178 --> 00:45:54,059
but just give them a way to start.

841
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:58,241
Can't stress this enough, I see a lot of developers on Twitter that are complaining about their

842
00:45:58,241 --> 00:46:01,863
game that not a lot of people know about, how they fooled another scammer.

843
00:46:02,364 --> 00:46:03,465
Like, what are you doing?

844
00:46:03,465 --> 00:46:04,846
That scammer has a friends list.

845
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:05,727
Give him a Steam key.

846
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:09,531
There's a viral mechanism in Steam and on Xbox and that's what it's there for.

847
00:46:09,531 --> 00:46:16,198
The only way that that isn't going to happen is if they sold it and it got lost or something

848
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:18,581
or I don't know what, but either way, it's a Steam key.

849
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:22,305
It gets activated on Steam and unless it's getting activated on a dummy account to be

850
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:23,366
sold later or something.

851
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:25,047
you're fine.

852
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:27,168
They have friends who will see that they're playing that,

853
00:46:27,168 --> 00:46:28,269
they're gonna look at the store page

854
00:46:28,269 --> 00:46:30,710
and you're probably gonna get a sale out of it.

855
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:32,471
Once you're established, don't just give it away

856
00:46:32,471 --> 00:46:34,272
because then there's like, you know,

857
00:46:34,272 --> 00:46:37,654
the word gets out and no one's gonna wanna buy your game

858
00:46:37,654 --> 00:46:39,675
because the developers just give it away for free.

859
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:41,316
But absolutely do not be skittish

860
00:46:41,316 --> 00:46:42,677
about giving that game away.

861
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:45,419
And if it's ahead of Steam, if you're not on Steam yet,

862
00:46:45,419 --> 00:46:47,140
make it small enough and just available

863
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,001
for download somewhere, give it away.

864
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:52,583
Even sometimes like we did, we had this little bit of

865
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:54,044
kind of air of secrecy around it,

866
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:55,365
because we hadn't really announced it yet.

867
00:46:55,365 --> 00:46:57,127
And that really, I think, helped generate hype

868
00:46:57,127 --> 00:46:58,528
between the people that were trading it.

869
00:46:58,528 --> 00:46:59,949
They were like, what the hell is this game?

870
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:03,512
What is this game is a very potent question.

871
00:47:03,512 --> 00:47:07,515
So use that to your advantage when you're unknown.

872
00:47:07,515 --> 00:47:09,116
That's it, thank you very much.

873
00:47:09,116 --> 00:47:11,058
I'll do some Q and A now.

874
00:47:15,325 --> 00:47:21,548
It seems I have a little extra time too. So because I finished a little early, I'm going to

875
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:26,971
show a trailer for our next update that's coming out next week. So just brace yourself.

876
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,192
Thank you very much. So if anyone has any questions, just go ahead and line up. No? Hi.

877
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:26,797
Hey. So you had some really good sort of warning critique on early access. Knowing kind

878
00:48:26,797 --> 00:48:35,382
of what you know now, would you do early access again? Is there some positives to it? Or

879
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:40,144
would you just go straight to like a full launch? So would we do early access again?

880
00:48:41,967 --> 00:48:50,632
right now in the position that we're in, I would probably say no. Only because we can. But at the

881
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:56,036
time early access was absolutely the thing that allowed us to do what we did. We're on year

882
00:48:57,677 --> 00:49:00,780
three and change of Slime Rancher development.

883
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,902
So two years into it, when we first released it,

884
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:06,345
we really needed to do that.

885
00:49:06,345 --> 00:49:08,907
Getting those initial sales absolutely helped.

886
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:12,290
So I'm not trying to demonize early access in any way,

887
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:15,633
but if we could and just come out with something

888
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:17,595
and say this is us, this is our new thing,

889
00:49:17,595 --> 00:49:19,076
I would probably do that.

890
00:49:19,076 --> 00:49:22,159
That said, I'm used to developing games

891
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,380
over a long period of time.

892
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:29,343
So if we didn't do early access, we would probably still ship something that is smaller

893
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:34,205
than it would be in two years, perhaps considerably smaller than it would be in two years.

894
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:38,927
And that really is just the reality of game development these days.

895
00:49:38,927 --> 00:49:44,689
I mean, name a single game that isn't, you know, maybe a really small indie game or something

896
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:47,170
that doesn't have content later on.

897
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,052
It's just, that's I think just what players expect these days, you know.

898
00:49:51,552 --> 00:49:57,556
oh, season pass, it's miserable, but why doesn't this game have a season pass? What is it dead on

899
00:49:57,556 --> 00:50:05,762
arrival? They want it both ways. So, yeah. Hi. I wanted to ask, so with putting out large chunks

900
00:50:05,762 --> 00:50:15,488
instead of small bits and breadcrumbs along the way, is there a fear ever of the risk behind

901
00:50:15,488 --> 00:50:20,132
like this could not work or how is that maybe handled preemptively?

902
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:23,532
Well, going back to what I was saying earlier,

903
00:50:23,532 --> 00:50:26,574
we just know the game is fun at this point.

904
00:50:26,574 --> 00:50:29,536
So our reviews tend to say that.

905
00:50:29,536 --> 00:50:32,818
So when we add new stuff, as long

906
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:35,700
as it's in that sort of same wheelhouse as what we've

907
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,062
already done, we're much more confident about that.

908
00:50:38,062 --> 00:50:41,244
Our Slime Science update, which was completely unlike anything

909
00:50:41,244 --> 00:50:42,525
that we had done up to that point,

910
00:50:42,525 --> 00:50:43,946
we were super nervous about that.

911
00:50:43,946 --> 00:50:47,309
We were like, this, you know, they're, um.

912
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:51,892
People are going to see this and go, this isn't the game that I bought.

913
00:50:51,892 --> 00:50:54,074
Like, there's like crafting now and everything.

914
00:50:54,074 --> 00:50:55,955
You know, it's not for me.

915
00:50:55,955 --> 00:50:57,436
That wasn't the case.

916
00:50:57,436 --> 00:51:02,540
But we very deliberately hid that, depending on your play time,

917
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,862
several hours into the experience.

918
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:10,446
We, at this point, kind of don't touch our first hour of the game.

919
00:51:10,786 --> 00:51:15,733
There might be a few additional things down the road, but we feel like the first hour works,

920
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:20,519
and so we're just backing away quietly and all other things are going to come later.

921
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:26,287
So, but we do rigorously test it, and as I said in my emergent storytelling talk,

922
00:51:26,287 --> 00:51:28,610
we just kind of dial everything back from broken.

923
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:32,813
So we know at the very least, like, whatever we're releasing is kind of firing on all cylinders,

924
00:51:32,813 --> 00:51:35,074
and, you know, people seem to like that.

925
00:51:35,074 --> 00:51:42,659
So this one in particular, the quantum slimes are like generating other realities of themselves at all times,

926
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:48,183
and if they get agitated enough, they will decide that that reality is more favorable than their current reality,

927
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:51,685
and dismiss the other realities and join with... I mean, it's a nightmare.

928
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:58,009
And it might be the end of us, but it's going to be a lot of fun to find that out.

929
00:51:58,009 --> 00:52:01,911
And so far in testing, it's okay, but it's really close to that.

930
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:02,892
So we'll learn.

931
00:52:02,892 --> 00:52:05,313
But that's why we're in early access.

932
00:52:05,313 --> 00:52:05,513
So...

933
00:52:05,513 --> 00:52:06,354
Awesome.

934
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:06,814
Thank you.

935
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:09,633
Thank you, great talk.

936
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:14,377
And you mentioned the performing toward the camera,

937
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:16,399
so as you watch and what,

938
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:19,902
could you tell me a little bit about how you did it

939
00:52:19,902 --> 00:52:24,066
so that when the player watch and play the game,

940
00:52:24,066 --> 00:52:26,188
it actually really performing toward the camera?

941
00:52:26,486 --> 00:52:31,027
Right, yeah, so explain more about how we developed this whole

942
00:52:31,027 --> 00:52:32,767
towards the camera kind of gameplay.

943
00:52:32,767 --> 00:52:36,408
It was the vac pack is a vacuum, so to begin with,

944
00:52:36,408 --> 00:52:37,668
things are going to be coming at the camera.

945
00:52:37,668 --> 00:52:41,989
But there was a key moment early on in development where, initially,

946
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:44,889
when slimes and other things would vac towards the camera,

947
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:48,270
they just did in the state that they happened to be in at the time.

948
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:51,551
And we made one little change, which said,

949
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:52,451
when you start vaccing a slime in,

950
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:57,273
you know, a frame or two, they snap and face the camera and go,

951
00:52:57,273 --> 00:52:58,133
woo!

952
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,154
You know, when they do, like, I wasn't expecting that.

953
00:53:00,154 --> 00:53:05,436
And that made the thing that a player is doing, you know,

954
00:53:05,436 --> 00:53:09,278
50 times every couple of minutes, like, way more intimate.

955
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:15,322
and it showed that the slimes weren't really afraid of you,

956
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:19,445
they were surprised, but I think eyes towards the screen,

957
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:22,166
especially in a first person game, is really key.

958
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,448
And in most games you just don't get that

959
00:53:24,448 --> 00:53:28,050
because you're taking someone out from a distance

960
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,052
or you're engaged in combat

961
00:53:31,052 --> 00:53:32,973
and so you're not necessarily looking at that

962
00:53:32,973 --> 00:53:35,194
and they have no real reason to interact with you

963
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:35,635
on that level.

964
00:53:35,975 --> 00:53:42,221
But we, you know, the tabby slimes boop the nose of the player.

965
00:53:42,221 --> 00:53:43,482
We just thought that was silly.

966
00:53:43,482 --> 00:53:48,727
But it also informs, like, the game design in that it's potentially a hazard if the tabby

967
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:50,689
happens to be spiky because it merged with a...

968
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:56,353
rock slime. So it's all of those things that are just saying like

969
00:53:56,353 --> 00:54:02,017
this is the player's eyes and we want to do as much stuff as possible in order to make that fun.

970
00:54:02,017 --> 00:54:07,561
And also things that are happening without the player

971
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:10,884
acting on something like the boop. That kind of takes people by

972
00:54:10,884 --> 00:54:16,208
surprise and it's because they weren't seeking it out. But it's a harmless interaction so the more

973
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:19,410
stuff like that that you can do I think the better.

974
00:54:21,288 --> 00:54:25,950
Hi. So I was wondering, um, Slime Rancher is actually one of the few games on

975
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:30,833
Steam I've played that was kid friendly. And I know a few companies have been

976
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:35,195
like kind of battling, um, the YouTube content because it was like had a lot of

977
00:54:35,195 --> 00:54:38,857
swearing and a lot of mature content. Do you think that hurts Slime Rancher's

978
00:54:38,857 --> 00:54:40,698
image at all? I was wondering.

979
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:48,886
I don't think so, because I mean, I think it's up to parents to make sure that they're not watching.

980
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:55,471
So, I'm sorry, the question was, do we think like YouTubers who are swearing through a Slime Rancher Let's Play hurts our image?

981
00:54:55,471 --> 00:54:58,133
You really have no control over that.

982
00:54:58,133 --> 00:55:01,856
So, I think it's up to parents to make sure that they're not watching a YouTuber that...

983
00:55:02,296 --> 00:55:03,797
is known for that.

984
00:55:03,797 --> 00:55:07,961
But I still think that half of the reasons someone shows up

985
00:55:07,961 --> 00:55:12,165
for YouTube to watch a Let's Play tends to be for that

986
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:13,446
person.

987
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:15,167
It's probably more than half.

988
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:18,590
So we're kind of fine to let them swear through it.

989
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,533
I mean, there's times I swear at Slime Ranchers, so I think

990
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:24,696
that's acceptable.

991
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:29,217
Guys like italics who keep it clean and stay informative.

992
00:55:29,217 --> 00:55:31,178
I think maybe that's more for kids.

993
00:55:31,178 --> 00:55:34,440
But we don't think it's hurt the image, because I don't

994
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,701
think a lot of times those demographics cross

995
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:37,422
over too much anyway.

996
00:55:37,422 --> 00:55:40,183
So kids that are watching kid-friendly content on

997
00:55:40,183 --> 00:55:41,024
YouTube probably.

998
00:55:41,564 --> 00:55:43,986
aren't even being exposed to that.

999
00:55:43,986 --> 00:55:47,128
And at the end of the day, there's a talking head.

1000
00:55:47,128 --> 00:55:50,231
It's not usually coming from nowhere.

1001
00:55:50,231 --> 00:55:53,253
So it's not like they would think that the developers have

1002
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:54,914
added this to the game.

1003
00:55:54,914 --> 00:55:58,497
They're seeing someone's head screaming at this game.

1004
00:55:58,497 --> 00:56:01,459
And I'm sure there's no shortage of YouTube videos

1005
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:03,421
where someone's swearing at a Disney movie or something

1006
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:05,643
as they watch it, something like that.

1007
00:56:05,643 --> 00:56:06,423
So it's not a problem.

1008
00:56:06,423 --> 00:56:07,584
Thank you.

1009
00:56:07,584 --> 00:56:07,624
OK.

1010
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:13,814
Awesome talk. Pretty simple question. Why not Kickstarter?

1011
00:56:13,814 --> 00:56:24,625
Oh, honestly I kind of felt like it was on the way out. And we were confident enough in our game

1012
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:28,709
that we thought if we can get this thing on green light and start selling it, we're good.

1013
00:56:28,709 --> 00:56:32,713
But we did think about Kickstarter and I think what we

1014
00:56:33,692 --> 00:56:38,094
and we learned that early access is almost no different,

1015
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:43,236
but I really didn't want to be beholden to a group of backers

1016
00:56:43,236 --> 00:56:47,138
who were going to be expecting things for them.

1017
00:56:47,138 --> 00:56:48,638
Like, I know everyone does it differently,

1018
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,359
but like backer updates and everything

1019
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:53,320
where you're speaking to only these people

1020
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,041
that really, that have backed you, like.

1021
00:56:55,561 --> 00:56:59,823
I mean, I want a much, much bigger megaphone to speak from,

1022
00:56:59,823 --> 00:57:01,984
so it made sense to just get the thing on Steam

1023
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:03,464
and let's see what happens.

1024
00:57:03,464 --> 00:57:07,026
And also, to be totally honest, we just didn't need the money.

1025
00:57:07,026 --> 00:57:09,687
We weren't eating ramen or anything.

1026
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:11,888
We really wanted to get paid because it

1027
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:16,550
had been a couple of years, but it wasn't dire straits.

1028
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,330
And so it was fine.

1029
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:18,231
Awesome, thanks.

1030
00:57:18,231 --> 00:57:18,751
Hi.

1031
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:23,833
If early access is released now, then what is release?

1032
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:24,993
Where is that line for you now?

1033
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:30,334
releases basically just 1.0 and we always think of it, I'm sure everyone does it

1034
00:57:30,334 --> 00:57:34,998
differently but we always think of it as

1035
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:35,258
1.0 is

1036
00:57:35,258 --> 00:57:39,562
the 1.0 version of Slime Rancher that is in a box on the shelf at

1037
00:57:39,562 --> 00:57:40,443
Target

1038
00:57:40,443 --> 00:57:44,066
that someone buys in a vacuum and never connects to the internet or reads

1039
00:57:44,066 --> 00:57:45,447
anything about the game

1040
00:57:45,447 --> 00:57:48,089
that they have twenty dollars well spent.

1041
00:57:48,489 --> 00:57:50,831
it's a complete experience.

1042
00:57:50,831 --> 00:57:53,574
Doesn't mean that we're not gonna add a ton of stuff later,

1043
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:56,116
we most definitely will.

1044
00:57:56,116 --> 00:57:59,680
You know, there's a lot of stuff that we wanna do with it,

1045
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,383
pending continued interest, but 1.0 for us is just,

1046
00:58:03,383 --> 00:58:06,646
if this were in a box, does someone feel good about,

1047
00:58:06,646 --> 00:58:08,267
you know, having purchased it?

1048
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:09,448
So, yeah.

1049
00:58:10,628 --> 00:58:16,833
A question related to the same topic is, you mentioned the reviews for your early versions,

1050
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:21,697
they're negative, there are some issues, it's not the same game you're going to end up releasing,

1051
00:58:21,697 --> 00:58:22,717
and it is hurting you.

1052
00:58:22,717 --> 00:58:27,201
Is there a way to remove those reviews when it goes to GA, or is that not allowed?

1053
00:58:27,201 --> 00:58:30,163
Because that way it's almost like a new game when it's released.

1054
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:30,763
Right, right.

1055
00:58:30,763 --> 00:58:32,024
So is there a way to remove?

1056
00:58:32,284 --> 00:58:36,806
bad early access reviews, and my understanding is there is not, other than they will be flagged

1057
00:58:36,806 --> 00:58:38,647
as early access.

1058
00:58:38,647 --> 00:58:47,010
And I don't know how people feel about Steam's recent review versus, you know, total average

1059
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:47,210
review.

1060
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:52,312
I don't know how they perceive that, but I'm sure if one of those is mixed, then the game

1061
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:52,932
is mixed.

1062
00:58:53,132 --> 00:58:56,495
So an early access review that is bad, that happens to,

1063
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:59,717
or a review that is bad that happens to say early access,

1064
00:58:59,717 --> 00:59:02,419
I think anyone is just gonna read that as a bad review.

1065
00:59:02,419 --> 00:59:04,640
Because it's blood in the water, right?

1066
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,682
It's like, at one point this game was bad,

1067
00:59:07,682 --> 00:59:09,224
even if it isn't now.

1068
00:59:09,224 --> 00:59:12,126
So, you know, I get skittish already, right?

1069
00:59:12,126 --> 00:59:12,966
Like, well what did they do

1070
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,088
that all of a sudden made it better, you know?

1071
00:59:15,088 --> 00:59:17,629
So, it's not fair, but I'm sure that's how

1072
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:19,571
people would perceive it.

1073
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:19,771
Thanks.

1074
00:59:21,713 --> 00:59:23,557
All right, well, looks like that's my time.

1075
00:59:23,557 --> 00:59:26,342
If anyone has any additional questions, I'll be around.

1076
00:59:26,342 --> 00:59:28,086
Thank you very much, I really appreciate it.
