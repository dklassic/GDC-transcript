1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:09,755
Alright, well it looks like the doors are closed, so I'll go ahead and wait for people

2
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:15,282
to get settled for a second, and then I'll go ahead and start with my presentation here

3
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:22,772
because I'm not at all nervous and totally ready to do this.

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,003
Hey there, GDC Assassins, I'm Gabe Graziani, one quarter of your community team on Assassin's

5
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:35,667
Creed, and I'm here today to talk to you about building a community of exceptionally passionate

6
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:38,209
and creative players.

7
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:42,973
And before I begin, I would like to mention that there are going to be some evaluations

8
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:48,497
emailed to you during this session, so if you could go ahead and be ruthless and brutal

9
00:00:48,497 --> 00:00:50,118
in your feedback, I would really appreciate it.

10
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:57,710
Now, before I begin, I need to apologize to you all for the sort of buzzworthy buzz...

11
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:05,052
Yeah, for the buzz-feedy, upworthy headline and specifically the description of this talk.

12
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:09,634
But I really wanted to get noticed by GDC this year, and it seemed to work.

13
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:15,356
So I figured I would go ahead and put in, like, 27 community tactics the PR fat cats

14
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:16,297
don't want you to know about.

15
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:22,285
So yeah, it turns out it worked, so here I am.

16
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:26,188
But of course, at Ubisoft, I'm fortunate enough

17
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:29,270
to work with one of the greatest PR teams in the business,

18
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,031
and I'd be remiss if I didn't call out the work

19
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:34,573
of Stone Chin and Chris Norris.

20
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:37,115
Specifically, I couldn't do a lot of the things

21
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:38,976
that I've been able to do at the company

22
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:40,537
without their help and support,

23
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:42,898
and I owe them a lot for participating

24
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:43,999
in the Assassin's Creed community.

25
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:51,339
and making it one of the most welcoming and flat-out prolific communities in gaming today.

26
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:53,441
I'm privileged to work with these gentlemen.

27
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:54,061
Now, a little bit about me.

28
00:01:54,061 --> 00:02:00,566
I studied film and animation at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco,

29
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:05,149
which is just down the street, and at Fisherman's Wharf, and over on Van Ness,

30
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:06,490
and you know how these guys are.

31
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,432
It's basically all over the city.

32
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:12,971
And then, after several years and no degree later,

33
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:16,456
I got a job at GamePro Magazine as a graphic designer

34
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:19,760
and moved into editorial as a writer

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,704
and game critic for GamesRadar and later GameSpy.

36
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:25,068
And man, being a games journalist

37
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:26,309
was like a dream come true.

38
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:28,745
the work was like a dream come true.

39
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:30,766
The pay and the hours, not so much.

40
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:33,308
So I started looking around

41
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:37,190
to see if I could do something at a game studio.

42
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,851
And this was around 2008.

43
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:41,512
So I tried to look for a company

44
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,053
who made games that I really liked.

45
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:45,596
Because it was 2008, I just finished Prince of Persia.

46
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:49,697
If you can find any of my reviews for Rainbow Six Vegas,

47
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:52,258
you'll know that I loved both one and two.

48
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:55,019
So Ubisoft Montreal was a natural fit.

49
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,479
And the best thing about that too was I had some friends

50
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,380
who worked there and were able to submit my resume for me.

51
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,302
And they were opening up a new weird community development

52
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:09,163
department that I wasn't super familiar with,

53
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:10,643
but I had always been active on the forums

54
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:12,103
at all the outlets that I worked at.

55
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,491
And part of the reason I mention my history is because

56
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:20,233
I wanted to make sure that you guys understand the skill set that I was arriving to the job with, right?

57
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,395
So I had had a bunch of history in film and animation,

58
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:29,577
and then while I was in editorial, which involved a lot of writing,

59
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,258
we also did some podcasts and things like that.

60
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:36,200
So I was very, like, AV, like, multimedia-focused.

61
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:43,447
So the outline for the GDC presentation says that I need to keep the introduction short,

62
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:47,910
but so much of what I've learned about working in community tracks right alongside my career

63
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,733
progress, so what I'm going to do is basically continue with my career a little bit and give

64
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:57,596
you an insight on what I learned along the way about creating a passionate community.

65
00:03:57,596 --> 00:04:00,298
So when I started, I didn't have a...

66
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:04,964
a Facebook account, I didn't have a Twitter account, I didn't understand how any of that

67
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:10,066
stuff worked. And what you need to understand is that this was just a week shy of six years

68
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:16,208
ago. So a lot of the brands at the time didn't really, weren't super active on those channels.

69
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:22,030
It wasn't a thing that companies did. So when I arrived, there really wasn't a very

70
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:27,108
obvious plan for how you were supposed to approach this kind of a job.

71
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:33,093
So I looked, though, to a couple of people who I thought were already doing a really

72
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:38,838
good job, and that would be Larry Herb, whom some of you may know as Major Nelson at Xbox,

73
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:46,225
and then also Ryan Bowling, who at the time was IM420, the community manager and creative

74
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:47,626
strategist for Call of Duty.

75
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:53,809
So looking at these guys, what I noticed first and foremost about them was

76
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:56,371
that they were super present in their communities.

77
00:04:56,371 --> 00:05:00,455
They were always available and they were virtually everywhere.

78
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:02,616
Especially like when I was a game journalist

79
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:07,420
and I was managing the Xbox part of the page for GamesRadar,

80
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,302
Major Nelson's blog was the first place I hit up every morning

81
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:11,923
because that's always where I got all my news.

82
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:15,066
So the key learning there was...

83
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,775
I needed to be available to my fans, so of course at that point I made a Facebook account

84
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:24,840
and Twitter account and started tweeting and Facebooking and doing all that good stuff.

85
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,347
So when I started on Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, which was the first Assassin's Creed game

86
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:34,690
that I worked on, we were looking to do a similar kind of thing.

87
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,612
We were looking to do something to provide presence.

88
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:40,046
And since we were still struggling with demonstrable ROI,

89
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:44,447
we knew that we had to do it cheap,

90
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:47,148
which is, you know, I think for community managers,

91
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:50,429
some of you are probably struggling with this yourself,

92
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:53,670
we look for a way to justify the expenditures

93
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,611
that we do in order to have these good feelings

94
00:05:57,611 --> 00:05:59,112
or positive sentiment in the community,

95
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:01,592
but it's really challenging to measure those things.

96
00:06:01,592 --> 00:06:02,393
So when we started.

97
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:05,573
we kind of copped out and we're just like,

98
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,653
well, we don't cost anything.

99
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:09,674
So, you know, it's basically free.

100
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:11,914
And you get this stuff that maybe is valuable,

101
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:15,395
maybe it isn't, but hey, it's free.

102
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:17,376
So we started doing YouTube Q and A's

103
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,896
and we did those with just like a camera

104
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:22,317
and like two of us in the studio.

105
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,617
Basically, we'd ask our community to submit questions

106
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,818
via our social channels,

107
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,658
and then we'd respond in a short YouTube video.

108
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:33,734
The key thing for these was that we were constantly refining our approach

109
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:37,698
and asking for feedback, not just on the game

110
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:41,583
but on the actual delivery system, how we were communicating with them.

111
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,668
We wanted to know from our community how we could service them the best.

112
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:51,915
So there are a couple of key factors to the success of these that got our community off

113
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:56,417
to a really positive start, right when it was really starting to grow, because at the

114
00:06:56,417 --> 00:07:01,619
time that I came on to Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, we were at roughly, I think, 160,000 Facebook

115
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:01,839
fans.

116
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,201
Today, the Assassin's Creed Facebook page is a global page with...

117
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:09,459
I think 10.1 million fans on it.

118
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:13,023
But the key success factors for the YouTube Q&As

119
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:16,286
were that, one, it was a concrete demonstration

120
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:17,066
of presence.

121
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:20,409
Because we gave them a personality to interact with,

122
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:23,612
there was a sense of contact and familiarity.

123
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,314
And this was something that we noticed about YouTube

124
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:26,215
in general at the time.

125
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:29,838
There was a methodology at work for the more popular YouTubers.

126
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:35,080
and one of the things that we noticed they did a lot was interact with their community.

127
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,081
So by answering the questions that we received,

128
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:41,063
we were directly interacting with our community.

129
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:45,524
And the second thing that contributed to the success of those

130
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:48,365
was something you might be familiar with called Senpai Noticed Me.

131
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:55,448
By calling out social media identities of fans directly on the YouTube videos,

132
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:58,729
either their Twitter account names or YouTube handles, whatever it was,

133
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:03,368
We were acknowledging individual players in a very meaningful and public way.

134
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,835
Within our growing community became something

135
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:09,356
of a badge of honor to get your questions answered,

136
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,297
especially as the program picked up

137
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,138
and we started getting more and more YouTube views

138
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:17,579
on the videos themselves, which at the time

139
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,760
it was like, I think, 30,000 views, 30 to 60,000 views.

140
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,641
We were like, oh man, this is amazing.

141
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:23,522
Now it doesn't seem like a whole lot for us,

142
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:26,883
but at the time it was something that we were hitting.

143
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:29,725
We'd never done anything like that that consistently,

144
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,746
so it was super exciting for us.

145
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:38,854
Also at that time, user-generated content was basically taking over.

146
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:44,922
I had done a study over the summer, specifically for Ubisoft, where I examined Bungie's...

147
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:47,343
Halo Reach beta.

148
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:49,883
And at the time, they had, this was before Waypoint,

149
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:52,324
so they just had the Bungie blog.

150
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,085
And I was going over their blog and noticed

151
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:57,606
that like 80% of the content that they put on the blog

152
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:59,306
was user-generated YouTube videos.

153
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:03,228
So it was clear that, and the key learning from that

154
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:07,509
for me too was that they weren't afraid of showing videos

155
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:09,350
where people were making fun of them,

156
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,690
or showing bugs, or doing anything like that.

157
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,811
They just put any content that they found entertaining

158
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:14,651
would go up on the blog.

159
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:20,937
So user-generated content became super essential

160
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:21,938
when we got to post-launch,

161
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:23,919
because as many of you are probably aware,

162
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,001
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood was the first of the series

163
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,062
to include multiplayer,

164
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:29,184
and that meant that we needed to give it

165
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,465
a lot more post-launch attention.

166
00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:34,909
And the multiplayer for Brotherhood was kind of complicated

167
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,250
in terms that it was both different

168
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,492
from the main Assassin's Creed game,

169
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,114
but it was also different

170
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,495
from a lot of multiplayers at the time.

171
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:43,556
So people really wanted...

172
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:48,702
Like there was a feeling in the studio that they wanted us to produce some video content because we've just done such great work

173
00:09:48,702 --> 00:09:51,986
With these Q&A's they're like hey, why don't you make some tutorials for the multiplayer?

174
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:55,971
The problem with that was that I was terrible at it

175
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:01,143
So, like, it had been like three weeks,

176
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,925
and I had done game capture and written scripts

177
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:06,006
and done all this stuff, and I still wasn't,

178
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,129
I still didn't have a finished video tutorial.

179
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:11,831
And it was starting to get super frustrating.

180
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:13,352
And right at a time when, you know,

181
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:14,773
if we didn't deliver something,

182
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:16,834
it was gonna lose relevance to our players, right?

183
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,515
We were losing players, like, on a daily basis

184
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:19,996
because they didn't understand what was going on.

185
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:24,360
So at this point, I wanna rewind for a second.

186
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:30,420
because we've been doing a thing that had been kind of simmering in the background this entire time,

187
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,521
but it was about to become a lot more important.

188
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:37,842
So when I started I took over for a gentleman named Amar Azazia,

189
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:40,603
who was a really talented community developer,

190
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:47,125
but is now the brand content director for the entire Assassin's Creed brand. So clearly a multi-talented individual.

191
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:53,136
Anyway, he'd started a feature on our website called Our Fans Got Talent.

192
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:57,399
So like I said, an amazing visionary, but maybe not the best at naming things.

193
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:05,304
So Our Fans Got Talent was a simple UGC recognition program, where we'd highlight a piece of

194
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:10,087
art from our community every month or so, and then, like, do, like, a little interview

195
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:10,608
or something.

196
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:15,791
So in focusing on the YouTube Q&As, though, we'd kind of let that slide, and we stopped

197
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,132
doing them as frequently as we used to.

198
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:22,638
Um, but, uh, with YouTube, with the YouTube community becoming, uh, more

199
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:25,840
productive, uh, and we started seeing more videos coming out, this is about

200
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,961
to get super, super important.

201
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:32,183
So we relaunched the program with a new name called Fan Appreciation Friday.

202
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:33,724
Because I love alliteration.

203
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:39,364
So Amar had also pointed out one fan in particular

204
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,426
who I'd started working with more closely,

205
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:43,868
and his name was EscoBlades.

206
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:47,071
He was a nice guy, and we chatted often on Twitter,

207
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,174
and he was becoming more active as a blogger,

208
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:53,497
and invited our team onto podcasts that he ran.

209
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:55,399
So he was starting to run community podcasts

210
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,240
and things like that.

211
00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:59,600
But most importantly, he was making gameplay videos

212
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,782
of our multiplayer.

213
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,503
And he was really good at it.

214
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:04,844
He had an amazing voice.

215
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:07,607
And I don't just mean his actual physical voice,

216
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:09,368
but his presence on camera.

217
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:12,531
He was really nice and really inviting and really good

218
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,234
at highlighting the different elements of the game.

219
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,195
So we reached out to him and some of his peers,

220
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,117
like Loomer and Squidish.

221
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:21,559
And we asked if it would be all right to highlight their videos

222
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,460
on the Facebook page.

223
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:29,234
Now I felt a little weird about it at the time because I didn't believe in paying people in exposure.

224
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:32,757
If someone does work for you, you pay them for that work, right?

225
00:12:32,757 --> 00:12:35,599
So this relationship was problematic for me.

226
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:41,863
I really didn't want to take advantage of our most dedicated and prolific community members

227
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:42,503
in that kind of way.

228
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:48,007
It seemed opposite to the kind of philosophy that we were going for.

229
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:51,229
So I tried to be really honest with them about what we were doing

230
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,470
and the way we were going to work together.

231
00:12:54,374 --> 00:13:00,461
But among our YouTube community, the response, by and large, was that I was just being a crazy person.

232
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:05,466
Because even though we weren't actually paying them, they were getting more views.

233
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:09,231
And after a couple of months, many of them actually got picked up by different MCMs,

234
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:13,976
like EscoBlades got picked up by Machinima, and that's a paying gig for him.

235
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:18,680
So by us featuring them on the Facebook page, it meant more views for them.

236
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,744
By us like sending out tweets and like interacting with them, it meant more views for them.

237
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:25,806
And more views for them was CPM for them.

238
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,609
And that meant that they were starting to make more money off of their videos.

239
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:34,033
It also was good because it raised their status in their MCN, right, their multi-channel network.

240
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:37,816
So I could sleep soundly at night with that relationship.

241
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:46,990
Around the same time, we had another art form start appearing more frequently in our Fan Appreciation Friday features, and that was cosplay.

242
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:58,052
Now, when I was a game critic, a video producer friend of mine and I wanted to produce, like, this sort of documentary about this crazy new thing called cosplay, but it was just too weird.

243
00:13:58,052 --> 00:14:05,794
Over the years, though, that I've been working in the community, it started becoming more and more mainstream.

244
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:09,057
And the developers loved it.

245
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,921
I think part of the reason for that is that

246
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:14,644
there's something super, super satisfying

247
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,446
for creative people when they see

248
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:17,708
the thing that they've created.

249
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:20,854
cause more creativity in the world.

250
00:14:20,854 --> 00:14:24,417
Like, it's sort of like a, it's a beautiful synergy, right?

251
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,339
In a virtuous cycle, in the truest sense of the word.

252
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,122
So they were always super excited to see

253
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:30,963
any cosplay that we have, and the demand

254
00:14:30,963 --> 00:14:32,645
came predominantly from the dev team.

255
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:35,487
But then when we would post these images up

256
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:37,429
as Fan Appreciation Friday images,

257
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,171
they would tend to get a lot of feedback

258
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,452
and a lot of engagement.

259
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:46,231
So I started to reach out more to individual cosplayers,

260
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:49,734
doing short-form interviews with them and stuff for the website.

261
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:54,398
And I was learning a lot about the amount of effort that went into their craft,

262
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:58,962
but also how things weren't always emotionally safe for cosplayers on the internet.

263
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,491
they were considered by many to be attention mongers,

264
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:04,111
like people who are just in it for attention,

265
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,812
which is something that I always think is...

266
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:08,433
I mean, it's a very common thread on the internet

267
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:12,154
to denigrate people for craving attention,

268
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:15,995
but the fact of the matter is that it's something that we all want, right?

269
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:18,936
Like, all people want some degree of attention.

270
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:20,277
So, there's...

271
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:22,777
From our perspective, there's nothing wrong with the pursuit of that.

272
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:29,204
So we tried to keep, like, knowing those things about,

273
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:30,885
like, in talking to cosplayers,

274
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:32,065
we realized that we needed to keep

275
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,566
a very close eye on moderation.

276
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,187
Whenever we posted a cosplayer's photo,

277
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:38,008
we always tried to be sure that we were there

278
00:15:38,008 --> 00:15:40,189
and present in the comments section

279
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,490
and very aware if we needed to delete comments

280
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,412
or edit comments or something like that.

281
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:51,193
And at that point, we had a pretty manageable traffic level

282
00:15:51,193 --> 00:15:53,614
because we were, I think, something like 480,000.

283
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:56,918
fans on the AC Facebook page at the time,

284
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:58,720
and so when we'd post a cosplay photo,

285
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,443
we could basically deal with it.

286
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:05,490
So cosplay was becoming bigger.

287
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,493
We wanted to do a big event for cosplay

288
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:10,194
to take advantage of the new trend.

289
00:16:10,194 --> 00:16:12,477
So we decided to do a contest on our Facebook page

290
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:16,140
right after the announcement of Assassin's Creed Revelations.

291
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,302
So we set up a submission mechanic

292
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:20,124
with an email address and a list of information

293
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:22,547
for people to provide us with their photos and stuff,

294
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,929
and we drafted up some legal rules,

295
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:26,651
and it was the biggest mistake of my career.

296
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:34,710
See, we didn't include anything in the legal rules that gave us a way to omit any of the submissions.

297
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:42,396
So that meant that every submission that we got had to face the wrath of an extraordinarily critical and ruthless Internet.

298
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:46,560
So when we started getting submissions, there were some we knew were simply going to be torn to pieces,

299
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,683
but there was nothing that we could do about it because there was no sort of out for us.

300
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:52,885
There was no way that we could...

301
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:56,450
like kick somebody out of the contest, right?

302
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,051
We had to accept all the Contras entries.

303
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,353
That's the way the legal rules were written.

304
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,594
And part of being accepted in the Contras entry

305
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:03,835
meant that your Facebook,

306
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:08,357
your photo went up on the Facebook album.

307
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:12,479
So we did our best when the photo album went live,

308
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:14,380
but at a certain point you have to stop moderating

309
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,201
and go to sleep.

310
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,343
So the next morning when I went into work,

311
00:17:18,343 --> 00:17:20,924
we had a couple of Facebook messages

312
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:23,205
from some really, really hurt community members.

313
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,630
and they were chastising us for not disabling the comments,

314
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,611
for not doing a better job of protecting them,

315
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:31,031
and things like that.

316
00:17:31,031 --> 00:17:33,251
And to this day, it's the thing that I regret the most.

317
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:36,352
But it's also the reason that I don't hesitate

318
00:17:36,352 --> 00:17:38,873
to remove any comment that in any way

319
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:40,593
disparages one of our community members.

320
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:46,054
And it's informed how we've approached moderation since.

321
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:49,455
And the sensitivity's inherent to handling

322
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:51,075
user-generated content of any kind.

323
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:56,275
Following that incident, we opted for a zero-tolerance policy

324
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,796
with respect to the kinds of feedback that we would allow our community

325
00:17:58,796 --> 00:18:01,057
to give other community members.

326
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:04,618
Under no circumstances are you allowed to use a person's race, ethnicity,

327
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:07,739
gender, identity, sexual orientation, or other inherent trait

328
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:11,100
as an insult on the Assassin's Creed social channels.

329
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:18,843
And this is a policy that's strictly enforced by all of our social media operatives.

330
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,104
A lot of communities will post these rules somewhere,

331
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:23,205
but we just execute on them.

332
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:27,032
Although I am sometimes a big fan of going ahead

333
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:28,575
and replying to the comment with the reason

334
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,818
that the comment was hidden or deleted,

335
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,581
so it shows up in the person's notification feed.

336
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:39,697
But as I said, I've been talking with a lot of cosplayers,

337
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:42,718
and we had been approached by some internal teams

338
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:46,039
who wanted to work with Jessica Nigri.

339
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,880
Now, I'd had some misgivings about working with her

340
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,021
because I wasn't sure that she put forth an image

341
00:18:51,021 --> 00:18:54,562
that was aligned with Assassin's Creed brand values.

342
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:56,803
She had a tendency to show a lot of skin in her costumes,

343
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,824
and I'll admit that I was personally uncomfortable

344
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:00,624
with promoting that.

345
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:06,688
So I put it to the cosplayers that I developed relationships with over Facebook chat,

346
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,969
asking if they felt it was appropriate that we work with her.

347
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:15,172
Their answer was a resounding and nearly unanimous yes,

348
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:19,394
because as they explained, you cosplay whatever you want, however you want.

349
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:22,295
There were some issues in cosplay at the time where...

350
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:28,314
there was a discussion going on about,

351
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:29,775
oh, is this OK to cosplay?

352
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:31,557
Is that OK to cosplay?

353
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:36,262
And the baseline ruling consensus for the community

354
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:39,545
was, you know what, we should just not be concerned about it.

355
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,487
If you want to dress up as something,

356
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:42,989
then you're going to go ahead and do it.

357
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:47,253
And this actually highlights one of the more positive aspects,

358
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:47,974
I think, of

359
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:51,236
reaching out and being really involved with your community.

360
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:54,338
Because of course, as I polled the cosplayers,

361
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:56,579
the information that they were giving me

362
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,961
helped me be a better feminist in my own personal life

363
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:02,343
and understand the kinds of things that I could do

364
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:05,445
to support the people in my life that were important to me.

365
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,743
And it was most definitely something that the Assassin's

366
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:11,684
Creed brand stood for.

367
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:14,324
I mean, the Assassins in Assassin's Creed

368
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:17,585
are all about freedom and liberty

369
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:19,505
and forging your own path, right?

370
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:22,566
So it made perfect sense to have her

371
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,086
as a cosplayer on our pages.

372
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:27,047
So we started with working Jessica.

373
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:29,308
We started working with Jessica, and that relationship

374
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,228
worked out really well for us.

375
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:33,949
I think at the time that we started working with her,

376
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:35,809
she had 200,000 Facebook fans, and now she's

377
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,209
up to well over 2 million.

378
00:20:38,818 --> 00:20:41,559
So we got into the habit of posting her photos.

379
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,620
We invited her to the studio,

380
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,501
and things were going really well.

381
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:47,223
Of course, this is the part where I talk a little bit

382
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:48,783
about confronting trolls.

383
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:52,405
Because we were very focused on moderating

384
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:54,507
anything that we posted with her in them.

385
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:56,428
Anytime we posted an image of her,

386
00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:58,509
it drew a lot of comments,

387
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,350
and some of them were really, really unacceptable.

388
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,332
But as I'd said, we didn't have too much trouble with that

389
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:04,372
because we'd just remove them.

390
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:09,199
But there was one example from a comdab we had at the time,

391
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:11,080
a super talented guy named Parvez Lakha.

392
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:18,826
And he brought to my attention one comment.

393
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:21,889
And somebody had posted this comment on our photo that said,

394
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:23,791
I bet you $10 she doesn't even play the games.

395
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:29,738
And that struck us both because we'd literally just watched her destroy an Assassin's Creed 4 demo

396
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:32,341
That a lot of journalists had struggled with

397
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:39,088
So not to mention it smacked of that whole fake geek girl garbage. That's not real

398
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,292
and it's certainly not welcome in our community.

399
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:46,234
So we wanted to crush that sentiment immediately,

400
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:48,976
and we wanted to make sure that we did it publicly

401
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,679
so people would understand our stance on it,

402
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,660
the Assassin's Creed stance on how we felt

403
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,482
about people addressing Jessica in this way.

404
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,983
So Parvez went ahead and responded

405
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,565
as the Assassin's Creed page with,

406
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:01,686
let's not make assumptions,

407
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:04,108
Jessica knows the franchise better than you might think.

408
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:05,589
We'll take your $10 in the form of a check,

409
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:07,491
please send to Ubisoft, care of Assassin's Creed.

410
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:17,562
And I'm super proud of that we were able to make that communication because it was a very clear statement of

411
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:22,425
how we felt about those comments at the time.

412
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:26,729
I mean, here's the thing. As a community manager, I don't care what draws you to our brand.

413
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:31,532
It just so happened that Jessica was intimately familiar with the games.

414
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:35,038
But even if she just liked the way the outfits look,

415
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:36,018
that would be totally fine.

416
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:38,519
Like, I literally do not care what it is

417
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,900
that draws you to the brand.

418
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,280
Whichever way you choose to celebrate it is totally fine.

419
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,681
You do not need to know every single thing

420
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:49,262
about the Assassin's Creed lore in order to be a fan of it.

421
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:55,064
That's the only barrier to entry

422
00:22:55,064 --> 00:22:57,285
as far as we're concerned is that you like it.

423
00:22:57,285 --> 00:22:59,045
And we'll never let someone step all over that

424
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,966
like it's somehow unworthy or unwelcome.

425
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:06,666
So in conclusion, to summarize the methodologies

426
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:09,187
that I've tried to highlight with my sort of rambling

427
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,187
reminiscence of the first couple years

428
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,568
that I was in Assassin's Creed ComDev.

429
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:15,609
One, be present and responsive.

430
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:17,369
Interact with your community and don't be afraid

431
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,850
to have genuine discussions with individuals,

432
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,251
the individuals in it.

433
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:23,671
You get back more than you put in for sure.

434
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:26,812
Treat it like a real relationship with a real person

435
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:27,473
because that's what it is.

436
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,253
It's just with a lot more people

437
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:30,313
than you're probably used to.

438
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:33,459
and a lot more people than a lot of the people that you know are probably used to.

439
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:40,405
And then two, you can viably support creativity by providing it with a platform for distribution

440
00:23:40,405 --> 00:23:41,667
on the internet.

441
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,428
Exposure can be a valuable commodity.

442
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:46,935
if you are honest about the relationship and respect

443
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:48,556
the time and effort that your community puts

444
00:23:48,556 --> 00:23:49,757
into user-generated content.

445
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:52,319
And as a community manager,

446
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,041
you're gonna be the primary person to do that.

447
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,844
We spend a lot of time working with cosplayers.

448
00:23:57,844 --> 00:23:59,825
And if I had a dime for every time somebody came to me

449
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:00,326
and was just like,

450
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:02,327
hey, can we have a cosplayer make a costume

451
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:03,068
for this next week?

452
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:05,508
No, no you cannot.

453
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:07,389
These costumes take a lot of time and effort

454
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:10,152
and because we understand that

455
00:24:10,152 --> 00:24:12,634
and are intimately familiar with our cosplayers,

456
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:15,576
we can work to defend them in that regard.

457
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:18,278
And three, defend vehemently your community's

458
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:21,000
emotional safety to the best of your ability.

459
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,822
Don't let weird trolls dominate the narrative.

460
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:26,165
Step in and engage, not to win an argument.

461
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:29,087
but to demonstrate, not to win an argument

462
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:29,888
with a particular individual,

463
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:32,110
but to demonstrate to your community

464
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,712
how you expect them to behave amongst each other.

465
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:37,014
You want to be the best example

466
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:38,795
of how your community members should treat

467
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:40,136
and interact with each other.

468
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:45,060
So, thanks very much for your time.

469
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,963
I will now be absolutely delighted to accept questions,

470
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:51,725
but I think I need to do that in the overflow room.

471
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:54,287
Cool, and don't forget to go ahead

472
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:55,288
and fill out that evaluation.

473
00:24:55,943 --> 00:24:56,562
Thanks very much.
