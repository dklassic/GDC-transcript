00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:12,336
Welcome to this talk titled improving games accessibility in children's games through

2
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:15,737
QA, which now I'm trying to say it out loud is a bit of a mouthful.

3
00:00:16,658 --> 00:00:19,218
Hope you're all having a great GDC so far.

4
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:26,260
My name is Hannah Bunce and I am a test engineer at the BBC over in the UK.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,101
Just some housekeeping before we begin.

6
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:35,723
Please turn all mobile phones, tablets, anything that might make any noise to silent.

7
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:43,888
And as I'm sure you're all aware, you will be sent surveys for session evaluations at

8
00:00:43,908 --> 00:00:44,648
the end of this session.

9
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:50,352
Please fill that in, especially if you like what I'm talking about and want to see more

10
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:51,353
of this in the future.

11
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,736
So a bit of an overview of the session.

12
00:00:56,116 --> 00:01:00,659
I'm going to give a quick introduction to myself, accessibility, and the BBC children's

13
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,160
games team.

14
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:08,137
An overview of our problem areas within our accessibility testing and QA.

15
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:14,241
Our current solutions to these problems and then some, I'm going to leave you with some

16
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:19,685
future tips and tricks for safeguarding against these problems and how hopefully you might

17
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:22,387
be inspired to do the same in your studios and companies.

18
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:28,513
So to introduce myself, my name is Hannah Burns.

19
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:32,095
I have been a QA tester for about four years now.

20
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:38,120
I have been working at the BBC as both a test engineer and

21
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,682
what is known as an accessibility champion for 18

22
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:44,385
months, and I've been interested in accessibility

23
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:48,088
for the better part of a decade now when I started

24
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:50,690
discovering that I needed subtitles to hear what was

25
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,430
going on in games.

26
00:01:54,153 --> 00:02:03,437
So what is accessibility? Accessibility has a number of definitions. In terms of general

27
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:09,520
terms, accessibility is about allowing people to access a thing, regardless of what that

28
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:18,404
thing is, and regardless of their abilities, disabilities, age, race, gender, anything

29
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:19,885
that might be a barrier to entry.

30
00:02:20,998 --> 00:02:27,342
And in terms of games, it's about allowing people from all walks of life to access and

31
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:33,786
to play games, which, as I'm sure quite a few of you might be aware of and agree with,

32
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:38,409
that the more people who play your games, the better it is for everybody, especially

33
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:41,171
if you make money from people playing those games.

34
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:46,855
So what is Games at Children's BBC?

35
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:54,110
For those of you who might not be aware or who have no knowledge of the BBC, it stands

36
00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:02,034
for British Broadcasting Corporation and it is a publicly funded corporation in the UK

37
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:08,357
that has an obligation to provide entertainment, information and education to the British public

38
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:11,879
through a variety of platforms and for audiences of all ages.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,082
We do a lot more than just make Doctor Who and Sherlock, I can assure you of that.

40
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:25,670
You might be aware of some of our products like iPlayer, the BBC Sport website, apps.

41
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,791
We cover a wide range of content and for a wide range of audiences.

42
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:37,592
What we specifically do at Children's BBC with regards to games is we provide games

43
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:39,252
for children aged between 2 and 12.

44
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,102
through these two brands, CBeebies and CBBC.

45
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:47,623
CBeebies is aimed at preschool kids,

46
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:49,144
so between the ages of 2 to 6,

47
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:52,626
and CBBC is aimed at a slightly older audience

48
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,548
of between 6 and 12.

49
00:03:55,628 --> 00:04:01,211
Of course, part of this service is providing entertainment,

50
00:04:01,912 --> 00:04:04,213
including people with disabilities.

51
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:05,854
So in order to do this,

52
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:09,276
we have to make sure that our games are as accessible as possible.

53
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:14,378
So to give you an idea of how busy we are

54
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:17,222
and how many games we do, on average,

55
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:21,589
we release three games a month, which adds up to quite a lot.

56
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,471
And recently our budgets have been expanding,

57
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:27,313
and as these have been expanding,

58
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,454
so have the breadth and complexity of the games.

59
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:34,097
Naturally, this has had an effect on QA and QA resourcing.

60
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:39,180
And also, on top of developing and testing these three games

61
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,401
a month, we also develop and maintain

62
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:43,583
an in-house interaction engine called Iver.

63
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:48,186
Any British people in the audience might get that joke.

64
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:51,628
I didn't when I first started working there.

65
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:55,553
So...

66
00:04:55,573 --> 00:05:01,055
Ah, crap. Sorry.

67
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:06,398
So when we started looking at our accessibility QA,

68
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:08,438
we noticed a problem,

69
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,359
which is with this game,

70
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:13,781
called Something Special, the Looking Game.

71
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:15,361
This was released in the spring of 2016,

72
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,423
and it was designed to be a completely blinder-friendly game,

73
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:23,985
primarily through the use of screen readers and in-game audio.

74
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:31,082
The game, which if we were in the UK, I'd be able to actually show you.

75
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:35,007
Unfortunately, I can't access the game outside of the UK.

76
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,433
It's a very simple hidden object game.

77
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:45,735
The main character, Mr. Tumble, who is a hit with kids of all ages and also some adults

78
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:49,377
with various disabilities, absolutely love this character.

79
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:54,278
He doesn't decide to lose objects, he just loses objects.

80
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,660
He's enlisted your help to find them around his house.

81
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:02,533
When you click on an object to find,

82
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:06,175
you're shown a photorealistic representation of the object,

83
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:09,297
and then also the Makaton symbol for this object.

84
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,638
The object is then animated to hide behind

85
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:13,959
one of three buttons,

86
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,161
which are a red, blue, and green button.

87
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:22,503
We also provide a colorblind mode of this game

88
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:24,885
where the object will hide behind a square,

89
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:27,006
circle, or triangle button.

90
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:29,819
So we don't rely just on color.

91
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:37,305
So when this game went live, we thought, great, we were shouting about it from the rooftops,

92
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,907
like this was our first ever completely blind-friendly game.

93
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:45,452
So a couple of weeks later, we received a complaint from a blind player stating that

94
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,935
the game could not be accessed via voiceover on iOS.

95
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:54,439
It was fine on TalkBack on Android, but just not voiceover on iOS.

96
00:06:55,841 --> 00:07:01,668
After much panicked investigation between myself, the project manager and my test lead,

97
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:06,293
who were the only people really assigned to the project at the time,

98
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:11,600
we discovered that the final build we tested actually broke the screen reader functionality.

99
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:17,187
This final build that we received came in three hours before the game had to go live.

100
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:22,813
So basically zero time for proper regression testing or any kind of testing.

101
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:27,739
At that point, we only had time to say, yep, this game loads on a few devices.

102
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:31,003
It doesn't just crash and burn.

103
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:32,665
So we went live with it.

104
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:38,400
And so this was a horrible thing for our team

105
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,300
to have to go through.

106
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,761
It did kickstart the improvement period

107
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,261
that we so desperately needed.

108
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:47,182
Around the same time, development

109
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:50,083
started on a new CBeebies app called Playtime Ireland.

110
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:52,744
Again, it's only available in the UK.

111
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:56,345
I apologize, because it's quite a fun app.

112
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:02,678
So the purpose of this game was to bring our HTML5 games into the hands of our audiences.

113
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:08,824
So parents could download our games, put them in the app, and then take their kids on long

114
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,766
car journeys and keep them quiet.

115
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:18,052
So now we not only needed to consider games accessibility, but also app accessibility.

116
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:21,876
And at times, these can be two completely different beasts.

117
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:27,694
So this introduction of the app also doubled our QA requirements.

118
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:33,538
One certification period for games to go on the website, and one certification period

119
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:34,379
to go into the app.

120
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,502
And that's not including the actual app testing itself.

121
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:41,684
So naturally we ramped up recruitment.

122
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:49,290
And within a few months we went from a team of three testers to six, which in turn meant

123
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,272
doubling the accessibility testing training.

124
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:57,737
And whilst the recruitment was going on, we also had some issues behind the scenes with

125
00:08:57,777 --> 00:08:58,258
guidelines.

126
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,580
So the BBC as a whole has a wealth of guidelines for digital accessibility.

127
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,361
These are used throughout our entire digital portfolio.

128
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:14,765
However, very few of these guidelines actually apply to games, which caused a lot of confusion

129
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:19,326
for some of our developers, a lot of confusion for the designers, and naturally a lot of

130
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:20,827
confusion for us testers.

131
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:28,073
So a lot of our improvements actually came from compiling a games accessibility document

132
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:33,296
from the ground up with the help of the BBC's digital accessibility team and the resources

133
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:36,679
available from sites such as gamesaccessibilityguidelines.com.

134
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:42,242
And we also found it was actually a great way to get UX and QA working together as these

135
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:44,404
two departments very rarely interact.

136
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:49,327
So QA is the final boss before going live.

137
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:53,013
But it doesn't need to be.

138
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:58,418
We now have QA looking at projects from kickoff meetings

139
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,001
through to prototypes, to alpha stage, beta,

140
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,443
and then final release candidate.

141
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:06,305
So QA are involved from the very beginning.

142
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:11,810
And now we also have time dedicated in kickoff meetings

143
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:15,173
for QA and also accessibility,

144
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,095
and then turn accessibility.

145
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:18,402
QA.

146
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:25,303
So this is one of the major improvements that we started was we got buy-in from the project

147
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:30,945
managers, the product managers, and our content producers to get QA in from the ground up.

148
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:37,506
So one of our other solutions at the moment is a lot of documentation.

149
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:42,088
So not much has changed in the practical aspect of our testing.

150
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:45,591
We still do our manual testing much the same way as we did before.

151
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:48,153
And we are currently looking at automation solutions.

152
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:54,498
So the more effective changes have come from implementing more robust processes.

153
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,842
We adopted a certification.

154
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:05,179
period very similar to what you would see from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.

155
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,402
We implemented this about 12 months ago and it has been a major hit with all of our developers.

156
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:17,965
So these are just basically a set of technical tests that must be passed before a game is

157
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:18,785
cleared to go live.

158
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:25,368
And the biggest of these tests, the biggest section, is accessibility, which is what this

159
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:27,969
first screenshot is.

160
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:33,010
It's just a snippet of our accessibility test cases in TestRail.

161
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:35,511
These test cases just live there.

162
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:40,733
They are generic enough to be used across multiple projects at multiple times.

163
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:46,585
And they are written in such a way that any tester can come in and could just understand

164
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:48,065
what needs to be done straight away.

165
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:54,687
The second screenshot I have there is just the title page of our Children's Games Accessibility

166
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:59,808
Guidelines and Recommendations, which is a document that gets sent out to any of our

167
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:06,750
third-party developers, our internal developers, our UX designers, and basically anyone involved

168
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,310
in the project.

169
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:17,182
These documents are all hosted in a place where anybody who might even be thinking about

170
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:22,106
doing a game for us can actually read them and get on board with our ideals before development

171
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:22,707
even begins.

172
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:27,150
So more improvements that we've made.

173
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:33,875
These are what I tend to call the four C's because they're just four things that will

174
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:37,258
become the letter C. And the first of which is collaboration.

175
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:43,268
So over the last year we have undertaken two massive research projects in a crossover between

176
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:45,191
QA and UX.

177
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:49,356
The first of these research projects was in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh

178
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:50,137
in Scotland.

179
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:52,153
with experts in autism.

180
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:58,634
The second project that we did was a collaboration

181
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,915
with two external accessibility consultants

182
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:04,436
to do an audit of all of our games, which at the time,

183
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:08,877
there were over 200 games that these consultants helped

184
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:11,698
us audit to see how many of our games

185
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:13,579
could be played with one or two switches.

186
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:19,720
The first project we found some interesting things

187
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:19,840
that.

188
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,470
can't talk about too much today, unfortunately,

189
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:25,553
with how to design for kids with autism

190
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,534
and how to keep them included.

191
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,056
We went to a bunch of specialist schools,

192
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:32,198
and we gained some major insights.

193
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,980
And it was worthwhile having a QA tester there

194
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,464
to go back and report back to the rest of the QA team.

195
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:42,686
Because we found this helps increase the understanding

196
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,988
of how and why things have been designed in a particular way,

197
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:48,030
which in turn improves the quality of bugs

198
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,951
that developers get.

199
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:52,173
and just all around improves the quality of the project.

200
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:57,657
So the second thing is to champion accessibility

201
00:13:57,777 --> 00:13:58,457
at all levels.

202
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:03,060
At the BBC, we have a accessibility champion network,

203
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,642
which at the moment is over 100 people strong.

204
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:11,145
And these are people from all walks of the project hierarchy,

205
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:14,467
so from heads of departments all the way down

206
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:15,828
to developers and testers.

207
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:22,879
And these people consist of a wide range of technical backgrounds as well.

208
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,024
So whilst creating a network might be impractical within a game studio, there's nothing wrong

209
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:32,366
with being a champion of accessibility yourself.

210
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:37,690
The way we like to think of things is that if you can see a way for your games or your

211
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,932
product to be more accessible for your players, speak up.

212
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:43,894
The results are nearly always worth it.

213
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:47,785
And then finally, onto consistency.

214
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:54,070
We found that having documents written in consistent ways,

215
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,812
in consistent layouts, helped everybody

216
00:14:56,872 --> 00:15:00,695
to understand what we were trying

217
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:03,096
to portray in these documents.

218
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:06,919
And then communication.

219
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,501
Communication is absolutely key in.

220
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,541
QA and accessibility.

221
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:15,122
Because whilst common sense normally prevails,

222
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:17,284
this is a point that most tend to forget.

223
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:21,246
The open communication lines between the games team and the apps team,

224
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:24,188
and then the apps team, our third-party developers,

225
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:26,489
and the apps team and the QA team,

226
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:29,511
basically you see the picture with open communication lines

227
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:30,651
with all different teams,

228
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:34,494
have been unparalleled in helping everybody improve

229
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:35,834
the accessibility of our games.

230
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:41,096
And since implementing all of these, we've not had a single accessibility complaint,

231
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:46,041
and we have released well over 50 games since that original complaint came in.

232
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:53,548
So as I said earlier, accessibility testing and accessibility design are now actual agenda

233
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:55,110
items on project kickoff meetings.

234
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:59,518
And we have found that accessibility issues found

235
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:02,460
during certification of these projects, of these games,

236
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,522
have decreased, especially with developers

237
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:07,404
who show enthusiasm for accessibility

238
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:08,604
during these kickoff meetings.

239
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:13,949
Another IQA team is now larger than it's ever been before.

240
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,591
We used to have monthly QA meetings.

241
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:20,173
They were only about 10 to 20 minutes long, just a quick

242
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:22,695
catch-up to say, oh, what have you been testing this month,

243
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:24,216
et cetera, et cetera.

244
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,959
We've now increased this to weekly, and we've increased

245
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:28,480
them to 45 minutes.

246
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:36,490
These allow us to go into more technical details of what we've been testing and how we've been

247
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,051
testing it.

248
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:45,156
And it also allows for us to share new accessibility tips and tricks to be passed on to the team.

249
00:16:50,651 --> 00:16:55,195
So the future, there's obviously always more room for improvement.

250
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:59,819
And whilst we're in a better position than we've ever been with regards to accessibility

251
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:06,244
and also with regards to QA, we are always looking to make things better.

252
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:12,129
So the first thing that we want to do is more training.

253
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:19,578
We are ramping up recruitment again, and naturally we want people to be on board with our accessibility

254
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,038
ideals from day one.

255
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:28,841
So what we're looking to do is when we hire a new tester, as well as getting them on board

256
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:34,503
with all of our normal processes, we're going to go through them with accessibility testing,

257
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:39,265
give them a few tasks to get their feet wet, and just basically help them from day one.

258
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,225
This should be common sense, but again, maintaining documentation is something that our games

259
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:53,790
team struggle with and I'm sure is an ongoing issue with many other studios.

260
00:17:54,831 --> 00:18:00,415
We have taken it on ourselves in QA to maintain these documentations because normally we're

261
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:04,759
the ones that need it the most, and if no one else is going to do it, we might as well

262
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,019
do it.

263
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:13,599
So something that is quite, what I think is quite unique to the BBC is having specialised

264
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,299
working groups.

265
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:22,022
I founded a working group called AlleyCats, which stands for Accessibility Champion Testers

266
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:24,703
in the summer of last year.

267
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:31,785
People who are invited to this group are people who are test engineers, QA analysts, but are

268
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:34,866
also part of the BBC's Accessibility Champion Networks.

269
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,996
So we get together on a bimonthly basis,

270
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:42,617
and we learn things from each other about, like,

271
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:47,059
so for example, some testers from Sport

272
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,400
had a new way of doing automation accessibility testing, which

273
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,821
then they shared with people from another department.

274
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:57,302
And now that other department, their product's accessibility

275
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:58,282
has just skyrocketed.

276
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:03,054
And we like to emphasize communication.

277
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:06,096
And as said earlier, we found that with having open lines

278
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:09,798
of communication, whether it's just going up to someone's

279
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:14,201
desk or through more formal means, having these open lines

280
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,542
of communication is just helping everybody.

281
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:22,186
And then finally, we want to review our processes on a more

282
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,547
regular basis.

283
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:25,828
I recommend something between.

284
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:32,453
two to three months to review your processes, because if you review them, say, every two

285
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:38,277
weeks, that's not enough time for new processes to sink in and for you to actually see if

286
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:39,218
they're working or not.

287
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:41,739
Thank you.

288
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,221
I did go through that quite quickly.

289
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:44,882
I do apologise.

290
00:19:44,902 --> 00:19:47,364
Any questions?

291
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:47,604
Thank you.

292
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:47,904
Any questions?

293
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:48,164
Thank you.

294
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:48,404
Thank you.

295
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:48,725
Thank you.

296
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:49,025
Thank you.

297
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:49,325
Thank you.

298
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:49,585
Thank you.

299
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:50,306
Thank you very much.

300
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:52,567
Thank you.

301
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:52,948
Thank you.

302
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:56,357
If you have any questions, there's a microphone there,

303
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:57,138
please use it.

304
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:06,726
Hi there.

305
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:07,326
Hey.

306
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:09,108
First of all, thanks for your talk.

307
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:09,908
Thank you.

308
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:12,831
I was wondering, I'm from Lionbridge Game Services,

309
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:15,993
we work a lot with localization and other languages,

310
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:19,456
so I'm kind of wondering how much you put

311
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:20,977
under this umbrella, accessibility,

312
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:21,958
as far as people who speak.

313
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:24,377
languages other than English?

314
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:30,301
That is a very good question that I actually answered after a talk I did on Monday.

315
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:33,003
I should actually put it in this.

316
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:39,667
So, as part of our remit to help the British public, we also produce games for Welsh, Gaelic

317
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:41,208
and Irish.

318
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:46,776
And these do present unique challenges, mostly to do with subtitles.

319
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:53,722
I don't know if you're familiar with Welsh at all, but compared to English, there's a lot more characters.

320
00:20:54,523 --> 00:21:01,308
So we've had some unique challenges with regards to the size of subtitles and where to place them on screens.

321
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:08,058
And I do have some amazing screenshots of a game that was just basically covered in

322
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:09,438
subtitles in the Welsh language.

323
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:11,940
You couldn't see the game at all.

324
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,422
So with that, we basically edited the script a little bit.

325
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,904
Obviously, we got permission from all the editorial staff and the brand owners to do

326
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:21,165
that.

327
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:26,848
But that's the only unique challenge we've had with regards to language is just with

328
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:27,508
subtitles.

329
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:29,669
I guess part of my question is...

330
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:34,796
Is when it comes to folks who are there in immigrant populations who speak a language

331
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,678
that isn't an official language.

332
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,284
So is that just a totally different department that works on that or is that part of your

333
00:21:43,304 --> 00:21:43,464
group?

334
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:49,650
No, we only look at English language things and then about five or six games per year

335
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:53,994
will be translated into Welsh, Gaelic and Irish, which are the official languages in

336
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:54,454
the UK.

337
00:21:54,694 --> 00:21:54,954
Gotcha.

338
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:55,575
Okay.

339
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:56,015
Thank you.

340
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:56,496
Thanks.

341
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:01,593
Hi, I'm Stephanie from Vision Game Labs.

342
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:05,596
We're based in Wales, actually, so Welsh is a thing for us.

343
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:09,218
I was just wondering, really, when

344
00:22:09,238 --> 00:22:11,900
you were developing the things for visual impairment,

345
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:15,383
whether or not you had used anything

346
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:17,484
to determine the level of visual impairment?

347
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:22,035
or whether that's something that you would like to work on together.

348
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:24,376
That is definitely something we would like to look at.

349
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,437
We do a lot of testing around colour contrasting

350
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:29,758
to help with people with low vision.

351
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:34,179
Obviously, because also with games for kids,

352
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,640
they're full of bright colours and high contrast anyway,

353
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,301
so we're sort of lucky in that regard

354
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,762
that we're making games for kids and that's what kids like.

355
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:48,864
The colour contrast is the main thing but also, like, the size of icons and everything

356
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:57,386
because yet again, for kids, children's and games for kids, sorry – we like to keep

357
00:22:57,426 --> 00:23:02,988
the art quite simple and well defined, which, again, is kind of cheating for people with

358
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,328
low vision, but it helps everybody.

359
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:07,409
I hope that answers your question.

360
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,109
Fab, fab.

361
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:10,510
And if you want to have a chat afterwards, please.

362
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:17,590
Any other questions?

363
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:19,755
Excellent.

364
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:21,017
Thank you.
