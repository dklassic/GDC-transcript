1
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,417
Good morning. How's everybody doing?

2
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:09,400
Woo!

3
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:13,886
Okay, it's great that you're here in the very first session of the day.

4
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:16,669
Welcome, everybody.

5
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:19,412
Okay.

6
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:22,276
Oh, I'm Matthew Weiss, and this is Clara Fernandez-Vara,

7
00:00:22,376 --> 00:00:24,979
and we're here to present the Narrative Innovation Showcase.

8
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:30,623
So we are game writers, game designers.

9
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:32,405
We've been doing this for a long time now.

10
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:37,472
And basically, we wanted to talk about experimentation in

11
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,175
narrative, because when we talk about game

12
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:41,778
experimentation, people think about mechanics.

13
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:45,481
And at times, the storytelling, the narrative is set aside.

14
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,622
And we wanted to actually focus on the kind of work

15
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:49,663
that people are already doing.

16
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:54,025
We want to explore new forms of storytelling in games

17
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:56,666
that also happen alongside design.

18
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:02,190
There are people who are already doing it, and we want to highlight this kind of work.

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:08,333
All the games that our creators are going to talk about today come from a variety of

20
00:01:08,393 --> 00:01:14,915
backgrounds, from academic experiments to experimental narratives to commercial games.

21
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:20,158
So we have a nice range that we wanted to showcase and show that this is already taking place.

22
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:24,508
So one of the reasons we wanted to do this is because game

23
00:01:24,548 --> 00:01:26,489
narrative has been around for a really long time.

24
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:27,910
It's been around since the beginning of games.

25
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:31,193
And there's talks all the time at GDC and other events where

26
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:34,355
people are always trying to say, we learned this thing,

27
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,656
we just discovered this new thing.

28
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:37,838
And it's true, new innovations happen all the time.

29
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:41,781
But we also really need to build a strong understanding

30
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:45,323
of where we've been so we can understand where we're going.

31
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:47,585
So we really want to use this as the beginning of

32
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:51,803
You know, the building of a real shared knowledge on this

33
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:57,064
topic. So the format is going to be we have selected five

34
00:01:57,124 --> 00:02:00,105
speakers for you. They're going to give five talks, ten minutes

35
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,885
each, focusing on challenges in narrative design and the focus

36
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:09,686
is going to be on process. How they tackle that challenge. And

37
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:12,047
there's not going to be Q&A. We're going to go to the wrap-up

38
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:15,447
room so that we have plenty of time to cover the topics that we

39
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:16,268
want to cover.

40
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:22,500
And our first speaker is Samantha Gorman talking about

41
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:22,960
Prime.

42
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:31,064
Hello, everyone.

43
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:35,980
Hello, so I'm Samantha.

44
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:39,003
I'm one half of the collaborative duo, Tender Claws.

45
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:40,825
We've been working together for 10 years.

46
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:45,649
And we write design, code, film, basically do a lot of

47
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,210
different hats on our projects.

48
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:50,693
All our projects argue that the way a story is told and

49
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:53,335
interacted with is actually part of the story itself.

50
00:02:54,476 --> 00:03:05,241
So today I'm going to be talking about Pry. Pry is part book, part film, and part game. It was a finalist for IGF, Excellence in Narrative, last year. And Apple nominated it as one of the top 25 apps of 2015.

51
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:06,802
And I'm going to be talking about Pry.

52
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,593
Sometimes she looks back at me.

53
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:29,957
Then nothing.

54
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:37,065
A wet red pain, a spade slicing like a knife, a hand reaching.

55
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:14,563
So Pry is a character study. It's an internal character study that's set during a specific time, mainly the first skull four.

56
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:22,707
The player is a guest inside James' mind and through the use of the iconic pinch gesture, Pry's apart his memories and thoughts.

57
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:28,312
So, coming from an art background, we're like, okay, as directors, video is more consumed

58
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:32,796
on a timeline by directors' authors, where text is often consumed on the reader's pace.

59
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:37,921
So how do we integrate the passive and active and text and video in a meaningful and compelling

60
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:38,261
way?

61
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:44,007
How can we merge text elements and gameplay that feels integrated, that keeps player agency

62
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,690
and moves away from the cut scene or DVD extra?

63
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:52,046
And what we saw, we're familiar with the background of full

64
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:53,268
motion video for games.

65
00:04:53,648 --> 00:04:55,971
But this project was actually inspired by the e-book.

66
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,775
Originally, e-books were like future of the book.

67
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:01,399
But then they were adapting print conventions, such as the

68
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:02,160
page turn.

69
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,244
And a lot of media was very segmented

70
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,405
rather than integrated.

71
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:11,930
And we really pay attention to the medium of the platform we're working with.

72
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,173
So tablets are excellent devices for video consumption.

73
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:18,836
However, a lot of early projects were simple branching narratives,

74
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:22,780
where the branches weren't necessarily weighted in a satisfying way.

75
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,264
They didn't go to a conclusion that felt satisfying for me as a reader.

76
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:32,688
And Pry's story was actually going against branching

77
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:36,231
because it was really a process of someone coming to terms with their memories

78
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:40,535
and the idea of the reader drilling deeper instead of branching outward.

79
00:05:42,502 --> 00:05:44,483
So how do we integrate text and video?

80
00:05:45,023 --> 00:05:46,724
We usually do a two-pronged approach.

81
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,365
First, we think about the story.

82
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:49,985
OK, what does the story suggest?

83
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:52,106
It's a character that's losing its sight.

84
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:53,547
It's forcing open.

85
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:55,368
It's coming to terms with something.

86
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,188
There's an exchange of control.

87
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,270
Then we think about the medium, the iPad.

88
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,411
What are the basic gestures, the vocabulary, the ways of

89
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:06,052
interacting that can be used for storytelling?

90
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:12,276
So combining those, as well as bringing different knowledge from different disciplines like theater, film, and installation,

91
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:17,759
we came up with different models to integrate text and video in ways that we felt were more meaningful.

92
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,182
One of the first ideas, we kind of had this idea of the sympathetic gesture,

93
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:28,286
where the player is a privileged guest inside the mind, and the player's actions and character's thinking are intertwined.

94
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:31,928
So the character gets a Braille Bible inherited from his mother.

95
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:34,690
If the reader, our player...

96
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,831
She's got indeed twins in her womb.

97
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:40,822
moves their finger smoothly over the text, the associations that the character has with

98
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:52,568
their family is more static. It comes up. If the reader moves their finger slower, then

99
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:57,291
they get separate associations with their family during the war. In this way, we're

100
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:03,675
able to remix the character's memories of his family according to this text that's relevant

101
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:04,195
to the story.

102
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:09,719
At a certain point in the climax of the narrative, he actually gets a...

103
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,604
He's trying to tell himself a story of what happened in the past, but he's an unreliable narrator.

104
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:20,948
At any point, the reader can pinch open different lines and they'll get information.

105
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:24,291
He'll go back on what he said or give alternative versions.

106
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:29,314
If it gets to a point where he can't conceptualize the text anymore,

107
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:33,938
he'll get fragmented thoughts or a kind of frantic pace of thoughts.

108
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:40,508
Or, images of video will open up that are associative with the text he's encountered.

109
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:43,272
There's about 45 minutes of video in this chapter alone.

110
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:51,300
And finally, we wanted something that unlocked throughout as the reader went through the project.

111
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:56,445
And here, there's an album that James encounters that's destroyed during the war.

112
00:07:56,525 --> 00:08:00,869
It holds the memories of his mother and one of his friends, Jesse, in the pages.

113
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:05,713
But what remains are only obsessive thoughts of what the objects once were on the page.

114
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:09,476
If the reader scrolls fast, the objects become whole again.

115
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:13,759
Otherwise, on the large level, it's a description of literally what was on the page,

116
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,361
or on the smaller level, memories or associations with the objects.

117
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:35,553
So these are some ways we tried to combine text and video and have a system where we had very authored, controlled aspects where I'm controlling what the lines say, I'm controlling the order, but at any point the player can dig in and get more information. It's very exploratory.

118
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:42,559
So these are the principles that guided us through Pry, and I can actually highlight it in some of these mechanics.

119
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,763
One of the central mechanics of the story is this eye-open chapter, where the violence

120
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:54,409
of the pinch gesture forces the eyes open, but at any point in the timeline, the player

121
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:55,069
can do this.

122
00:08:56,571 --> 00:09:00,654
Closing the eyes will return to a default space where the thoughts update on what was

123
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:01,155
just seen.

124
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:09,760
But however, there is a third layer to this where there's three spaces where an inverse pinch will crunch down

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,321
and it'll get more subconscious memories and thoughts.

126
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,742
And these three spaces work together.

127
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:19,064
However, we as authors have used a timeline to plan out.

128
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,085
Everything that happens according to time code.

129
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:25,046
Where we can take the time code and without the player

130
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:27,566
necessarily realizing it, manipulate it to make sure

131
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:30,747
they see certain story beats while leaving other moments

132
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:31,707
exploratory.

133
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:36,168
For instance, if we want them to see something that happens

134
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,689
further on and they close the eyes, we can make sure that the

135
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:43,090
external world video pauses but the sound continues so they

136
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,830
feel like they're in a continuous world.

137
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:48,331
So that when they open the eyes next, immediately that

138
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:49,251
story beat hits.

139
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:55,756
There's a very complicated system in how we actually author the underlying structure

140
00:09:55,856 --> 00:10:01,339
to make sure that we're creating a cohesive narrative while still leaving open the exploratory

141
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:01,839
mechanic.

142
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,623
One of the things we're also interested in is there's times when we invert the idea of

143
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:10,165
text at a player's pace and video at an author's pace.

144
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,767
What happens to text when it becomes video?

145
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,508
What is watching and what is reading?

146
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:19,462
So the last slide is changing game narrative is not necessarily

147
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:20,142
the goal here.

148
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:22,384
It's the evolution of game narrative is not one

149
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:24,807
conclusion, but a rich variety of approaches.

150
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:28,790
Instead, we argue for deeper attention to how interactions

151
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,191
and story itself resonate.

152
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:32,734
That story doesn't exist in a vacuum.

153
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,696
It originates from player and author effect and a

154
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:37,919
combination of passive and active viewing.

155
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,020
Thank you.

156
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:52,034
Our next speaker is Aaron Reid talking about Icebound.

157
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:00,058
All right.

158
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:00,799
Hello everybody.

159
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:03,680
So, yeah, yeah, I'm Aaron A. Reid.

160
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,262
I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of California Santa Cruz and also an independent designer,

161
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:10,884
but I am graduating soon, so this second part becomes more important.

162
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:15,375
So I've been making indie story games for more than 10 years

163
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:18,036
now. You might recognize one or two of these things. I've

164
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:19,896
always been trying to push at the boundaries of what

165
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:23,277
interactive stories can do. I'm going to talk about my latest

166
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:26,438
game, the icebound concordance. So we had this on the festival

167
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,419
circuit last year. It was here IGF and we actually won indicated

168
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,860
story award last year which was a huge honor. And I wanted to

169
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,241
say that this is really a true collaboration made equally by

170
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:38,801
myself and Jacob Garby who I think is not here today but is

171
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:41,182
going to be around GDC. So if you see him, say hi.

172
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:45,638
So the narrative premise we set out to explore with this game

173
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:49,101
was this. What if exploring an interactive story could feel

174
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,204
like sculpting with clay? Because the choice structures

175
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,887
we're used to in game stories tend to fall into one of two

176
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:56,108
imperfect categories.

177
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,832
So branching paths can feel like being lost in a maze. You

178
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:03,834
can't see the structure or where you're positioned in it. And

179
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,875
that makes choices feel stressful because you can't see

180
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:08,456
the consequences of them. What decisions will lead to the best

181
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:11,438
story? You usually don't know. And you can't usually try again

182
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:12,799
without starting over from the beginning.

183
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:18,232
Mazes are also static. You'll never do something that surprises the designer of the maze. Mazes

184
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:21,434
are also hard to build for the designer because you might waste your time building paths no one

185
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:26,997
ever sees. But in practice this usually isn't a problem because most mazes are fake in games as

186
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:31,600
we all know. There's usually only one real path through the story. And collapsing branches is

187
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,063
fine. I do this all the time in my work. So do all of us. But it's a trick. And so with this

188
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,205
project we really wanted to think about alternatives to that.

189
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:43,561
So another technique we often see in interactive stories is

190
00:12:44,842 --> 00:12:47,824
sort of like customizing options in your new car. So

191
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:50,086
you're offering decisions to the player that might have a

192
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:53,268
cosmetic effect or might get aggregated into stats that the

193
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:54,369
game refers to later on.

194
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,594
But these kind of decisions don't usually change the shape

195
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:01,296
of the overall experience very much. So this works too. And

196
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:03,939
again, I do this all the time in my games. But sometimes not

197
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:06,862
even the new car smell can hide the fact that maybe this isn't

198
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:09,185
the car you would have picked out for yourself. You're kind of

199
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,188
stuck with it. And maybe it's even more of a railroad car than

200
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:14,611
one that you can actually drive around to explore in on your

201
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:14,771
own.

202
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:17,933
So the sense of exploring is really what Jacob and I wanted

203
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:20,694
to try with this game. What's a different model that really

204
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:26,096
puts exploring as a mechanic as the thing you're doing front

205
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:30,197
and center? Genuinely exploring a story space. And the story

206
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:33,098
part of that is important too because we're both writers so we

207
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:36,200
didn't want something that felt so procedural or generative that

208
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,420
it stopped working as fiction.

209
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,002
So our challenge was to find a new narrative mechanic and build

210
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:44,605
a game around it that allowed low cost reversible decisions

211
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:47,647
and the ability to make surprising things. So that's

212
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,649
kind of what we mean by feeling like sculpture.

213
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:54,054
So for extra fun we had some constraints. We initially did

214
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:56,715
this project for an art grant called future of the book that

215
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:58,596
wanted a digital game that worked with a physical printed

216
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:03,418
book which is right here. Which we also designed along with the

217
00:14:03,438 --> 00:14:06,200
game. As writers without a budget it needed to be mostly

218
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,161
driven by text and also this.

219
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:11,135
So we had some interesting constraints that might be

220
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:13,475
different than the constraints many of you work with on your

221
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:17,437
games. So let me talk a little bit about the game we ended up

222
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:19,957
with and then I'll go back and say how we sort of tackled these

223
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:24,659
challenges. So in the ice bound concordance you explore a

224
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,359
series of connected stories set at a place called Carina

225
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,121
station, a polar research base slowly sinking into ice. Each

226
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:34,582
level of the game is a deeper level of Carina station and a

227
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:38,023
story further back in time of people who lived at this remote

228
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:38,423
outpost.

229
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,948
As you reach each new story you see a map for that level of the

230
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:45,429
station. The map is filled with objects and areas that might

231
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,871
become significant to the story if you choose to shine one of

232
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:50,772
your virtual spotlights on them. And we kind of like to call this

233
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:53,833
idea Chekhov's doll house. So if you know the theater convention

234
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:55,754
that if there's a gun over the mantelpiece someone's going to

235
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,355
shoot it before the end of the play. In our game you're sort of

236
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,737
choosing what narrative element has that significance. What

237
00:15:01,837 --> 00:15:04,198
set ups will lead to dramatic payoffs in your version of the

238
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:04,478
story.

239
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:10,382
And I should say that the set of possibilities on each map isn't static. It's in part procedural

240
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:14,565
chosen from a library of content and winnowed down in part by the player's earlier choices.

241
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:19,668
So certain combinations activate more story fragments, which you're seeing on the left

242
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:25,012
side here. Events and endings. These are second and third act style plot points implied by

243
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:29,554
the setup you've created. So for example, loneliness plus romantic thoughts might lead

244
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:33,637
to a love story, but then if you add an element of danger, it might give it a tragic ending.

245
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,827
All three kinds of story fragments can also be examined as longer texts which are altered

246
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,367
based on the current state of the story.

247
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,668
Such as other active fragments, recurring themes and so on.

248
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:48,570
There's also shimmering text that can be cycled through different alternatives.

249
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,171
And sometimes a single word can really profoundly change the meaning of an entire fragment.

250
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:59,810
So while this is happening, you carry on a running conversation with a sort of digital

251
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:04,071
ghost, the original author of all these stories who has been resurrected as a virtual agent.

252
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:07,873
To resolve a story, you need to convince the author that your version makes sense.

253
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:12,094
You do this by showing him pages from the companion physical book, the Icebound Compendium.

254
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:16,536
Filled with more layers of narrative, the book acts as a kind of thematic controller

255
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:17,136
for the story.

256
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:20,734
Augmented reality recognizes which page of the book you're

257
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:24,115
looking at and hidden tags determine whether a given page

258
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:27,757
and your chosen story have any overlapping thematic ideas. If

259
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:31,118
they do, those themes become strengthened and the next level

260
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:34,219
you visit will have more objects and text connecting to those

261
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:37,740
strengthened themes. As you go deeper, you're slowly bringing

262
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,201
the narrative more and more in line with your own thematic

263
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:43,322
preferences, making the story feel more and more like

264
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:44,502
something you contributed to.

265
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:47,583
Thank you.

266
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:52,928
That was a lot to take in. But the core gameplay loop is

267
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,810
really kind of just this. You're building stories using a set of

268
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,492
available fragments. You're resolving stories by finding a

269
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:04,435
page in the book with a thematic match. And then that set of

270
00:17:04,475 --> 00:17:07,817
fragments gets winnowed down based on those decisions so that

271
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:10,399
the next story you build has more fragments that connect to

272
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:11,540
the themes you're interested in.

273
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,814
So how did we get to here? What was the solution to our initial

274
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:19,095
challenge of wanting something that felt more sculptural? Well

275
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:22,176
it turns out we took a couple of significant ideas. So rather

276
00:17:22,216 --> 00:17:25,197
than invent one giant system that could create the aesthetic

277
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:28,298
we wanted, we realized we needed to make the story dynamic in a

278
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:32,779
lot of different subtle ways. So on the highest level choosing

279
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:36,480
themes by showing the book pages helps shape the story in a big

280
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,421
sense, what's it about, what's the big picture.

281
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:41,642
The mechanic of moving the lights around controls the sort of

282
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:43,863
major details, which characters you're going to focus on, what

283
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:46,965
plot events are important. And then that zoomed in view of the

284
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:50,107
individual text gives you the player control over really small

285
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:53,808
aspects, words and phrases. And at the same time, this cycle is

286
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:56,290
going on, there's also things like the conversation with the

287
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,751
central character who has a state that can change and how

288
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:01,612
the player chooses to interact with the printed book. Do they

289
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:03,913
read it all at once at the beginning? Do they dip back into

290
00:18:03,954 --> 00:18:04,614
it as they're playing?

291
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:07,516
So together all these things worked better than any one

292
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:10,359
system for creating a dynamic that made the player feel like

293
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:13,482
an author. One of the things we've been happiest about is to

294
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:16,524
see this come out in reviews of the game. So we got a few weeks

295
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:18,746
ago this really nice piece from rock, paper, shotgun where they

296
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:21,629
said I'd feel some small but significant change ripple

297
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:24,311
through the game from a choice I made. The icebound concordance

298
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,273
is a game that more than anything else captures this

299
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,035
feeling of editing. So that's been really cool to see people

300
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:29,596
pick up on that.

301
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:36,976
We did a lot of prototyping of narrative mechanics. We did a

302
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,779
lot of experimenting with ways we could break story up into

303
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:43,023
pieces, move those pieces around, combine them and

304
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:45,426
importantly restrict those combinations so they stayed

305
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:47,669
narratively valid without restricting the player's

306
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:49,451
creativity so much they felt railroaded.

307
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,798
Another insight when exploring a new space you need a map. So

308
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:58,319
we built a lot of visualization and authoring tools to help us

309
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:00,980
understand the kind of huge combinatorial space representing

310
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,561
the different ways our story fragments can be combined. And

311
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:06,521
this is actually a doubly exponential space because each

312
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:09,642
level has thousands of possible sets of fragments based on what

313
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,283
themes are active but each of those sets has hundreds of

314
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:14,984
permutations based on how the player has currently configured

315
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:15,484
their lights.

316
00:19:16,284 --> 00:19:18,966
So the tools we built really helped us discover how much

317
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:22,247
content we needed to cover that possibility space and to find

318
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,589
any holes or edge cases that might have taken weeks of play

319
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:27,650
testing to emerge more organically. And another

320
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,232
interesting insight, we actually needed less content than we

321
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:33,733
originally thought we did. So Icebound has about 50,000 words

322
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:37,055
of story and that's smaller than other projects I've done by a

323
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:39,396
significant amount. But we've seen in reviews and in play

324
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,198
testing and stuff that players feel more like they're actually

325
00:19:42,258 --> 00:19:44,019
shaping the story and having a big impact on it.

326
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:49,723
Which is a huge win for two overworked writers. So how does

327
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:52,425
this change game narrative as we know it. Sorry Clara that makes

328
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:52,986
me think of this.

329
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,535
So I think I have less grandiose conclusions than a Star Trek

330
00:19:57,555 --> 00:20:01,239
episode. But I think Jacob and I actually kind of succeeded at

331
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:03,441
what we set out to do. We genuinely didn't know if we

332
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:06,143
could make this work. But we went out exploring strange new

333
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,026
mechanics and seeking out new models of interactive story and

334
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:11,548
we hit on something really special I think. So if you're

335
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:14,090
lucky enough to be in a space where you can explore an indie

336
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,633
space, an academic space, a personal project space, even a

337
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:19,996
studio willing to take some risks, you should be boldly

338
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:20,316
going.

339
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:26,103
The rewards might be fame or possibly even fortune as illustrated by this photograph

340
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,569
of Jacob and I holding literally fives of dollars.

341
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:35,468
So finally, I really believe that players are more engaged if

342
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:38,470
they can build story not just choose story. I've seen this in

343
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,171
a lot of my own projects and I'd love to see more people building

344
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:44,473
story engines that let players truly collaborate with us. Let

345
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,374
them use the story telling skills that we all have as

346
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:49,015
writers and narrative designers to help them tell their own

347
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:52,017
surprising life changing meaningful stories that they

348
00:20:52,037 --> 00:20:53,077
truly had a hand in crafting.

349
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,044
So you can find out more about our game at ice-bound.com. The

350
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:59,506
book is actually here at the GDC bookstore, which is awesome.

351
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,768
And if you're interested in getting a hold of me, that's my

352
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:05,049
website. Thank you very much.

353
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:15,836
And next up, we have Katie Chironis talking about Elsinore.

354
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,873
Hi, so I am a game designer at Oculus by day and by night.

355
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:27,638
Some friends and I work on Elsinore.

356
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:30,045
Here's our trailer.

357
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:28,526
So what is Elsinore?

358
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:33,771
Elsinore is a time looping Shakespearean adventure game set in the world of Shakespeare's Hamlet.

359
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:37,934
It's really weird and we're still honestly not sure how to elevator pitch it ourselves

360
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:38,775
so we're still working on that.

361
00:22:39,215 --> 00:22:43,219
It's kind of like if you took Hamlet and mashed it up with the time looping mechanics of Majora's

362
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,582
Mask and a little bit of performance location based theater like Sleep No More.

363
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:54,208
As Ophelia, for those of you who slept through high school English, is Hamlet's ex and jolted lover,

364
00:22:54,949 --> 00:22:59,313
one of the side characters in the original play, you are attempting to stop the tragedy of Hamlet

365
00:22:59,393 --> 00:23:02,656
over the course of four days. There are two catches with this.

366
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:06,079
Number one, Ophelia is stuck in a time loop and she knows it.

367
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:09,062
So all the information that she learns between loops is retained.

368
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:09,882
And number two,

369
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:14,287
The information that you do acquire goes into this inventory of information that you have at

370
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:19,393
your disposal and you can then present it at any given point in the timeline. So obviously

371
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:25,059
talking to characters about what your dad thinks has a very different impact on day one

372
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,581
versus if he just got murdered by Hamlet.

373
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,004
Working with that has been really interesting.

374
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:34,107
In many ways, Elsinore is sort of born of what if.

375
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:38,350
Most of us on the team work in game development for our day jobs.

376
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:42,173
And we wanted to sort of explore this concept of tragic gameplay.

377
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:48,118
And you know, you think of tragedy as sort of this concept of a group of characters or a tragic protagonist

378
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:52,121
doing everything in their power to try and create a good outcome,

379
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,643
but because of some innate flaw or some vice they have, everything goes to shit.

380
00:23:56,324 --> 00:24:00,407
And so we really wanted to take the concept of the traditional game which is structured

381
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:01,267
around this power fantasy.

382
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:05,790
You're always supposed to be excelling and learning and gaining clarity and getting better

383
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:09,373
and how can we turn that on its head and create something that really feels like playing a

384
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:10,314
Shakespearean tragedy.

385
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:15,017
Accounting for player agency makes this really hard.

386
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:20,341
We tend to try and turn things against players and so I'm going to talk a little bit about

387
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:21,361
how we managed to make that happen.

388
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:27,409
Number one is that giving players this arsenal of information at their disposal

389
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:31,316
allows them to do completely reasonable things that Shakespeare didn't account for

390
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:33,219
when he was writing Hamlet in the 17th century.

391
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:38,804
So, you know, for example, players go up to Hamlet and they're like, hey, Hamlet, I noticed

392
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:41,086
that you're feeling really stabby today, what if you didn't kill anyone?

393
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:47,513
Or conversely, you know, go ‑‑ they go right up to Hamlet and they say, hey, Hamlet,

394
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:51,096
I know for a fact that your uncle totally murdered your dad, so here's all the evidence

395
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:51,497
you need.

396
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:52,598
Go get him, tiger!

397
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:53,519
And so, you know ‑‑

398
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:59,704
When you sort of allow players to attempt to solve the tragedy for themselves, the puzzle

399
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:00,945
becomes can they actually do it?

400
00:25:01,345 --> 00:25:02,366
It seems so straightforward, right?

401
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:04,628
You look at Romeo and Juliet and you're like, what if they had a cell phone?

402
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:09,571
Oh my God, this would have just cleared itself right up.

403
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:15,015
And so writing to this and writing around this required digging really deeply into the

404
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:15,676
source material.

405
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:20,483
And doing a lot of reading about the original play, what do scholars think of it, what do

406
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:25,750
scholars think of the characters, and creating large bodies of new information and new characterization

407
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,593
that did not exist in the original play.

408
00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:29,856
So taking the example of Gertrude.

409
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:33,760
Again, for those of you who don't know Hamlet, she's the queen of Denmark.

410
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,481
For most of the play, she's kind of a background character.

411
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,622
She sits at her husband's side.

412
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:38,462
She rules the throne.

413
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:41,064
In Act 5, she gets poisoned and dies.

414
00:25:41,704 --> 00:25:44,906
That's a large amount of her contribution to the play.

415
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,069
She is still a queen, and she's still on the throne.

416
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:52,131
What happens if the player goes and tells her on day one, hey, I have proof that your

417
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:54,792
husband is a murderer and murdered your last husband?

418
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,154
How would she react?

419
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:02,975
It really required going back and reading through the play and creating new avenues

420
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:04,776
of content that move around that.

421
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:09,117
Not to mention, because it's a time looping game, we can see Gertrude in so many different

422
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:09,777
situations.

423
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:13,077
We can see her at her peak and at her lowest point.

424
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:17,538
We can see her when she's ruling on the throne of Denmark as a solo queen after having disposed

425
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:18,119
of her husband.

426
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,059
And when she's about to commit suicide because she learned something that she shouldn't have

427
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:25,340
long before she was supposed to know it.

428
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,142
And so really, the secondary struggle, once we had sort of created all this content around characters,

429
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:38,744
was, okay, how do we bring it all to a nice close? How do we take everything that we know and create

430
00:26:38,824 --> 00:26:43,125
a tragic ending out of all this? Because, you know, if you sort of go with the scheme of tragic

431
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:47,286
gameplay, we're trying to force players into scenarios where all of their best intentions

432
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:50,027
are thwarted, and the things that they thought would work out don't in the end.

433
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:58,391
So a large amount of this comes back to sort of writing around each character's tragic

434
00:26:58,431 --> 00:26:58,711
flaw.

435
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:05,115
We wanted to basically, like, you know, the player will present information and characters

436
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:09,418
will seem to move in rational ways according to that information until inevitably it starts

437
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:11,399
to break down towards the end of day three and day four.

438
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,182
So a lot of day three and day four, they start to go crazy, they start to kill each other.

439
00:27:15,722 --> 00:27:15,902
And...

440
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:17,323
Um...

441
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,767
In a way, it feels a little bit dirty as a game designer and a writer because I will

442
00:27:22,328 --> 00:27:26,412
see players come in and play the game and they're like, hey, everything was going really

443
00:27:26,432 --> 00:27:29,475
well and then it totally veered off the rails and went out of control.

444
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:35,200
And that's sort of the exact opposite of everything that you're taught to do in commercial game

445
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,362
development, which has kind of been really fun.

446
00:27:38,844 --> 00:27:42,288
Watching the gameplay sort of feels like a back and forth

447
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:46,212
between myself and Connor, our designer, and the players as

448
00:27:46,253 --> 00:27:48,535
they're attempting every possible avenue that they think

449
00:27:48,555 --> 00:27:49,416
will lead to success.

450
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:51,959
And at every step of the way, the game is saying, no.

451
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,301
No, you can't do that.

452
00:27:56,484 --> 00:28:03,412
So, in the end, we've sort of seen players come to an interesting conclusion, which is

453
00:28:03,532 --> 00:28:07,496
that, you know, when you're reading a tragedy, the characters within the tragedy normally

454
00:28:07,536 --> 00:28:08,697
come to death or failure.

455
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:13,141
But when you're watching players engage with a tragic game, they come to catharsis.

456
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:17,186
They sort of realize, oh, like, you know, it's not about solving.

457
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:18,066
It's not about winning.

458
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:18,247
It's...

459
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:23,109
It's about understanding who these people are and who these characters are and empathizing

460
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:26,291
with them and trying to befriend them in the face of the end of the world.

461
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:33,894
How does Elsinore change game narrative?

462
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:35,696
I think that's a large question.

463
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,778
To some extent, I don't know.

464
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:39,939
As the writer and as the designer,

465
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,103
it's not really my job to expound upon that.

466
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,966
What I will say is that I think Elsinore

467
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:48,967
works best as an outlier.

468
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:51,569
I think it works best as, you know,

469
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:54,091
in a world where there are games that empower the player

470
00:28:54,411 --> 00:28:56,993
and lift her up and allow her to, you know,

471
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:58,274
excel and to gain new heights,

472
00:28:58,655 --> 00:28:59,876
Elsinore says, fuck you.

473
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:00,676
And...

474
00:29:01,877 --> 00:29:12,165
Maybe there's some power in that. We are demoing the game at the Indie Mega booth every day this week if you would like to come and play for yourself as writers and designers and tell us how we're doing. Thank you very much.

475
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:20,692
Thank you.

476
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:22,853
Next we have Nina Freeman talking about Sybil.

477
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:29,358
Hello.

478
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,072
So hi, my name is Nina Freeman.

479
00:29:33,112 --> 00:29:34,794
I'm a level designer at Fulbright right now,

480
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:35,755
working on Tacoma.

481
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:38,679
My last project was Sybil, which I worked on

482
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:40,281
with StarMade Games.

483
00:29:41,722 --> 00:29:43,625
And today I'll talk to you about vignette games,

484
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:44,486
which is what Sybil is.

485
00:29:46,348 --> 00:29:47,990
Okay, so what's a vignette?

486
00:29:49,095 --> 00:29:52,338
I really like this definition of vignettes from Ian Bogost.

487
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:56,282
I think it encompasses vignettes in the broadest sense, which is useful.

488
00:29:57,323 --> 00:30:03,549
Some examples of vignettes in other mediums that are not games are Mrs. Dalloway, if you've

489
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:03,949
read that.

490
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:08,454
Much of William Carlos Williams' work, who's a poet, or the movie Lost in Translation.

491
00:30:09,154 --> 00:30:14,319
In games, some pieces that I consider vignettes are Dysphoria, The Last of Us Left Behind,

492
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,360
or The Beginner's Guide.

493
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,143
So just to give you some context about the kind of vignette that I'm talking about.

494
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:25,162
So here's a short vignette style poem, just to give you a concrete example, by Frank O'Hara,

495
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:26,043
which you can read.

496
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:31,467
Much of my work is inspired by this kind of work in poetry, and particularly by this poet

497
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:35,630
and the other poets that are considered part of the New York School of Poetry.

498
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:40,915
In my work particularly, I've used vignettes as a guide to developing mechanics that enable

499
00:30:40,935 --> 00:30:45,639
the kind of intimacy that help players examine the wrinkles in individual human experiences.

500
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:49,659
So the vignette games I designed are character focused and focus

501
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:53,961
on the specificity of human lives or moments in human lives.

502
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:57,063
They don't often try to make a statement or have a theme,

503
00:30:57,103 --> 00:31:00,585
although they can. They're exploratory or descriptive of a

504
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:03,146
single, concise experience or character.

505
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:09,318
So I used this vignette approach when designing Sybil, a game that I worked on, like I said,

506
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:10,038
with StarMadeGames.

507
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,380
I was the designer and writer.

508
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:17,145
It's a game about a relationship between two young people, Nina and Blake, sort of in their

509
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:18,106
late 19s, early 20s.

510
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:24,452
And they're two people who met in an MMORPG, like a World of Warcraft style thing, that

511
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:26,094
want to meet up in real life to have sex.

512
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:29,276
You play as Nina and experience this situation from her

513
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:29,916
perspective.

514
00:31:30,396 --> 00:31:32,957
So it's a concise vignette game about this one particular

515
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,537
moment in a larger relationship.

516
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:37,518
And here's the trailer just to give you a sense of what the

517
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:38,879
game is like and how it plays.

518
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:47,062
Modem device.

519
00:31:47,142 --> 00:31:47,522
Morning.

520
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:51,823
Not much.

521
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:52,783
Want to do it right together?

522
00:31:54,604 --> 00:32:01,609
Yeah.

523
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:07,913
I kind of wish we lived closer.

524
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:09,415
Yeah.

525
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:12,477
Being on opposite coasts isn't the best for hanging out.

526
00:32:25,252 --> 00:32:28,553
Want to meet up with me? Like, in real life.

527
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,000
That's how you spell Sybil. People always ask me that, so that's how you spell it.

528
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:51,262
It's already out. You can go to SybilGame.com if you want to check it out later.

529
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,381
Oh, and it's in IGF, we'll be showing it on the expo floor later this week.

530
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:02,883
So the challenge in making Sybil for me was that, you know, it's about this romantic relationship.

531
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:08,245
And romantic relationships are full of complexity and nuance, as I'm sure most of us know.

532
00:33:08,525 --> 00:33:13,567
So how do I tell the story of a relationship without overwhelming the player with information

533
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:16,868
about like all these experiences that these people have had together?

534
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:17,828
That's like a lot of stuff.

535
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,003
So the, the, um, wait, I'm going to go back to the slide and stay on it for a bit.

536
00:33:24,204 --> 00:33:29,068
So, um, when I started working on the game, I wanted to tell the story of this relationship,

537
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:33,291
and it's based on a personal experience. So I had this whole deep, complicated memory,

538
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:38,575
um, that spanned over a few years, and that's a lot of story to tell, and I didn't necessarily

539
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:42,599
want to tell all of it. Uh, the entire relationship between these two people has many aspects.

540
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:47,248
How did they meet? What was that like? What have they bonded over? What have they fought over? Etc.

541
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:55,283
Making a story that addresses all of these things with depth and nuance would probably lead to a project of a larger scope than my team had the capacity for.

542
00:33:56,198 --> 00:33:59,580
Four of us worked on it while I was in grad school and we all had other jobs.

543
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,902
So even more importantly, is every aspect of this relationship interesting to me as

544
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:05,323
a writer?

545
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:06,623
Potentially not.

546
00:34:07,023 --> 00:34:11,285
So I asked myself how I could focus on the aspect of the relationship that I found the

547
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:16,228
most interesting to write about and sort of like cut the scope down to that specific part

548
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:17,048
of it.

549
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:18,786
In a vignette way.

550
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:24,427
So, in my effort to focus in on one aspect of the relationship, I developed the story

551
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:25,788
within the constraints of a vignette.

552
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:30,469
The vignette of Sybil focuses on the in-person meeting for sex between the two main characters.

553
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:35,290
Given this constraint, each piece of the game needed to support and contextualize how and

554
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,651
why the couple decide to meet up.

555
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:42,093
Each act of the game consists of one conversation between the pair that contextualizes their

556
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:46,474
meeting and ephemera to support the player's understanding of that single moment in their

557
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:47,114
relationship.

558
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:55,833
So of course, because it's a vignette about this one

559
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:58,475
particular moment, the game does not start at the beginning

560
00:34:58,495 --> 00:34:59,256
of their relationship.

561
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:00,858
It doesn't start when they met.

562
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:01,919
It starts sort of in the middle.

563
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,122
So it doesn't depict that part of their relationship at all.

564
00:35:06,162 --> 00:35:07,564
It really just focuses in on this moment.

565
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:15,627
Despite that, the players still need some context to understand that the relationship has already begun to develop, just for context.

566
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:22,229
So, throughout the first act, the players presented with ephemera that refer to their interactions sort of prior to this moment.

567
00:35:23,169 --> 00:35:27,770
For example, Nina's friend comments on how much she likes Blake in this email that the player can find.

568
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:33,792
It's just enough information to show the player that Nina and Blake have already started down the path to becoming close,

569
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,373
without spelling it out explicitly or exceeding the scope of the vignette.

570
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:42,298
So it's really like sort of context building so they can understand where this relationship

571
00:35:42,338 --> 00:35:42,878
is coming from.

572
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,964
So Act 1 continues to build on this basic level of information and begins to explore

573
00:35:49,004 --> 00:35:51,246
the physical side of Nina and Blake's relationship.

574
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:55,050
The player finds pictures the two have been sending back and forth to each other while

575
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,034
they overhear this flirtatious conversation in which Blake asks Nina for more pictures

576
00:35:59,054 --> 00:35:59,414
of herself.

577
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:04,116
This act shows that the pair have become close enough to send real pictures of themselves

578
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:04,656
to each other.

579
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:09,258
And these photos and what they imply about how Nina and Blake are feeling are a really

580
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:12,799
important wrinkle in this vignette of their oncoming sexual encounter.

581
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,080
These photo exchanges show the player that the two are becoming intimate in a sexually

582
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,701
charged way.

583
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:23,222
So finally the act ends with a short film of Nina taking a sexy selfie to send to Blake.

584
00:36:23,623 --> 00:36:28,324
This is meant to emphasize how important intimacy and the physical body are to this moment

585
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:29,625
in Nina and Blake's relationship.

586
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:34,527
So like I said before, each act is sort of meant to contextualize one sort of wrinkle in this moment.

587
00:36:34,827 --> 00:36:37,848
So this first one sets up sort of the sexual part of it.

588
00:36:40,149 --> 00:36:44,371
So of course all this is conveyed to the player through emails and pictures and dialogue. It's

589
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:48,272
almost like sort of a gone home style thing where you're like going through a space and looking at

590
00:36:48,312 --> 00:36:52,094
stuff and learning about the characters that way instead of having them like tell it to you

591
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:54,715
explicitly. So it's all pretty minimal.

592
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:57,338
I leave it up to the player to fill in the blanks.

593
00:36:57,758 --> 00:37:01,303
I give them just enough information in order to paint a picture of where this couple is

594
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:04,908
at in their relationship without exceeding the constraints of the vignette by getting

595
00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:09,454
too much into sort of the history of it and the nitty gritty of the stuff that came before

596
00:37:09,514 --> 00:37:09,995
this moment.

597
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:14,703
So I think this is an important example of how the vignette as a constraint helped inform

598
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:16,424
the mechanics and storytelling in Sybil.

599
00:37:17,065 --> 00:37:21,309
Vignettes are all about evocative detail, details that tell a story in between the lines.

600
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:24,892
Details that do not need to explain themselves or be spelled out.

601
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:29,777
The player plays Sybil listening to the brief conversations between the characters and understanding

602
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:34,561
the context of those conversations by finding ephemera that relate to them within the game's

603
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:35,422
computer interface.

604
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:40,206
So you're sort of listening to these conversations and understanding the context of them by clicking

605
00:37:40,226 --> 00:37:42,888
around Nina's computer and exploring all of this ephemera.

606
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:49,113
So in Act 2, Nina and Blake are further breaking down the barriers between their digital and

607
00:37:49,153 --> 00:37:53,256
physical relationship as they come closer to having sex, because they are becoming emotionally

608
00:37:53,316 --> 00:37:56,098
intimate for the first time in this moment in their relationship.

609
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:59,881
So in this act, the two are doing a lot more than sending pics to each other.

610
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:03,924
It's no longer just about the physical sex aspect of the relationship.

611
00:38:04,344 --> 00:38:06,327
They're sharing intimate details about their lives.

612
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:12,514
So in this conversation, for example, Nina tells Blake a story about how her mom and dad first met.

613
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:16,479
And Blake tells Nina that he thinks she'd really get along with his real life friends.

614
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:20,083
So these are just, you know, the sort of things that you tell to someone when you're

615
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:22,246
becoming intimate with them. These like personal stories.

616
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:27,695
So finally at the end of the act it's clear that they're intimate enough to be thinking about what

617
00:38:27,735 --> 00:38:32,037
it'd be like to meet and to talk on the phone and to be sharing these more personal stories with

618
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:36,700
each other rather than like kind of just flirting and like sending sexy selfies to each other.

619
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,843
Sort of another layer on top of that. So all of these little details that add depth to the

620
00:38:42,883 --> 00:38:47,565
vignette contextualize their awkward conversation in act two that ends with them on the phone with

621
00:38:47,585 --> 00:38:51,667
each other and when they're talking on the phone they're sort of professing their love and desire

622
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:52,048
for sex.

623
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:57,159
Not because of the sexy pics, but because they feel like they understand each other in a way

624
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,604
and are growing closer to one another at this moment in their relationship.

625
00:39:02,145 --> 00:39:06,249
So this act further contextualizes the vignette and gives the player a better understanding

626
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,694
of how the meeting for sex came to be and how it developed to that point

627
00:39:10,154 --> 00:39:13,078
and the details of their relationship that support that understanding.

628
00:39:14,762 --> 00:39:19,706
Okay, so finally, in Act 3, the player experiences the conversation between the couple that really

629
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:20,646
ties up the vignette.

630
00:39:21,087 --> 00:39:23,028
Nina and Blake decide to actually meet.

631
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:26,611
So Blake will fly to New York City to see Nina in person.

632
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,554
But the act is about that, and how the two feel about it.

633
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:35,418
So it introduces some uncertainty, illustrating Blake's particular uncertainty about this

634
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,139
meeting and Nina's enthusiasm.

635
00:39:38,015 --> 00:39:42,477
As you can see, her enthusiasm is sort of expressed by this list of potential plans

636
00:39:42,537 --> 00:39:43,298
on her desktop.

637
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:45,379
That's sort of one of the first things you see in the act.

638
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:49,040
So you can kind of see, like, oh, Nina is off on her own, like, kind of planning this

639
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,981
out and she's getting, like, pretty hyped up about it.

640
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:56,083
And then that kind of contextualizes later in the act when she is really like, hey, we

641
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,584
should meet, like, let's talk about this.

642
00:39:57,664 --> 00:39:59,085
I'm kind of already making plans.

643
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:01,446
And you know that because you see her plans.

644
00:40:02,268 --> 00:40:07,270
So each act consists of one detail about their relationship that ultimately contextualizes

645
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,630
the final short film which closes this act.

646
00:40:11,331 --> 00:40:16,033
Nina and Blake meet up in person and have sex in this final short film that closes the

647
00:40:16,073 --> 00:40:16,893
final act of the game.

648
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:21,474
The player's experience of that final scene is understood through the lens provided by

649
00:40:21,514 --> 00:40:24,776
the details of their relationship as evoked by the previous three acts.

650
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:30,157
The sexy pics in act one, the phone calls in act two, and finally the uncertainty in

651
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,438
the plane tickets in act three.

652
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,651
So, by the way, I would like to emphasize that all of this, I'm sort of explaining it

653
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:40,872
in terms of the ephemera you find, because so much of that is there to really contextualize

654
00:40:40,912 --> 00:40:41,472
what's happening.

655
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,633
It's really not just about the conversations.

656
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:48,234
The conversations are so dependent on the player clicking around this computer and understanding

657
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:51,975
what's going on in the background so that they can kind of feel like they know where

658
00:40:51,995 --> 00:40:55,676
Nina's coming from on a different level beyond just what she says.

659
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:03,251
So, yeah, it's really about those details rather than a plot.

660
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:04,892
There's not really much of a plot to this game.

661
00:41:04,932 --> 00:41:07,093
It's really just these three conversations and then they meet.

662
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,053
It's as simple as that.

663
00:41:08,854 --> 00:41:11,755
It's about the characters and the nuance of the situation.

664
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:15,537
It's about the snippets of conversations in the ephemera that contextualize them.

665
00:41:15,997 --> 00:41:17,697
This is what makes Sybil a vignette game.

666
00:41:18,218 --> 00:41:20,519
It's not told through an elegant beginning, middle, and end.

667
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:23,800
It's one moment explored through the details that contextualize it.

668
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,261
It's an ordinary life story told through ordinary life things.

669
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:32,773
So the game does not explain the exact circumstances

670
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:35,478
of this relationship that are not specifically relevant

671
00:41:35,498 --> 00:41:38,523
to helping the player's understanding

672
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:39,925
of the focus of the vignette,

673
00:41:40,266 --> 00:41:42,209
which culminates sort of in that final short film

674
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:42,770
where they meet up.

675
00:41:43,605 --> 00:41:46,206
The game begins in the midst of their relationship, like I said earlier.

676
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:52,449
It explores how they came to meet up for sex and ends abruptly after this sort of sex meet

677
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:53,189
up happens.

678
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:57,711
I wasn't interested in exploring how the characters were impacted by what happened.

679
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,112
That would be outside of the scope of the vignette.

680
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:05,354
This vignette is constrained to the circumstances and nuances of exactly how it happened and

681
00:42:05,434 --> 00:42:05,974
nothing more.

682
00:42:07,495 --> 00:42:12,096
So the ending may feel unsatisfying because it ends at what many may consider the climax.

683
00:42:12,594 --> 00:42:16,336
However, the choice was deliberate in order to maintain the scope of the vignette and

684
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:20,459
to evoke the character's feeling of a sudden end to a sexual encounter.

685
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,643
The abrupt ending itself is necessary in order to express the ephemeral nature of this meeting

686
00:42:25,703 --> 00:42:26,704
between Nina and Blake.

687
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:31,348
So I would like to emphasize that tying up your story neatly may not always be necessary.

688
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:33,649
If abruptness evokes a feeling, use it.

689
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:38,413
If the climax is the ending or the beginning, then make that decision purposeful and use

690
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:38,513
it.

691
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:42,854
If you're feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of a story, consider whether or not you're

692
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:45,395
really just trying to explore one concise part of it.

693
00:42:45,415 --> 00:42:46,435
A vignette.

694
00:42:46,835 --> 00:42:47,976
And try to focus on that.

695
00:42:48,536 --> 00:42:51,336
Explore your story through its details, no matter how mundane.

696
00:42:51,516 --> 00:42:54,997
Don't be afraid to cut the cruft, even if it makes the story arc unusual.

697
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:56,778
Every story has its own shape.

698
00:42:57,018 --> 00:42:57,498
Embrace it.

699
00:42:58,318 --> 00:42:58,578
Thanks.

700
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,640
And, finally, we have Richard Rouse talking about the church in the darkness.

701
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:18,924
I want to thank Matt and Clara for inviting me to do this and also thanks to all the other

702
00:43:19,104 --> 00:43:22,386
amazing talks we've had here today. I'm sort of intimidated by this lineup.

703
00:43:24,107 --> 00:43:28,069
But as the other speakers have talked about, when Matt and Clara proposed this session,

704
00:43:28,389 --> 00:43:31,251
they said, well, first state what your challenge was with the project.

705
00:43:31,952 --> 00:43:36,855
And I thought that was a really good thing to think of a project in those terms. And not enough

706
00:43:36,895 --> 00:43:39,736
projects made me think about, like, what is the big challenge we're taking on?

707
00:43:40,297 --> 00:43:48,042
I think a lot of really good directors do that sort of thing, but maybe they don't articulate it to

708
00:43:48,082 --> 00:43:51,205
themselves or write it down or anything like that. And I certainly didn't when I was starting this

709
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:55,268
project. When I thought back about when I started on this, on working on the church in the

710
00:43:55,288 --> 00:44:00,331
darkness, there were actually two challenges that I was taking on. And the first one was I

711
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:03,534
really wanted to make an action game with a changing narrative.

712
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:09,019
The reason I got into games was wanting to tell stories that would react to players and

713
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,422
that would allow them to express themselves and to see what would happen.

714
00:44:12,622 --> 00:44:16,005
And I've had some success with that with games I worked on in the past, like the first game

715
00:44:16,045 --> 00:44:21,650
I made, Odyssey, was an Ultima-style RPG, to the suffering horror games where the choices

716
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,813
you were making in the present not only affected the future but also the past.

717
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:27,976
Or most recently working a bit on state of decay where an

718
00:44:28,076 --> 00:44:31,639
ongoing simulation produces a lot of tricky narrative choices

719
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:34,502
you kind of have to make under time pressure. But I was

720
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:37,284
interested in some other games that I remembered back from way

721
00:44:37,324 --> 00:44:41,508
way back in the 80s. There were several murder mystery type

722
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:44,872
games that actually randomized who was murdered in the game and

723
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:46,533
who did the murdering. And it was a game that was sort of

724
00:44:47,274 --> 00:44:50,698
This was an interesting approach to adapting one of these things that made these games

725
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:51,659
highly replayable.

726
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:54,622
Or a more recent, but still 20 years ago, example.

727
00:44:54,822 --> 00:44:59,308
It comes from the Blade Runner game that Westwood did in the 90s, where it randomized whether

728
00:44:59,368 --> 00:45:00,889
each character was a replicant or not.

729
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:04,273
And obviously the choices you would have to make is the player would change dramatically

730
00:45:04,313 --> 00:45:04,814
based on that.

731
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:09,431
So the second thing I really wanted to do was explore the

732
00:45:09,471 --> 00:45:12,736
nature of cults. And I've been sort of fascinated by cults for

733
00:45:12,756 --> 00:45:16,181
a long time. And specifically how cults often start off with

734
00:45:16,221 --> 00:45:18,985
these very noble intentions of really wanting to change the

735
00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:20,227
world or do something positive.

736
00:45:20,787 --> 00:45:23,769
And then things sort of drift off and maybe go wrong.

737
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:25,771
But maybe sometimes they don't.

738
00:45:25,811 --> 00:45:26,872
And why does it happen sometimes?

739
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,413
And why does it not happen other times?

740
00:45:28,453 --> 00:45:29,313
And how can you tell?

741
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,375
So the solution, of course, I realized was to combine these

742
00:45:32,415 --> 00:45:32,896
two things.

743
00:45:33,576 --> 00:45:35,337
And that's what I'm trying to do in The Church in the

744
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,878
Darkness, which is the game we just announced.

745
00:45:36,938 --> 00:45:38,179
And I'm going to show the trailer.

746
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:42,842
We came to the jungle looking for peace.

747
00:45:45,024 --> 00:45:46,265
America is corrupt.

748
00:45:46,885 --> 00:45:49,187
It sends our children to die in Vietnam.

749
00:45:50,065 --> 00:45:54,706
It's system keeps you poor, keeps you segregated, keeps you powerless.

750
00:45:56,906 --> 00:45:58,167
We told you our way was better.

751
00:45:59,107 --> 00:46:01,108
Living in socialism is God-intended.

752
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:04,828
And because we preach the truth, they call us a cult.

753
00:46:06,009 --> 00:46:08,529
So they hate us. They want to kill us.

754
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:12,630
That is why we had to leave their sick country.

755
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:16,531
So we came here, to South America, to the jungle,

756
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:19,492
to isolate ourselves, to purify our community.

757
00:46:20,495 --> 00:46:28,118
But still they hate us, because our success proves that their society is wrong, that their system is cruel, that their way is doomed.

758
00:46:30,298 --> 00:46:31,559
So they are coming for us.

759
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:34,699
They will infiltrate us.

760
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,540
They will sabotage us.

761
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,061
They will try to kidnap our people.

762
00:46:42,782 --> 00:46:44,343
But we are ready.

763
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:48,706
We take up arms, and we will have no mercy for anyone that violates our home.

764
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:54,369
Attacking us will just show the world how corrupt they are.

765
00:46:54,409 --> 00:46:59,892
So let them call us a cult, because we stand firm for what we believe.

766
00:46:59,932 --> 00:47:05,855
We have God on our side, and we will not let them take a single one of us alive.

767
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:13,166
So if I had to give you the one liner, the church in the

768
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:16,508
darkness is a top down action infiltration game set inside a

769
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:19,770
religious cult in the 1970s where the story changes every

770
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:23,292
time you play. The player is infiltrating this group, the

771
00:47:23,332 --> 00:47:26,874
collective justice mission to check on a relative. But the

772
00:47:26,894 --> 00:47:29,516
thing is you don't know the true nature of this group. You don't

773
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:32,218
know are they a bunch of happy socialists just living their

774
00:47:32,278 --> 00:47:34,419
alternate life in the jungle or is there something more

775
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:37,521
apocalyptic going on. And the player has choice about how they

776
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,102
interact with these people and what they do there.

777
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:43,426
You can be completely snealthy in your infiltration looking for the person you're trying to find.

778
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:48,311
You can use non-lethal methods to take down opponents or you can kill anyone who gets

779
00:47:48,351 --> 00:47:48,752
in your way.

780
00:47:49,857 --> 00:47:52,378
So how did I come up with this, how did I get to this point and

781
00:47:52,398 --> 00:47:54,920
come up with this design? I really started with a lot of

782
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,902
research and when I was prepping I told Matt, well, maybe I don't

783
00:47:57,922 --> 00:47:59,943
need to talk about the research. He was like, no, no, you should

784
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:02,425
talk about the research. People need to do more research. So I

785
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:05,647
love doing research, you know, really going beyond just what

786
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:08,329
you find in the Wikipedia article or that cool movie you

787
00:48:08,349 --> 00:48:11,911
saw once with Denzel Washington in it. If you're on a budget

788
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:14,293
like me, I recommend the library. They're still around.

789
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:16,594
They're still awesome. Go find that dusty book in the corner

790
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:18,956
that no one has read and read it and put that stuff in your

791
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:19,156
game.

792
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,877
So when I was reading up on this I found that the 70s were

793
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:25,078
really the ideal time for this sort of radical progressive

794
00:48:25,118 --> 00:48:29,159
group. In case the American education system has failed

795
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:33,060
you, the 70s were a time of great sort of distrust of the

796
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,881
government and uncertainty like if our society was going to

797
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:39,242
collapse at any time. We had the ongoing struggles in Vietnam

798
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:42,142
and illegal bombings in Cambodia. You had ongoing fear

799
00:48:42,282 --> 00:48:43,443
of nuclear annihilation.

800
00:48:45,136 --> 00:48:49,339
And people were really not sure if society was going to make it.

801
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:53,561
And they started thinking, well, you know, the peaceful protest movements of the 60s

802
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:54,421
have kind of failed us.

803
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:58,844
And some people started actually going about things differently and threatening violence

804
00:48:58,884 --> 00:49:00,124
and some actually carrying it out.

805
00:49:00,885 --> 00:49:10,248
And so in this time period, this very fertile period for these groups that were presenting a new way of life, a new way to approach having society that would work better.

806
00:49:10,268 --> 00:49:19,251
And the interesting thing in reading up on all these groups that I found was that you don't join a cult because you're weak, you join it because you're really strong, because you're really strong-willed that you want to do something different.

807
00:49:21,172 --> 00:49:27,876
And these groups generally offer really great benefits to the

808
00:49:27,896 --> 00:49:30,137
people who are in them like help them with their personal issues

809
00:49:30,197 --> 00:49:34,419
or help them find a community if they're outcasts. And they also

810
00:49:34,479 --> 00:49:37,441
then tend to start to involve this us versus them mentality

811
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:40,423
that we're right and everyone else is wrong and you need to be

812
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:42,824
with us. And the darker groups take that even farther saying

813
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:44,725
well if you ever leave us we're never going to talk to you

814
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:46,366
again. Your children are never going to talk to you again.

815
00:49:46,706 --> 00:49:48,928
We may hunt you down and persecute you.

816
00:49:49,248 --> 00:49:53,572
And the leaders of these groups tend to take the power that comes with leading this movement

817
00:49:53,632 --> 00:49:56,874
and the absolute power corrupting absolutely happens.

818
00:49:57,655 --> 00:49:58,996
And sometimes bad outcomes happen.

819
00:49:59,036 --> 00:49:59,877
But sometimes they don't.

820
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:03,500
Interestingly, reading about so many of these groups, they don't all end badly.

821
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,942
Sometimes they just try something for a while and then it peters out.

822
00:50:05,982 --> 00:50:09,945
Or sometimes some of these groups are still going today, but they don't get the headlines

823
00:50:10,005 --> 00:50:13,128
because no crimes were committed and everyone didn't die.

824
00:50:14,128 --> 00:50:18,138
So looking, it wasn't intended to be funny.

825
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:25,125
Looking at how to put this into game form, I thought, well, the

826
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:27,626
player needs to be an outsider. He needs to look at this group

827
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:31,048
from the outside in order to try to figure out which type of

828
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:34,150
group is this. Is it one that is just trying to do their own

829
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:38,673
thing or is something bad going to happen? You can think of it

830
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:40,834
like one of those murder mysteries except the murder has

831
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,015
not taken place yet if the murder is going to happen at

832
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:43,435
all.

833
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:47,665
So I thought an infiltration game was something that fits. I

834
00:50:47,705 --> 00:50:52,072
wanted to build on a bedrock of sort of known game play

835
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:54,656
mechanics and things that I've worked with in the past. Unlike

836
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,579
some of these other talks when I'm innovating I like to keep

837
00:50:56,619 --> 00:50:59,383
some stuff that I'm familiar with and innovate in a few ways.

838
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:08,103
I wanted something that felt like a good immersive sim that we've played many versions of that

839
00:51:08,123 --> 00:51:11,968
infiltration game before but that everything was completely grounded in reality that stripped

840
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:15,572
away the sci-fi trappings or the fantasy trappings we've seen in other games in the genre.

841
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:20,697
And where the player's choices in that world really have an impact on what happens.

842
00:51:20,737 --> 00:51:22,839
And I wanted you to soak up the narrative while you were playing.

843
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:26,582
You're listening to the cult leaders talk over the PA system the entire time you're

844
00:51:26,602 --> 00:51:27,623
infiltrating their movement.

845
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,145
And what they say changes subtly based on which type of group this is.

846
00:51:31,165 --> 00:51:35,169
And you're finding documents and reading them and trying to put together which type of group

847
00:51:35,249 --> 00:51:35,529
is this.

848
00:51:35,669 --> 00:51:38,291
Because the interesting thing about all these different groups is I researched them.

849
00:51:38,872 --> 00:51:40,516
There is a great commonality to them.

850
00:51:40,536 --> 00:51:42,460
There is a lot of the dogma they say is the same.

851
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:46,268
So a lot of the base of the game is the same, and then these little bits along the edges change.

852
00:51:46,288 --> 00:51:49,736
And it's your job as the player to seek those out and try to figure out what they are.

853
00:51:51,703 --> 00:51:54,184
So I thought, you know, we've, and then obviously you have a

854
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,485
choice about what to do with the information as you get it.

855
00:51:56,505 --> 00:51:58,667
And you know, you can think of it like this, we've all played

856
00:51:58,767 --> 00:52:01,388
choice based games before where you have a baseline narrative

857
00:52:01,808 --> 00:52:03,369
and then players make some choices and then you have a

858
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:05,610
number of possible stories that can result from that.

859
00:52:05,651 --> 00:52:08,112
But if you think of the game as having several starting

860
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:11,254
narrative states that are changed every time you play the

861
00:52:11,274 --> 00:52:14,255
game, you then put your choices on that and then you have a

862
00:52:14,295 --> 00:52:16,817
much bigger possibility space for all the player stories that

863
00:52:16,837 --> 00:52:17,457
can be created.

864
00:52:17,497 --> 00:52:19,178
And that was something that excited me

865
00:52:19,218 --> 00:52:20,119
about working on this game.

866
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:25,237
So the final question they posed to all of us was how does this involve game narrative,

867
00:52:25,257 --> 00:52:29,179
and that was a very highfalutin question, particularly for a game that is the farthest

868
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:30,240
from shipping of any of these.

869
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,542
But since they asked, you know, I like to think that each storytelling medium that we

870
00:52:35,582 --> 00:52:38,344
all know and love, you know, they each do something really well.

871
00:52:38,804 --> 00:52:41,945
So for example, books are really good, you know, novels are really good at putting you

872
00:52:41,985 --> 00:52:44,146
inside the head of a given character.

873
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:47,511
putting you in with that one person and their innermost

874
00:52:47,551 --> 00:52:51,397
thoughts. Comics take the written word and add an

875
00:52:51,577 --> 00:52:56,284
illustrative level that makes everything much more have a

876
00:52:56,344 --> 00:52:58,627
specific style and tone to it that's unique.

877
00:52:59,669 --> 00:53:03,654
Theater is great because I think it's the most human because the people are right there

878
00:53:03,774 --> 00:53:07,079
acting in front of you, going through this whole scene, and you're right there living

879
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:07,579
it with them.

880
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,546
And film is obviously in complete control of the experience, the framing, the lighting,

881
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:15,731
the music, everything can be exactly what the director wants it to be.

882
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,252
So I think games can be a lot of different things but the thing

883
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:23,132
that excites me about them the most is I think that we can ask

884
00:53:23,152 --> 00:53:26,353
the question what if, right? What if the situation was like

885
00:53:26,393 --> 00:53:28,493
this? What would you do then? How would your choices change?

886
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:31,594
How would that impact everyone else in the game? What if your

887
00:53:31,634 --> 00:53:34,594
family member was in a religious cult but you didn't know whether

888
00:53:34,654 --> 00:53:37,195
that cult was really bad or not? What if you found out the group

889
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:40,196
was apocalyptic? Would you save your own family member or would

890
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,936
you risk it all and try to save the whole group?

891
00:53:42,596 --> 00:53:44,699
What if the group had no bad intentions but you still thought

892
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:46,782
they were creepy? Would you let your relatives stay there?

893
00:53:48,738 --> 00:53:51,339
And I think, you know, with subject matter like this, I

894
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,321
think it's really valuable to explore it in games because we

895
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:56,822
can see more sides of the story. Because looking at the story

896
00:53:56,842 --> 00:53:59,584
of all these cults, you know, there's not just one. And I read

897
00:53:59,644 --> 00:54:03,066
so many stories of survivors and people who have left who say,

898
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,427
you know, it's just not as simple as everyone thinks. You

899
00:54:05,447 --> 00:54:08,249
know, we wanted to change the world. We weren't brainwashed.

900
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:11,131
You know, there was good along with the bad. What if things

901
00:54:11,171 --> 00:54:13,572
had gone a different way? And I think those are the interesting

902
00:54:13,612 --> 00:54:16,093
different sides to the story. And telling a linear story of

903
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:17,954
this, you can only tell one version of that.

904
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:20,716
But telling it in game form, you can look at multiple sides of

905
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:22,277
it and show some more of the complexity.

906
00:54:22,778 --> 00:54:24,999
And the player can make choices about how they deal with it

907
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:27,621
and see just how many sides there are to any one story.

908
00:54:28,841 --> 00:54:29,942
So that's the game.

909
00:54:30,523 --> 00:54:32,244
If you want to follow along with development as we

910
00:54:32,284 --> 00:54:34,185
continue to work on it, I've got a mailing list up at the

911
00:54:34,225 --> 00:54:35,646
website there, or get on Twitter, or

912
00:54:35,686 --> 00:54:36,226
something like that.

913
00:54:36,266 --> 00:54:38,748
If you come by after, I have some cool postcards you can

914
00:54:38,788 --> 00:54:39,268
take with you.

915
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:43,091
And I'm doing another talk about dynamic narratives

916
00:54:43,171 --> 00:54:43,831
tomorrow at 210.

917
00:54:44,111 --> 00:54:46,713
If you want to hear that more broadly about a whole bunch of

918
00:54:46,753 --> 00:54:47,153
different games.

919
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:47,534
All right.

920
00:54:47,694 --> 00:54:48,114
Thanks very much.

921
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:59,180
All right, so I hope that you were all taking notes, because that was a lot of information

922
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:03,006
and there's been a lot of insights, but we wanted to give you a bit of a summary

923
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,351
of the things that we've learned today from listening to them,

924
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:08,874
but also from our conversations while we were preparing this.

925
00:55:10,423 --> 00:55:16,147
So the first thing that we realized is that all of the talks here deal with games that

926
00:55:16,227 --> 00:55:17,428
go beyond genre fiction.

927
00:55:17,468 --> 00:55:24,153
And I mean by genre fiction things like science fiction, fantasy, mystery, and I love those.

928
00:55:24,293 --> 00:55:30,157
But I think that going beyond genre fiction, looking at histories of real people, going

929
00:55:30,197 --> 00:55:32,758
to Shakespeare, culture, you know, the 70s.

930
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:38,143
They're going to challenges in the ways that we have to tell those stories, that we have

931
00:55:38,203 --> 00:55:39,225
to create those stories.

932
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:44,470
So just by shifting to something that is not genre, we're already innovating and finding

933
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:45,591
new ways to tell those stories.

934
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:53,792
Also fragmented modular narratives, the vignettes that we were talking about before, are a great

935
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:59,716
way to tell a story. We tend to think of plot as being that's what a story is. But really

936
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:04,900
there's many kinds of stories that are just little bits of information that you can arrange

937
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,123
in any way or come across in any way. And this is actually not a strange way of telling

938
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:12,205
a story. This is a very normal way of telling a story when you think about poetry and other

939
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:14,187
forms. And it fits in games very well.

940
00:56:15,689 --> 00:56:20,697
We often don't take advantage of it and it's a pretty simple thing to do in a lot of ways.

941
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:24,570
I mean, in a way, you're going to see, actually,

942
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,231
in the narrative summit, there's a couple of talks

943
00:56:26,271 --> 00:56:27,411
about branching narratives.

944
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:29,832
And in a way, we have to think beyond branching.

945
00:56:29,872 --> 00:56:31,292
We're looking at combinatorics.

946
00:56:31,332 --> 00:56:34,393
We're looking at ways in which we can create new stories,

947
00:56:34,453 --> 00:56:37,154
which links to the next point that we want to make, which is

948
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:38,174
leaving gaps.

949
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:41,976
And at times, leaving gaps are ways to encourage players to

950
00:56:42,396 --> 00:56:44,777
interpret the game, to explore, to find out what else

951
00:56:44,797 --> 00:56:45,457
is there.

952
00:56:47,498 --> 00:56:50,361
to figure out the story for themselves.

953
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:54,565
And in a way, what we do is less storytelling and more story building.

954
00:56:54,685 --> 00:56:58,229
We are building the story from those modules that we were just talking about.

955
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:03,274
But also we invite players to build their own stories by exploring the gaps that we're leaving for them.

956
00:57:03,874 --> 00:57:04,515
Excuse me, for them.

957
00:57:05,976 --> 00:57:09,059
And surprise, video's not terrible. We just did it wrong 20 years ago.

958
00:57:11,249 --> 00:57:15,214
You can use video or in a broader sense static media and

959
00:57:15,274 --> 00:57:19,259
still have rich interactive experience. It's just a matter

960
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:22,243
of approaching it in the right way.

961
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:25,840
So that's it from us.

962
00:57:26,481 --> 00:57:31,365
You'll get emails from the GDC organization asking you to

963
00:57:31,905 --> 00:57:32,766
fill out the e-vowels.

964
00:57:33,207 --> 00:57:35,368
Please tell us nice things about us.

965
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:37,590
If you want to see more of this next year, we'll be

966
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:41,454
happy to come back and find more experimental narrative

967
00:57:41,514 --> 00:57:42,114
games for you.

968
00:57:43,195 --> 00:57:45,818
There's no Q&A, but we'll be happy to meet you at the wrap

969
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:46,699
up room on this floor.

970
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:46,979
All right?

971
00:57:47,439 --> 00:57:49,121
Thank you, everybody, and a round of applause for all the

972
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:49,301
tech.
