00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:22,084
Hi everybody, I'm Dimitri. I've been in game development for about 15 years now, and I've done stuff like design casual games, produce casual games, design mobile games, start a game company that makes mobile games, be the GM of a company that makes social games, be the GM of Zynga New York, and work on a giant console franchise which shall remain nameless.

2
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:27,607
Before all of that stuff, though, I went to grad school and studied architectural history.

3
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:31,337
So that weird combination of backgrounds is why I wanted to talk about

4
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:35,598
something we rarely talk about in this business, which is not the games that we make,

5
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,659
but the places in which we make them.

6
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:43,380
So before we start looking at some of those, let's take a super brief look at some history.

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,081
The office you work in didn't spring fully formed out of Ralph Baer's head or his garage.

8
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:54,122
Like the games themselves, commercial office forms have a long history,

9
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:55,923
which I'm going to go through in about three slides.

10
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:01,610
The first serious influence on game development offices starts with the modern factory.

11
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,952
This is one of the first times that we see a need to put a lot of people in a limited

12
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:09,055
space to perform repetitive tasks without moving very much.

13
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:14,358
Pretty soon, an industry springs up around trying to make these movements even more efficient,

14
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:19,842
and between that, the desire to have employees under something like constant surveillance,

15
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:25,806
and the growing costs of commercial real estate, you wind up with something like this.

16
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,171
Just to get this out of the way, this is an open office.

17
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:32,412
Every 20 years, this gets reinvented.

18
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:36,373
And every 10 years, everybody decides that it's horrible,

19
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:37,894
and there's a bunch of pushback against it.

20
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:41,095
And for the reasons that you see here, surveillance,

21
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:44,696
paternalism, and cost, especially cost,

22
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:46,777
open offices are not going away.

23
00:01:47,277 --> 00:01:47,517
Sorry.

24
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:51,518
So instead of starting another debate about studies

25
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,399
show open offices suck.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,723
Let's take them as a given for just a few minutes and talk about how we can make this better

27
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:03,125
rather than pretending we'll be able to abolish it completely anytime soon.

28
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:11,510
So, besides factories turned into open offices, another ancestor of the modern game development space is this, the art studio.

29
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:18,194
These spaces started out as places that were just optimized for light, great big giant windows, and ease of access to supplies.

30
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:22,857
But starting about the mid-20th century, the idea of the studio as a social space

31
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,820
and eventually as an art object itself,

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,401
starts to gather some steam.

33
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,163
So signifying that you're a creative

34
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:32,625
through your workspace is an old idea,

35
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:35,207
but we also have Andy Warhol's factory

36
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:37,068
to thank for a lot of what we expect

37
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:39,710
for someplace that's called a studio today.

38
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:43,113
And the third major branch in the ancestry

39
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:46,095
of game development spaces is the science lab.

40
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:48,336
These are utilitarian spaces

41
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,718
that also have great big giant windows

42
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:53,180
and are devoted to experimentation.

43
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,384
Laboratories are where computers first started to show up in the workplace

44
00:02:57,965 --> 00:03:01,231
and the total takeover of the desktop by computer equipment

45
00:03:01,652 --> 00:03:03,295
was very much birthed in the lab.

46
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:07,068
This is what, yeah, you see the timeline

47
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:08,989
of what an engineering space looks like.

48
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,110
This is what an engineering space looks like right now.

49
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:14,352
And this is also what every other space

50
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:15,193
looks like right now.

51
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:17,374
So what you probably started to notice

52
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:18,995
in these last three slides is that

53
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:21,436
despite starting down three very different paths,

54
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:23,257
these workplace types wound up

55
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:26,439
at a really familiar destination, rows of desks.

56
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:30,781
So the key differentiator is not what the rows of desks are,

57
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:33,322
but what you surround them with and how you arrange them.

58
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:39,037
because the rows of desks themselves are really the nucleus of the commercial workspace.

59
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,621
So in an industry famously on the cutting edge of technology and culture, what have

60
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:46,323
we done with all those rows of desks?

61
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:50,606
Unfortunately the first answer is a bunch of bullshit that nobody likes.

62
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:56,331
Last year this guy, the amazing Kyle Drexel of Wargaming, helped me to run a survey about

63
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:57,511
game industry workplaces.

64
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,422
And I guess this is already kind of spoiled by the factoid

65
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:02,322
at the top of the slide.

66
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,563
But one of the big takeaways from that survey

67
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:06,524
is that most game developers don't really

68
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:07,465
like their workspace.

69
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:08,746
Here's why.

70
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:09,986
There's sort of a bunch of reasons.

71
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:13,028
Reason number one, which kind of surprised me,

72
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:14,609
was it's just too noisy.

73
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:15,649
It's too noisy.

74
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,551
About 30-odd percent of game developers

75
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,512
thought their workspace was too noisy.

76
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:25,055
And this obviously has to do with the fact that

77
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,712
When engineers were to design a perfect workspace,

78
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:30,854
they're going to come up with someplace that allows them

79
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:35,978
to get into that flow state that everyone is after.

80
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,720
When designers design a perfect workspace,

81
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,081
they're going to design a space that

82
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,143
allows them to collaborate and talk to each other.

83
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:44,625
And artists fall somewhere in between.

84
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:46,267
Marketers fall somewhere on the phone.

85
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:51,338
This obviously has a lot of different applications.

86
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:52,739
So personal space.

87
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:55,441
This is a little bit more out of folks' control,

88
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,623
but it was the number two thing that people talked about.

89
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:59,324
We're on top of each other.

90
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:01,786
There's no privacy at all.

91
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:03,907
And that doesn't necessarily have to mean

92
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:06,389
our desks are packed in next to each other,

93
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:10,372
or we wish we were madmen and had giant offices

94
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:11,913
and just gonna drink booze all day long.

95
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:18,595
It does have something to do with how the space is laid out and how people perceive this space.

96
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:25,057
Importantly, because these are, you know, this is survey results here, so whether or not you can do anything about it,

97
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:29,219
this is what people are thinking about the space that you've created for them to work in.

98
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:35,261
So, even though everything is super tight and super crowded, this is like dichotomy number one in this list.

99
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,111
We're still never near the people that we need to be near.

100
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:43,894
We have to walk all the way across the office to get to HR.

101
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:48,197
We have to walk all the way across the office to get from one part

102
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:49,738
of the engineering department to another.

103
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,700
The bathrooms are at the far side of Mars.

104
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:55,582
This is a consistent problem.

105
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,005
And of course, the classic, there's never a meeting room.

106
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:00,746
There's never a meeting room when you need one.

107
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,367
There's never one when you don't need one.

108
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:03,868
There are.

109
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:06,995
Too many for people that always get all the meeting rooms

110
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:07,495
they want.

111
00:06:09,156 --> 00:06:12,778
I have some more slides about this later on in the deck,

112
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:17,641
but just know that meeting space and collaboration space

113
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:20,202
in general, even if it's not a private meeting room,

114
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,363
is very important to folks.

115
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,185
This list is seven or eight items,

116
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:28,706
but these are the tops out of 200 different things

117
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,908
that people whined about in the survey where I asked them to.

118
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:37,922
Visual privacy is surprisingly important to folks. This isn't just, hey, I don't want to feel like my

119
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:45,127
boss is looking at my monitor all the time, but also just the capacity to be looking out at your

120
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:52,933
monitor and at your workspace and not seeing chaos right behind it. So everyone can see

121
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:57,396
everything, sure, but also the fact that you can see everything is really distracting. So a lot

122
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:57,817
of different...

123
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:01,588
a lot of different approaches in the case studies that I take a look at to

124
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,950
to kind of try and figure out that problem. This one actually came up more

125
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,332
often than I thought it would, and I guess that's down to game developers

126
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:11,552
being game developers, but

127
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:15,914
yeah, a lot of people don't just think their offices just are shitty.

128
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:19,755
They're ugly, they're boring, they don't have any games in them.

129
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,656
That was a stunningly high

130
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,378
frequency complaint. There's no place for us to actually play games.

131
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,242
There's a fine line, which you'll see a little bit later on,

132
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:36,447
between there's no place and you're trying to turn this place into some kind of weird fun prison.

133
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,629
But that came up a lot.

134
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,613
And then the light level issue.

135
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:49,738
This is very simple, very basic, but programmers need a different amount of light

136
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:54,602
than artists, than designers, than people who have to look at giant lists of stuff.

137
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:59,071
all day long, the people that are testing your game, etc.

138
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:03,952
So one crucial factor in workplace satisfaction

139
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:07,534
that came up again and again and again in the survey, in my individual interviews,

140
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:12,175
was the organizing principle behind how these rows of desks are laid out.

141
00:08:12,615 --> 00:08:14,836
There are two main schools of thought about how this ought to be done,

142
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:17,637
and most respondents' offices use either one or the other,

143
00:08:17,837 --> 00:08:19,518
in almost exactly equal proportions.

144
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:24,616
Everyone working on a specific project is clustered together,

145
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,496
regardless of what they do on that project.

146
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,517
In the departmental layout, artists sit with artists,

147
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:32,078
producers sit with the producers, design sits over there,

148
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,459
engineers sit over there, even if there are two or three

149
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:35,819
different games that they're working on.

150
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,340
It's pretty clear what the advantages and issues

151
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,361
with these approaches are.

152
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,741
If everyone working on a game is sitting together,

153
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,062
you don't have to go too far to find and collaborate

154
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:45,223
with the other devs who are working

155
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:46,643
on the same problems as you are.

156
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:48,984
As we know from those factory studies 100 years ago,

157
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,581
the less you have to physically move to get your job done,

158
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:54,622
the more efficient you're going to be at doing it.

159
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,502
Of course, the main drawback here

160
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:59,203
is the very reason why the departmental seating

161
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:00,144
model exists.

162
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:02,624
It's very easy for people to get siloed

163
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:05,005
when they're only thinking about their own problems.

164
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:06,726
And you quickly lose the advantage

165
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:11,127
of having 30 engineers who are these top class guys and gals

166
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:15,548
working together if only 10 of them ever talk to each other.

167
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:17,829
And another 10 are sequestered over someplace else.

168
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:18,970
They never talk to each other.

169
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,330
That's.

170
00:09:20,152 --> 00:09:23,053
the knowledge sharing gap becomes very, very huge.

171
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:28,317
So as a result of that, you get this kind of third approach.

172
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:32,479
Some workplaces, but usually, but not only,

173
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,421
those with large or flexible physical spaces to work with

174
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:40,344
have adopted a hybrid model in which the groups most

175
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,965
likely to work across all games sit with one another

176
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,007
in as central a location as possible,

177
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:48,789
and the devs working on a single game primarily or only.

178
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,254
sit together on the periphery.

179
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:54,017
Now typically these central services departments

180
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:57,379
include groups like marketing, most business functions,

181
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,463
some artists, some QA, and very often a tools

182
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:03,784
or a game engine group.

183
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:06,787
Now to be clear, none of these approaches

184
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:08,968
are the right way to lay out an office space.

185
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,209
I'm not trying to claim that.

186
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,512
First, you have to actually fit your staff

187
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,133
into the physical space that you've got.

188
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:18,336
So some of these approaches might not be appropriate.

189
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,209
And none of these might be appropriate for your office.

190
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:26,109
In theory, you could design some kind of crazy

191
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,750
four-dimensional model where everything

192
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,491
perfectly overlaps at acute angles,

193
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:31,371
but it's very rare that you can actually

194
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:33,892
implement something like that in the space you've got.

195
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:36,873
Although I will mention one at the end of this talk,

196
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:40,914
that a giant company that everybody loves to be named,

197
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:44,715
Never, has worked out and a lot of people actually like it.

198
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:46,956
So that's in the tweetable takeaways portion.

199
00:10:48,101 --> 00:11:00,425
So let's take things out of the realm of theory for a minute and then look at a few examples of how some game companies of varying sizes and with varying giant Scrooge McDuck piles of cash deal with these issues.

200
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:12,808
The first one is everybody's favorite company, Zynga. These guys had a building that existed already that they needed to work with, but it was basically a giant open shell. The key word is gigantic.

201
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,741
Zynga was only a bit more than half of this office,

202
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:19,002
but we're talking about 12 NFL regulation football fields,

203
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:22,284
or nine World Cup football pitches for you people

204
00:11:22,324 --> 00:11:23,584
that like the right kind of football.

205
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:29,166
Each employee has a lot of space in a workspace this size.

206
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:36,249
So none of you might know what square foot per kind of feels

207
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,890
like, but trust me, 140 is, in New York, you're like,

208
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,430
forget it.

209
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:38,871
That's heaven.

210
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:52,012
Heaven. Good. Sorry. So the model that Zynga tried to follow with this was a version of the hybrid plan,

211
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:58,537
where the game teams sit together and the central teams sit together, and each of them had an open seating area

212
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:03,761
that surrounded a small core of collaboration spaces of various sizes.

213
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:12,047
The problem that Zynga tried to address in the most obvious way was that ugly or boring issue that we talked about.

214
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:18,168
So like a lot of Silicon Valley startups made good, these guys bought into the office as

215
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:22,069
playground model that has come to prominence in the last 20 years.

216
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,531
Seriously, Zynga went absolutely goddamn bananas making their office into a 12-year-old boy's

217
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:28,871
dream.

218
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:36,013
And we'll come back in a few minutes to what influence that had on their employees and

219
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:36,413
their outlook.

220
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:40,224
So once you left the common areas of Zynga,

221
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:42,826
the offices don't look that much different

222
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,247
from any other corporate workspace.

223
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:47,890
They have more knickknacks, both employee and company supplied.

224
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,432
But other than that, it looks kind of familiar

225
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:51,953
to anyone who's built software.

226
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,796
Here's how they tried to deal with the key issues

227
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,517
that we identified a few slides ago.

228
00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:58,779
So noise, they had it a little bit easy.

229
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,540
They just had a lot of square feet,

230
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,942
so they could give each employee a lot of square feet.

231
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:05,925
And that dramatically reduces the noise because of physics.

232
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:09,717
visual privacy you see a lot of the time they tried to

233
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:11,663
They didn't use

234
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:17,018
a particularly intense methodology for this, but did what a lot of companies that have

235
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:24,544
prefab office furniture do, which is to get these angled desk pods that you can see here.

236
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:28,908
This is not a perfect solution as you can see, because from where the photographer is

237
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:32,551
standing you can see everybody's monitor and it also looks like pure chaos in the background.

238
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:37,474
But it is a lot better than the triangle shirtwaist factory stuff that you see a lot of other

239
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:40,797
people do where it's just a sweatshop, rows and rows and rows of monitors.

240
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:44,684
Collaboration space, they had a ton of space,

241
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,425
so they could have a lot of collaboration space.

242
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:49,728
And here, again, they tried this hybrid layout

243
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:53,050
where each game team has a physically distinct area,

244
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:56,233
as do the central services folks.

245
00:13:56,993 --> 00:14:00,376
But crucially, within that area, the arrangement

246
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:04,779
was non-standardized and was driven by the folks

247
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:07,482
at the top, the general managers of those games.

248
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,861
Make sure that you note that was driven by leaderships,

249
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,783
because that will come back in a minute.

250
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:15,765
So what was the overall approach?

251
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:18,067
Basically, Zynga is trying very, very hard

252
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:19,348
to make everything fun and playful.

253
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:22,851
The idea, of course, is that if the employees are having fun,

254
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:24,753
it'll be easier for them to make more fun games

255
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:27,256
for the customers, and sometimes this worked,

256
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:30,319
and sometimes it resulted in cognitive dissonance

257
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,382
and forced fun and lots of hate.

258
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:37,285
So this can be absolute cultural poison,

259
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:39,645
but it wasn't the only challenge that Zynga faced

260
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:40,966
with the approach that they chose.

261
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:45,387
It's really expensive to do things like this.

262
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:50,228
And when revenues turn down, the ball pit starts to look goofy.

263
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,969
Scalability, there's only a certain number

264
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:56,730
of people that can fit on the water slide.

265
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,990
When you get more people, you can't

266
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,990
make the water slide any bigger.

267
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:03,760
And importantly, as we were saying before about management

268
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,100
being able to call the shots on how things moved around,

269
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:10,502
this interferes with humans' nesting impulse.

270
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:13,563
People want to have some degree of agency over their space.

271
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:15,364
We see this over and over again.

272
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:19,685
And this is actually a pretty commonly mentioned issue

273
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,066
in white papers and studies.

274
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:24,047
People want to have some control over their space.

275
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:26,308
When you take that away from them, it's not good.

276
00:15:27,464 --> 00:15:30,025
it just sort of increases their degree of nervousness.

277
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:33,567
So a lot of the sort of hipster ad agencies

278
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:35,787
where it's like, well, you don't even have a computer,

279
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:39,009
you just take a notepad and draw on it

280
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:41,790
and sit in the corner and lie on the fake grass

281
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,970
or whatever it is that we've got,

282
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,592
that doesn't often work out.

283
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:49,232
If you're particularly interested,

284
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:52,714
there's a white paper by guys called Fleming and Sturdy,

285
00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:55,755
which is called Being Yourself in the Electronic Sweatshop.

286
00:15:56,212 --> 00:16:03,046
new forms of normative control. That's in Human Relations, which is an academic journal.

287
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:06,533
I'll give you more information on that if you want it at some point.

288
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,869
But so let's take a look at a second space.

289
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,111
Space number two is Three Rings.

290
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:15,693
If you've never been to a meeting or a party there,

291
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:17,254
this place is really unique.

292
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:21,156
The studio is owned by Sega now, but when they opened this office,

293
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:21,897
it was an indie.

294
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:24,799
And they started to take a really dramatic approach

295
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,581
to one of these classic small developer problems of how

296
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:29,002
to build out a white box.

297
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,485
They had a giant Class B loft, really common.

298
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:37,257
You probably have one if you have worked at a small developer.

299
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:38,697
It's just an empty white box.

300
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:45,039
It was about, I guess, 1 10th of a football pitch, so not huge.

301
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,581
And key to this is that what you're about to see here,

302
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:54,383
this steampunk submarine thing, is half of their office,

303
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:58,284
the back half, which was completely redesigned.

304
00:16:58,324 --> 00:17:02,446
The front half stayed very similar to its original build.

305
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:04,692
This is intentionally cozy.

306
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,833
So they actually had quite a bit more space

307
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,074
than they wound up slicing up and giving to the employees

308
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:13,455
on purpose, trying to sort of increase

309
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:17,137
the effort for collaboration by packing everybody

310
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:18,498
into smaller spaces.

311
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,558
So that's quite intentional.

312
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:23,140
And they divided their space up into these small group

313
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,001
work rooms, little pods with four or five folks in them

314
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:29,442
that would be a department working on a game,

315
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:32,023
but not giant.

316
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,100
one giant team of 35 people.

317
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,182
So even small companies, especially in San Francisco,

318
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:39,843
wound up in this perk arms race.

319
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:41,685
According to Three Rings, however,

320
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:44,006
it was practically impossible to hire engineers

321
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:45,707
at this point, and the office actually

322
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:47,609
was a key marketing tool for them.

323
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,411
So despite superficial similarities,

324
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:51,912
this is really a very different use

325
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,754
of architectural playfulness than what we saw with SingIt.

326
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,176
It's also important to note that though

327
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:59,538
the steampunk aesthetic was completely pervasive

328
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,738
in the front half of the office,

329
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,272
This was definitely the party in the back portion of the Three Rings office mullet.

330
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:12,015
There's a much more straightforward space on the other side of a wall that you can't see here.

331
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:17,398
And that has largely become home to the business type functions versus the design and the artwork,

332
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:19,359
which are going on in the submarine.

333
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:24,862
And that's maybe the most literal case of architectural determinism that I have ever seen.

334
00:18:25,422 --> 00:18:29,885
And it does affect the employees, and we'll see how in slide or two.

335
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:32,837
So here's how Three Rings approached those big game

336
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:34,198
development workspace issues.

337
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:35,879
Very different to what Zynga did.

338
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,642
And they did a couple of things that a giant corporation really

339
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:40,142
can't do.

340
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,183
Well, for example, they knew that they

341
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:43,624
weren't going to have a huge noise problem,

342
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,645
because they had a relatively good sized space

343
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:46,846
and very few employees.

344
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:48,667
That's one way to solve that problem,

345
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:51,048
but it's not a call you can necessarily make.

346
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:52,970
For visual privacy, they actually

347
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,532
partitioned up their workspace and faced the desks

348
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:58,353
towards walls and partitions.

349
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:02,936
in order to avoid the problem of having you looking out at, you know, a sea of monitors

350
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:04,458
with visual chaos behind them.

351
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:09,863
Their collaboration spaces, actually as you can see on their layout here, practically

352
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:15,349
all of the office space in this area is designed as a sort of small, informal collaborative

353
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:15,769
space.

354
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,311
And then they also have a...

355
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:22,047
a secret library room that you enter through a bookcase that

356
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:23,068
was a conference.

357
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:24,768
Really, this office space is tremendous.

358
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:28,089
So pardon me if I'm just like goofy about it.

359
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:30,989
The light level was very clever here.

360
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:33,330
They have these big curtains that you

361
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,730
can see over their large loft windows.

362
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,871
And they have custom made light fixture covers

363
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:41,651
that mute the fluorescent lights.

364
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:44,532
So you can kind of adjust the lights in a way.

365
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:51,417
a much more granular way than you saw in a space like Zynga or in a lot of Class B office space.

366
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:59,945
And here they have their teams in separate spaces, but they kind of have a sort of miniature version of the hybrid

367
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:05,610
with individual groups inside teams parked together to encourage collaboration with them.

368
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,155
Unfortunately, they actually only had one private collaborative space.

369
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:16,304
but a lot of this space was available for public collaboration.

370
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:21,066
So the TLDR is that through salesmanship and smart design and luck,

371
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,607
Three Rings was able to give themselves a completely unique environment

372
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:28,269
that functioned as a calling card that explained how the company works

373
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:31,450
and how they think of themselves as you walk through it,

374
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,091
as a visitor or an employee.

375
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:36,633
The major issues that arose, though, are something you probably have already guessed.

376
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,652
Once you have a steampunk submarine in your office,

377
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:43,374
your company is kind of like about having a steampunk

378
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:44,355
submarine in your office.

379
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:49,378
And that introduces a bunch of risks around changing tastes,

380
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:49,979
for example.

381
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,481
You're maybe not always going to want a steampunk submarine.

382
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:58,605
Packing all of these people into tight spaces on purpose

383
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:02,167
can obviously introduce some issues as well.

384
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:05,049
And the fact that you're sort of basically

385
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:06,330
stuck with what you've got.

386
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:11,211
Tom Schofield, who is one of the principals at Three Rings, told me,

387
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:16,755
the way we thought of it was, anything works in here as long as it fits in a steampunk submarine.

388
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:22,960
So it's a little bit deterministic, but obviously there's some big upside.

389
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,604
So the final case study that I'm going to take a look at looks at a totally different type of space.

390
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:32,627
This is a very different space, a very different budget, and a totally different set of requirements.

391
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:38,401
This is New York's Waka Waka, which is a game development co-working space and incubator

392
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:43,603
in the trendy Lower East Side, located in a former storefront tattoo parlor.

393
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:49,205
This space was inherited and tweaked, but in a lot of ways it's the same type of space

394
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:52,286
that it was when it was an art gallery a few tenants ago.

395
00:21:53,086 --> 00:21:58,888
It's a small open room, and it's long and narrow, which rules out a lot of the desk

396
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:00,509
layouts that we talked about before.

397
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:08,620
Though without any real permanent walls, it's quite flexible and it has a second story and a tiny little yard that can be configured in a few different ways.

398
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:16,445
So, check this out. Even a 2,000 square foot office makes an amenity play in its own way.

399
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:17,886
So that maybe tells us something.

400
00:22:18,446 --> 00:22:22,489
People like to say that they don't care about perks that much, like this cool little backyard.

401
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:26,712
But again, we see a significant effort to maximize the available resources.

402
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:29,729
Waka Waka doesn't have much furniture in it at all,

403
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:33,232
but what is there is high quality and extremely stylish.

404
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:37,196
Flexibility and minimalist chic are just overflowing here.

405
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:40,820
And this sort of underscores the aspirational aspect

406
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,161
of workspace design.

407
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:47,887
Is it showing two different things or something?

408
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,188
All right, cool.

409
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,589
So we don't actually really design a workspace

410
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:56,591
around our employees so much as we

411
00:22:57,051 --> 00:22:58,992
create a space that looks like it's already

412
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,773
home to the type of people that we want working in it.

413
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:06,315
And whether that's a feature or a bug,

414
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,916
we kind of, that's up to us to figure out.

415
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:11,785
So how did Waka Waka address the big issues?

416
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,547
It's harder for them than for Three Rings or Zynga

417
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,968
because they couldn't really choose much about how

418
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:19,730
their space is laid out, about what materials it's made out of.

419
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,131
It's really noisy if there are a lot of people in there.

420
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,313
The whole thing is made out of polished concrete.

421
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:26,893
Now they've done what they can about that.

422
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,615
As you can see, even the desk is made out

423
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:31,136
of noise baffling material.

424
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:34,418
And they've got a bunch of noise baffles hanging on the wall.

425
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:35,478
So they are smart about it.

426
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,160
As far as visual privacy goes.

427
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:40,147
there's really only two options.

428
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:42,789
You could have everybody facing directly into a white wall.

429
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,190
Not great.

430
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,772
Or you could have everyone sort of looking

431
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,773
at a maximum of one other person.

432
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:50,474
And that's what they did.

433
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:54,377
For a collaboration space, this is kind of tricky.

434
00:23:54,678 --> 00:23:56,579
The studio amenities and infrastructure

435
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:59,461
are shared between everyone that's in there.

436
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:01,723
It's kind of a big open space.

437
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:03,044
They have a little area in the back

438
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:05,666
that you can sort of see there that has a couch.

439
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:06,066
And

440
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,212
Their backyard is also sort of an ad hoc collaboration space,

441
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:11,333
as is their downstairs.

442
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:13,794
But ultimately, there aren't very many walls.

443
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:16,776
So there's a limit to what you can do.

444
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:20,518
Now, the layout, of course, can change.

445
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:22,679
Other than getting new giant desks,

446
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,400
they can switch things up.

447
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,141
But at the end of the day, there's

448
00:24:27,181 --> 00:24:28,742
not much solitude that's possible.

449
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:33,307
So what the core of WakaWaka's workspace approach

450
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:35,328
is about allowing small independent teams

451
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:37,349
to work in close proximity to each other

452
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:40,590
and share facilities that they could otherwise never afford.

453
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:43,672
This office signifies to potential coworkers

454
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:45,553
and to those visiting that the people who work here

455
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:48,454
understand the indie game aesthetic through and through.

456
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:51,916
It's sparse, but precise, and above all else,

457
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:54,778
it's elegant in both functional and visual design.

458
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:57,399
So this works to attract like-minded collaborators.

459
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:01,482
And it immediately tells a compelling story to, for example,

460
00:25:01,662 --> 00:25:04,845
visiting publishers who are attending meetings with the developers that are based here.

461
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,027
This approach definitely comes with some real challenges, however.

462
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,528
The space is small,

463
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:16,574
and there's no real layout choices.

464
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:20,197
So the various privacy concerns are magnified tremendously.

465
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:21,998
There's also the question of scale.

466
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:25,321
If you succeed here, you kind of have to leave.

467
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:28,463
So this randomizes the balance of the people in the space,

468
00:25:28,503 --> 00:25:30,664
and that can be a huge issue in a workspace

469
00:25:30,704 --> 00:25:32,846
that's only got about a dozen other folks in there.

470
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,789
The materials we talked about, it's all polished concrete,

471
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,171
so they couldn't really do too much with that,

472
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:41,133
but they kind of ran with it

473
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:42,694
rather than trying to fight against it.

474
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,057
It's TBD how well that works out.

475
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,539
And then on top of the challenge

476
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,920
of people scaling out of the office.

477
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,831
You really have to trust the curation instincts of the people

478
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:55,691
that run this space.

479
00:25:55,731 --> 00:25:58,612
Now, this particular workspace is run by game business

480
00:25:58,652 --> 00:25:59,052
veterans.

481
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:01,092
But if that's not always the case,

482
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:04,333
then you could wind up in here with whoever

483
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:06,353
they were able to get to fill the seats in order

484
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:07,613
to pay the rent.

485
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:10,894
So at last, here are the tweetable takeaways.

486
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:12,954
I'm going to put them up there one by one.

487
00:26:13,014 --> 00:26:15,935
So maybe wait till the end if you want to take a picture.

488
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:18,435
And I'll also make this whole deck available digitally

489
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:19,735
if you want it as well.

490
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:27,058
So let's try to distill some of the most significant findings from my research and the survey and the interviews and these case studies.

491
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:37,507
So we'll continue this conversation with each other and the rest of our discipline and maybe for some of you with the people you work with as you contemplate the design or redesign of your own development space.

492
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:42,932
First, disciplines differ. Now this is huge.

493
00:26:43,493 --> 00:26:48,736
Engineers do not have the same requirements as designers or artists or marketers.

494
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:53,078
If you have one type of space for all of these different types of folks, you're setting yourself

495
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:54,339
up for a big challenge.

496
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:59,102
Even in a small studio, you have to do what you can to make sure that there's quiet space

497
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:03,764
and collaboration space available and that they're as distinct and distant physically

498
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,365
from each other as possible.

499
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:12,019
Privacy. Too much noise, as I mentioned, was the number one thing that people mentioned

500
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:17,783
in the survey, but close behind it were a few different types of issues around privacy.

501
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:23,488
Physical privacy and visual privacy are separate, and they're both very important. Game developers,

502
00:27:23,528 --> 00:27:26,991
like everybody else, don't want to feel like they're being monitored in a time and motion

503
00:27:27,051 --> 00:27:31,815
study by their bosses all day long. So if we're already going out of our way to provide

504
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:34,637
jellybean foot baths delivered fresh daily by Uber...

505
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:40,982
It's irresponsible not to contemplate providing phone booths or arranging your monitors so

506
00:27:41,002 --> 00:27:44,807
that people can read Kotaku when they're burned out for a few minutes without worrying that

507
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:45,668
they're going to get fired.

508
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:50,353
There are better ways to find out if your employees are shirking their responsibilities

509
00:27:50,393 --> 00:27:52,896
than by fixing all their screens towards the boss.

510
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,023
is an important and enormous part of what we do.

511
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:03,006
About a third of the folks we spoke to said that their offices needed more

512
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:03,546
meeting rooms.

513
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:07,210
When we change the phrasing to talk about general collaborative space,

514
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,292
that number shot through the roof. So people are

515
00:28:10,652 --> 00:28:14,516
are empathetic. They don't want to disturb their colleagues. A lot of times

516
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:15,136
folks just

517
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:18,939
flat-out won't talk to people that they would benefit by talking to

518
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,843
because there's nowhere to do it without disturbing somebody else.

519
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,730
There are a lot of innovative ideas

520
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,272
about how to make this work, even in a really low square

521
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:30,513
footage space, like the backyard at Waka Waka or some others.

522
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:32,734
So if you're interested in going into greater depth

523
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,096
on this particular issue, drop me a line.

524
00:28:35,156 --> 00:28:36,977
I'll give you my contact information,

525
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:38,497
or you can come up to me afterwards,

526
00:28:38,557 --> 00:28:40,778
and I can offer some concepts for you.

527
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:44,600
As I was researching this topic and speaking

528
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,481
with interior designers and architects,

529
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:48,002
I kept hearing over and over again

530
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,764
how important it is to consult with the people that

531
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:53,065
are going to use the office during your design process.

532
00:28:53,604 --> 00:28:56,947
The impact of coming in on a Monday morning and having everything be in a totally different

533
00:28:57,007 --> 00:29:01,712
spot or of seeing people roam around with measuring tapes and lasers taking measurements

534
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:04,075
and jotting things down without knowing why they're there.

535
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,022
or what's going to happen to your workplace is huge.

536
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:09,665
That's that nesting instinct that we talked about before.

537
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:10,726
And we know this.

538
00:29:11,306 --> 00:29:12,487
This is community management.

539
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:13,728
This is usability testing.

540
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:14,789
And we do this in our games.

541
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,832
If you're designing a space, take some time

542
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:20,114
and talk to the people that are going to be using it.

543
00:29:21,456 --> 00:29:23,878
Although a game can sometimes be a passion project

544
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:27,541
and a work of one genius's singular vision.

545
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,313
It would be pretty unique to imagine an office space that way.

546
00:29:33,153 --> 00:29:33,654
So don't do it.

547
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:36,095
Personal space.

548
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:40,518
We've mentioned this a lot and this is something that you probably have less

549
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:44,121
control over in your space, just down to raw square footage concerns.

550
00:29:44,641 --> 00:29:50,105
But even in really small areas, remember to do what you can to, you know,

551
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:52,026
just alter the layout.

552
00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:55,488
Make it possible for people to feel like there's a little bit of personal space.

553
00:29:55,848 --> 00:30:01,253
Even if that just means, in a couple of places I've seen, literal actual phone booths put

554
00:30:01,294 --> 00:30:04,937
up in the corner so that people don't have to, you know, hover over by the kitchen to

555
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:05,758
make a phone call.

556
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,283
This helps people feel like they have some control.

557
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:16,733
So about that super scheme that I mentioned before.

558
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:20,134
So a hybrid layout.

559
00:30:20,174 --> 00:30:23,655
So this is one of these very popular companies

560
00:30:23,675 --> 00:30:24,355
that everybody loves.

561
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:28,096
Designed this system where there are pods of about four to six

562
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:29,196
people with desks.

563
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:31,857
Each one of those pods is self-assembled,

564
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,817
but it's always from the same game team,

565
00:30:34,357 --> 00:30:36,418
and sometimes within the same discipline.

566
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,918
Each pod has a separate meeting room.

567
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,162
and a small separate private collaboration area,

568
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:45,203
as well as being located around a central space

569
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:47,985
that everyone can just kind of rotate their desks into.

570
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:50,246
In case you happen to have a jillion dollars

571
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:53,528
and can build out a space that works like this,

572
00:30:53,928 --> 00:30:55,409
the people that worked in that space

573
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:57,170
gave tremendously good reviews.

574
00:30:57,931 --> 00:30:59,172
So that's something to think about.

575
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:01,315
And then lastly, perks.

576
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:03,516
I have a lot of data from the survey about this,

577
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:04,396
but here's the bottom line.

578
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:05,737
You have to have something.

579
00:31:06,457 --> 00:31:08,698
The lack of space to play games in I mentioned before

580
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:10,578
was mentioned about a fifth of our respondents.

581
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,599
People notice when the office is super square,

582
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:15,580
but there is definitely, definitely such a thing

583
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,520
is too much of a good thing.

584
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:21,362
About 33% of our survey respondents said that the reason they think their companies provide

585
00:31:21,402 --> 00:31:26,104
them with these fun perks was to keep them at their desks for longer hours.

586
00:31:27,245 --> 00:31:31,507
So even if this is not true in your office, you have to take into account that some people

587
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:32,807
are going to think that it's true.

588
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:38,190
So remember that before the guys show up delivering your three-story water slide.

589
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:46,471
So, we probably don't have any time for any questions at all, but this is my contact information.

590
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:49,633
If you can't see it, just walk up, I'll give you a business card.

591
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:55,057
And there's also a room that I can go to where I'll just stand outside and talk to you.

592
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,101
It's, what did you say it was three?

593
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:00,962
2002, so maybe I'll go there.

594
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:04,438
Hey, give me a good rating.

595
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:06,363
Those people will email you stuff,

596
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:08,369
and it'll say give me a good rating,

597
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:09,151
so give me a good rating.

598
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:10,655
Thanks, everybody.
