1
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:09,654
Thank you for coming and choosing to listen to me.

2
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:13,857
I'm Em, and I'm a sound designer at A Shell in the Pit Audio.

3
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:18,140
And today I hope that I can help give some insight

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,661
into how sound can help with storytelling.

5
00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:24,404
It's been the focus of my work for a while now,

6
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:27,906
and I think it'd be great if everyone

7
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:29,687
paid more attention to it.

8
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,281
Night in the Woods was an inspiration to work on as a sound designer.

9
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:41,585
The writers Scott Benson and Bethany Hockenberry included a whole bunch of sound into the story

10
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:47,910
and Alec Holowka incorporated it into the music as a cohesive whole.

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,331
Alec's right there.

12
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:55,688
And Gordon Mclattery and Joey van Alden of A Shell in the Pit

13
00:00:56,028 --> 00:01:00,611
gave me a ton of support to explore, as well as actual

14
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:04,513
sound and moral and creative support. Joey also did the

15
00:01:04,553 --> 00:01:08,635
sound for Demon Tower, the game within the game. So the sound

16
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:12,137
design and these ideas I'll be sharing, were a collaboration

17
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:19,481
between all of us. So this is a story about a place and a time.

18
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:22,860
It's told through setting, atmosphere, and characters.

19
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:25,963
And my goal with the sound was to reflect this

20
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:27,744
and bring you closer into the setting

21
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:30,186
to make you feel as though you are May

22
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:32,647
feeling as she would feel in this place.

23
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:37,031
And so every one of the 5,090 sounds in the game

24
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,072
make a contribution to the story.

25
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:43,115
Even with the foley, Scott gave me the direction

26
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:45,697
to make May's footsteps and cloth sound

27
00:01:45,777 --> 00:01:48,459
as if she were an ungraceful potato sack.

28
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:57,501
So these two television characters also add by helping establish the mood in this opening scene.

29
00:01:58,742 --> 00:02:03,824
Even without looking at the dialogue, things feel a little bit ridiculous and a little bit off.

30
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:11,488
There are awkward silences, laughter, clapping, all entwined with the voices to make it feel alive.

31
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:19,932
Being alive in terms of sound means chaos.

32
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:24,439
It means that if there is a repetitive action, like this conversation,

33
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,761
there will be a corresponding set of variable sounds that trigger randomly.

34
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:33,964
Being alive also means rhythm and movement in everything.

35
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:39,186
It means that sound comes from both known and unknown sources.

36
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:47,686
That sense of liveliness is all bundled up under the umbrella of

37
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:53,827
feeling. To be alive is to feel so everything inside every scene

38
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:58,708
has its own mood. How do you feel about being here? And why?

39
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:08,210
I made each different ambience by taking the feelings Scott's

40
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,270
art gave me and giving them voice.

41
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,601
Literally, what better way to convey a sense of life than

42
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:19,624
human breath. So I use my own voice for a lot of the sound

43
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:23,246
effects and ambiences. I made most of the wind sounds by

44
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:27,790
blowing into the microphone like this, and cutting them into

45
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,312
short segments that faded in and out and turning it into a

46
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:34,395
scatterer ambience, which is a sound that gets triggered at

47
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:38,498
random time intervals, as well as a random position in space.

48
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,583
I used this particular layer as an element in almost every

49
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:47,928
outdoor scene to create a persistent lonely atmosphere. And

50
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:51,792
I reuse signature or thematic sounds a lot because I find it

51
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:56,417
helps in manipulating you subconsciously. Also, this was

52
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:59,861
our implementation tool of choice f mod, not going to talk

53
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:00,762
too much about it, though.

54
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:06,351
So here the fireflies change from fluttering to chirping

55
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:07,712
when you jump into a swarm,

56
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:09,193
like they're excited to be with you.

57
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:12,175
They react both visually and audibly.

58
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:16,999
So in the real world, we react to things as they happen.

59
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:18,580
They give us memories.

60
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,341
We live with all of our senses.

61
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:23,743
So having a character react to a sound

62
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,485
at the same time you're experiencing it

63
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:28,126
makes it feel as though all the elements belong together.

64
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,951
like this is a real world.

65
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:33,872
I was pretty excited to discover moments like this

66
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:34,733
throughout the script.

67
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:39,856
And a fun fact is that the sound of one firefly

68
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,777
is actually the sound of a bunch of frogs.

69
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,561
So in this real world, the characters have their own agency.

70
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:52,236
This ambience was one of the first ones I made.

71
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:55,857
I wanted to give Mae's home a comforting sense of life.

72
00:04:56,157 --> 00:04:59,018
And so I decided this meant waking up and hearing your mom

73
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:01,379
bustling around downstairs and humming.

74
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,159
Later in the process, Alec pointed out

75
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,640
that it didn't make too much sense

76
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,200
because when you go downstairs,

77
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,720
Mae's mom is just sitting there reading.

78
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,021
But instead of taking it out,

79
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:13,621
I decided to create a little narrative each morning

80
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,782
and have Mae's mom finish up and sit down

81
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:19,663
right as you come down the stairs.

82
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:23,858
So this is an example of a sound coming from an unknown source

83
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:27,999
as and it also has the special purpose of letting you know that

84
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:35,902
she's there to talk to if you want. Where is Angus off to?

85
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:44,789
Yes, grabbing the USB stick he has handy under a couple pieces of paper on his desk.

86
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,114
Off screen sound can really help if you don't have enough time to animate everything and

87
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:52,777
it doesn't have to be something that was left out, it can be a choice.

88
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:56,194
That rummaging sound only took a couple minutes to make,

89
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:58,376
so you can really use that to your advantage.

90
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:00,718
If you're a writer, you can plan for it,

91
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,099
and if you're a sound designer,

92
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,341
you can look carefully for those moments

93
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:07,965
where you can add continuing movement and fluidity

94
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:10,147
and connect little narrative threads.

95
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,571
And it doesn't have to be an obvious action either.

96
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:18,435
Just like May's house, this location has its own story,

97
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,916
and we can hear the neighbors, which

98
00:06:20,976 --> 00:06:23,416
hints that Angus and his partner Greg

99
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:26,297
live in a less than ideal location with thin walls.

100
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:29,178
And it tells us that they live among people who

101
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:31,099
are living their own story.

102
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,159
They're watching a movie, and it's

103
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,680
outside of what we're experiencing

104
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,880
with the main characters.

105
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:45,187
So we come back to the town every day, so it was important to enhance that sense of

106
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,888
liveliness.

107
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:51,734
The telephone wires respond to us, sounding higher in pitch in the end and lower in the

108
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:55,158
middle, and they have a higher probability of rattling in the middle.

109
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,381
Everything we can jump on responds to us differently.

110
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:05,742
The squirrels react to the environment

111
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:07,383
outside of what the player is doing,

112
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:09,784
filling the landscape with little footsteps

113
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:10,885
on each different surface.

114
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:14,167
And to achieve this effect, I took a little rock

115
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:17,188
and tapped it against some concrete or a chair

116
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:18,729
or my guitar strings,

117
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:20,690
which is what the telephone wires are made of.

118
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:26,113
And I also made the car sounds using a highly advanced

119
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,575
and unique process, which I will demonstrate now.

120
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,935
The main town ambience is filled with randomly triggering sounds.

121
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:46,918
The train from earlier passing by every 90 to 300 seconds.

122
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:52,121
Townspeople that we can't see are calling out to one another and we've got the wind

123
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,303
and birds chirping between one to three seconds.

124
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,930
Each different time interval was a deliberate choice that said something.

125
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:14,153
So this is a kind of a silly detail, but the pigeons have a 44% chance of pecking a seed

126
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:16,334
and a lower chance of breaking it open.

127
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:27,558
It seems minute, but adding probability helps make the world sound less repetitive.

128
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,582
And as creators of this world, we never know how intimate you're going to get with any

129
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:33,362
given space.

130
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:43,490
I did all this detail to help sell the idea, again, that you are May, and you're waking

131
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,212
up every day and moving through this ever-changing town.

132
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:48,794
And it does change visually as well.

133
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,095
Everything is centered around the passing of time.

134
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,981
So if you decide to stand in one place for a while, you'll hear more than a loop.

135
00:08:56,481 --> 00:09:03,569
The ambiances were designed to situate you in time and in the spirit of the many procedural visuals are always random.

136
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:10,116
So ambiances were really important in the sound design of this game.

137
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,441
Each different atmosphere was another opportunity for immersion.

138
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:20,982
Whether it's hissing pipes passing by, a reverb that suggests a deep, dark tunnel, or a chef

139
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:23,423
who's humming along to the background music every day.

140
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:28,904
We took all the opportunities we could think of to blend sound effects and music together.

141
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:29,664
Like here.

142
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:36,222
Alec, who is the composer, asked for the sound of the train to

143
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:40,265
have the same BPM as the music. The sound effect actually made

144
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:50,433
it onto the soundtrack, which I was pretty excited about. And

145
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:54,055
we often used a real time parameter control to determine

146
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:57,358
how sounds change based on the game state or your actions.

147
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:06,719
So in this case, I like the idea that as you climb higher in the town, the wind builds up and the music loses its low frequencies and gets quieter.

148
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:15,026
So this bottom track is a gradual high-pass filter and the two top tracks are the wind fading in.

149
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:23,433
So once you get to the top, you can hear once again that lonely wind and it creates a moment for me.

150
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,819
It feels different than standing on the street like you've

151
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,142
accomplished something. And you can listen to the pigeons

152
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:31,083
finding seeds.

153
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:39,510
Similarly, when you walk into a store, the music is different

154
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,152
than on the street. It is diegetic, which means that it

155
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,614
exists for the characters and the story as a part of their

156
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:49,097
world. And so here it sounds as if it's coming from the

157
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:50,238
speakers in this location.

158
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:54,473
Which if it interests you, I made happen with a convolution

159
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:58,755
reverb called fog convolver, a little bit of EQ and some delay.

160
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:06,679
Diegetic music can really help create moments and affect mood.

161
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,002
So here May and her friend B are having an argument. In the

162
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,623
middle of the conversation, the record that was playing fades

163
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:17,625
out, and you're left hearing the needle. It makes things serious

164
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:18,446
and uncomfortable.

165
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,831
And sometimes silence is more powerful than music.

166
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:26,632
And it can make music more meaningful in contrast.

167
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:29,572
So we should try to avoid carpet bombing our stories

168
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:31,253
with music, even if it's super good.

169
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:33,613
I think that we should choose our moments for both.

170
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:39,794
We can also get creative with how we transition

171
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:40,895
from one song to another.

172
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:43,755
So how would someone playing obnoxious guitar

173
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:44,875
at a real party do it?

174
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:54,362
When we first started in on the sound design work,

175
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:56,143
we weren't sure whether or not to include

176
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:57,204
some kind of voiceover.

177
00:11:57,224 --> 00:12:00,526
I knew we had made the right decision to omit it

178
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,367
the first time I watched someone stream the game.

179
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:06,169
They read all the lines in different silly voices

180
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,590
and it seemed to me as if they were really able

181
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,851
to embody the characters.

182
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:13,173
And I think our voices might have got in the way

183
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:14,133
of that a little bit.

184
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:20,530
This wasn't immediately obvious, though, so the original plan was to trigger a vocalization

185
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,691
of a single emotion for each different speech bubble.

186
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:29,052
We did have an elaborate range of emotions that we recorded in the voices of May, Greg,

187
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:34,694
and Bruce, and it wasn't until the team tested these out together that we realized that it

188
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:38,375
would be unrealistic to implement them all on top of the creative reasons.

189
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:43,897
But here's a small sampling of some of the emotions, starting with May.

190
00:12:45,177 --> 00:12:46,538
This is exasperated.

191
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:52,483
And here's weird.

192
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,004
Chuckle.

193
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:55,845
Sarcastic.

194
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:58,547
Which probably would have been used a lot.

195
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:58,787
Annoyed.

196
00:12:58,807 --> 00:12:59,488
And here's weird.

197
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:01,209
Chuckle.

198
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:04,651
Sarcastic.

199
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,774
Which probably would have been used a lot.

200
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:10,215
Annoyed.

201
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,990
This one is drunk.

202
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:30,359
We had a lot of fun doing these.

203
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,001
And this is mischievous.

204
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,404
And jump which actually did make it into the game.

205
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,366
As well as injured.

206
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:49,522
And this was a range of Greg who is particularly weird because we were trying to base him off a fox

207
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,564
I don't know if you've ever heard of Fox

208
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:56,229
With a mix of a dude Scott showed us from a reality show

209
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,310
That's all of that.

210
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,091
There's a lot more of those too.

211
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:23,231
I did however using a lot of voice work

212
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:24,532
for background characters.

213
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,652
In this case to make it feel like there are

214
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:30,153
real live weirdos getting drunk in the woods.

215
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:33,653
And I say weirdos because if you actually listen

216
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:39,975
to what's going on, again, it's pretty strange.

217
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:42,335
Greg Lobanov and Chris Tammack helped me out

218
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,035
with most of these.

219
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,957
and we didn't give each other much direction,

220
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:48,838
just kind of went nuts and saw how much

221
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:49,879
we could make each other laugh.

222
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
For some of it, we even went into the woods

223
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,101
to capture the space and probably seriously

224
00:14:56,161 --> 00:15:00,443
freaked some people out.

225
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,844
So be as weird as possible because sometimes

226
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,545
something you laugh forever at with a friend

227
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,606
is also something other people think is funny.

228
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:12,588
This was turned into a 10 hour YouTube video.

229
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,012
We also all voice different genders because I think it's always good to blur those lines.

230
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:32,433
Another fun fact is that I can do a pretty good grandpa laugh.

231
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:45,729
So be weird and always be imagining what could be happening in each different space.

232
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:49,052
I imagine this loudspeaker lady being really bored.

233
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:54,176
Like maybe she's actually just sputtering nonsense because it's all she has to do.

234
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,622
So now we can talk about the fun, creepy stuff.

235
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:06,247
For May's dreams, I once again breathed weirdly into a microphone.

236
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:09,009
This time with as much creepy intention as possible.

237
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:12,920
I made a palette of sounds to use in connection with these

238
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:17,265
extra astral projections Mae starts having. I made one sound

239
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:20,569
especially for the dark being in the universe who I won't say too

240
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:24,033
much about except that if you listen, you'll hear a deep, slow

241
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,116
pitch down breathing track.

242
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,700
and to get you more into maze head during the scary scenes or

243
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,762
when you're sleeping. I also recorded some shallow breathing

244
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:49,788
using binaural microphones so it can sound like your own. I also

245
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:53,891
use some of these sounds as scatterers. So they behave just

246
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:59,254
like the wind I talked about before. And I did in a few

247
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:01,576
cases add too much detail.

248
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:04,765
and had to scale back for performance issue reasons.

249
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,286
So if I did it again, I would start

250
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:09,267
by making the ambiences more condensed,

251
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,487
but it was a learning process.

252
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:16,248
So my interpretation of this dream

253
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,609
is that a tear is made in the universe,

254
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,290
and it unleashes all the horrible sounds that

255
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,371
continue to pop up after this, as if it breaks open May's head

256
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:28,032
and leaves a portal to this dimension.

257
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:32,088
which is why I added all those ambient layers to this big, important moment.

258
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:34,529
So you make those associations. ♪♪

259
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:49,376
And this breathing track that comes in now was actually an accident,

260
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,738
where for some reason the track and the event itself didn't fade out

261
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:55,079
with the rest of the sound between scene transitions.

262
00:17:56,274 --> 00:18:02,237
But I think sometimes accidents and the randomness of the system kind of work and I ended up quite liking that effect

263
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:12,302
So I took those signature sounds from the dreams and placed them at moments in the story in the real world that meant something

264
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:14,403
To emphasize a connection

265
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:22,287
I added the sound whenever a particular being is around and made it get louder the longer you stay there using an AD HSR

266
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,452
And I imagined again that it's coming from Mae's head as if you're hearing what she's hearing.

267
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:32,294
And I didn't do any of this imagining that you would think about it consciously.

268
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:36,855
But I think that just because something is unconsciously noticed doesn't mean it's not

269
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:41,417
working as a functional part of the story. And it doesn't mean it's not noticed at all.

270
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:47,319
Sound is an emotion. It's an intangible feeling. And we notice the feelings it gives us.

271
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,172
Even if we don't pinpoint the source.

272
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:54,594
I didn't find that discouraging, but I find it powerful.

273
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:57,155
One of my least favorite expressions

274
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:58,976
in the sound design industry is that

275
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:01,777
if you've done a good job, people won't notice.

276
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:06,159
And I would argue that we shouldn't seek to go unnoticed,

277
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,260
but instead to provoke people into listening

278
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,641
by making them feel shit.

279
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:16,564
And sometimes the game can respond to the sound.

280
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:21,946
I implemented that signature sound idea and was surprised and super excited to discover

281
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,846
it written into the story later on.

282
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:42,933
I got this idea to try to affect you emotionally with a signature sound from inside.

283
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:48,078
I was terrified by the horrible water demon in that game, and I realized that I could

284
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:53,201
tell when it was near because it would play an ominous musical tone, which I first noticed

285
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:58,524
when I approached a hatch, and it had been placed there as a spot ambience, and I felt

286
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,184
fear building.

287
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:03,166
And I didn't want to open the door and confront the creature, and he would be there.

288
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:05,988
I spent a long time just standing there.

289
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,481
And it made a huge emotional impact.

290
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:11,022
So whenever May is approaching something dark,

291
00:20:11,102 --> 00:20:13,223
the volume of the horrible sound is increased

292
00:20:13,243 --> 00:20:13,983
the closer you get.

293
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:17,825
I wanted to make you uneasy and reluctant to move forward.

294
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:21,387
So when May starts out on the right in this scene,

295
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:22,767
you can hear an active forest.

296
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:25,128
There are birds and movement in the bushes.

297
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,589
And as you progress, they all go silent,

298
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:29,030
which again was all in the script.

299
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,371
And then as the horrible sound,

300
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:33,171
then the horrible sound starts coming in.

301
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:07,675
And that loud sound you heard has a very specific purpose in this story, but I won't say what

302
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:07,795
it is.

303
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:16,581
So to give you a little summary with interactive narrative,

304
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:18,921
all the different possible ways the game could sound

305
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,542
is what turns it into something special.

306
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:24,023
Just like in life, the world responds to our actions.

307
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:25,844
It would be impossible to predict

308
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:26,824
all the interpretations.

309
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:29,545
But what I tried to do here was lay out the clues

310
00:21:29,725 --> 00:21:31,146
and suggest certain feelings.

311
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:35,407
I went about it by playing the game over and over and over

312
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:37,548
with an open mind, each time trying

313
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,448
to think of what details might be noticed.

314
00:21:40,563 --> 00:21:45,785
I was always trying to make connections, influence emotion, and insinuate that the characters

315
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:49,366
are doing their own thing, and that the world is changing.

316
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,452
So this neat little presentation may have made it seem like I knew what I was doing

317
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:09,413
all along, but I want to assure you that at the time, I certainly did not feel that way.

318
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:13,376
It was a learning process and it wasn't as succinct as this.

319
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:16,958
And I say this to encourage you not to worry about that in yourselves.

320
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:21,662
I was able to do this work just because I loved what I was doing and I loved this game

321
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,905
and I immersed myself in it and didn't think about all the people that were going to play.

322
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:30,488
I pushed away my awareness that this was my first release as the lead sound designer.

323
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:33,896
and didn't let that make me too afraid to try all this stuff.

324
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:35,997
I just did what I know.

325
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:40,440
I got weird, and I experimented and followed my intuition

326
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,621
along the lines of what the team created.

327
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:46,163
And on the topic of encouragement,

328
00:22:46,263 --> 00:22:49,265
I'll also mention that coming to speak at GDC

329
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:52,387
was real scary for me, but I did it anyway

330
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:54,889
because I think that we who might be more anxious

331
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:57,790
about this sort of thing, especially as few women

332
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,612
are not binary people in games.

333
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:04,743
And even fewer in game audio need to start pushing that fear of being seen away and show

334
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:08,126
each other that we are here and that we are doing cool stuff.

335
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:13,450
And that being here is lots of fun, so if you want to get into this kind of career,

336
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,032
you should, no matter who you are.

337
00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:18,775
And once you do, don't be afraid to put yourselves out there.

338
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:23,679
I think each time you do something like this, you grow exponentially with it.

339
00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:36,466
Lastly, I want to stress again how much of a team effort the sound was, especially with Alec, and I can't really express how lucky I feel to have been able to work on a project like this with these people.

340
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:46,889
So try to find people who inspire you to tell stories, and keep thinking of new ways to tell stories, and think about how much sound can impact those stories.

341
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,971
We have a lot more exploring to do.

342
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:53,812
So let Charcoal lead you to the stars.

343
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:56,293
Thank you.

344
00:23:57,113 --> 00:24:15,697
So I think we have time for questions.

345
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:17,078
Do we have time for questions?

346
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:17,698
Okay.

347
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:19,759
So you can ask those now.

348
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,240
Here's my Twitter also.

349
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:25,284
I think there's a microphone if you have them.

350
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:30,550
That's cool too if no one does.

351
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:37,737
Hey, so very good talk.

352
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:38,218
Thank you for it.

353
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:46,554
One thing that I got out of this and out of playing Night in the Woods was that I really

354
00:24:46,594 --> 00:24:52,982
appreciated your ability to do so much with so little and to really contribute to crafting

355
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:55,905
this world with such a delicate touch.

356
00:24:56,346 --> 00:24:59,369
And I'm wondering if you have any tips for...

357
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:10,385
So I'm coming from, as a sound designer, I feel like a lot of what I need to do to feel like a good sound designer is focus a lot on quite the opposite.

358
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:12,446
It's putting more and more into it.

359
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:17,809
And I'm wondering if you have any tips on how to train that sort of restraint and focus on the little details.

360
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:25,980
I would say to, I guess my strategy is to record as much as possible.

361
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,785
So when I use library sounds, I often tend to put a lot of layers in,

362
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:40,510
as opposed to just finding the right sound that you don't need to add more to make sound good.

363
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:46,154
And I think, yeah, going out and just finding it in real life and recording it.

364
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:48,866
is a nice way to do that.

365
00:25:48,886 --> 00:25:50,307
Makes sense, thanks.

366
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,248
Yeah, no problem.

367
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,230
Hi.

368
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,432
Hi, was there a particular environment or set of sounds

369
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:59,233
that you found particularly challenging?

370
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:06,958
I think, I guess, I don't know if it

371
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,040
was particularly challenging.

372
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,242
But all the dark sequences definitely

373
00:26:12,282 --> 00:26:13,382
took a lot more effort.

374
00:26:14,704 --> 00:26:22,130
the dreams. I went through a lot of iteration where I was constantly going back and tweaking

375
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,715
little things. They felt really important in the story, so I wanted to make sure they

376
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:28,736
were just right.

377
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:32,286
Hello.

378
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:33,567
Hello.

379
00:26:33,987 --> 00:26:39,349
So as someone who also really loves recording just a bunch of random things and like finding

380
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:47,033
cool combinations, what was the most fun or like weird thing you foleyed for the game?

381
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:59,358
I think, I mean, it's not really foley, but the weirdest stuff we recorded I think was

382
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:00,238
definitely the voices.

383
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:00,459
Yeah.

384
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:00,859
Yeah.

385
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:01,159
It's so weird.

386
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:01,439
It's so weird.

387
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:11,150
Um, I, yeah, it's kind of hard to remember everything, but I'll just say the voices.

388
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:16,715
They're very good.

389
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,336
Hi, brilliant presentation, you should be proud.

390
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:19,057
Thank you.

391
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:27,404
You mentioned at one point you sometimes went a little too far, and like were going into too much detail or complexity in designing something.

392
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:33,411
when that was happening, how did you, what made you realize you were going further than

393
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:37,915
you needed to? Did you realize yourself or did other people say, maybe we don't need

394
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:38,315
this much?

395
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:46,421
Well, it, when I really realized it, it was technical and it was actually, it was kind

396
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:53,486
of a mix of going too far and also just setting stuff up wrong. So I, uh, had all of these

397
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,968
layers in the town ambience and one of them

398
00:27:56,876 --> 00:28:02,678
was a scatterer, which is the one that gets triggered at a random time, and I had it getting

399
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:09,081
triggered, like, way too frequently, and it was just a mistake, and it kind of made me

400
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:16,604
go back and reevaluate, you know, how many voices I was using and think about performance

401
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:18,044
a little more on a whole.

402
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:24,407
So but and it just made me realize that that's a really good thing to do from the start.

403
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:26,139
Thank you very much.

404
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,560
No problem.

405
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,501
Great work.

406
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,562
I love this sound design in this game so much.

407
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:34,203
And the dream with the train sound effect

408
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:36,144
was my favorite dream of all of them.

409
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:37,465
So awesome.

410
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:38,906
Yeah, that one was fun.

411
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,547
A personal curiosity I had is when

412
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:44,508
you're in that under tunnel with the cook,

413
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:46,710
and it's got that kind of boomy reverb,

414
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,091
was that baked into the sounds you were playing?

415
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:50,892
Or did you have a live effect?

416
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:51,812
Yeah.

417
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:52,873
So I have.

418
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:58,849
everything going through sends and I have a few different reverbs for each different location.

419
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:03,772
So and that was all done in fmod. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. No problem.

420
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:09,955
Hi, wonderful talk. Thank you. When you were designing, did you think of the characters as

421
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:18,340
people or animals or kind of both? I think it was a mix of both. I mean,

422
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,661
they are supposed to just be people, but...

423
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,342
I guess because we started out with those voices, it kind of just put me in the mindset

424
00:29:27,422 --> 00:29:27,863
of that.

425
00:29:29,363 --> 00:29:32,765
Like, the voices I did for May, I was kind of going like, mrrr.

426
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,508
But mostly people, I think.

427
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:39,969
Yeah.

428
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:40,749
Great.

429
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:42,570
Thank you very much.

430
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,610
Yeah, no problem.

431
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:44,771
Okay.

432
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:49,502
Looks like all the questions.

433
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:52,303
I can go to the wrap-up room for 20 minutes,

434
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:56,245
and then I would encourage everyone to attend.

435
00:29:56,305 --> 00:30:00,106
There's a Women in Game Audio Roundtable in the South Hall

436
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,106
that's always really good.

437
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:03,587
So I'm going to go to that directly after.

438
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:05,408
And thanks again.
