00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:14,090
Hello there, everybody.

2
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:20,617
Welcome to our talk, Creating Narrative Visual Effects in Temtem.

3
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,759
We're super honored to kick off the Visual Effects Summit right now.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,122
And yeah, without further ado, let's go.

5
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:27,123
Let's show some magic.

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,673
All right, of course, it's good to know who you're listening to at least.

7
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,094
So my name is Kees.

8
00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:35,356
I'm a senior visual effects artist at Crema Games.

9
00:00:35,776 --> 00:00:45,284
I started my visual effects career as a 2D artist working on Lethal League Blaze and eventually transitioned to a 3D real-time visual effects style combining the 2D elements.

10
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:51,569
And currently I'm a full-time animator on Temtem and also a teaching assistant and mentor at Visual Effects Apprentice.

11
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,551
As you can see already from my pictures, I'm a dog lover.

12
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,573
And for me, dogs are here, cats here.

13
00:00:57,113 --> 00:01:03,958
There needs to be some balance, of course, in the Visual Effects team, and I like to explain everything in sound effects.

14
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:14,607
Hello everyone, I'm Mireille, I'm the Lead VFX Artist here at Crema, and so far I have developed my career mostly working in Crema and Intentum, also some minor previous projects, but mostly there.

15
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:24,446
Also, one of my main tasks within the team is to translate Kei-san's effect to the rest of the team, because you may know that not everyone speaks VFX language, so that's a thing.

16
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:28,288
And also, whatever he said about cats and dogs, still under discussion.

17
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:29,288
We'll get to it.

18
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:42,335
Okay, so for a lot of you that may not know what Temtem is, Temtem is a MMO monster creature collector that's equipped with turn-based battles that are mostly 2v2 battles.

19
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:47,432
It was created by Crema Games, which is a small Spanish team of around 30 people.

20
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:53,856
And regarding visual effects, there have been four VFX artists in total, but never more than two at the same time.

21
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:59,820
For us both, we've been working there, me, almost three years, and Case, a bit more than two years.

22
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:07,365
And yeah, we've tried to put a bit, a lot of emphasis on handling the different narrative of the different creatures that appear in the game.

23
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,950
We also wanted to say that the game has been developed using Unity with its built-in runner pipeline.

24
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:17,199
Okay, and now Kees will tell you a bit about what can you expect from this talk.

25
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:23,616
All right, so of course you want to think, what are the things we're going to talk about?

26
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:31,520
So the main red line of our presentation will be the narrative aspect that we try to incorporate with our visual effects technique animations.

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,802
So along this, we'll tell about the different tools we use to make this a reality.

28
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:48,248
So we're going to show you the tool or the videos first without, then we're going to apply the tool and tell you what it does and how we think it makes the narrative visual effects storytelling a reality.

29
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:59,175
And we want to point out these talks for intermediate to experienced visual effects artists that maybe want to put a bit more emphasis on narrative storytelling in their visual effects work, because we think it's really important.

30
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:05,959
And of course, it might be interesting for other art professions that actually want to start out as a visual effects artist.

31
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,021
Are there actually any people in the audience that aren't visual effects artists?

32
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:15,185
Well, maybe after this talk you want to become a visual effects artist because it's a really cool job.

33
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:19,348
And you could have already seen it repeated a few times on the screen.

34
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:25,132
Along the presentation or during the presentation, we'll show you many different visual effects to kind of set the tone.

35
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:36,660
To set the tone already for the talk, over here you see one of our many temtem called Drakash, not being smashed once, not twice, but of course three times by a giant pixel block named Turbo Attack.

36
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:39,990
But of course, what makes it narrative, Mikko?

37
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:45,996
So, what do we mean when we say that Phantom has a space for narrative visual effects?

38
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:49,460
Okay, so Temtem has little gameplay limitations.

39
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:59,169
We, of course, have some design constraints when it comes to how much damage a technique does, how much stamina it uses, the number of targets it has, but not really apart from that.

40
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:14,042
This comes from the fact that the visual effects are mostly contained in 2v2 battles, where information that would be key in other games can make competitive games like League of Legends or, you know, adventure games, soul flight games, that information is not really relevant for us.

41
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:20,396
This means that we can focus and investigate a bit more into other aspects of the visual effects, like for example, the narrative ones.

42
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:27,798
We also wanted to say that since the game came out as an early access game, we've had a lot of interaction with the community.

43
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:35,120
For us, this has been, I think, a privilege, because it's mostly been a lot of constructive feedback.

44
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:46,467
Also, Temtem has a space for signature moves, and these are special moves that only one Temtem can use, and we've used them to further and deepen the different stories of a particular creature.

45
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:53,210
Okay, so in here, you can see the main three techniques that we're gonna talk about in our presentation.

46
00:04:53,930 --> 00:05:03,733
From right to left, you can see leech, repress, and cozy net, but for now, we'll let you wondering how do the sequences look, and we'll tell you a bit about our production workflow.

47
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:09,019
All right, so we think it's always nice to see how different games get created.

48
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:17,486
So we want to show how it starts from getting an idea of a technique animation, up until applying and thinking of gameplay details, up until the final product.

49
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:21,609
So what Miguel already said, we have little limitations in creative freedom.

50
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:33,798
So we have done things like creating a giant black hole, sucking everything inwards, or a giant lava wall, which eventually pours hot lava over this little platypod, which is fine and is still fine to this day.

51
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:40,264
I guess that's what happens when you let visual effects artists decide mostly what happens with visuals in the game.

52
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:42,166
But how does it actually look?

53
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,908
So, we have some information on the screen.

54
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,370
Of course, we have an idea.

55
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,495
This can be a designer's little story, like, hey, I got, for example, a lava wall and I want to pour hot lava over this platypad.

56
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:57,580
Or we can even have a lot of freedom that we can create even our own ideas.

57
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:01,548
So for example, next up we get some gameplay details.

58
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:06,070
And you can see over underneath here, for example, we have Thunderstrike, of course.

59
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,331
What kind of typing is it?

60
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:07,971
Electric.

61
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:09,652
How much, what is the category?

62
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:11,333
Special, physical.

63
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,094
What kind of damage does it do?

64
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:14,475
Stamina and holds.

65
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:22,259
And these little details I'll explain further down because we think gameplay details are very important to even begin, starting with the visual effects animations.

66
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,441
Again, next time, for example, Fire Tornado.

67
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:27,062
What kind of category is it?

68
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:28,363
Of course, element fire.

69
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,777
For example, you can see two holds.

70
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,348
This will also depend on how long will the technique take.

71
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,362
Next up, we have the concepting phase.

72
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:43,283
And this really depends on actually the choice of the visual effects artists.

73
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:46,484
Of course, we're an indie game, so of course we're an indie game.

74
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:51,426
We're an indie company, so we don't have a lot of people in the company, around 30-ish people.

75
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:54,907
So we don't have a dedicated 2D concept artist that helps us out.

76
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:58,149
So what we like to do, we just draw our own concept art.

77
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:04,071
So we like to draw the key frame, the biggest impactful key frame of the technique animation.

78
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:15,857
And this is a very fast way for the art director, lead visual effects artist, to already discuss within 15 minutes already, this is what we want.

79
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:17,238
And it's really fast.

80
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:20,559
We also think maybe sometimes faster than kitbashing in a way.

81
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,982
And also little scribbles, like this stampede scribble.

82
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:31,694
And also, it's a very team collaborative effort that Miko and I work together.

83
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:36,556
So we constantly go back and forth, overpaint, timing changes, tune in little details.

84
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,717
And that's really fun to do.

85
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,519
But let me explain further now what the gameplay elements actually are.

86
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:49,563
Because we do have gameplay elements or restrictions, but we have different ones than compared to player versus player games, for example.

87
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:55,540
So we have the duration that you already saw in the picture, spectacularity, and some other elements.

88
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,282
So duration, what you saw is we have three holds.

89
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:06,567
And basically, the bigger the hold, or the more turns you have to wait, the longer the technique animation has to be on the screen.

90
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:14,672
So we can have technique animations that we have to make visuals on two to three seconds, or the highest holds eight to nine seconds.

91
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:16,713
So that's a very good thing to point out.

92
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:19,735
Okay, we need to create an effect that takes nine seconds.

93
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,477
Next up, we have Spectacularity.

94
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:29,784
This is mostly based on the damage, because if we make every technique 150 damage, of course, none of them would stand out.

95
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:31,326
So we have some restrictions.

96
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:37,472
Some techniques are zero damage, some are 10 damage, and some can go up to 150 damage.

97
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:41,275
And we have some other elements such as stamina.

98
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:44,458
How much stamina does it cost to cast a technique animation?

99
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:50,121
The priority, does it go first, second, third, or fourth because of the turn-based battle system?

100
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:51,963
How many target numbers?

101
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:56,386
One temtem getting targeted, two temtem, or the whole area, or the whole battle zone?

102
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,307
And what are the conditionings applied?

103
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,669
Is it poison, burned, frozen, and so on?

104
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,233
So even in the end, it doesn't look like this much, that much on their own.

105
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:07,814
It's really a combination of

106
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:12,837
of the elements together that we can pinpoint, okay, how big does the technique get?

107
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:18,281
But, Migo, can you tell us something about the unique game aspects?

108
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:19,562
Of course.

109
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:24,285
Okay, so this will be the last bit of information before we dive into the techniques.

110
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:28,248
And as for now, Tentame is 12 different elemental types.

111
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,890
Each, of course, with its own color palette and shape language.

112
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:36,474
And we have water, electrical, fire, earth, melee, crystal, you name it.

113
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:42,620
And we have developed these color palettes for each one that are useful for more things that you may think of.

114
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,782
For example, for us, VFX artists, it's super helpful to have this as a reference to fall back to.

115
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:51,644
And also, for example, case is colorblind for some values of yellow.

116
00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:57,506
And since we mostly want yellow electricity and yellow fire, even if green fire is cool, green fire is really cool.

117
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,468
But yeah, having this to fall back to has proven super useful.

118
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:08,196
Also, the game is divided into main areas, as we call them the battle zones and the free-roam area.

119
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:11,217
The free-roam area is where the game itself happens.

120
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:14,178
It's where you find the other players, since it's an MMO game.

121
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:17,219
It's where you find the NPCs, where the story itself happens.

122
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:19,279
And then we have the battle zones areas.

123
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,601
This is where the 2v2 battle happens and where we have developed most of our visual effects.

124
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:33,124
And finally, Temtem right now, we have 164 different Temtem, and more than 350 techniques.

125
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:48,314
And if you think about it, this has been one of the hardest parts of developing visual effects for Temtem, because we have to consider that every technique has to look good on every Temtem, because every Temtem can potentially use every technique, and of course they can re-sit them.

126
00:10:48,996 --> 00:11:02,786
So we have to play a lot with the scale of the techniques and the different effects because it's not the same if a small temtem like this body but receives a technique, a middle-sized temtem like this ballast over here, or the super huge electrical mythical temtem like this mulligan.

127
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:08,611
Okay, so that was it for the information and right now we'll dive into our first big technique that's called leech.

128
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:16,840
All right, so we have all the very important information out of the way that we even think of before we're starting.

129
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,181
So we know, okay, how long does it take and everything.

130
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:21,301
So let's talk about Leech.

131
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:23,362
And of course, first, what's the narrative?

132
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:24,762
How did it start?

133
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:28,643
So let me introduce you to one of our many temtem called Typhoo.

134
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:32,624
And we can say Typhoo is a pretty big meme in the community.

135
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,824
Because well, Typhoo is a meme.

136
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:38,545
Why does T-Pose Typhoo look like a dollar store scissor?

137
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:43,231
Like once every couple of months, people are like, hmm, Typhoo.

138
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:46,917
And then after a few games, don't play Typhoo, even for the memes.

139
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,822
Typhoo doesn't deserve to be good.

140
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:53,329
Typhoo deserves to be left in the dirt.

141
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:59,574
So, of course, us as visual effects artists, I can look at everybody in the audience.

142
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:09,502
When you hear from your, in this case, from a designer, hey, Typhoon needs a new special signature move, so it's really special only for Typhoon.

143
00:12:10,282 --> 00:12:14,486
Of course, we want to make Typhoon matter, because who doesn't love this T-pose and dollar store scissor?

144
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:26,185
So when thinking of like an idea conceptualization, we think of, okay, what does fit the best and makes Typhoon matter and be part of something bigger than the Temtem universe?

145
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:32,028
And eventually we wanted to give Typhoon a very nature godly feel that is like part of something bigger.

146
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:40,352
Of course, we take much, much reference from games you have worked on, TV shows, everything we can take references off, anime also.

147
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:48,559
And we thought a very fitting thematic for Taifu, a godly nature feel, was the Watcher from the What If series.

148
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,925
I don't know if you've watched the What If series, but it's just the way it's looking at you, it's very menacing in a way, it's kind of like very godly.

149
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:59,848
And we thought, well, we think this will be very special for Taifu.

150
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:08,540
So here's a little sneak peek and let's dive into it actually, how we actually started out and what are the tools and techniques we apply.

151
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:18,685
So first of all, we're talking about, we're going to talk about with Leech's spectacularism, I'll say spectacularity because I stumble constantly over the words, time remapping and Temtem battle shader effects.

152
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,218
So first up, Spectacularity.

153
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:28,163
So, you already heard us say a few times, 10x a turn-based battle game.

154
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:35,509
So, what we really try to focus on, we need to keep the players engaged, because we can have technique animations up to 9 seconds.

155
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,692
So we want to really encapture those hype moments because we create games for the players.

156
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:46,114
So every time they use a skill, they're like, yes, I want to maybe use that Temtem only because of the skill.

157
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:47,055
That's actually our goal.

158
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:51,677
And we want to make it really matter and fit the whole Temtem story itself.

159
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,919
So for Typhoon, that's the leeching part.

160
00:13:55,114 --> 00:14:00,075
And also what really works the best for it is mostly anime because anime timing is really great.

161
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:04,256
It's very snappy and it's constantly engaging in a way, like the colors, everything's working.

162
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,397
And we can really put a more emphasis on the thematic.

163
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:12,818
We can give it much, much more power, really increased power of punches and everything together.

164
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:18,520
And we really think that works great for Leech and the technique animations.

165
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,643
Next up, we have time remapping.

166
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:26,531
And in this video over here, we'll show you the video actually without the tool applied.

167
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:28,374
We'll tell you what the tool actually does.

168
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:31,319
And then afterwards, we're going to take a look how it looks with it applied.

169
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:33,982
So what is time remapping?

170
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:41,908
So with time remapping, we're able to slow or speed up time with time curves that you can see on the left bottom over here.

171
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:46,592
This is actually a very artist-friendly way for us to efficiently try out different things.

172
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:51,535
Like maybe we kick in a very slow motion kind of feel, a very speed up kind of feel.

173
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:54,918
And we can give the technique 10 times more power with it.

174
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:58,561
So just imagine for yourself, you're looking at this technique GIF.

175
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:00,563
How would it look if it's very linear?

176
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:03,386
It would lose a lot of power, a lot of anticipation.

177
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:07,191
It kind of misses that hype moment and that anticipation moment for the players.

178
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:13,519
So by just really increasing those curves, we can really give that a very spectacular feel to it.

179
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:16,895
And we can say what gets affected by it.

180
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,417
We can say everything gets affected in the scene.

181
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:26,844
We can say the source animators, so the source temtem is getting affected, the targeted temtem, or we can say all the temtem in the area.

182
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:29,407
So we have lots of possibilities if you think of it.

183
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,871
So let's do a refresh for the mind how it looks without time remapping.

184
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:36,614
And these can be some pretty small details actually.

185
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,816
So the narrative is there, but it's kind of missing that juicy feel.

186
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,357
It's kind of like the oomph of it.

187
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,918
It's really like, oh, it's coming, it's coming.

188
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,459
And then, bam, it explodes.

189
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,681
So let's see how it looks with time remapping.

190
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:54,404
And it can be a slight detail that some of you might not really recognize in the beginning.

191
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,127
But for us, it's really adding on top of that extra animation feel.

192
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:10,212
So Typhoo casts its skill, it builds up, it goes in slow-mo and it rapidly increases over time to really show Typhoo leeching the life source out of the enemy Temtem.

193
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:16,961
And for the last tool of leech, let's talk about Temtem Battle Shader effects.

194
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:26,020
And you can already get a question actually yourself, or, hey, Kees, why are there two floating eyes and some swishy swooshies, solar coasters, curve meshes?

195
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,202
Yeah, you can name it what it is.

196
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:29,704
We call it solar coast for now.

197
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:33,949
Let me explain actually how that works, Temtem Battle Shader effects.

198
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:38,501
So here we show Taifu in the Unity editor scene.

199
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:43,405
And the cool thing we can do with Temtem Battle Shader effects is we can place Temtem clones.

200
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:47,969
And you heard me say clones, and Miguel will tell a bit more about clones eventually.

201
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,935
But what we can do is we can set custom parameters during the animation timing of the technique.

202
00:16:53,975 --> 00:16:57,758
So during the eight seconds, we can say we want to increase the fresnel over time.

203
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:01,461
the texture speed, the power of the glow and everything.

204
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:08,446
We have lots of possibilities with this and we use it again with the curve meshes we showed you, the curve files.

205
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:12,869
But we can do other things only giving typhoon a nature godly feel.

206
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,993
We can give a tantum a digital feel that is a distorted hologram.

207
00:17:19,174 --> 00:17:23,417
We can go more to nightmare field kind of effects like nightmare feet.

208
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:31,026
We can even glitch the temtem like it's stuck in the matrix and offsetting the vertices so much for digital type effects.

209
00:17:32,246 --> 00:17:42,629
And we can send out an extra temtem clone with a battle shader on it, and we really portray the power of, okay, the temtem is getting punched, bonk, it goes backwards, and it's like an aura shader that we apply to it.

210
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,371
So again, what does it do for Typhoo?

211
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:53,833
Without the temtem battle shader effects, two floating eyes, some swishy-smooshy, solar coasters, it's missing something.

212
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,271
but with the Temtem Battle Shader effect.

213
00:17:58,031 --> 00:17:58,932
It comes all together.

214
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:06,640
The narrative is there that we think will really try to give Temtem Typhoon a very nature-godly feel.

215
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:09,643
And it's a really cool tool, too.

216
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:11,284
We can do lots of things with it.

217
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:19,072
And let's see how it looks actually when we have all the tools combined and with some sound effects on it and see how it comes to a whole final product.

218
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:48,153
And you might also notice at the end of the effect, we let some particles linger so the player can already register for, okay, this tantrum just got attacked because sometimes there are maybe four of the same tantrum in the battle scene.

219
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:55,318
So with the first big technique out of the leech, Migo, can you tell us something about our next mental technique called Depress?

220
00:18:55,998 --> 00:18:56,959
Yep, definitely.

221
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:59,721
Okay, so after leech, we are diving into Depress.

222
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:01,661
This one is a mental technique.

223
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:06,102
It's a damaging technique that requires the target to be asleep for it to work.

224
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:14,424
So given the name of this technique, we wanted to try and recreate those kinds of feelings and emotions that you may get when you're going through a bad time.

225
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:29,307
Our narrative idea for this technique was that if we were able to implement in some sort of way our own feelings into the game, then the technique would be more fitting inside the Temtem universe, but also outside of it, and the players would be able to relate more to it.

226
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:48,064
Ok, so that's why, let me show you a technique As you can see, the enemy temtem goes into some sort of personality disorder where it sees itself out of its own body and some particles that play with it and it gets pulled back together, but of course it's damaged

227
00:19:49,093 --> 00:20:00,343
Okay, so in here we're going to talk about two main tools that we made to make this technique stand out, that are the extra tantrums or clones as Kees just said, and of course post-processing.

228
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:10,652
So for these extra tantrums or clones, what these are, they are copies of the tantrums that are within a technique and we can use several different animations for them.

229
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:19,039
We can use animations that they have in their Battlezone kit, that can be for example the gate hit animation or the

230
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:25,491
attacking animation, but also we can use some animations from the free-roam area.

231
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:37,495
This, in addition with, for example, some more basic animation that's just position, rotation, and scaling, we can create techniques that have sufficient narrative meaning just with that.

232
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:39,676
Like, for example, you can see a lot of running temtems.

233
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:42,157
That's the stampede scribble that I showed you earlier.

234
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:50,776
Also in the GIF, you can see this technique that's called Oshidashi, and you can definitely see the impact that being able to animate this temtem has.

235
00:20:51,636 --> 00:21:04,029
Without it, well, the punch would feel powerful, okay, because we have the impact frame, we have the timbre mapping, but it will feel much less powerful if we didn't launch the temtem up into the sky.

236
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:14,291
It also helps us to give some comedic effect, because as you may have seen, temtem visual effects lean into some sort of comedic or funny effect.

237
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:17,152
And you can see that little star up in the sky, that's like, okay.

238
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:23,253
Okay, and next up, you can see the effect this one has on the press.

239
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:34,357
Without the extra temtem, you can see some particles floating around, but you don't understand why the temtem has disappeared, you don't really get where it is, and it has no narrative meaning.

240
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:40,921
On the other hand, when we put it back on, you can definitely see that something's happening to it.

241
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:51,356
We also use basic animation principles like this squat and stretch, so you can understand the violence of the pullback and the pullback together.

242
00:21:53,058 --> 00:22:07,926
Okay, also post-processing, maybe for some of you that may not know what post-processing is, it consists of filters that are applied in the last stages of rendering and with it we can create some effects like vignetting or changes of contrast, bloom, etc.

243
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:16,170
So in Tantum we are able to modify the current post-processing that we have at any current time within the technique animation

244
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,777
and we can have two of them overlapping at the same time.

245
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:27,861
This means that we can have, for example, one handling a change of bloom and another one handling a LUT color swap of the full screen.

246
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:33,123
We can do this also with curving files that I showed you earlier in time remapping.

247
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:35,364
So this is a very artist-friendly way to do it.

248
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:40,287
For example, this would be some LUT textures that we created for post-processing.

249
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:51,716
And with this we can portray, for example, the violence of an explosion in this technique that's called knockback blast with these full black and white values, or color, sorry.

250
00:22:53,018 --> 00:22:58,705
We can also portray, for example, an electrical field with these blue and dark blue values.

251
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:06,564
And also, we can create that feeling that you may have had if you had an electrifying massage, maybe.

252
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:14,988
But yeah, for example, here we get a full black and white color swap of the full screen, that in addition with an inverted fresnel on the enemy temtem.

253
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:21,871
We portrayed that thing that we may have seen in a lot of animes where the skeleton gets shown when you get electrocuted.

254
00:23:23,412 --> 00:23:26,394
Okay, we've also created an Uber shader for post-processing.

255
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:30,357
because sometimes we want to handle more than one thing at the same time.

256
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:36,440
For example, if we have overlapping stuff in time, it's easier to do it in just one file and not have to move it around.

257
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:45,003
And you can see, for example, how we handle in the right part of the screen vignetting, in the middle part, there's kinetic lengths for some super fast techniques.

258
00:23:45,944 --> 00:23:48,085
And up there is the LUT color swaps.

259
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:52,367
Okay, so getting back to the press, you can see the effect this one has.

260
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:55,308
So without post-processing,

261
00:23:56,434 --> 00:24:03,240
you can definitely feel that something's missing, a transition feels a lot more bland, and we're missing something, yeah.

262
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:16,611
But when we put it back on, you can definitely understand that you are going into that sort of mental state where the damage could happen, and suddenly it gets a lot more narrative meaning.

263
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:20,955
Okay, so now let's show it with sound effects, of course.

264
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:41,385
So yeah, you can definitely see the projectile finding, then you get both copies or both personalities pulled back of the temtem.

265
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:46,929
The projectiles are the particles that are playing with both copies, and then the violins pull back.

266
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:50,451
So you can definitely understand that life will never be the same again for this temtem.

267
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:57,997
Okay, so next up, this is the app for the press, and we'll tell you about our next big technique that's called coaching it.

268
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:08,643
So, our third big technique is called CozNet and maybe the wording is a bit wrong because it doesn't look very cozy for little Mosu.

269
00:25:09,584 --> 00:25:11,024
Yeah, we can all agree about that.

270
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:23,370
Fun fact, actually, if we show our work in progress videos, we cast all the different technique animations, all the different small temtem, because we have, we think that's the most impact and sells the idea a bit more.

271
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,632
And a lot of actually colleagues of us are like, no, the little temtem, so.

272
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,234
All right, so what is the narrative of CozyNet?

273
00:25:31,534 --> 00:25:46,067
So with CozyNet, we really wanted to portray the feel of the temtem getting pulled into the lair of Arachnid, a spire temtem with the typings digital and nature, where Arachnid crawls down and eventually feasts on this little snack called Mosu.

274
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:49,770
And yeah, we treat them with love, don't worry.

275
00:25:51,044 --> 00:25:52,625
So what are the things we're going to talk about?

276
00:25:52,645 --> 00:25:58,648
We're going to talk about actually two very important things that we think are very special when it comes to Temtem.

277
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:02,850
It's camera movement and BZChain's Battlezone changes.

278
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,612
So you can already see in the video over here, it's not shippable.

279
00:26:06,992 --> 00:26:08,813
The camera has an error or something.

280
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:16,797
So let me get you through it, how the camera movement works and what we actually can do by adding extra movement on already everything that's there.

281
00:26:18,318 --> 00:26:18,538
So,

282
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:26,195
Yeah, it's quite unique being a visual effects art for Temtem because sometimes we have our own ownership that we come up with our own idea.

283
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:28,876
We create it from the beginning up until the end.

284
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:32,897
And it's really, we think it's really special that we can do that.

285
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:41,101
But also with this comes camera movements because camera movement is very important because we have the time for it with the turn-based battle system and everything.

286
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:46,443
So we can really create interesting camera shots and camera positioning or camera positions.

287
00:26:46,983 --> 00:26:48,064
But how are we doing it?

288
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:50,587
So we do it again with the curve files.

289
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:51,849
It's a lifesaver for us.

290
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:55,172
We can do, for example, animate the field of view curve of the camera.

291
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:57,035
So instead of only doing screen shakes, we can create extra wobbles.

292
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:58,076
So think of, for example, a very climactic explosion.

293
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:04,343
It goes boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, and then brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

294
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:05,063
it explodes.

295
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:11,747
Those are kind of like the things we can do with field of view curves and we can go all out and just have a lot of fun with it actually.

296
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:30,836
Next up we have curvings of different cameras so camera A and B and we have all kinds of freedom from how can we move camera A towards camera B so we can create shots of the cameras and how is it transitioning or when is camera B kicking in maybe camera C, D, E. We have lots of cameras sometimes.

297
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:47,593
And during this, actually approaching 1.0 of Temtem, it actually released last September, there was one colleague of ours, Adrie Dovonio-Andres, we call him the shader god, and he had one thing, like one sentence he constantly repeated to us, and we want to share it with you.

298
00:27:48,254 --> 00:27:49,736
So, this is Adrie.

299
00:27:51,117 --> 00:27:54,760
And Adrie always told us, let the camera follow the effect.

300
00:27:55,746 --> 00:27:57,168
And why is this actually?

301
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:04,838
Well, this way it looks like the player is naturally getting guided by the visual effects instead of an almighty being controlling the camera.

302
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:06,400
What if typhoon?

303
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,143
So what do we mean by this?

304
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:12,408
Let's go, for example, through some examples.

305
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:22,303
So over here you have Unseen Blow and you can already see something and I'm letting the first run of GIF again.

306
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:22,703
Yeah.

307
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:36,450
And you can already maybe see some things that when a projectile starts, we first let the player register, okay, there's something happening with the projectile, but we only let the second camera kick in when a projectile is halfway through the trajectory.

308
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,191
So this way the player knows, okay,

309
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:41,312
I need to take a look at the projectile.

310
00:28:41,392 --> 00:28:42,993
Okay, the projectile is going to do something.

311
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:44,614
It's going to damage the other temtem.

312
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:49,437
Because if we instantly let the camera move towards the target, the player doesn't know what to do.

313
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,458
And it's kind of, we're forcing the player in a way.

314
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:57,581
And the player is like, oh, I'm maybe not really together with the visual effects and the projectile movement of it.

315
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,339
Over here you have the coach net itself.

316
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,084
So you can see also with the line how the camera's moving.

317
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:06,747
So first camera moves down.

318
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:09,531
We do the anticipation also.

319
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:11,194
It's really building up to that hype moment.

320
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:12,155
It's like da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

321
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:14,098
And it goes back to the normal battle zone area.

322
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:20,885
And what I was talking about, building up to that climactic explosion with field of view curves.

323
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:24,027
So this is one technique called DG thread.

324
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:25,909
So the camera is zooming inwards.

325
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,231
We really increase the field of view power.

326
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:33,755
And it's like, we're holding a moment, tiny bit, and then it kicks in, it zooms very far actually inwards.

327
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:39,019
And we show that, yeah, the 10th time is damaged by quite a, quite an amount of damage.

328
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:45,525
So let's see again for coast net, how it looks without the camera movement, actually.

329
00:29:48,598 --> 00:29:52,061
So Eric Knight is casting the skill, and of course, there's something wrong.

330
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:53,383
It doesn't look shippable at all.

331
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:57,186
But let's see actually how it looks with the camera movement.

332
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:05,774
So Eric Knight is casting the skill, crawls down like Spider-Man, and eventually feasting on his little snack called Mosu.

333
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:12,380
So with camera movement out of the way, let's talk about battle zone changes.

334
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:18,514
And you can already see, this is not the final battle zone, this is actually our visual effects test that you've seen.

335
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:22,419
It doesn't look that great, so let's see how we can make it even better.

336
00:30:24,147 --> 00:30:25,808
So what are Battlezone changes?

337
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:33,114
Battlezone changes are custom unity scenes where we hand place all kinds of different assets that are actually at our disposal.

338
00:30:33,895 --> 00:30:41,401
And we're doing it to really capture that because we do mostly Battlezones for signature moves that are special to one certain temtem.

339
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:50,388
So we can really give a temtem like Arachnid, a temtem like Leech, like Typhoon, much more meaning to the overall, the skill of it and what it does.

340
00:30:50,968 --> 00:30:59,926
So what we did, for example, we created a giant spider web that's actually like the focus point, leading with the shape language, the lines to the middle, that little mouse.

341
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:02,531
So there's something going to happen with the enemy temtem.

342
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:06,624
And with that, we also added some environmental effects.

343
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:15,171
So we give the feeling of the players inside the spider cocoon, and there's something going wrong, and it's definitely going to go wrong with the enemy Temtem.

344
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:24,740
But also with this, if you think it yourself, we have lots of possibilities with this, because the Temtem universe for us is very big as visual effects artists.

345
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,643
So what are some other things we can actually do with this?

346
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:35,827
We can create a toxic wasteland, a stone dune and trench environment, a more martial arts melee environment.

347
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:41,950
And we can even summon a stormy sea where thunder and tornadoes appear.

348
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:44,992
Just a bit like in the Netherlands, where it's constantly raining.

349
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:46,693
And trust me, I am from the Netherlands.

350
00:31:46,993 --> 00:31:47,854
It's constantly raining.

351
00:31:48,294 --> 00:31:49,735
Actually, also in San Francisco this week.

352
00:31:51,710 --> 00:32:01,699
So you can already see like we're having loads of fun also with this and we just kind of can go all out and just use all kinds of different things and the why's and the how of a meaning to the scene.

353
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,241
Because why are we doing it?

354
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:11,789
We're doing it to give again Eric Knight that special feel that maybe people want to play the Spire 10 because we can cast our enemy tantrums in a giant spider cocoon.

355
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:13,369
And how are we doing it?

356
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,751
We're using basically everything at our disposal that we can use.

357
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:26,156
So if, for example, some 3D artists create some very cool environment art assets, we think we can use it in a way, create some interesting composition and camera shots.

358
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,897
And if that works, yeah, we use that actually.

359
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:32,579
So a refresher for the mind.

360
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,380
How does it look without battlezone changes?

361
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,541
So again, you can remember the normal visual effects test scene, it's not fitting at all.

362
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:43,762
It misses the whole point of the technique.

363
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:49,904
But with the Battlezone change, there's already more meaning to it.

364
00:32:50,044 --> 00:32:56,406
The narrative is there and just capture that moment of the spider tent and what could a spider tent be.

365
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:07,468
And lastly, let's see how it looks with some sound effects because we think adding sound effects, getting added to the facial effects makes it a whole picture and become a final product.

366
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:30,920
And there's also one thing I want to point out is that with certain techniques, we favor some cameras on the right side and the left side.

367
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,002
This is more because when a camera is favored on the left side, it could be the friendly team.

368
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:38,343
And when a camera favors the right side, it's the enemy team.

369
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:44,207
Because what I told you again, some temtem can be, there can be two of the same temtem in the battle zone.

370
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:47,768
So this is like a small cue for the players.

371
00:33:47,788 --> 00:33:50,430
It's like, okay, the enemy is using this skill right now.

372
00:33:51,454 --> 00:34:00,984
So with our third big technique out of the way, CozyNet, we have one more thing that's very important when it's getting applied to our technique animations, which is composition.

373
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:02,967
Can you tell us something more about that, Miguel?

374
00:34:04,056 --> 00:34:19,511
Yep, okay, so as you've been seeing Temtem techniques are a little bit like small cinematics or like mini mini movies and we've tried to learn stuff like for example for animated series or movies and put what we've learned from them to use.

375
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:29,220
We of course tried to live up to those standards and we have tried to implement this like for example with a low angle shot to portray a Temtem as much much more powerful

376
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:31,462
or even just the opposite.

377
00:34:31,482 --> 00:34:42,467
Like if we portray a shot from a super high position, and it's a small temtem in a super big environment, then that temtem suddenly feels super weak.

378
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:45,929
We've also tried to put two things together.

379
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:49,971
One thing was that what Keith said, that the camera has to follow the effect.

380
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,052
And the other thing is that the visual effects have to guide the eye.

381
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:54,313
This is really important for us.

382
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:56,454
So let me show you what I mean.

383
00:34:57,438 --> 00:35:12,246
In this technique that's called Crystal Deluge, you can see that we try to, at first, the camera following the effects, because we don't start moving the camera up until the VFX have left the camera shot.

384
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:18,450
And also we have that triangular shape, so we make sure that the player is looking downwards.

385
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,852
Also that way the transition feels a lot more natural.

386
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:34,232
This is important because in composition in Temtem we don't want the player to miss any important information and we've tried to do it and it's been one of the hardest parts of developing VFX here.

387
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:40,980
This would be a sketch of the triangular shape I was talking about and you can see that the effect has already left the screen.

388
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:45,731
This next technique, that's called unseen blow.

389
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:55,460
You can see what Kees was telling about earlier, that we don't start moving the camera up until the projectile is like 50% on its way over the enemy.

390
00:35:56,361 --> 00:36:06,250
In here, we put our higher values in the projectile, so we make sure that the player is looking, well, of course, at the projectile, and that they are looking at this action line.

391
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:11,153
And finally here, this is the signature move of Wasp Beam.

392
00:36:11,555 --> 00:36:12,599
That's a Wasp Temtem.

393
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:42,056
and we do portray the temtem as more powerful with this slight low angle shot at the beginning and also with that conic shape that we do upwards we make sure that the player is looking above and behind the temtem because of course the first time they see the technique they are not going to know what's going to happen but at least they know where it's coming from so they are not surprised and they're like okay I wanted to look there but in a way we're making that look there

394
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:47,058
So this would be the action line that we want the player to look at.

395
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,942
And yeah, we are getting close to the end of the presentation, but not quite there.

396
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:56,365
Because, but wait, there is more.

397
00:36:56,966 --> 00:37:02,671
So let's do a small recap of what we talked about with the three techniques, leech, depress, and cozy net.

398
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:06,253
We've talked about things such as time remapping, adding spectacularity.

399
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:09,963
Temtem battle shader effects, Temtem clones, and so on.

400
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:19,709
And we really think we have many more tools, but we think these are the most important tools that we can go actually all out and capture that narrative feeling of the technique animations.

401
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:30,757
We also think, even in the slightest, this could also work for you, because narrative visual effects meaning is very important, we think, and to give maybe the basic explosion a bit more meaning to it.

402
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:35,676
Of course, but wait, there is more.

403
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:40,018
Because we're all visual effects artists, there are lots of visual effects artists over here.

404
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:42,039
Imagine what we can do with this.

405
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,843
So, with that out of the way, can you tell us something about the divine god called Peak Epic?

406
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:53,625
Okay, so this is the signature move, this Piggy Tentum, that's called Piggy Pig.

407
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:56,228
And let me tell you the story for this one.

408
00:37:56,688 --> 00:38:01,472
So since the game came out as an early access, there was a lot of interaction with the community.

409
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:05,956
And some Tentums in the beginning, they were super overpowered, like insane.

410
00:38:06,996 --> 00:38:09,899
And it was the case for this Piggy Pig Tentum.

411
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,282
And of course, since it was so powerful, people started comparing it with a god.

412
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:32,243
and like shortly after this was all around in the discord okay and shortly after of course the pkip charge was born that was a thing and we wanted to give back to the community in a way and and try to put what well what they showed us and put it in the game so let me show you

413
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:48,502
Okay, so of course this is a meme for us, but we also wanted to make it look good for the players that weren't there in the beginning.

414
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:53,163
But yeah, I think it's been super fun developing VFX for this game.

415
00:38:54,623 --> 00:39:02,405
You can also see that we've used all of the tools that we've been talking about, like for example, the time remapping, overlapping post-processing with that vignetting and chromatic aberration.

416
00:39:03,865 --> 00:39:07,626
But yeah, next up we'll tell you a bit about another technique that's called horror.

417
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:14,410
So approaching 1.0, we kind of got like super comfortable with the Temtem IP.

418
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:22,754
I think we can speak for a lot of people that when you get at the end of like a stage from DLC or a game, you're really trying to push yourselves.

419
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:26,135
Okay, we got all this, let's create some crazy things actually.

420
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:34,059
So what we try to do with the mental technique, especially because fire is fire, electric is electric, but mental can be lots of things.

421
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:37,260
It can be depersonalization with the press, for example.

422
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,482
Or it can be something in your mind, like something affecting your amygdala.

423
00:39:40,863 --> 00:39:43,184
Think of games such as Bloodborne, stories of H.P.

424
00:39:43,224 --> 00:39:43,745
Lovecraft.

425
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:45,926
I'm myself a huge fan of those.

426
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:56,835
I was like, let's see how we can really put maybe Temtem in the Temtem universe and let's summon the depths of Cthulhu and put it in a Temtem jacket that fits the whole narrative of it.

427
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:11,176
So we summoned the giant tentacle eye floating, looks like a raid boss in a way to give that feeling of composition.

428
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:11,276
Oops.

429
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:13,137
Oh, sorry.

430
00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:19,380
To give the feeling of composition and the menacing feel of the temtem that's in the mental realms.

431
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,922
Oh no, I'm not going to be the same after this anymore.

432
00:40:23,663 --> 00:40:32,007
And what we did was we sent out a pulse of mental powers when upon impact tentacles burst out with toxic viscous goo splashing towards the player's screen.

433
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:39,387
The next technique is called outgrowth, or first when it started, drain climbing plant.

434
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:44,589
And this was actually a technique we came up with our own, like the whole idea was on our own.

435
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,870
And the designer also told us, okay, sure, you can do it.

436
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,390
Good luck.

437
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,391
And then afterwards, oh, okay, how are we going to do this?

438
00:40:51,872 --> 00:40:55,153
So this technique is for one of our mythical tantrum called tyrannic.

439
00:40:56,073 --> 00:41:00,639
which comes from the fire volcano environment and its typing is fire and nature.

440
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:12,193
And what we wanted to capture with this technique animation was the full force of nature ramping towards the enemy, creating a tree of life and eventually exploding in nature colors and nature schematic.

441
00:41:12,934 --> 00:41:15,417
And a bit of flavor of Naruto wood style jutsu.

442
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:29,956
So for this technique, it was a real team collaborative thing.

443
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:37,904
And again, our shader god comes back, Adri de Voglio Andres, created a root shader because this was a very necessary thing for us that we needed.

444
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:43,189
So I'm going to explain to you actually how we set it up and how we made this possible, this effect.

445
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,572
So first, we needed some custom meshes that we created in Blender.

446
00:41:46,993 --> 00:41:49,756
And you can see some red vertices painted on these meshes.

447
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:56,710
Maybe some of you already know how the root shader works or like how you let the roots grow in a way.

448
00:41:57,171 --> 00:42:06,720
But these actually, these vertices determine the thickness of the root because again, shape language is very important and we want to get rid of the symmetrical shapes in the technique animation.

449
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,843
So it feels more natural and the roots really feel natural in a way.

450
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:16,282
Next up, we have a basic shader that actually Chromium made over here, together with Andri.

451
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:23,749
And these cover things such as fresnel, for example, texture panning, because that's a very important thing also, together with the roots.

452
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:32,297
And also, of course, the root growing in a point, actually, instead of being cut off, because then it feels more natural and believable to the players.

453
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:37,357
We painted our own personal roots tileable texture.

454
00:42:38,078 --> 00:42:49,268
And you can see over here how we try to implement the roots hand placed again with the battle zone change that we think really fits the camera movement and the battle zone and the composition for the battle zone changes.

455
00:42:51,206 --> 00:42:54,707
And it's also nice to see how it actually started, because this was the first color scheme.

456
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:59,048
But of course, the narrative is very important, but you can already guess it.

457
00:42:59,348 --> 00:43:03,390
Tyrannic comes from a fire volcano there, and it's typings fires in nature.

458
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:07,491
So it leads more towards the orange colors, the more brighter colors.

459
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:10,952
So we changed it up totally.

460
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:15,133
And it took a while, of course, but these things, mistakes can happen in game dev.

461
00:43:15,553 --> 00:43:17,794
And I think everybody makes sometimes these mistakes.

462
00:43:20,285 --> 00:43:23,595
And let's see, let's also show you the first ever draft of outgrowth.

463
00:43:24,076 --> 00:43:27,506
And there might, there are some important things I want to point out afterwards.

464
00:43:33,942 --> 00:43:36,263
So you can already see the camera movement is there.

465
00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:38,003
The composition, everything is there.

466
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:41,904
The roots are basically working, but it's very cluttered.

467
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,044
You don't really see where you have to look.

468
00:43:44,344 --> 00:43:46,245
The color scheme is all wrong.

469
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:51,006
But this actually shows that camera movement is really a key into our visual effects animations.

470
00:43:51,586 --> 00:43:56,207
And that, yeah, a lot of signature moves, we just even start with camera movement.

471
00:43:56,327 --> 00:43:58,308
And on top of that, we add the visual effects layers.

472
00:43:58,368 --> 00:43:59,888
So we make it easy for ourselves.

473
00:44:01,536 --> 00:44:04,267
Next up, Migo is going to tell us more about Black Hole.

474
00:44:06,482 --> 00:44:14,788
Okay, so as we've been saying, sometimes the ideas for the techniques came from the designer or our CEO, Enrique Paños, who was the one that created the techniques.

475
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:20,372
But other times, the ideas for the techniques came from either ourselves or more tech part of the company.

476
00:44:21,012 --> 00:44:22,513
So this was the case for Black Hole.

477
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:29,218
In this one, we wanted to try and recreate the moment that you would feel, would think, inside a black hole, of course.

478
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:32,861
That's you hear nothing, you see nothing, there's nothing happening.

479
00:44:33,581 --> 00:44:34,222
So let me show you.

480
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,941
Yeah, so that was that.

481
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:48,302
And yeah, we also did a custom post-processing here.

482
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:50,263
Let me show you, actually.

483
00:44:50,943 --> 00:44:56,806
Swirling distortion in the middle to also portray that feeling that everything's been sucked inside the black hole.

484
00:44:57,606 --> 00:44:58,527
You can see it right over there.

485
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:01,048
So yeah, that's also helped out a bit.

486
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:06,530
Okay, so this would be our last technique.

487
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:08,971
So Kees, will you do me the honors here?

488
00:45:09,652 --> 00:45:09,912
I can.

489
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:16,611
I think we can speak for a lot of people and this technique will speak some volume actually.

490
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:22,772
And we've all experienced this like maybe every week, three, four times, five times.

491
00:45:23,412 --> 00:45:26,093
And if not, well, we have a very special computer actually.

492
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:28,593
So let's just let this be a technique speak for itself.

493
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:35,235
Yay, blue screens.

494
00:45:35,455 --> 00:45:36,335
Who doesn't love those?

495
00:45:38,266 --> 00:45:52,118
Okay, so what we want you to take from this, of course we know that you have to be in this sort of position where putting this in your game makes sense, but if you are to take anything from this talk it's that in some cases less is more, okay?

496
00:45:52,558 --> 00:46:00,345
Because you see that this is literally one big blue billboard and a sad face, and it has a lot of narrative and comedic meaning.

497
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:08,636
So we think that if you are able to implement, well, maybe any of that, even in the slightest in your own games, maybe you can benefit from that.

498
00:46:09,538 --> 00:46:11,340
Great, so thank you all so much for coming.

499
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,727
This was the end of our talk, but we didn't want to leave before saying some shout outs and some thank yous.

500
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,821
So of course we didn't create Temtem on our own because yeah, that's just not possible.

501
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:26,184
And we want to thank the, just want to give some huge shout outs to the team back in Madrid.

502
00:46:26,545 --> 00:46:33,289
Each and every person is super talented and just working with such a team that has so much passion for the Temtem IP is just great.

503
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,893
And that we can share our visual effects work with them is just an amazing opportunity.

504
00:46:38,613 --> 00:46:50,565
Also, we want to thank our bosses, Enrique Paños and Guillermo Andradas, for believing in us, letting us give this talk and just having trust in us as representing Temtem, the IP.

505
00:46:52,307 --> 00:47:05,880
Also Alex Munoz and our shader god, Adrie de Vognio-Andres, during 1.0 and just working on Temtem techniques, the feedback sessions were just super into detail with animation to time, shape, language, everything.

506
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,944
Shaders also helping out, and it's just, for us, really valuable.

507
00:47:10,825 --> 00:47:12,546
People that really helped us out a lot.

508
00:47:13,907 --> 00:47:15,209
And Jason, where are you sitting?

509
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:24,269
Jason, thank you so much for reaching out to us to give us the opportunity to give this talk about Temtem and creating narrative visual effects animations.

510
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:44,973
It's actually our first time going to GDC and our first time in America, so it can be quite overwhelming, but just sharing, because we're also quite new in the visual effects industry, and just sharing how much fun we have creating visual effects and how we can also do other kinds of visual effects and narrative visual effects, it's just amazing to share that.

511
00:47:45,493 --> 00:47:55,037
And of course, lastly, regarding the GDC team giving out the important information about travel documents and everything, it really helped us out a lot.

512
00:47:55,117 --> 00:47:58,599
And thank you especially Sam Warnke for replying so super fast.

513
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:05,622
So with that out of the way, actually, there is a little temtem that has actually a question.

514
00:48:06,822 --> 00:48:08,483
And that is, are there any questions?

515
00:48:21,206 --> 00:48:24,632
Yeah.

516
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:27,316
Yeah, if it's at the mic, that could be possible, yeah.

517
00:48:27,336 --> 00:48:28,358
Yeah, I think that's best.

518
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:30,923
I'm a little short.

519
00:48:31,918 --> 00:48:32,999
Excellent talk, thank you.

520
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,983
I wanted to check, what were the main points of collaboration you had with the wider team?

521
00:48:38,504 --> 00:48:40,866
Like, what departments are you mainly collaborating with?

522
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:43,788
So, the main point with the wider team, like the collaboration.

523
00:48:44,669 --> 00:48:53,737
So, I think especially with Adrie de Vogna Andres and the art director, we really wanted to capture that the Temtem style of the visual effects fits the universe.

524
00:48:54,137 --> 00:48:58,581
But for example, also with the sound people that created the visual effects sounds,

525
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:04,769
They also sometimes ask us like, hey, what is actually your feeling with this technique animation?

526
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:07,372
Because sometimes the ideas come up ourselves.

527
00:49:08,678 --> 00:49:20,401
And I can think also with game design, when we created Outgrowth with the routes moving forward, we had this idea and we showed a concept, but of course then the designer is going to ask, oh, how many targets does it have?

528
00:49:20,521 --> 00:49:22,002
Is it one target, two targets?

529
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:22,902
How long is it?

530
00:49:22,942 --> 00:49:29,744
Because if we make technique animations too long compared to 50 damage, then players will just be,

531
00:49:30,424 --> 00:49:32,304
Come on, again, again, again.

532
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:33,765
Sometimes that happens.

533
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:45,107
I think, well, since it's a rather small company, in the end, we've had a lot of interaction with every department, mostly, because, for example, some techniques, I can think of the Shane Schmoyer's REC.

534
00:49:46,187 --> 00:49:50,248
That one, the animation team did the animation for that one, and then we put on the visual effects.

535
00:49:50,848 --> 00:49:56,589
Also, sometimes the 3D department created some of the environments, so in the end,

536
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,290
Actually a mix of every department almost.

537
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:04,332
Like for example a monkey getting animated jumping up with two giant rocks and smashing it downwards.

538
00:50:04,812 --> 00:50:05,692
Those kind of things.

539
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:08,253
So it's really cool to create effects for that.

540
00:50:08,513 --> 00:50:09,153
That's super cool.

541
00:50:09,213 --> 00:50:09,514
Thank you.

542
00:50:09,834 --> 00:50:10,194
No problem.

543
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:13,358
Hey there.

544
00:50:13,738 --> 00:50:16,659
First, it's really impressive you built this game with 30 people.

545
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:17,839
Thank you.

546
00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:18,499
Pass it off to you.

547
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:18,979
That's great.

548
00:50:19,379 --> 00:50:24,341
So you guys obviously have so much creative freedom to build these effects for your TemTems.

549
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:30,082
So where did you checkpoint yourself in terms of budgeting or memory usage or time?

550
00:50:30,122 --> 00:50:32,702
Because you could build environments, you can build shaders.

551
00:50:32,782 --> 00:50:34,423
What kind of went on with that process?

552
00:50:35,263 --> 00:50:38,264
So where do we build the budgeting, timing, everything?

553
00:50:38,364 --> 00:50:47,686
Well, I think for optimization, the hardest thing was for, for example, Nintendo Switch, because we have lots of billboards that are just full on in screen.

554
00:50:47,727 --> 00:50:49,407
So you can already imagine the overdraw.

555
00:50:49,847 --> 00:51:00,630
So when we optimized for the Switch, it took a long time because we want to capture that feeling that it feels like very rich, the effects, but doesn't lose the glow and everything in the shapes.

556
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:02,791
And that was pretty difficult.

557
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:13,415
Yeah, we had to kill our uber shader that we had for PC and just build several super minor shaders that worked for that.

558
00:51:14,275 --> 00:51:19,918
And also regarding time, I think we did every technique within 3 or 4 days.

559
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:23,773
Of course, it took more, it took less.

560
00:51:24,153 --> 00:51:30,675
Outgrowth took two weeks because of the color change and everything and the slight colorblind values.

561
00:51:30,735 --> 00:51:35,437
I was like, okay, these colors, oh no, again, again, back and forth, but that happens.

562
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:37,731
Yeah, and a follow-up.

563
00:51:37,991 --> 00:51:44,338
Do you guys use the visual effects graph, or do you guys use particle systems, or do you guys use... Like, what's the core for what you build?

564
00:51:44,598 --> 00:51:49,162
We use Shuriken, because it was built with a built-in render pipeline, a 2019.4 version.

565
00:51:49,202 --> 00:51:49,843
Cool.

566
00:51:50,704 --> 00:51:51,705
For example... Oh, sorry.

567
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:58,431
For example, like, the routes we animated by hand with the animator, because you just have control in the way the feeling control.

568
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,733
Like, you have to feel in this, okay, how can I really...

569
00:52:01,474 --> 00:52:05,236
When the root grows, it goes like, it bursts upwards and you let it hang.

570
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:06,997
And then when it goes, it goes.

571
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:07,537
Yeah.

572
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,638
Kind of like how they do it in Naruto and like the animes.

573
00:52:09,758 --> 00:52:11,619
That's like very timing feeling.

574
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:12,080
Yeah.

575
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:12,820
Cool.

576
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,580
Well, thank you so much.

577
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:13,921
Thank you.

578
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:14,361
Thank you.

579
00:52:16,588 --> 00:52:17,148
Hi, guys.

580
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:30,351
I was curious about how you went about deciding when to trade off between keeping the animation as satisfying as possible and how much time the animation takes.

581
00:52:30,671 --> 00:52:35,552
Because I realize that sometimes, take the animation as good as it can look, you need a certain amount of time.

582
00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:40,253
But after a certain point, you're making a player wait a certain amount each time they play it.

583
00:52:40,553 --> 00:52:44,014
So how did you go about deciding when it needed to be

584
00:52:51,457 --> 00:52:57,782
So regarding timing and how long do you think a technique animation should take and how we decided.

585
00:52:58,202 --> 00:53:00,283
So we have the holds for example.

586
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:05,727
So 0 holds is 2 to 3 seconds and 3 holds so how long the technique animation holds before getting cast.

587
00:53:06,448 --> 00:53:08,789
possible to cast, it's nine seconds.

588
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:17,332
But we have, for example, the giant lava wall that you saw with like platypus standing there and then eventually lava will pour over the temtem.

589
00:53:18,193 --> 00:53:30,478
First, the technique was 15 seconds or so, 13, because we had like a whole concept art that the lava walls are appearing, we have a camera pouring like over the lava wall, looking downwards, then we follow the lava, following downwards.

590
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,920
And then our shader guard, Adrieu Von Andres, he was like,

591
00:53:35,894 --> 00:53:36,995
It's 15 seconds.

592
00:53:37,495 --> 00:53:39,636
It's two holds, so it needs to be seven seconds.

593
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,878
So we had to just cut off like half of the technique animation and still make it work.

594
00:53:44,618 --> 00:53:46,799
So sometimes it's also a try and error.

595
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:52,442
We have the, because we have lots and loads of fun, but sometimes you forget, ooh, okay, this takes too long.

596
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:53,963
Players are not gonna like this.

597
00:53:54,363 --> 00:53:55,364
We got too excited with it.

598
00:53:55,604 --> 00:53:56,304
Yeah.

599
00:53:57,004 --> 00:53:59,946
And also if you think about it, like if it's a three hold technique,

600
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:02,147
it's gonna be seen much less.

601
00:54:03,488 --> 00:54:05,268
Because you have to wait three turns to use it.

602
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:09,250
So in the end, we balance it out.

603
00:54:09,431 --> 00:54:12,992
A technique that's three seconds, maybe you can use it three times, so in the end it's nine seconds.

604
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:17,335
And one technique that you can use it once every three turns, it's nine seconds.

605
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:19,235
So it kind of balances it out, yeah.

606
00:54:20,856 --> 00:54:21,677
Thank you.

607
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:22,237
Oh, yes.

608
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:27,681
Thank you so much for doing this talk, it was really nice and really cool to learn about.

609
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:31,866
And I was wondering, for your concepting stuff, what are you guys trying to focus on with that?

610
00:54:31,906 --> 00:54:35,971
Are you more like color theory stuff, or like, I guess just what's your focus with that?

611
00:54:36,992 --> 00:54:42,618
I think when I start out at Tantum, I'm a huge advocate of overpaints for visual effects artists because

612
00:54:43,632 --> 00:54:45,632
For example, when you're a smaller team, you don't have concept art.

613
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:50,874
And I think it's, uh, for example, kit bashing sometimes might take a bit longer and just drawing it out.

614
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:55,315
Even a little sketch or just full out sketch 15, maybe up 20 minutes.

615
00:54:55,895 --> 00:54:57,455
It just shows in one shot.

616
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:58,655
This is what we want.

617
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:00,356
We don't do like some techniques.

618
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:03,996
We do the charge part, the impact part, and then the ending part.

619
00:55:04,356 --> 00:55:09,137
And we concept it out, but we never go longer than 30 minutes in a way.

620
00:55:10,078 --> 00:55:11,398
But this is just, uh,

621
00:55:12,912 --> 00:55:14,073
Sorry, what was the question again?

622
00:55:14,573 --> 00:55:16,795
Oh, just to get your focus for the concept.

623
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:17,075
Yeah.

624
00:55:17,115 --> 00:55:23,220
So with the focus, it's like to capture that main impact moment, the highest part of the technique animation.

625
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,841
Awesome.

626
00:55:24,861 --> 00:55:25,421
Thank you so much.

627
00:55:25,581 --> 00:55:25,861
Thank you.

628
00:55:28,123 --> 00:55:28,964
Hello.

629
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:33,587
I have a question about your gradients and your gradient management system.

630
00:55:33,627 --> 00:55:35,809
How do you iterate making new gradients?

631
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:38,871
Let's say you make a new like attack class or.

632
00:55:39,893 --> 00:55:44,957
Damage type and then also how do you balance that against your very vibrant and colorful environments?

633
00:55:47,398 --> 00:55:52,702
Like do you mean for example, how do we tackle our color gradients for example LUT textures?

634
00:55:54,303 --> 00:55:54,723
The what, sorry?

635
00:55:54,904 --> 00:55:55,784
The LUT textures

636
00:55:57,779 --> 00:56:05,845
Well, we can, for example, with knockback blast that you saw with the very black and white flashing frames that you're really building up to the anticipation.

637
00:56:06,386 --> 00:56:11,470
Sometimes we invert the colors by accident and it's like, oh, that's cool.

638
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:12,291
That's cool.

639
00:56:12,651 --> 00:56:14,652
And then we use it for loads of other techniques.

640
00:56:15,453 --> 00:56:41,296
but yeah with colors and everything and other other times we just like for example if it's an electrical field we think that we have to go for those blue or bluish dark blue values so in the end it's mostly going back to our color palettes and applying that to the to the technique also of course if it's something super particular like the electrocution thing we have to go for references outside of the game

641
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:46,200
So it can be anime references or other games, of course.

642
00:56:47,901 --> 00:56:48,702
So yeah, I think that's it.

643
00:56:49,383 --> 00:56:49,603
Thanks.

644
00:56:50,183 --> 00:56:50,484
Awesome.

645
00:56:50,504 --> 00:56:50,824
Thank you.

646
00:56:51,805 --> 00:56:52,425
No more questions?

647
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:54,567
All right, cool.

648
00:56:54,607 --> 00:56:55,808
Thank you so much, everybody.
