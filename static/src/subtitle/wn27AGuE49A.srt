1
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:08,347
All right, so we're talking about playgrounds

2
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:10,148
and level design, applying playgrounds.

3
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:13,411
Briefly about me, my background's in modding,

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:14,532
which will be relevant later,

5
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:16,914
and I also work as a multiplayer level designer,

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,935
including these games and some others.

7
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:20,977
But we're here to talk about playgrounds,

8
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:22,158
real-world playgrounds,

9
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:23,839
and what they can teach us about level design.

10
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:27,062
Specifically, what they can teach us about level geometry.

11
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:31,205
Before we get too far into details, let's get academic.

12
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:36,351
Playgrounds are persistent community spaces for non-prescriptive play.

13
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:41,816
Playgrounds are not an obstacle course to beat, or a puzzle to solve, or a story to tell.

14
00:00:42,337 --> 00:00:45,620
There are aspects of obstacle courses and stories to playgrounds,

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,304
but playgrounds are not consumed through interaction. They persist.

16
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:54,369
A good playground facilitates many stories, many obstacle courses, and many forms of play.

17
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:57,852
Playgrounds are also fundamentally multiplayer spaces,

18
00:00:58,272 --> 00:01:00,113
and they scale according to player need.

19
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:03,495
That means player count, game mode, and...

20
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:06,356
Oh, I'm blanking on the third one.

21
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:10,843
player trust.

22
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:12,123
Next slide, of course.

23
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:15,144
So Raf Koster and a team with Google explored the idea of a

24
00:01:15,204 --> 00:01:16,705
trust spectrum in games.

25
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,526
And a similar idea also applies to playgrounds.

26
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:23,047
Here we can scale up from solo and parallel play to

27
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:26,068
cooperative activities and upward to large group

28
00:01:26,148 --> 00:01:27,788
competitive and cooperative activities.

29
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,392
There's also some overlap between the idea of playgrounds and sandboxes.

30
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:34,513
Often we talk about sandbox level design.

31
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:37,254
The main difference is that sandboxes,

32
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,455
it's kind of a neutral space where you bring toys.

33
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:42,496
Playgrounds are the toy itself.

34
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,717
Sandboxes are also often consumed through interaction,

35
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,198
while playgrounds persist.

36
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:50,539
Sandboxes are often really good at parallel play and solo play,

37
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,820
but they don't offer the most rich cooperative or competitive experiences.

38
00:01:57,063 --> 00:02:00,607
The core of this talk is about level geometry, but keep in mind that

39
00:02:01,348 --> 00:02:04,893
the way we build our levels and the way we shape our levels affects multiplayer systems.

40
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:09,218
If we played Deathmatch on a King of the Hill map, it would still probably feel like King of the Hill,

41
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,701
because level design and game systems work together.

42
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:14,144
So here's a playground for my neighborhood.

43
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:16,046
It's pretty basic, pretty simple.

44
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:19,069
If you live in North America, you've probably seen playgrounds like this all over the place.

45
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:22,992
And the important thing here is we can't convert this layout directly to our video game levels,

46
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:24,494
and we also probably wouldn't want to.

47
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:26,596
But there is still something we can learn from it.

48
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,341
So here's the same playground up close.

49
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:30,402
Let's break it down.

50
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,105
As the fundamental unit, we have a module,

51
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,606
or a self-contained chunk.

52
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:37,870
At the heart of this module is a platform elevated up.

53
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:39,932
This serves as a kind of goal.

54
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:41,954
Keep in mind this playground is for young kids.

55
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:43,175
For me, standing on that platform

56
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:44,657
is not a meaningful vantage point,

57
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:46,579
but for a five-year-old, you know, it is.

58
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:51,734
In order to get up to that platform, our goal, there's a skill check that the player must pass.

59
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:54,596
A route up, in this case a staircase.

60
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:58,539
The important thing to keep in mind is that the skill check is not a binary pass or fail.

61
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,023
You can fail, trip and hurt yourself, but most use will depend and fall into a range of skill.

62
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:06,745
For a three-year-old, you'll be pretty slow on those stairs.

63
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:07,885
For a five-year-old, okay.

64
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:10,347
For a ten-year-old, maybe you can go two steps at a time.

65
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:13,243
And if you keep the multiplayer context in mind,

66
00:03:13,783 --> 00:03:15,444
if I can take those stairs two steps at a time

67
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:16,584
and my opponent can't,

68
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,425
now I've got tactics I can exploit.

69
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,067
Now that we've reached the platform,

70
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,668
we have routes back down, and these function as rewards,

71
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:25,189
in this case, slides.

72
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:27,490
These are also opportunities for subversive play

73
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,651
for the skillful player who can run up the slide.

74
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:32,912
Subversive play is basically whenever a constraint

75
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:34,933
of the design can be used against its intent,

76
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,634
or when the player thinks they're doing something

77
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,575
against intent, whether or not it actually was.

78
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:41,886
Hard to see, but there's also a set piece in the back.

79
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:43,066
This is a little steering wheel.

80
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:46,007
A good set piece helps for landmarking

81
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:47,647
and theming a module.

82
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,008
Cool, so now that we have this language of modules,

83
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:53,108
we can build into more complex structures.

84
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:55,169
So this playground's a little more interesting

85
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,769
because here we have several modules

86
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:58,349
that combine into a larger structure.

87
00:03:58,929 --> 00:03:59,710
As our first module,

88
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,490
we have a staircase going around the right.

89
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,710
We've got a rock wall that we're seeing the back of,

90
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,891
and we've got some slides.

91
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,611
This connects to a second module

92
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:08,911
with this sort of twisted ladder pole thing.

93
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:14,839
This goes up to a third module with a twisty tube slide, a long slide, a ladder going down

94
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,402
the interior and a big rock wall.

95
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:21,128
And that ladder connects to our fourth module with a small staircase, some monkey bars and

96
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:22,170
a little jump up stump.

97
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:23,872
And that takes us back to the ground.

98
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,651
In the abstract, if we rearrange this,

99
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:29,251
we see this formula is a hierarchy, or trees.

100
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,552
As a playground, it's pretty cool,

101
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:33,072
but it's also still pretty simple.

102
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:34,852
If we played a game of tag here,

103
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:36,653
the lack of loops would be a problem.

104
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:38,393
We'd reach one end of the structure,

105
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:40,173
and the only way to go back to the other end

106
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,414
would be to run around on the ground or backtrack.

107
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:44,554
But now that we have this abstract language,

108
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:46,195
it's pretty easy to imagine a version

109
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:47,475
that connects as cycles.

110
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:49,335
In fact, now with this abstract language,

111
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,876
we can imagine infinite, sprawling, huge playgrounds

112
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,576
if we so wanted.

113
00:04:54,438 --> 00:04:57,519
How do we convert this to level geometry and level design?

114
00:04:58,539 --> 00:04:59,820
Here is where we get to modding.

115
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,761
Most of my experiments have been for Quake, the one from 1996.

116
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:05,841
For those of you who do not know,

117
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:07,942
that is a screenshot of the first level in Quake.

118
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:14,224
When applying Playgrounds, the really important thing

119
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:16,765
is that we have a robust skill set to draw on,

120
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:17,765
that we can apply.

121
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:19,933
and Quake has that.

122
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:22,094
Quake also has advanced skill checks

123
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:23,315
for its movement systems,

124
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,596
which we'll get to in a little bit.

125
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:26,597
There's also an active player community,

126
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,639
which means there's a lot of feedback that we can get.

127
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:31,941
The maps are also fundamentally multiplayer

128
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,802
in that they support solo, cooperative,

129
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:35,303
and PVP on all maps.

130
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:37,084
Once we adjust the layouts

131
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:38,905
to be more in the playground format,

132
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,887
we have something that's much closer

133
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:43,348
to the playgrounds I've described

134
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,349
than many other games that exist.

135
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,938
So taking those ideas together, here's a basic playground.

136
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,640
Again, if you've played Quake,

137
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:52,502
if you looked at the other screenshot,

138
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:54,163
this looks nothing like a normal Quake level,

139
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:55,344
but this is a Quake level.

140
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:59,928
And once we overlay and break it back down

141
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,431
into the ideas of modules and the skills involved,

142
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:04,473
this should look familiar by now.

143
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:07,595
Rearranged, and if we swapped out those skills,

144
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:11,479
the same hierarchy and loops could describe a playground.

145
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:15,608
Pushing these ideas further, adding monsters and items

146
00:06:15,648 --> 00:06:17,068
for more rewards and skill checks,

147
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:18,609
and we get some pretty neat playgrounds.

148
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,910
Importantly, once we add enemy respawning

149
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,910
and item respawning persistence,

150
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,271
this level becomes a place to be

151
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,031
rather than an obstacle course to complete,

152
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:29,131
like most Quake levels.

153
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:32,472
Importantly, while there are objectives to complete,

154
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,153
there are many ways to achieve them

155
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:36,693
and many ways of adding new goals and new ways of playing.

156
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:39,614
This is a test.

157
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,933
So the player got a ring of shadows, which means the monsters aren't seeing them.

158
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:52,115
Normally the ring of shadows only lasts about 30 seconds, which wouldn't be enough to beat

159
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:56,058
the level, but this player is also doing crazy stuff.

160
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:56,658
So...

161
00:06:56,698 --> 00:07:06,525
Alright, there you go.

162
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:12,635
The speedrun, normally that map takes about 10 to 15 minutes for a first playthrough to go through,

163
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:18,596
but in the speedrun, using the advanced skill checks of rocket jumping, circle jumping, ramp jumping,

164
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:20,457
a player is able to beat it in 27 seconds.

165
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:25,538
And that's not something I planned, but it's something that's possible within this playground format.

166
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:29,899
And it's a way of adding new goals and new ways of playing on top of the experience

167
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:35,481
that are separate from what would traditionally be a standard obstacle course.

168
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:38,058
At this point, some of you may be thinking,

169
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,339
but Andrew, I'm not making that kind of game.

170
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,559
How does this help me?

171
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,120
And the reality is that probably you aren't making

172
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,701
this kind of game because this is a very strange thing

173
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:47,522
I'm exploring.

174
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:50,463
But if you are working in 3D environments

175
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,763
and you have player avatars,

176
00:07:51,943 --> 00:07:53,964
and you're worried about camera, character, and controls,

177
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,165
then you can still apply Playgrounds.

178
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,182
If you're involved in prototyping or early pre-production, you need metrics test maps.

179
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:06,725
The standard metrics test map is basically just a 3D equivalent of a meter stick.

180
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:09,726
It tells you how far, how fast, how high, and so on.

181
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:12,688
But it doesn't tell you whether your metrics are fun.

182
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,949
So, metrics playgrounds.

183
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:19,126
Here's an example of a metrics playground I built for a game

184
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:21,608
where we wanted to get the fundamentals right very early on.

185
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:25,191
We had a lot of fundamental rich moveset

186
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:26,312
that we wanted to explore.

187
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:28,174
We had a tight third-person camera,

188
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:30,556
we had double jumping, clambering, crouching,

189
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:32,717
sliding, sprinting, all sorts of things.

190
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:34,519
We wanted to make sure that all those things

191
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,762
worked cohesively and none of those abilities

192
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:39,063
stood out as sore thumbs.

193
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,433
As we started adding more gameplay mechanics

194
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:43,734
and discovering what our game was,

195
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,316
we dropped them into the level as well.

196
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,698
We had gunplay, so there were things to shoot at

197
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:48,799
and things that shot at you.

198
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,302
And this was a way to sample the entire experience

199
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:53,903
of the game in one spot.

200
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:57,166
Would our final levels look anything like Playgrounds?

201
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,768
Probably not, and that's okay.

202
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:03,191
The value of Playgrounds here was to help us identify

203
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,493
the fun of the game rather than worrying

204
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:08,576
about the level design just yet.

205
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,401
Returning to our idea of playgrounds,

206
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:15,721
I've really only scratched the surface with my example so far.

207
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:18,802
Really, we've gotten at the non-prescriptive aspect

208
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21,303
through our approach to level geometry.

209
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:25,063
There's a lot more work to be done around the persistent community spaces as well.

210
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:28,444
To me, playgrounds are an interesting metaphor

211
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:31,185
for what we can do with level design around multiplayer.

212
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:35,645
It's an example of how level geometry affects system design.

213
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:37,826
And it's a way for level geometry

214
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,520
to allow multiplayer to be more flexible to our players' needs.

215
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,300
Thanks.

216
00:09:51,663 --> 00:09:53,563
Let me see if I can get that YouTube video to play.

217
00:09:53,924 --> 00:10:04,567
No.

218
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,147
If you have questions you can come up to the mic.

219
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:08,466
And if you don't, that's all right as well.

220
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:15,751
Hello.

221
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:18,853
I was just wondering if you had any examples of games that

222
00:10:18,873 --> 00:10:20,074
kind of have similar structures.

223
00:10:20,094 --> 00:10:22,235
Because one example that I was thinking

224
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,377
of when you were showing your final example

225
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,539
was Apex Legends has one level.

226
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:28,700
It's like water treatment.

227
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,001
Like that whole area looks very similar to the map

228
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,043
that you showed in one of your last slides.

229
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:38,432
Yeah, I haven't played Apex Legends yet, but I feel like Battle Royales are one of the cases that's exploring it.

230
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:42,335
More of a playground approach, and it's very exciting for me to see that.

231
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:48,580
I think they are still pretty rigid in some ways. They're more flexible than traditional PvP experiences.

232
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:53,098
there is more flexibility around,

233
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:55,119
like I play PUBG as a road trip sim.

234
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,621
I don't play it to win.

235
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:58,582
And the fact that it lets me do that

236
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:01,805
without ruining somebody else's experience is amazing.

237
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:04,067
Like that's unheard of like 10 years ago.

238
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:05,408
So it's exciting.

239
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:07,810
Does that answer your question?

240
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,472
I was curious if you had any other examples.

241
00:11:10,732 --> 00:11:11,093
Oh, oh.

242
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:14,095
Mario 64 with co-op.

243
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,208
is pretty cool.

244
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:22,531
There's a speed run of Mario 64 with co-op, I think, hacked in.

245
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:24,273
That's just amazing.

246
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:27,094
But it's another case where the level is consumed

247
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:27,995
through interaction.

248
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,496
So it's still not 100%.

249
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,597
Thanks.

250
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:34,979
Hi.

251
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,681
Do you think that this playground concept is

252
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:40,143
something that is in any way applicable in a two

253
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:40,983
dimensional environment?

254
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:47,819
I haven't done much 2D level design, so off the top of my head...

255
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:55,426
I don't know, I feel like you could take something like Spelunky.

256
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,768
Were you here for the previous talk?

257
00:11:58,628 --> 00:11:58,849
Okay.

258
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,654
So radically non-linear level design is Audrey's talk.

259
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:06,335
Or Aubrey.

260
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:07,997
Okay, Aubrey.

261
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:09,038
And...

262
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:17,480
Yeah, I feel like a contained arena, almost Pac-Man-like, probably would let you do some interesting things there.

263
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:18,841
Thank you.

264
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:21,684
Hey.

265
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:26,430
What kind of concerns do you have for making sure that the parts of the playground, like, feel attached,

266
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,495
rather than just, like, independent parts who just happen to be put next to each other?

267
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:35,084
Well, it's specifically that they build up into a hierarchy.

268
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:37,887
A lot of this is that there's gravity at play

269
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:39,508
and that you can fall back down,

270
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:41,329
and to get to the higher points,

271
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,471
you have to take a route up,

272
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,994
and that naturally creates connectivity

273
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:47,735
between these nodes.

274
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:51,858
I'm not sure that answers your question, though.

275
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:56,199
No, that's fine. It's just like something feels like, like,

276
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,380
separate puzzles that just happen to be put together,

277
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,240
and there's like, what kind of thought is put into making sure

278
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,001
they feel fine as a whole rather than independently?

279
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:06,902
Mm. A lot of it's just playtesting a lot,

280
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:09,462
because if it's too far of an outlier,

281
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:12,583
then nobody's playing it, nobody's using it, and it's, yeah.

282
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:15,784
All right.

283
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:17,958
Hi there, awesome talk.

284
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,923
With regards to this, one of the things you had mentioned

285
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:24,947
was you have the set pieces and stuff with regards

286
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,168
to actual playgrounds.

287
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:29,772
And we've got these, with your playtest examples,

288
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,657
the different elements that make up your level.

289
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:38,636
When we're getting more along in pipelines for level production,

290
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:41,758
we start to add more geometric features.

291
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:44,179
We start to add more things that draw the eye more.

292
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,880
How do we, like if we were going to theoretically make games

293
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,522
that sort of center around these kind of node-based ideas,

294
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:55,623
how do we try and preserve that node-based,

295
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:58,204
like keeping the focus while adding

296
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,145
our geometric on top of that?

297
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:03,545
I don't think it inherently has to be as geometric as I've done here.

298
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:07,967
A lot of that's for the sake of fast iterations and, again, helping players realize this isn't

299
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:08,648
standard Quake.

300
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:10,428
Don't expect standard Quake gameplay.

301
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:17,772
You could do, and I have done, experiments that are much more traditionally pretty and

302
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:19,473
less LEGO blocks.

303
00:14:21,514 --> 00:14:28,257
The specifics of solving for a high-fidelity environment, it's going to be case by case.

304
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:32,468
Do we need to switch to Jerry or do we still have time?

305
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:38,250
I'm not sure what time it is.

306
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,271
We started, I think you have a couple more minutes.

307
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:42,771
Okay.

308
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:43,812
Who's next?

309
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:46,332
You can go first.

310
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:52,514
Hi. So you mentioned that playgrounds are where you bring toys and sandboxes is the toy itself.

311
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:52,934
Yep.

312
00:14:53,134 --> 00:14:58,516
Do you find that there's any room for overlap between the two or in the case, like, is there any examples that you can think of?

313
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:06,321
Yeah, yeah, I feel like often the term sandbox has been used to mean playgrounds in some cases.

314
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:13,804
Like, I'm thinking of Bungie games in particular, like sandbox designers around weapons and the Halo series.

315
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:19,387
To me that's almost more playground design than it is sandbox design, because it's not...

316
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:24,949
I don't know, there's some fuzziness in the terms there and there's...

317
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:29,848
definitely some overlap. I think the main thing is how persistent the space is.

318
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:39,553
So, talking about how you use playgrounds as a form of

319
00:15:40,114 --> 00:15:43,195
establishing your metrics, do you

320
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,557
consider this to be the most important part of

321
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,779
this playground technique or that it...

322
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,941
sort of like spreads out throughout the entire design of it.

323
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:59,463
So like for example, you said earlier that you create a playground to establish your

324
00:15:59,503 --> 00:15:59,963
metrics.

325
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:11,129
Does that sort of design element showcase itself as good as it seemed with the metric

326
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,490
establishment that you had showed earlier?

327
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,630
When you say showed earlier, do you mean?

328
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,711
So like that image where you had showed that playground

329
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:22,651
that you built.

330
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:25,012
Yeah, this one?

331
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:25,512
Yeah.

332
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:31,534
So does this sort of playground establishment

333
00:16:32,754 --> 00:16:37,155
translate better for establishing metrics, or just

334
00:16:37,215 --> 00:16:38,155
in general design?

335
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:44,857
Or does it, in your opinion, spread out basically evenly

336
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:45,557
all over the place?

337
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:50,935
Um, like for me this doesn't replace other metrics test maps

338
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:53,858
because you do still want to verify, hey, does my code actually work?

339
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:56,060
Am I actually jumping five feet? That kind of thing.

340
00:16:57,421 --> 00:17:01,085
I feel like though the context that's provided by this kind of

341
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:07,211
a fun experimental play space is very valuable

342
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:10,994
in determining whether you're, um, whether it's actually fun.

343
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,575
definitely a problem I've run into in the past.

344
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:16,657
The only metrics test map we had before this

345
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:18,559
was a big, open, flat box.

346
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,241
And as a result, everybody was running really fast

347
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:23,784
and jumping really high, and attack abilities

348
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:25,125
were going miles.

349
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:29,369
And obviously, because if you don't have context around you,

350
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:30,990
you can't tell how fast you're moving.

351
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:33,913
And as soon as we did this, it was like, oh, whoa, slow down.

352
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,476
So hopefully that answers your question.

353
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:38,678
Yeah, thank you very much.

354
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:42,742
Hi everybody, good afternoon, it's great to be here.

355
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:50,024
Professor of Game Design at Miami University

356
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:51,445
in Oxford, Ohio.

357
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:53,747
It still doesn't make any sense to me,

358
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:55,369
but that's just the way it is.

359
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:57,931
And I'm a play engineer.

360
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,194
So a lot of what I do is designing physical,

361
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:05,637
hardware, electronic, digital experiences.

362
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:07,699
So kind of running the gamut.

363
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:10,501
If you've ever been to Alt Control GDC, for example,

364
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:12,362
that's something I've been involved with

365
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:13,443
for quite a few years.

366
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:17,943
And this is real world level design.

367
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:19,605
Sort of.

368
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:24,249
It's going to be a bit of a bait and switch, so that's fun.

369
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,412
This is probably a little more accurate to it.

370
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:29,033
So what we're really going to talk about

371
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:34,058
is a few lenses that I use to look at designing in spaces

372
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:39,382
and how that connects to digital worlds, real worlds,

373
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:41,684
where the similarities are, where the differences are,

374
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:44,587
and specifically looking at the boundaries of designed

375
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:47,169
experience and the experience bleed.

376
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,481
So this is something I use with a lot of the work that I build.

377
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:55,542
But two big inspirations for me that I'm

378
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:56,922
sure you're all very familiar with

379
00:18:57,142 --> 00:19:01,084
are Disney and Nintendo, two masters of design.

380
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,324
So Disney's always been kind of at the forefront

381
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,325
of immersive and experience design

382
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,046
way before they were buzzwords.

383
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:10,487
And Nintendo, I think, is a really major innovator

384
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:10,947
in games.

385
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:12,628
Breath of the Wild, especially, I

386
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:15,349
think is really impressive with how unique and thoughtful

387
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:16,729
the open world design was.

388
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:19,851
And I think there's some really interesting similarities between them.

389
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:25,235
You may recognize some of these images as supplemental to a Nintendo presentation

390
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,276
on the Breath of the Wild world design.

391
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:32,680
And what I see are concepts very similar to how theme parks have approached large-scale layouts,

392
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:37,424
especially the idea of attraction or magnetism to landmarks

393
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:42,467
and the use of obstructions to block or control the reveal of something,

394
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,649
called a berm in theme park design.

395
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,861
So if you look at the attracting elements in this view, you can see that the positioning,

396
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:56,483
the scale and the density of the landmarks all affect how they attract us without confining

397
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,323
us or creating a golden path.

398
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:04,145
The large landmarks help determine where additional points of interest can be placed, or if you're

399
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:06,105
at Disney, where you would put a churro stand.

400
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:11,435
So here's a picture at Magic Kingdom,

401
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:15,360
and you can see how similar that is to that screenshot

402
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,461
in Breath of the Wild.

403
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:19,565
Once again, it's this very deliberate use

404
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,689
of position, elevation, scale, and density

405
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:25,652
that's going to attract us in different directions.

406
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:27,634
Now, there's no wrong path here.

407
00:20:27,855 --> 00:20:29,196
There's just your path.

408
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:33,160
And you can examine this at any scale from any position,

409
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,881
whether you're at Disney or you're running around a game

410
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:36,781
like Breath of the Wild.

411
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:40,582
Imagine gravitational fields of varying sizes

412
00:20:40,702 --> 00:20:43,863
pulling people to and fro as they wander around this park.

413
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:47,644
Cinderella's Castle perhaps being the strongest pull,

414
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:49,985
taking people in a wide arc

415
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:52,005
as they move around during the day.

416
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,213
So this is kind of the modern definition pertaining to design entertainment,

417
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:59,775
also applies to like Hollywood sets.

418
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,318
But a berm, even at Disney, isn't always about blocking things,

419
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:07,020
but it's also about controlling your view,

420
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,442
which I think is a really important similarity to Breath of the Wild,

421
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,464
where they used what they called a triangle rule

422
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,927
as a way of hiding landmarks, like a berm, but then revealing.

423
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:21,712
And in fact, the reveal of Cinderella's castle when entering the park was really, really

424
00:21:21,772 --> 00:21:22,733
important to Walt.

425
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:27,858
When you get to the train station at Magic Kingdom, that was actually built as a berm

426
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:31,822
to control the reveal, similar to the Breath of the Wild's triangle rule.

427
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:36,748
So when you get up there, you can't see anything inside the park.

428
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:42,756
And then you go to the left or the right through a tunnel, and then you come upon Main Street.

429
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:48,663
And finally, Cinderella's castle is revealed, perfectly framed within that space.

430
00:21:49,604 --> 00:21:53,048
Now, all of that is happening within the gates of the park.

431
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:59,754
It is the boundary of the Disney experience, and everything beyond that boundary is completely

432
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:03,418
under their control, much like in digital games.

433
00:22:04,218 --> 00:22:06,320
So the boundary in this context...

434
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,553
is what allows them to then create that buildup

435
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:15,596
and that reveal to crescendo to very powerful moments.

436
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,540
But it's not actually where the audience experience

437
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,080
is beginning.

438
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:25,465
For the experience bleed, that's everything for Disney

439
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,107
leading up to those gates.

440
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:31,469
Disney influences that experience bleed through their mobile app,

441
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:34,530
their airport shuttle, their automatic luggage transfer,

442
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,730
and a hundred other ways,

443
00:22:36,171 --> 00:22:39,712
so that the closer you get to Disney, the more magical it feels,

444
00:22:39,752 --> 00:22:42,113
and the more things are just kind of happening for you.

445
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:47,815
So I think it's really useful to identify the boundary of your design

446
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:50,917
so that you can start and use that as an anchor point

447
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:53,398
for examining and influencing and designing

448
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:56,519
for the experience bleed that leads up to that.

449
00:22:57,219 --> 00:22:58,540
Now, the imposition of a boundary

450
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,441
is pretty different for a digital game.

451
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:02,241
You've got this rectangle of light.

452
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,122
You've got some inputs that you touch.

453
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:08,824
So digital game design primarily focuses entirely

454
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:11,826
on the revealing of their world rather than having

455
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:14,427
to deal with blocking ours, because you're

456
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:16,668
in control of absolutely everything in there.

457
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:19,909
Breath of the Wild doesn't have to worry about making sure

458
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:23,931
there's a mountain over here so that nobody sees downtown Los

459
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:24,351
Angeles.

460
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:30,200
But basically it focuses on that because they can't block ours.

461
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,163
So when theme parks use berms to block out sites permanently,

462
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:37,345
the reason they're doing that is to reduce contradictions.

463
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:41,548
If I'm in Tomorrowland and I can see Frontierland,

464
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:44,009
that would completely break my immersion

465
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,351
and those elements would start to cancel each other out.

466
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:48,612
With consoles, especially mobile ones,

467
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:50,134
it can seem a little bit hopeless

468
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:53,256
because there's so little control over that environment.

469
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:57,077
And as a designer, you can consider this not your problem,

470
00:23:57,798 --> 00:23:59,999
but also the real world is not going anywhere.

471
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,640
And the lack of control does not mean

472
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,321
a complete lack of influence.

473
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:07,542
I think Nintendo has thought a lot about this

474
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:09,363
when pursuing mobile and social play.

475
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:13,945
The use of Amiibos, or how Joy-Cons are able to reconfigure

476
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,385
for different styles of play.

477
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:18,787
These are different methods for them to exert influence

478
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:20,748
over the experience bleed of the games

479
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:22,068
that are played on their system.

480
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:27,071
And you don't actually have to own the platform to influence that player experience.

481
00:24:27,752 --> 00:24:33,175
In an ARG like I Love Bees, it was an entirely auxiliary design devoted to bringing fans

482
00:24:33,335 --> 00:24:37,958
into the Halo universe, and yet a completely different type of experience.

483
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:43,761
But it still provided a connection and a portal that allowed them to be even more engaged

484
00:24:44,122 --> 00:24:44,702
with the game.

485
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:47,366
But it doesn't have to be quite this extreme.

486
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:52,554
A lot of you are already working on different ways to influence the experience bleed through

487
00:24:52,654 --> 00:24:55,759
social media or marketing or even exhibiting at events like this.

488
00:24:57,568 --> 00:25:01,612
Even at a booth at GDC, you can influence that experience bleed for your game.

489
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:06,416
You can attract surprise and delight in audience into forgetting about the meeting they need

490
00:25:06,436 --> 00:25:08,958
to go to or how nervous they are about their talk.

491
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:14,823
This is Butt-Sniffing Pugs, a completely digital game, but in order to provide...

492
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:21,889
a better experience in order to attract people, in order to change people's perceptions and

493
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:26,974
forget about things that they were doing, they put that effort into influencing that

494
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:31,858
bleed by putting down the astroturf and making that alternative controller and turning it

495
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:36,803
into something where it isn't just fun to play, but it's actually fun to watch people

496
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:37,123
play.

497
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:41,987
So the point is this design lens I think is still really applicable to digital

498
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:44,349
because you can't get rid of the real world.

499
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:47,611
So how can you make people forget about it for just a little bit?

500
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:51,194
Here's a GIF of Luftrausers by Vlambeer.

501
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:55,517
I built as an experiment an alternative controller

502
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:59,279
to shift the style of play from deep mental focus

503
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,381
to an embodied form of play.

504
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,121
So I created cardboard wings, put tilt switches

505
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,662
on the ends of them for steering,

506
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:10,864
buttons at the end of the wings for firing,

507
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:12,665
and a foot pedal to accelerate.

508
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:15,487
And this is to get people to embrace

509
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:17,008
the external experience.

510
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:20,391
It was an entirely new feeling and a lot of fun

511
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:21,792
to both play and watch.

512
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:25,414
It became a fundamentally different experience,

513
00:26:25,454 --> 00:26:28,597
similar to what we sports accomplished when

514
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:29,757
playing games like tennis.

515
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,440
We found that failure was a lot more fun,

516
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:37,362
and it actually shifted the skills needed

517
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:38,823
to be good at the game.

518
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:42,686
So it was a great spectacle, but also very exhausting.

519
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:46,288
So I think it's also good to take a look at other mediums

520
00:26:46,408 --> 00:26:48,669
and communities and fandoms for how they reduce

521
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:51,031
the contradictions in their experiences,

522
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,072
and how they transition their audiences

523
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:55,774
to fully say yes to the designed reality,

524
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:58,776
whether it be a game, a film, or whatever it happens to be.

525
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:03,440
A Rocky Horror audience goes much deeper than simply putting on costumes.

526
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,644
Many bring an array of props like rice and rubber gloves and noisemakers.

527
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:12,909
Some venues or events will even provide some of these props so that people that are new

528
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:16,292
to these experiences are more encouraged to get involved.

529
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:20,555
and be fully prepared for when that film begins.

530
00:27:21,736 --> 00:27:24,317
Now the boundary in this case is the film itself.

531
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:26,138
It's what's displayed on the screen.

532
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,680
You could just walk into the theater, sit down,

533
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,742
they press play, and bam, there you go.

534
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:34,444
But it's these other acts, these influences

535
00:27:34,544 --> 00:27:38,566
that change that bleed that makes it much more enjoyable

536
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:40,428
and a really special thing for the fans.

537
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,533
There's a lot of places that are exploring this in a lot of really

538
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:47,416
interesting ways beyond just theme parks.

539
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:50,840
Meow Wolf in Phoenix with immersive art and storytelling.

540
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:53,723
Sleep No More in New York with immersive theater.

541
00:27:54,164 --> 00:27:57,588
Two Bit Circus in LA, a modern arcade with amusements and

542
00:27:57,648 --> 00:27:59,670
layers of metagames throughout the space.

543
00:28:00,532 --> 00:28:02,455
or Can Can Wonderland and the Twin Cities,

544
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:05,961
which has artist-designed mini-golf, unique games,

545
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:08,064
and interesting entertainment experiences.

546
00:28:08,585 --> 00:28:10,108
And of course, Escape Rooms,

547
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,813
which have become an entire industry unto themselves.

548
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,101
But escape rooms are often the most guilty

549
00:28:16,482 --> 00:28:18,343
in not considering the experience bleed.

550
00:28:18,683 --> 00:28:19,804
The boundary is obvious.

551
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,086
The door opens, you put in the room,

552
00:28:22,146 --> 00:28:24,528
the door closes, the clock starts, bam, there you go.

553
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:27,550
This is actually the first escape room I designed

554
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,612
called Utopia Room, and we managed to win an award for it,

555
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:31,273
which was awesome.

556
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:36,717
But sadly, my influence stopped at the boundary.

557
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:41,743
And I had no ability for that experience to bleed beyond that door.

558
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:46,768
And for players, the experience when going to something like an escape room

559
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:50,272
begins long before they enter that room.

560
00:28:50,573 --> 00:28:53,316
It may be when they finally find a parking spot.

561
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,697
It may even be before then.

562
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:56,779
They're in a state of anticipation.

563
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,604
which is a really perfect state for designers to start whispering in their ears.

564
00:29:02,044 --> 00:29:08,609
But without any influence, it's also really easy for players to put them in a state that is not conducive for that,

565
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,611
and you end up with something really jarring.

566
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:14,134
So in this case, the onboarding, I think, is really, really important,

567
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:18,678
to help them forget the world they came from and be prepared to enter that new one.

568
00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:23,324
So the bleed being ignored really hurt the experience

569
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,406
even after the boundary.

570
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,148
Personally, I would have a lot of trouble adjusting

571
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:31,330
if I open a closet, suddenly stumbled into Narnia

572
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,431
without so much as a coat,

573
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:35,032
Tumnus appears, tells me that I have 60 minutes

574
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:36,774
to keep the White Witch from killing us all.

575
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,576
First five minutes, I'd just be sputtering around

576
00:29:39,636 --> 00:29:43,098
trying to get my bearings, and I want that 60 minutes.

577
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:47,181
I want all 60 minutes to be fulfilling and engaging

578
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:49,102
and not stressful and jarring.

579
00:29:50,143 --> 00:29:52,885
So I'm not saying that you're not already doing a lot of these things,

580
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:56,888
but that looking at the experiences you design through some of these lenses

581
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,310
can help you notice spots that you've missed

582
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:02,313
or areas that you haven't been paying attention to before,

583
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:08,698
not to mention as more and more devices collect in our homes and all around us

584
00:30:08,878 --> 00:30:13,222
with Internet of Things and smart lights and TV reactive LEDs

585
00:30:13,282 --> 00:30:15,183
and smart speakers and who knows what else.

586
00:30:15,904 --> 00:30:20,985
There are going to be more and more ways for designers to reach out of the digital into

587
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:24,266
the physical world and put more and more influence.

588
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:30,808
So imagine a software update where you can approve your Switch to talk to your Hue light

589
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:34,589
bulbs and set the mood a bit when you're playing Breath of the Wild.

590
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:37,901
And maybe they stick a projector on the back of your TV

591
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,763
so the weather pattern is always on your ceiling.

592
00:30:40,823 --> 00:30:43,385
So you get that nice, warm, beautiful sunny day

593
00:30:43,845 --> 00:30:47,488
or the ominous clouds rolling in and things can get spooky.

594
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:50,062
And maybe this is really dumb.

595
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,224
But it also kind of seems a little fun, too.

596
00:30:53,244 --> 00:30:56,025
And I think it's worth continuing

597
00:30:56,065 --> 00:30:58,807
to reevaluate these things and look at what's possible,

598
00:30:58,887 --> 00:31:01,909
whether you design in real spaces like myself

599
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:03,529
or in the digital.

600
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,731
And as consoles change and what we plan changes,

601
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:07,952
other tech is gonna change.

602
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:09,933
We'll be able to use a lot more of this tech

603
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:13,435
and blur that boundary between the digital and the rest.

604
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:15,916
This is a game I created called Cylindrus.

605
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:21,218
It's a four-player wireless game with a 2D field wrapped

606
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:23,919
around a cylinder, creating this continuous space.

607
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,440
So the real world, in this case, becomes

608
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,780
part of the constraints.

609
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,641
It becomes part of the mechanics.

610
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:33,823
The level itself has to exist on a physical space

611
00:31:33,983 --> 00:31:36,184
and therefore cannot be infinite.

612
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:43,191
And this forces you to incorporate moving around that digital or virtual world

613
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:44,913
in order to better understand it.

614
00:31:45,374 --> 00:31:48,978
But essentially, it's still just a video game slapped onto a cylinder.

615
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,131
This is one called Please Stand By.

616
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,052
It's a 1950s television set

617
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:57,534
with a completely digital component,

618
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,316
but all of the interface is using the physical

619
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:04,559
and the rabbit ears, the hitting the side of the TV,

620
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:05,539
using the knobs.

621
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,882
It stands out because it is out of place in time,

622
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,202
but not in space.

623
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:14,464
It's a familiar artifact that belongs in a space.

624
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:18,048
So even though the game is digital and just made in Unity,

625
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:20,951
it could be played without any of those other components,

626
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:24,555
the controls for this experience live within the bleed.

627
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:27,418
And that experience will bleed into your memories

628
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,141
related to such a familiar artifact.

629
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:37,104
I want to leave you with the final thought of how do you use the space between your players

630
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:39,685
and your game, because it does not have to be empty.

631
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:44,827
Think about where the boundary is for what you have created, that point where you have

632
00:32:44,987 --> 00:32:50,309
full control, and then think about what happens before there and how people come up to that.

633
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,250
Thank you very much.

634
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,311
Yeah.

635
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:53,771
Thank you.

636
00:33:00,516 --> 00:33:04,294
So if anybody has any questions, hopefully we have a couple of minutes.

637
00:33:04,394 --> 00:33:05,258
But yeah.
