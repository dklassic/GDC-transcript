00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:08,614
Hello, and welcome to Keyframes and Cardboard Props,

2
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:12,457
a look inside God of War's cinematic process.

3
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:13,618
My name is Erika Pinto,

4
00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:16,520
and I'm the lead narrative animator at Santa Monica Studio.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,183
Today, I'm going to talk about everything that went

6
00:00:19,183 --> 00:00:20,684
into the creation of the scenes

7
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:22,005
like the one I'm about to show you.

8
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:23,626
Of course, just a heads up,

9
00:00:23,626 --> 00:00:26,369
there are spoilers for God of War ahead,

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:27,550
so if you haven't played the game,

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,652
I don't know if you wanna leave or just let it be spoiled.

12
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:50,632
It is time, my son. Look around at what you have done.

13
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:27,446
Come on, we gotta go!

14
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:29,688
You saw.

15
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:30,949
There's no time, look!

16
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:31,229
I have a plan!

17
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:31,729
Jump!

18
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:31,809

Jump!

36
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:37,853
Hup!

37
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:38,413
Hup!

38
00:01:38,413 --> 00:01:38,513
Hup!

39
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:38,613
Hup!

40
00:01:38,613 --> 00:01:38,774
Hup!

41
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:38,834
Hup!

42
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:41,816
Hup!

43
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:42,236
Hup!

44
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:42,576
Hup!

45
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:42,896
Hup!

46
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:43,277
Hup!

47
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:44,277
Hup!

48
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:49,841
Hup!

49
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:50,181
Hup!

50
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:50,441
Hup!

51
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:50,601
Hup!

52
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:50,701
Hup!

53
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:50,861
Hup!

54
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:51,202
Hup!

55
00:01:51,202 --> 00:01:51,262
Hup!

56
00:01:51,262 --> 00:01:51,362
Hup!

57
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:51,422
Hup!

58
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:51,482
Hup!

59
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:52,022
Hup!

60
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:53,123
Hup!

61
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:53,303
Hup!

62
00:01:53,303 --> 00:01:53,603
Hup!

63
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:53,763
Hup!

64
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:54,544
Hup!

65
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,332
That was your plan.

66
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:17,614
You're both tracked.

67
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:20,457
Let's give it up for our cinematics team.

68
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:27,105
Man, they worked hard on that.

69
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:27,626
All right.

70
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:29,148
So at the beginning of this project,

71
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:31,070
our creative director, Cory Barlock,

72
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,254
came to the cinematics team and said, I have a vision.

73
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:39,285
I want to create a seamless, immersive player experience,

74
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,228
and I want to do it with a camera that never cuts.

75
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,549
Not anywhere in a cinematic,

76
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:46,292
not between gameplay and cinematic, never.

77
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:50,355
So our question was, how do we do that?

78
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:51,837
I'm going to tell you how we did that,

79
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:53,458
and I'm going to do it step-by-step

80
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,080
using the scene I just showed you,

81
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,042
which we lovingly called the flying boat jump.

82
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,704
So named because Kratos and Atreus

83
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:01,325
jump off of a giant flying boat.

84
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:04,555
This is one of the most complex scenes in God of War

85
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:06,657
running the gamut of our entire production pipeline,

86
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:08,639
so I'm going to be referring back to it

87
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,541
throughout our presentation.

88
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,022
First, I'd like to talk a little bit

89
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:14,724
about the people involved in creating a cinematic.

90
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:16,165
At the top of our hierarchy, of course,

91
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:17,807
we've got our creative director,

92
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:20,009
who provided the overarching vision of the story

93
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:21,590
and oversaw the broad strokes

94
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,072
of the cinematic production process.

95
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:27,215
We had our writers, Matt Sophos and Rich Galbert,

96
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:28,736
who would present the director's vision

97
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:29,537
in the form of scripts.

98
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:33,014
Our director of photography, Doria Razzi,

99
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:36,096
who designed the detailed plan for executing that vision

100
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:39,119
scene by scene with a consistent cinematic language.

101
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,381
And there's the rest of our team,

102
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,002
such as our animation director, Bruno,

103
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:45,885
who provided the context for our character acting choices

104
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:47,926
and would give feedback on the animation quality.

105
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:50,106
myself, the animation lead,

106
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,848
responsible for the day-to-day production process

107
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:54,828
and ensuring the animators had everything they needed

108
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:56,429
to work to the best of their abilities,

109
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,490
also providing feedback.

110
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,130
All of our animators, several of which

111
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,371
aren't in this photo, sadly,

112
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:03,392
but they were expected to maintain

113
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:05,092
a certain level of self-autonomy

114
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:06,893
with ownership of their assigned scenes

115
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:07,853
from start to finish.

116
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,634
They would work very closely with our cinematic artist,

117
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:11,735
who would wrangle the cameras,

118
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:13,475
and they would send all of that data

119
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:14,736
over to our integration team

120
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:16,337
to put the scenes into the game engine.

121
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:18,905
And of course, we can't forget our support staff,

122
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:22,107
such as our producers and our outsource coordinator

123
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:24,868
who made sure everything was running smoothly

124
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:25,688
and getting done on time.

125
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,090
I'd like to break down our production

126
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,451
into three main phases where we were able

127
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,513
to streamline our workflow for no-cut cinematics.

128
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:38,535
Pre-visualization, or pre-vis for short,

129
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:40,616
everything we did on set at the mocap stage,

130
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:43,718
and scene assembly and polish of all of that data.

131
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:47,891
So let's start with pre-visualization.

132
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:50,132
And if you see the picture in the background,

133
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:52,813
you might get a little hint of where we went there.

134
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:53,974
Let's start with a little history.

135
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:56,675
On previous God of War projects,

136
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:59,456
all of our layout was done in Maya.

137
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:01,697
This is all right, our camera language was pretty simple.

138
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:03,117
We really only had one main rule,

139
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:04,638
which was to keep the camera alive.

140
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,238
So we didn't have any static shots.

141
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:09,620
You can see it might move to follow Kratos' gaze.

142
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,940
It might push in a little bit to focus on his daughter

143
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,041
as we come into the scene.

144
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:16,901
we would use cuts to show details and character reactions.

145
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,984
But there wasn't much attention paid

146
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:20,225
to lens choice or anything.

147
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:22,187
This was pretty passable,

148
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:26,391
but we realized this method did not work with no cuts.

149
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:29,695
Here's a very early test scene from this current project,

150
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:31,156
and I'm gonna kinda rip it apart

151
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:33,198
and talk about the failure points.

152
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:34,480
This is my scene, so I can do that.

153
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,785
So, you could see, first of all,

154
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:41,786
the characters tended to freeze in place.

155
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:43,807
We didn't really know what to do with them,

156
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,867
and that forced the camera to swing around

157
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,668
and traverse great distances

158
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:49,369
without really any motivation to do so.

159
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:52,290
I was trying to get reaction shots on their faces

160
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,310
as they talked to each other,

161
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,910
but again, since I froze them in place,

162
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,111
I didn't really know what to do with the camera,

163
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:59,052
so it would move around kind of awkwardly.

164
00:05:59,052 --> 00:05:59,952
It wasn't really grounded

165
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,793
the way a real camera person would behave.

166
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,666
If you look at the start of a scene,

167
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,648
you could see that the camera is just way too high.

168
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:07,109
A person would have to be floating in the air

169
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:08,170
in order to get that shot.

170
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,352
And then it very quickly swings around

171
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:13,335
and starts going backwards across an entire field.

172
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:16,878
And it was also just a very time-consuming process

173
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,841
for something that didn't yield very great results.

174
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:21,422
What we really needed was someone

175
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,923
with experience in staging,

176
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:24,184
who could help us tackle oners

177
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,866
in a more sophisticated way.

178
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,321
So that's when we hired Doria Rossi.

179
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,322
And with Doria on board, we began to think about

180
00:06:31,322 --> 00:06:33,643
staging our scenes as a complex dance

181
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,863
between actors and the camera.

182
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:37,384
We would often use top-down diagrams to plan the scenes.

183
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:40,145
Most of the time this was just done on a whiteboard

184
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:42,345
with some markers, but here I've cleaned it up

185
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:43,726
a little bit for you guys so you can see.

186
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:44,786
Here's our camera.

187
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:48,508
The red dot represents Kratos and he's carrying a boar.

188
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,808
The green dot over here is Atreus

189
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:52,149
and the blue dot is Freya

190
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:55,150
and they're all going inside their giant turtle house.

191
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,730
Let me go ahead and play this scene for you.

192
00:06:58,205 --> 00:06:59,525
Hello?

193
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:04,488
If my laptop would cooperate.

194
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:08,271
Hang on just a second.

195
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:11,993
Come on, don't break on me.

196
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:16,136
Place him on the stave there.

197
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:22,019
You can see the camera follows Kratos in

198
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:27,102
and parks behind her as Freya goes up to her shelf.

199
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:30,134
Atreus comes in from screen right.

200
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:30,674
You want a balloon?

201
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:31,195
It's better this way.

202
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:33,436
Yeah, my father doesn't like people either.

203
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:33,516
Boy.

204
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:34,656
Whoa, you don't.

205
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:36,417
Hold him still before he hurts himself.

206
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:40,139
And Atreus kind of moves off to one side and stays out of the way.

207
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:49,083
And you'll notice that the camera is constantly doing minor little movements to shift the focus from one character to another.

208
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,545
I need two more things.

209
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:53,405
Fresh red root grows just behind the house.

210
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:54,426
Can you pull a cluster?

211
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:01,183
You'll see Atreus will go off screen,

212
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:05,204
and then the camera moves and parks behind them again

213
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:07,504
to let Freya and Kratos have their little heart

214
00:08:07,504 --> 00:08:09,045
to heart moment.

215
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:11,985
I know you're a god.

216
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:13,826
Not of this realm, but there's no mistaking it.

217
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,506
He doesn't know, does he?

218
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:18,847
About your true nature or his own.

219
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:21,127
That is none of your concern.

220
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:24,908
The gods of these realms don't take kindly to outsiders.

221
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:25,668
Trust me.

222
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:26,108
I know.

223
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:28,068
When they find you.

224
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,350
And they will.

225
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,610
They'll make things difficult.

226
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,092
And then for you film lovers out there,

227
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,433
this is our little homage to Citizen Kane.

228
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,955
Whatever you're hiding, you cannot protect him forever.

229
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:41,876
Brought a trace into the back that kept him in focus.

230
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:42,816
But you're right.

231
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:43,577
Doesn't concern me.

232
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:46,398
Now if that staging diagram got a little crazy

233
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:48,599
and looked a bit like spaghetti,

234
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:51,661
that's because, well, staging a wonder is very complicated.

235
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,662
All right, so we had our diagrams and our staging ready,

236
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:56,683
but how do we actually create the previs?

237
00:08:57,865 --> 00:09:01,388
Well, animators might recognize this sort of thing.

238
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:04,170
We often shoot reference to see how our body mechanics work

239
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,772
and get a sense of timing.

240
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:08,054
Most often we just set a camera down somewhere

241
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:09,095
and shoot ourselves.

242
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:11,997
This was Sophie Evans getting some cool Kratos motion.

243
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:14,519
And this works great for our gameplay animators.

244
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,841
They use it to, you know, figure out new moves.

245
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,843
And the cinematics team was wondering,

246
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:20,824
well how could we leverage that for our cinematics?

247
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:23,366
Could we take the camera off the tripod

248
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,948
and start shooting scenes with it?

249
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:26,469
Yes you can.

250
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,511
Some of the benefits of this were we could easily test

251
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:31,632
different styles of camera,

252
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:33,612
and Dory wanted to try a documentary style,

253
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:36,234
you know, more grounded and using handheld.

254
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:38,355
It took very little setup time.

255
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:40,916
You could just grab an SLR, grab a couple animators,

256
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,297
go outside and shoot.

257
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:44,398
It was very quick to review.

258
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:46,118
We could shoot in a couple hours,

259
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,359
do a review with Corey,

260
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,860
and do reshoots within the same day.

261
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:52,918
you would get a lot of surprising human interactions

262
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:54,901
just riffing off each other from take to take

263
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:55,902
that you might not think about

264
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:59,527
when you were sitting at a computer doing layout in Maya.

265
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:00,127
Plus, it's just a lot of fun.

266
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:02,530
You know, you get out of your chair,

267
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,614
you get a little exercise, you look a little ridiculous,

268
00:10:05,614 --> 00:10:07,356
you confuse all your neighbors around you,

269
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,137
and it's pretty awesome.

270
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,681
Some of the challenges, of course,

271
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:14,004
are memorizing lots of lines.

272
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:16,426
We had several very chatty characters in this game,

273
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:19,408
plus learning that complex choreography I just showed you,

274
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:20,710
and since we had no cuts,

275
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,731
the animators had to keep all of that in mind

276
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:25,234
while we were shooting at once.

277
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:27,776
What we were trying to do is establish accurate timing

278
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:30,038
for the camera to figure out how much time was needed

279
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:32,060
to transition from composition to composition.

280
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:35,208
And we also had to figure out how we were going to deal

281
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,049
with characters of differing sizes.

282
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:39,950
You know, we had little Atreus and we had some dwarves,

283
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,431
and then we had normal-sized humans,

284
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:44,252
we had super-sized humans, we had orcs and trolls

285
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:45,312
and dragons and everything.

286
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,613
How were we gonna do that?

287
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:49,714
And finally, how would the principal cast

288
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:50,634
react to our acting?

289
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,235
I mean, we're not professional actors,

290
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,015
we're just animators,

291
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:55,597
and would they be influenced by our previews?

292
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:58,918
Let me show you some videos of that live-action reference.

293
00:10:58,918 --> 00:10:59,738
Let's see the damage.

294
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:02,239
In relation to the fire. Let's see the damage.

295
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:02,780
Stuffing game.

296
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:07,997
You can see as our solution for the characters of differing sizes,

297
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:10,900
we tended to just have the animators walking around on their knees.

298
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,081
They're the dwarf characters.

299
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:15,665
This helped us get accurate eye lines and compositions for the camera.

300
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:18,968
For this scene, we needed to shoot a vista,

301
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:22,852
and we happened to have a handy little overlook on our balcony

302
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:24,634
down to the dev team floor.

303
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:28,238
I've never been this close to the mountain before.

304
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:31,806
Thank you.

305
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:36,848
One of the disadvantages of walking on your knees is you don't get a good sense of accurate

306
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:39,089
timing for how long it takes to move around.

307
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:43,331
You can see our animator Mike there kind of shuffling, but our principal cast was able

308
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:52,314
to walk around freely, so you can see he's a lot more active.

309
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:02,972
I just love that, that's so cool.

310
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:08,853
This is one of our earliest tests,

311
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,314
when we had extra time, so we went out of our way

312
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:11,334
to build a giant ogre.

313
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:14,395
Our animation director got in on the fun.

314
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:17,795
But even then, we were still trying

315
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:19,856
to get some real work done, and Dory wanted

316
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:21,496
to test this camera move where he kind of snuck

317
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:24,417
in between us, and then we parked in front of him.

318
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,257
And it worked out pretty well.

319
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:29,518
So let's take a look at the live action reference

320
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:30,798
for the flying boat jump.

321
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:32,662
Action.

322
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:34,162
You can see we had a prop, a tripod.

323
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:36,642
Originally we were gonna start the scene

324
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:38,483
with some kind of a lever pull,

325
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:40,503
but in the end we ended up going with a player interact

326
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:41,543
where you're trying to push off

327
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:42,824
the broken piece of the ship.

328
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:45,604
Here we're trying to get a sense of the timing

329
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:49,305
of the VFX, that mist that's coming up along the floor

330
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:53,246
and sliding over to reveal Zeus.

331
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:55,926
It is time, my son.

332
00:12:55,926 --> 00:13:00,027
Following the mist over to the hallucination Kratos.

333
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:09,400
And with this previews, we were able to quickly test whether this transition from third person

334
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:16,845
camera to first person camera was going to work.

335
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:18,566
And back to third person.

336
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:22,308
Avi Yaini, everybody.

337
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:24,709
He was great.

338
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:27,091
Very bewildered Atreus.

339
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:30,013
And back to our first person camera.

340
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:32,804
and back to third person.

341
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:36,387
And when Dory realized that this was going to work,

342
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:37,788
we all got really excited.

343
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:40,470
And it was great to be able to see it this early

344
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,891
in our previous production process.

345
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:43,692
There's our barrels rolling down the street.

346
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:47,475
This also let us quickly figure out

347
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:51,538
how many takes we were going to have to shoot on stage.

348
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:53,540
You can see right there, we cut,

349
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,122
and that was going to be the end of the first part.

350
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:57,883
And then we would do the second part of the landing

351
00:13:57,883 --> 00:13:59,044
with some hand-keyed stuff in the middle of the scene.

352
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,085
And up you guys go.

353
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:00,725
That was your plan?

354
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,342
They're both cracked.

355
00:14:06,342 --> 00:14:08,184
So for many scenes, the live action reference

356
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:09,865
was actually enough previs to take directly to stage.

357
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:12,186
But some were a little bit more complex,

358
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,788
and we needed a way to actually visualize

359
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:15,589
the game environment.

360
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,712
So for this, we used rough motion capture, or mocap.

361
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,833
We had the luxury of having our own Vicon space

362
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,275
within our studio, but with Oners,

363
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:25,816
this actually became a necessity.

364
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:30,335
So some of the benefits of that was that we could actually

365
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,777
work with characters of varying sizes

366
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:35,239
without having to shuffle around on our knees.

367
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,580
We could see our actual sets and props to scale.

368
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,743
We could get more accurate plans for our principal shoot days

369
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:41,865
we could figure out how many different mocap volumes

370
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,606
we would need and figure out how we would divide up

371
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,448
our environments to accomplish that.

372
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:49,331
All of that data could then be sent over to the stage

373
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:50,072
to prep for our shoot.

374
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:53,394
And anything that we shoot could also be exported

375
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:55,196
as a prototype to be put in the game engine.

376
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,259
Some of the challenges of working with motion capture,

377
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,282
of course, are learning to operate a mocap system.

378
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:05,464
Blade is not the most user-friendly piece of software,

379
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:06,805
and we would often have camera issues

380
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,666
getting all the cameras calibrated.

381
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,268
Our virtual camera's monitor often shorted out

382
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:14,150
due to cabling issues, so we had some hardware difficulties.

383
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,712
MotionBuilder was unstable with our plugins sometimes,

384
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:20,334
and tended to crash when we worked with a very large scene.

385
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:21,155
So stuff like that.

386
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:23,955
It was also a much slower iteration time

387
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:27,117
than live action previs because you had to set up the volume,

388
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:28,579
you had to get the animator suited up,

389
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:31,421
we had to shoot the thing, we had to tear it down,

390
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:33,763
then we had to assemble the scene,

391
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:34,704
then we had to render it.

392
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:37,166
So it was a little more difficult to iterate quickly,

393
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,988
at least a one day turnaround just to shoot it.

394
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:41,950
It tended to divert our animators away

395
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,711
because they were getting in the suit and shooting,

396
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:44,672
and it was a lot of fun,

397
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:46,053
but then they were spending time shooting

398
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,654
instead of animating.

399
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:49,176
When production ramped up significantly,

400
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,898
we would hire temp actors to fill in those roles.

401
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:57,014
But the concern was always that because the animator was not in the suit and in the moment

402
00:15:57,014 --> 00:16:01,996
with the pre-vis process, they might have less creative input in their ownership of

403
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:03,877
their scenes, so we were always concerned about that.

404
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:09,899
We're thinking of maybe ways to involve the main owner of the scene, but then hire temp

405
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,740
actors to fill in the rest of the characters for the scene.

406
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:17,188
Here are some examples of where we used rough motion capture for our previz.

407
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:22,209
This scene was important because we needed to see the relationship of the table and the

408
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:26,230
characters and the location of the fireplace and the cauldron within her house.

409
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,451
So we really just wanted to see where everything was and also figure out how Kratos was going

410
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:31,751
to dunk the head in there.

411
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:37,253
And you'll see in the rough mocap, the arm was kind of obscuring him, so we opened it

412
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:37,973
up for the final shot.

413
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:41,002
This was a test of how we might shoot

414
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:43,064
some very large characters.

415
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:45,246
We just marked up a cardboard box

416
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:48,469
and puppeteered that guy around.

417
00:16:48,469 --> 00:16:51,392
This was important to actually see the environment,

418
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:53,473
that face in the mountain,

419
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:56,656
and figure out where we were going to place

420
00:16:56,656 --> 00:17:00,079
our characters in relation to the scene.

421
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,602
So going back to flying boat jump again,

422
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:06,145
this was our rough mocap previs.

423
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:10,204
This was shot pretty early in the production of this scene,

424
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:12,426
so you'll notice that the entrances and exits

425
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:13,687
hadn't been figured out yet.

426
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,408
Kratos is coming in from a strange location.

427
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:15,828
Time to end this.

428
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,750
Yes, my son.

429
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,592
Really, the purpose of this test was to see

430
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:23,454
how this composition would look with the two ghosts

431
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:25,956
and the boat in the background

432
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:27,877
and having Atreus standing there.

433
00:17:27,877 --> 00:17:30,939
And then was everything going to get too busy

434
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:32,481
or could we frame it so it looked really nice?

435
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:35,463
So we're really looking at this composition in particular.

436
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:43,747
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

437
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:44,448
Back up, back up, man.

438
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,289
Yeah, one of the things of having Vicon

439
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:48,430
in your own studio is that everyone can hear you.

440
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,951
And cut.

441
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:50,211
Thank you!

442
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:57,996
They were usually pretty good sports about it, though.

443
00:17:57,996 --> 00:17:58,997
I'd like to talk a little bit

444
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:00,678
about the importance of business,

445
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,260
which is basically giving your characters things to do.

446
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,427
This is something movie folks understand pretty implicitly,

447
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:08,408
but can sometimes be overlooked in games,

448
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:10,350
especially when we just have so much content

449
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,312
we have to crank out, you know, hours and hours of content.

450
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:14,793
But again, when we had no cuts,

451
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,495
it was very important to give our characters things to do,

452
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:20,077
because this gave us opportunities for the camera

453
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:21,859
to look away from the characters.

454
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:23,139
Again, we can't do cutaways,

455
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:25,301
but having something for the camera to look at

456
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:27,443
and motivate to look away from the character's face

457
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:28,183
was important.

458
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,942
Business would also provide motivation

459
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,843
for getting the characters to move through the space.

460
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:34,843
And if you think back to our early tests

461
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:36,364
where the characters were kind of freezing

462
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:37,745
and that caused the camera to swing around

463
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:40,927
and do weird stuff, giving them business helped move them.

464
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:45,710
Finally, you could get a lot of nice nonverbal insights

465
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,271
into a character's personality by giving them stuff to do.

466
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:50,813
And this would help our actors get into character

467
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:52,654
and stay in character throughout the scene

468
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:54,455
and not worry about what to do with their body.

469
00:18:56,725 --> 00:19:01,288
So these are some examples of giving our characters business.

470
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:02,769
You can see we put Freya up on a ladder

471
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:07,131
and messing around with some herbs

472
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:09,132
to help sell her character as a witch of the woods.

473
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:11,294
And Sindri's freaking about carrying that gear.

474
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:14,115
But really also selling his nature as a craftsman

475
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:15,816
and being dedicated to his work.

476
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:16,496
And his work is junk.

477
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:18,237
And his work is junk.

478
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:19,258
Those things are accurate.

479
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,599
Those things are accurate.

480
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:20,959
Point! Point.

481
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:30,575
I just love the idea of Brock eating something, and I won't spoil where he got that meat from,

482
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:33,916
but if you play the game you will find out.

483
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:41,518
This is an example of getting the character to move through the space by using business.

484
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:48,121
We had all these cups and bowls and stuff on her table that she was using to cast her

485
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,802
spell, and she could go over there and work with that.

486
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:53,636
Leader of the Baneer once, yes.

487
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:54,478
No longer.

488
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:57,607
And you did not think it important to tell me?

489
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:02,685
Here's an example of how we used a prop to do something

490
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,245
that looks like a cutaway.

491
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,206
Quickly move down and look at the knife,

492
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,207
and then come back up.

493
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,467
And again, here we focus on Freya,

494
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:13,909
and then we're using the bowl to kind of create

495
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:15,549
a new composition.

496
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,429
Avi, everybody.

497
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:20,811
And using those effects to then draw the camera up

498
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:21,591
to go up to Kratos.

499
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:27,593
You may have noticed a big part of business is having props.

500
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:31,334
And Sony's main motion capture studio

501
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,535
has an entire prop building department,

502
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:35,116
but for Previs we're on our own.

503
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:37,718
So we tended to gather whatever materials we could find

504
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:40,420
from the mail room, from trash cans,

505
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,521
leftover items in the hallways,

506
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:45,303
used lots of duct tape and created stuff like this.

507
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:47,545
We've got our tree, we've got the big ogre,

508
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:48,285
some kind of deer.

509
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:50,787
Sometimes we would use markers

510
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:52,428
and marker up something like Mimir's head

511
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:53,949
so that when we shot our rough mocap

512
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:55,550
we could see it in the mocap space.

513
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,638
And finally, for those scenes where we literally

514
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,959
could not humanly shoot the scene,

515
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,419
we went back to traditional layout.

516
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,101
The big benefit of this is you can do anything,

517
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:09,162
so we can craft those big, super epic God of War moments.

518
00:21:09,162 --> 00:21:12,544
The challenge, of course, is that it is super time consuming

519
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:15,005
to create and iterate on,

520
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:17,146
and it's hard to establish real world timing

521
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:19,147
because you're not physically doing the actions

522
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:19,667
with your body.

523
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:22,509
But let's take a look at some of the cool scenes we did.

524
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:43,059
Hold on!

525
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:48,463
If you can see how much the composition changes

526
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:54,188
and also having Credoc pick up the axe with his other hand

527
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:01,169
All right, we have a small clip of traditional previews

528
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,430
for the flying boat jump.

529
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,172
And originally, this was going to be

530
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:06,314
almost a different scene entirely.

531
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,516
So we had this whole moment where these icicles

532
00:22:08,516 --> 00:22:10,478
were gonna break down and break off

533
00:22:10,478 --> 00:22:11,259
the front part of the ship.

534
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:14,141
But then the rest of it is pretty similar

535
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:17,004
to what we ended up shooting and animating

536
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:17,945
for the final product.

537
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:21,669
We've got the barrels rolling down, or whatever that is.

538
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:26,576
and then they crash.

539
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:27,817
And an interesting thing to note here

540
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:30,639
in the original previz is that Kratos jumps first,

541
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:33,641
so it was a cool change to have Atreus lead the way

542
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:35,523
in the final version.

543
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:40,627
All right, so once you've got your previz all done,

544
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:46,251
you've got it approved, it is time to go on set.

545
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:47,152
All right.

546
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:50,574
On previous projects, we would sometimes

547
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:52,316
do our set construction, our rehearsal,

548
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:54,317
even our shoots, all on the same day.

549
00:22:55,432 --> 00:22:58,953
We didn't have a virtual camera because we were doing all the camera work in Maya.

550
00:22:58,953 --> 00:23:03,396
So there was a little bit of room for choreography experiments, letting the actors run around

551
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:05,977
and see what they could, you know, come up with.

552
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:09,939
But again, no cuts means it's not really great to try improv.

553
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:14,322
This scene was really the only time we were on stage and didn't have Previs ready, so

554
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:15,322
we just kind of winged it.

555
00:23:16,246 --> 00:23:18,607
And you can start to see some of the same failure points

556
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:19,847
you encountered in our early tests.

557
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:20,788
What is it, boy?

558
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:22,508
Some very unmotivated camera motions

559
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:25,349
because the actors had frozen and Dory needed

560
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:27,230
to go and see their faces.

561
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,791
So we just kind of swung around to try to get their reactions.

562
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:33,333
And then we had to swing back around because we had

563
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,973
to get back to game camera.

564
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:36,814
So there wasn't really any motivation for that move

565
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:39,235
either, but we wanted to see Atreus' face

566
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:40,475
and we needed to get back to the game.

567
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:46,460
In the end, this data, I don't know,

568
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,363
we just didn't like it, so we ended up throwing it out,

569
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:50,664
and we did a proper previs pass,

570
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:52,005
and we came back to the stage later.

571
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:54,087
It also helped to have more context

572
00:23:54,087 --> 00:23:56,149
for where the scene was taking place,

573
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:58,210
and it was taking place in a boat.

574
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,311
Again, I said nothing.

575
00:23:59,311 --> 00:24:01,553
All right, let's shoot some previs for the boat.

576
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:04,208
What is it, boy?

577
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:05,869
You can see here we were able to figure out

578
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:08,350
how to get the actors to face the camera.

579
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,671
You don't hear that?

580
00:24:09,671 --> 00:24:11,132
Dory was able to do some more thinking

581
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:14,154
about how he wanted to do the lensing.

582
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:15,735
What's going on right now?

583
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:17,335
And we would do a zoom in

584
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:21,838
and get a really nice intimate shot here.

585
00:24:21,838 --> 00:24:22,979
Lots of voices, angry.

586
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:23,879
You really didn't hear that?

587
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,079
No.

588
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,222
We had this nice moment with them.

589
00:24:28,222 --> 00:24:29,282
It felt

590
00:24:31,974 --> 00:24:37,402
And then we could use the motion of Atreus turning to sit back down on the boat as motivation

591
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:38,984
for the camera to move and get back into the camera.

592
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:44,292
So again, every scene had to be meticulously planned.

593
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:47,757
So no more winging it on the set, have pre-vis every single time.

594
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,613
Another big aspect of not winging it was breaking up

595
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:55,855
our mo-cap shoots and having a specific tech day.

596
00:24:55,855 --> 00:24:58,477
So no actors on set, just the animators and Dory

597
00:24:58,477 --> 00:25:00,619
and everybody who needed to be there to review

598
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:03,561
our exported data and our videos from the previous process

599
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:07,064
with the stage crew, discussing and reviewing any props

600
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:08,085
we would need for the shoot day,

601
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:11,107
dividing up our volume space,

602
00:25:11,107 --> 00:25:13,048
figuring out which sets we wanted to construct.

603
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,839
laying down tape for all our major choreography beats,

604
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:19,103
and this was useful when we had our mo-cap previews,

605
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:20,766
we could actually measure that in MotionBuilder

606
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:21,547
and get that all down.

607
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:24,772
And finally, just go over our shot list,

608
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:26,155
finalize any last minute details

609
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:27,217
so that when the actors showed up,

610
00:25:27,217 --> 00:25:29,060
they were ready to go and we could just start rehearsing.

611
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,434
Now getting those assets to the stage for Tech Day

612
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:34,835
posed a little bit of a challenge,

613
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:37,698
and that's where we had our tech artists give us an assist.

614
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:39,540
They wrote a tool for us which we called

615
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,901
the Maya to Motion Builder tool,

616
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:43,043
and that allowed our animators to export

617
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:46,125
our proprietary animation rigs into Motion Builder

618
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,707
at the correct scale and orientation,

619
00:25:47,707 --> 00:25:49,628
and we didn't need to bake anims or anything,

620
00:25:49,628 --> 00:25:51,110
so that saved us a lot of time.

621
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,672
One of the big pain points, however,

622
00:25:53,672 --> 00:25:55,754
was exporting our environments into Motion Builder.

623
00:25:56,913 --> 00:25:59,555
See, on our project, we use a proprietary thing

624
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:02,457
called ref nodes, which are similar to like Unity prefabs,

625
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:05,079
and those need to be converted to regular geometry

626
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,880
in order to be compatible with MotionBuilder.

627
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,782
And this was a very slow process.

628
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:11,664
I mean, there's just hundreds or thousands of assets

629
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:13,926
in just this one piece alone, the house.

630
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:17,148
That converted geo then needed to be parented under a node

631
00:26:17,148 --> 00:26:19,410
so that it could be moved from world space

632
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,852
to the mocap space, which is like that green space there

633
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:24,474
at the origin, and then back again after the shoot.

634
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:26,356
And this was all done by hand,

635
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:27,997
so there was lots of room for human error,

636
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:30,379
especially when onboarding new team members.

637
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:32,160
So we're now developing an automation tool

638
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,942
similar to Maya to MotionBuilder,

639
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:35,843
but for converting environment geometry.

640
00:26:35,843 --> 00:26:40,026
Once we're on the set, there were quite a few people there.

641
00:26:40,026 --> 00:26:43,969
We had our creative director, of course, our writers.

642
00:26:45,195 --> 00:26:46,616
Our director of photography was there,

643
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:47,797
the animation director was there,

644
00:26:47,797 --> 00:26:49,818
the animation lead was there, our producers were there,

645
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:53,481
our dialogue coordinator, the stage crew, and animators.

646
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:55,622
Whoo, lots of cooks in the kitchen.

647
00:26:55,622 --> 00:26:58,724
So it was very important to define roles on the set

648
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:00,225
so the actors weren't getting overwhelmed

649
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:01,766
by feedback coming from too many directions.

650
00:27:01,766 --> 00:27:04,928
What we ended up doing was having our creative director

651
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:08,310
or writers focus with the actors on their performance notes.

652
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,873
Our director of photography would focus on staging notes.

653
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:14,108
and our animation director would focus

654
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:16,250
on any kind of body mechanics notes.

655
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,812
So if anybody else had feedback to give

656
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:20,776
for any of these things, they could go to our point people

657
00:27:20,776 --> 00:27:22,178
and give them the feedback,

658
00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:23,800
and then they could relay it to the actors,

659
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,802
so the actors knew who to go to when they needed feedback.

660
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,439
And what would the animators do on set?

661
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:32,180
Ooh, we could use them as stage hands.

662
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,701
Again, they were owning their scene,

663
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:36,003
so they know it and they know all the elements within it,

664
00:27:36,003 --> 00:27:38,385
so they really were helpful in being able

665
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:40,887
to present the previous videos and talk through it.

666
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:43,549
They could inform other people about any entrances,

667
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:46,171
exits, key poses, props that were needed.

668
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:48,053
They could assist with any stand-in work,

669
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:49,334
any kind of extra bodies needed

670
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,316
that we didn't have anybody suited up for.

671
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,818
And of course, they were taking notes

672
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:55,159
on any info coming out of the shoot

673
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:56,360
so that when they got the data back,

674
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,581
they were ready to hit the ground running.

675
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,313
Here's a few examples of animators as stagehands here.

676
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,455
I'm playing a dead body.

677
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:03,655
Yep.

678
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:07,619
And you can see our creative director,

679
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,141
writers, and our dialogue coordinator in the back,

680
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:14,224
making sure everything's running smoothly.

681
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:17,927
This is a scene that actually got cut from the game,

682
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:20,410
but I had a lot of fun playing this creature in the water,

683
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,191
and then our stage crew did an awesome job

684
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:24,973
building this boat for us that could move around

685
00:28:24,973 --> 00:28:26,335
and act like it was on the water.

686
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:29,714
Sit down.

687
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:34,035
This is not a game.

688
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:35,136
Here you can see our boat rig

689
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:37,816
being used for a more intense scene.

690
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,597
This is the introduction of Jormungandr,

691
00:28:39,597 --> 00:28:42,318
the giant world serpent coming out of the water.

692
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:45,379
And I'd like to take this moment to talk a little bit

693
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:48,340
about multiple motion capture spaces.

694
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,640
And I'm gonna pause it here,

695
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,541
and you can see we've got our main actors in the boat here.

696
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:56,345
And you've got me in the corner,

697
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:58,486
and what the heck am I doing with this little thing here?

698
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,886
It's kind of hard to see, but you can see a monitor

699
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:02,867
of what Dory's seeing through his virtual camera,

700
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,228
and here's Kratos and Atreus,

701
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:06,248
and we've got this giant snake.

702
00:29:06,248 --> 00:29:08,209
Now, obviously, we couldn't build a giant snake.

703
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:09,970
It wouldn't fit in the mo-cap space.

704
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,031
So what we used was a tiny little box with markers on it,

705
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:15,712
and I was acting as sort of a puppeteer of the snake.

706
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,353
And then we would take that data and offset it in real time

707
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:19,853
so that, from Dory's point of view,

708
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,574
he could see the snake in the right place.

709
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:26,616
and then this little green spot being held by Bruno,

710
00:29:26,616 --> 00:29:29,838
our animation director, was being held up

711
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:33,799
so that the actors would know where to look

712
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,960
to represent where the snake would be.

713
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,841
Whew, a little complex, but we made it work.

714
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,682
All right, here we've got some onset footage

715
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:40,723
from the flying boat jump.

716
00:29:40,723 --> 00:29:42,744
Since this was a pretty physical scene,

717
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:45,925
we ended up using stunt actors.

718
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,242
Here we have one of our stunt actors acting as Kratos,

719
00:29:51,242 --> 00:29:54,084
and he would also double as the ghost Kratos.

720
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,786
And you might see Dory over there kind of offset.

721
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:59,047
We wanted to keep him out of the way of the stunt actor

722
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,809
so he would not get punched in the face.

723
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:03,650
And also, it allowed him to get in

724
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,371
and really get that first person camera

725
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,012
without interrupting the actors.

726
00:30:07,012 --> 00:30:08,673
So he's being offset as well.

727
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:25,874
Like I mentioned when we did our live action previews,

728
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:28,355
we were gonna break it up into multiple pieces.

729
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:31,836
So we'll see the second take where we've got our observers.

730
00:30:31,836 --> 00:30:33,776
We've got a stunt stand in for Sonny as Atreus.

731
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:35,157
Okay, coming in close.

732
00:30:35,157 --> 00:30:37,858
And then we've got Kratos in the back there.

733
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:39,638
What the hell's that?

734
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,979
And since we had already shot the data for the ghost,

735
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:44,900
we could see that within the virtual camera.

736
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,960
We gotta go!

737
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,481
Look, there's no time!

738
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:48,821
Look!

739
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:00,636
We hadn't animated the barrels yet,

740
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:01,617
so we just kind of pretended.

741
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:01,817
And go.

742
00:31:01,817 --> 00:31:02,498
I got a plan.

743
00:31:02,498 --> 00:31:02,918
Jump.

744
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:05,320
And then here's where we cut,

745
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:11,126
and we go to the traditional animation for the big fall,

746
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:14,569
and then we have our final take where they land,

747
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:16,791
and you know the rest of that scene.

748
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,453
Now what is your plan?

749
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:19,714
All right.

750
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:21,456
So after everything is done and shot,

751
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:23,377
it's time to get all that data back

752
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:25,159
and assemble it and polish it.

753
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:28,191
And the first part of that is editing.

754
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:29,993
I know what you're thinking.

755
00:31:29,993 --> 00:31:30,614
What? Editing?

756
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:31,835
Why are you editing a one-er?

757
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:33,276
It's all one shot.

758
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:36,399
Well, we tried to avoid editing as often as possible

759
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,021
because it's exponentially more difficult

760
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,843
to blend two takes together versus cutting.

761
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:43,330
But sometimes you have to account for multi-volume scenes

762
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,370
for very large environments.

763
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,011
Sometimes you have to think about unintentional mistakes

764
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:49,011
that might have happened on set.

765
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:51,292
Maybe you're getting a really good take,

766
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:53,472
but then there's just one line that the actor flubs,

767
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:55,153
so you wanna just do a little insert there

768
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:56,233
where they get the line right,

769
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:59,294
and then you'll just merge those two bests together.

770
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,895
Sometimes we need inserts for clarity or script rewrites.

771
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:04,975
Occasionally we'd have a play test

772
00:32:04,975 --> 00:32:06,496
where the players would give feedback

773
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:07,996
that they didn't understand what was going on,

774
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:09,237
so we might do some rewrites.

775
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:14,947
and shoot something to help clarify that scene.

776
00:32:14,947 --> 00:32:18,670
Also, timing passes in case a scene was running long

777
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,811
or needed some extra time,

778
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:20,892
we would insert or cut things down.

779
00:32:20,892 --> 00:32:21,132
Cut, yeah.

780
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:24,935
Also, any changes to level design or environment art,

781
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:27,577
like you saw in the mocap previz,

782
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,638
we hadn't figured out the entrances or exits,

783
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:30,959
so sometimes once we nailed that down,

784
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:33,081
we would do a quick reshoot and get those entrances

785
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:34,401
nailed down and blend that all together.

786
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:34,882
Challenges of editing.

787
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:42,214
We had some limitations with Maya

788
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:44,295
because blending takes together is hard.

789
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,336
We weren't having too much luck with the tracks editor,

790
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,816
so what we ended up doing was using

791
00:32:47,816 --> 00:32:49,517
Motion Builder's Story tool,

792
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:51,337
which let us edit pretty quickly

793
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,278
and get some macro edits going.

794
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:55,139
And then once we were happy with the rough timing,

795
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,100
we could then work on anim layers and constraints.

796
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,381
Now there's a bit of an art to choosing where to edit.

797
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:02,861
You're trying to find the best blend.

798
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:05,823
And what you're looking for is character position and pose,

799
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:07,143
whether they match pretty closely

800
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:08,383
across two different takes.

801
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:10,734
Of course, also the camera position.

802
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:11,975
Again, because we're not cutting,

803
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:14,457
you need to make sure the camera's in a pretty safe place

804
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:16,038
so that you're not getting some weird motion

805
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,900
once you're going between the two takes.

806
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,821
It's a bonus if your carriages are off-screen

807
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:21,363
when you're doing the edit,

808
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:23,444
because then you don't have to worry

809
00:33:23,444 --> 00:33:25,306
about blending them together.

810
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:28,749
Let's take a look at our story tool for flying boat jump.

811
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:30,170
Yeah, I know, it looks a little crazy.

812
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,811
Let me break it down for you.

813
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:35,254
These two tracks represent the ghost Kratos and Zeus.

814
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:37,299
And what we were doing here was working

815
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:39,500
and getting those punches looking really good and physical,

816
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,940
so we did a bunch of edits for timing.

817
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,161
Up here we've got Atreus.

818
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:44,801
This is about the moment when he pushes

819
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:46,341
through the two ghosts, so we,

820
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:47,902
oh no, why is my battery not,

821
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,422
I'm sorry, let's plug that in.

822
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:50,482
All right, here we go.

823
00:33:50,482 --> 00:33:56,023
This is where Atreus was pushing through the two ghosts.

824
00:33:56,023 --> 00:33:59,324
We wanted to make sure that felt very physical.

825
00:33:59,324 --> 00:34:00,784
Here we actually ran out of data,

826
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:02,925
so we were copying and pasting extra punches.

827
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:05,582
Yeah.

828
00:34:05,582 --> 00:34:06,922
And here we've got a little take of Atreus.

829
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:08,403
This is probably an old screenshot

830
00:34:08,403 --> 00:34:10,803
and they were probably gonna insert that up here

831
00:34:10,803 --> 00:34:12,364
to help Atreus slide.

832
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:13,464
And let's go ahead and play this shot

833
00:34:13,464 --> 00:34:15,444
and you can watch it, go along with it.

834
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:17,785
Here's those physical punches.

835
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:19,545
Here we've got Atreus's push through coming in.

836
00:34:19,545 --> 00:34:20,666
Extra punches, bam.

837
00:34:39,004 --> 00:34:41,926
and this take of Atreus sliding down.

838
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:42,727
All right, some results of that.

839
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:46,249
Of course, the ideal was always to get our scenes

840
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:49,651
nailed down with one perfect take,

841
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:53,474
but it ended up that over 50% of our cinematics

842
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:56,396
needed major editing or reshoots or merges.

843
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,981
And all of our cinematics required at least some minor edits

844
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:01,702
to accommodate our finalized environments,

845
00:35:01,702 --> 00:35:03,923
make sure our pose were matching, et cetera.

846
00:35:03,923 --> 00:35:05,644
That's not a great track record.

847
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:08,645
So how can we get that percentage down?

848
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:11,347
Really what we need to do is focus on our tools

849
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:13,588
and communication to make sure we have everything we need

850
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:15,669
before we go on stage and after we go on stage

851
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:18,310
to help us get our workflow moving more quickly.

852
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:18,710
Oh yes, animation.

853
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,370
It's time to do the fun stuff.

854
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,153
It's time to animate those cool creatures

855
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:26,374
and those crazy stunts.

856
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:31,406
And also the not so fun stuff like bandages and chains

857
00:35:31,406 --> 00:35:35,108
and ropes and vines and all those spline IK

858
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:35,948
everybody loves to do, yeah.

859
00:35:35,948 --> 00:35:39,910
When you're using cuts, it's often simpler

860
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,371
to compartmentalize your thoughts into smaller task chunks

861
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:45,152
and focus on one shot at a time,

862
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:46,412
such as this 150 frames, that's not too bad,

863
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:48,613
you can keep track of what your curves are doing there.

864
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:51,745
But with very long runners like God of War had,

865
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:54,266
the animators had to keep the entire scene in mind

866
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:55,126
while they're making edits,

867
00:35:55,126 --> 00:35:56,747
because if you're working on a layer

868
00:35:56,747 --> 00:35:58,367
and you make a change and you forget

869
00:35:58,367 --> 00:35:59,468
that you made that change,

870
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:01,088
it might ripple down the entire scene.

871
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:02,349
So if you're not keeping track,

872
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:04,850
hours of your work could get wrecked.

873
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,230
The actual process of animating

874
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,911
is the same as it's been for years,

875
00:36:07,911 --> 00:36:10,892
but the mental focus required grew quite a bit.

876
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:12,753
So let's take a look at some of our awesome

877
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,334
and keyed animations.

878
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,510
I got to do that one.

879
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:33,613
In between all my meetings and spreadsheets.

880
00:36:33,613 --> 00:36:36,874
Stay behind me and protect our flank.

881
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:37,774
Yes sir!

882
00:36:37,774 --> 00:36:40,215
And of course our flying boat jump.

883
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:50,543
Some quick numbers about our animation team.

884
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:53,045
We had an internal team size of about seven animators

885
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,627
at peak production.

886
00:36:54,627 --> 00:36:56,248
We had three different outsource teams,

887
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,310
two vendors helping clean up our body

888
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,592
and one vendor for facial solving.

889
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:02,733
But our internal animators would have ownership

890
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:04,895
of all the scenes, including our outsource ones,

891
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:06,957
so that they could assemble the outsource data

892
00:37:06,957 --> 00:37:08,458
and make sure everything got integrated

893
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,400
and keeping track of the debugging process.

894
00:37:12,209 --> 00:37:15,111
In hindsight, we wished we'd had a larger internal team

895
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:16,932
because as our contractors rolled off,

896
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:18,953
we would have to transfer ownership of all those scenes

897
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:20,834
to all our remaining team members,

898
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,775
and we had over 100 cut scenes to keep track of,

899
00:37:22,775 --> 00:37:23,436
so that was a lot.

900
00:37:23,436 --> 00:37:27,378
Also, just tracking the sheer amount of content

901
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,919
and scope creep, we had a lot of level design asks

902
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:31,540
that weren't originally in the script,

903
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,361
but we would need to help tell the story

904
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:35,222
of level design as well.

905
00:37:35,222 --> 00:37:37,144
So now we take into consideration

906
00:37:37,144 --> 00:37:39,585
all of our narrative moments, and not just cinematics,

907
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,266
as we work out our scope and our schedule.

908
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:47,163
Onto our polish, we had what we called the buttery smooth patch.

909
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:50,911
What this was was just really troubleshooting those seamless transitions between gameplay

910
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:53,818
and cinematics to make sure our no-cut language was working.

911
00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:57,164
The main things we were looking for was pose matching,

912
00:37:57,164 --> 00:37:58,564
and that seems pretty obvious,

913
00:37:58,564 --> 00:38:01,305
but it's important to establish those standard poses,

914
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:02,866
and any time it's changed,

915
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:05,507
make sure you communicate them widely across the team.

916
00:38:05,507 --> 00:38:07,768
Make sure your pose library is updated,

917
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:09,788
and see if you can find some tools

918
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,849
that helps the animators match poses and animations

919
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:13,430
across your scenes and characters.

920
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:17,589
matching the velocity of the gameplay animation

921
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,010
into a cinematic and back out.

922
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,371
Each of our characters had a zero joint

923
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:23,792
that indicated their position in the game.

924
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:25,613
And in the case of Kratos, the player,

925
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:28,254
the camera is also attached to that zero joint.

926
00:38:28,254 --> 00:38:29,935
So any kind of errant motion was gonna cause

927
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:31,696
some weird jarring camera blends.

928
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:34,590
The zero joint's velocity also informs the engine

929
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,492
of what state the character should be in,

930
00:38:36,492 --> 00:38:38,876
whether he's walking or running or idle.

931
00:38:38,876 --> 00:38:40,818
So if it's not matching the actual action of the scene,

932
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,802
if you've animated your cinematic so Kratos is running out,

933
00:38:43,802 --> 00:38:45,325
but your zero joint is frozen,

934
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:46,787
then the game engine thinks he's standing,

935
00:38:46,787 --> 00:38:48,689
so then you're gonna see him pop into an idle pose

936
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:49,410
at the end of the scene.

937
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:53,276
Finally, thinking about metrics.

938
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:56,438
For any interactable objects such as doors or levers,

939
00:38:56,438 --> 00:38:59,060
we need to get those exact metrics set by the gameplay team

940
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,221
for how close the player should be to that object

941
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:02,983
at the start of a cinematic.

942
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:06,065
Here are some issues with buttery smoothness.

943
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:08,646
You can see this magical door.

944
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,848
We hadn't figured out the metrics

945
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,849
of where the player should stand,

946
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:15,631
so you'll see Kratos actually walk backwards

947
00:39:15,631 --> 00:39:16,671
as he's starting the cinematic.

948
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:16,851
Oh, or not.

949
00:39:16,851 --> 00:39:18,172
Let me do that again.

950
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:19,653
Here we go.

951
00:39:19,653 --> 00:39:19,853
Yep.

952
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,935
Little lerp there.

953
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:25,396
Still can't get the doors open, huh?

954
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:25,557
Quiet.

955
00:39:25,557 --> 00:39:26,798
Here you can see some of our debugging tools.

956
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:31,042
You can see there's a little arrow down here

957
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:33,925
showing the velocity of the zero joint at any time.

958
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:36,988
We're trying to debug why those pose match matches are happening.

959
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:43,181
This scene, you'll notice that the log and Kratos

960
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,463
become out of sync.

961
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:46,704
Oh, what's that sliding all about?

962
00:39:46,704 --> 00:39:48,706
Let's go into that debugging tool,

963
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:50,628
and you'll see that at some point,

964
00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:53,350
the log's zero joint stopped moving,

965
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,332
so it thought that it should not be moving forward,

966
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:57,133
while Kratos kept walking along.

967
00:39:57,133 --> 00:40:02,978
So just taking care to do all of that buttery smoothness.

968
00:40:02,978 --> 00:40:07,202
Here are some issues with the flying boat jump.

969
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,250
There was kind of a position misalignment

970
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,890
and we didn't have any transitional motion

971
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,811
to get the player into the place where they needed to be.

972
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:18,292
We didn't do that.

973
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,692
And also for some reason it wanted to play that part twice.

974
00:40:20,692 --> 00:40:22,412
I don't know.

975
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:25,453
At the end, the lighting hadn't been put in yet,

976
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:27,353
but you can see that there's a pose mismatch here

977
00:40:27,353 --> 00:40:29,894
between the normal idle and the combat idle.

978
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,595
In this particular iteration, Kratos flew off into space

979
00:40:33,595 --> 00:40:36,715
and then aligned up with the ship.

980
00:40:38,817 --> 00:40:41,940
The zero joint also, if it wasn't in sync with the body,

981
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,781
sometimes there were clock physics problems

982
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:45,442
because it thought the character was somewhere else.

983
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:48,985
So you would see his skirt would flip out there.

984
00:40:48,985 --> 00:40:49,526
And again, pose mismatches.

985
00:40:49,526 --> 00:40:56,111
This was always the pops between the end of the cinematic

986
00:40:56,111 --> 00:40:57,372
and the gameplay.

987
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,914
Here you might see the characters drop down.

988
00:41:00,914 --> 00:41:04,097
That might be because IK or collision's turning back on

989
00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:06,179
and we haven't quite aligned them to the ground plane.

990
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:07,600
So we're trying to figure out where that's going.

991
00:41:09,654 --> 00:41:13,315
Another big part of polishing our scenes were armor variants.

992
00:41:13,315 --> 00:41:15,316
Kratos has many armors.

993
00:41:15,316 --> 00:41:18,757
And again, because we can't cut, we can't hide any armor swaps

994
00:41:18,757 --> 00:41:21,678
on a cut to get into our cinematics.

995
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:25,219
Some problems with that were, of course, obstructing your face.

996
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,820
We need to be able to see Kratos' face

997
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,221
during certain cinematics, but certain pauldrons

998
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,742
would obstruct it, and that's troubling.

999
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,711
Penetrations, we'd have stuff going into

1000
00:41:35,711 --> 00:41:38,013
other parts of the body, other parts of the armor.

1001
00:41:38,013 --> 00:41:39,333
This was a pretty extreme example.

1002
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,635
I don't think this was ever actually in any cinematic.

1003
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:47,118
Some solutions to this were making slight body adjustments

1004
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:49,159
to fix our penetrations.

1005
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,380
We could often cheat the camera

1006
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,561
so that if an offending object,

1007
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:56,143
from the camera view it doesn't look like it's penetrating,

1008
00:41:56,143 --> 00:41:57,924
then it's resting properly on different armors,

1009
00:41:57,924 --> 00:42:00,766
such as when he's resting his hand on his bracers.

1010
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,015
from a specific camera angle, it looks fine.

1011
00:42:04,015 --> 00:42:09,421
And when all else fails, we plead with character art,

1012
00:42:09,421 --> 00:42:11,623
can you please just adjust this pauldron a little bit

1013
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:12,504
so I don't have to deal with it anymore?

1014
00:42:12,504 --> 00:42:15,807
Of course, there was one scene in particular

1015
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:18,851
that was a beast, and you might recognize this one.

1016
00:42:18,851 --> 00:42:20,272
The rope.

1017
00:42:21,994 --> 00:42:23,775
Kratos had to sling a rope over his shoulder,

1018
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:25,716
and he couldn't hide it.

1019
00:42:25,716 --> 00:42:27,216
It's close up on the camera.

1020
00:42:27,216 --> 00:42:29,277
All the pauldrons were clipping through,

1021
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:30,538
or it was floating above,

1022
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:32,499
and what were we going to do about this?

1023
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:34,639
Oh, man, that's a tough one.

1024
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,121
What TechArt ended up doing was rigging up a rope for us

1025
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:39,642
with four different joint chains

1026
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:41,422
and four different rope meshes,

1027
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:43,683
and our animator placed them at different heights

1028
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:45,104
to cover the range of variation

1029
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,805
between our different shoulder pads.

1030
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:49,618
then the integration team would script the visibility

1031
00:42:49,618 --> 00:42:51,719
on each of those rope meshes to turn on and off,

1032
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:54,640
depending on what the player had equipped at the time.

1033
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:54,700
Yes.

1034
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,140
Why'd you say nothing?

1035
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:02,024
Another thing here is our axe pommel.

1036
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:05,565
Sundari rests his elbow on it,

1037
00:43:05,565 --> 00:43:09,347
but this particular pommel had a blade.

1038
00:43:09,347 --> 00:43:11,988
Oh, man. Okay. For this one, we just tweaked the animation

1039
00:43:11,988 --> 00:43:14,049
to have Sundari wrap his arm around the blade.

1040
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,630
In any other pommel, it still looked like

1041
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,710
he was resting his elbow on it.

1042
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:23,555
But our favorite one, and one we probably got the most bugs for,

1043
00:43:23,555 --> 00:43:30,761
were what we lovingly called the Kratos nip slip.

1044
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:33,303
What is that?

1045
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:34,023
Yeah.

1046
00:43:34,023 --> 00:43:36,445
That was an easy fix.

1047
00:43:36,445 --> 00:43:38,146
You just rotate the clavicle a little bit.

1048
00:43:38,146 --> 00:43:40,668
But just, it happened so many times.

1049
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:43,330
We got so many bugs about that.

1050
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:43,971
There we go.

1051
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:44,811
Fixing all the bugs.

1052
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,153
All right, let's wrap it up.

1053
00:43:47,153 --> 00:43:49,935
So although we encountered many challenges

1054
00:43:49,935 --> 00:43:52,156
on the path to realizing this vision

1055
00:43:52,156 --> 00:43:53,837
of a no-cut narrative language,

1056
00:43:53,837 --> 00:43:56,419
overall we felt our new pipeline helped us achieve success.

1057
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:59,161
Our final cinematics looked pretty close to our previz,

1058
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:01,002
even when it was shot in live action.

1059
00:44:01,002 --> 00:44:03,424
And we were able to create smooth blends

1060
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:04,765
between gameplay and cinematics.

1061
00:44:04,765 --> 00:44:07,587
So let's take one more look at the flying boat jump

1062
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:10,228
and the many pieces that came together to create it.

1063
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:28,272
It is time, my son. Look around at what you have done.

1064
00:45:08,027 --> 00:45:09,088
Come on, we gotta go!

1065
00:45:09,088 --> 00:45:09,569
You saw.

1066
00:45:09,569 --> 00:45:11,851
There's no time, look!

1067
00:45:51,663 --> 00:45:52,743
That was your plan.

1068
00:45:52,743 --> 00:45:53,784
You're both tracked.

1069
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,305
Thank you very much for coming.

1070
00:45:55,305 --> 00:45:55,605
Thank you.

1071
00:45:55,605 --> 00:45:57,086
Thank you.

1072
00:45:57,086 --> 00:45:58,607
Thank you.

1073
00:45:58,607 --> 00:45:59,087
Thank you.

1074
00:45:59,087 --> 00:45:59,568
Thank you.

1075
00:45:59,568 --> 00:45:59,728
Thank you.

1076
00:45:59,728 --> 00:45:59,888
Thank you.

1077
00:45:59,888 --> 00:46:08,393
Thank you.

1078
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:08,593
Thank you.

1079
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:09,113
Thank you.

1080
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:09,433
Thank you.

1081
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:09,774
Thank you.

1082
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:10,374
Thank you.

1083
00:46:10,374 --> 00:46:10,714
Thank you.

1084
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:11,174
Thank you.

1085
00:46:11,174 --> 00:46:11,675
Thank you.

1086
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:11,955
Thank you.

1087
00:46:11,955 --> 00:46:12,275
Thank you.

1088
00:46:12,275 --> 00:46:13,716
We have some time for Q&A, so we've

1089
00:46:13,716 --> 00:46:17,918
got a couple microphones here if you want to come up

1090
00:46:17,918 --> 00:46:18,479
and ask me any questions.

1091
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:18,659
Anybody?

1092
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:18,859
All right.

1093
00:46:21,467 --> 00:46:21,888
Hi.

1094
00:46:21,888 --> 00:46:22,148
Hello.

1095
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:23,649
Thank you for your presentation.

1096
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:24,069
Thank you.

1097
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:26,692
I'm Christian.

1098
00:46:26,692 --> 00:46:28,293
So I had two questions.

1099
00:46:28,293 --> 00:46:33,878
One, did you guys use VCam all the way through to the final

1100
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:36,040
cut scenes?

1101
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:36,240
Yes.

1102
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,322
When we shot live action reference, we

1103
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:39,483
wouldn't have the VCam.

1104
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:40,864
We would just be using an SLR.

1105
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,726
But any time we were using rough mo-cap on the stage, we

1106
00:46:43,726 --> 00:46:46,268
would always have a virtual camera on set, yes.

1107
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:50,905
Yeah, did the virtual camera actually help you guys translate

1108
00:46:50,905 --> 00:46:55,527
what you were doing with the VCAM to the final cutscene you would get in the game?

1109
00:46:55,527 --> 00:46:59,429
Yes, I mean the data was being recorded from the virtual camera,

1110
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:03,010
and then Dory could take that, and he and the cinematic artists would take that data,

1111
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,792
and they would do some cleanup by hand in MotionBuilder

1112
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:08,573
to get the final look and do some minor adjustments here and there,

1113
00:47:08,573 --> 00:47:13,555
but the raw data from the virtual camera was always the baseline for that.

1114
00:47:13,555 --> 00:47:14,436
Cool, and then...

1115
00:47:15,308 --> 00:47:18,430
As far as studio-wise, do you guys

1116
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,872
enjoy this process with the motion capture, the VCAM?

1117
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:25,154
And will you use it again on future projects?

1118
00:47:25,154 --> 00:47:25,994
I think it's a lot of fun.

1119
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:28,215
I think now that we've got our pipeline set up,

1120
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:30,497
it's definitely a tool we can use in our pocket

1121
00:47:30,497 --> 00:47:31,197
whenever we can.

1122
00:47:31,197 --> 00:47:33,438
It's really helped streamline our previous process

1123
00:47:33,438 --> 00:47:35,480
and helping us iterate as quickly as possible.

1124
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,921
So it's definitely something I want to keep using.

1125
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:38,361
Cool.

1126
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:38,661
Thank you.

1127
00:47:38,661 --> 00:47:38,982
Thank you.

1128
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:40,942
Yes.

1129
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:41,182
Hi.

1130
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:43,624
Thank you for the talk.

1131
00:47:43,624 --> 00:47:44,844
Another question about VCam.

1132
00:47:44,844 --> 00:47:50,547
Can you say something quickly about this deciding

1133
00:47:50,547 --> 00:47:55,350
between shooting VCam with the actors on stage,

1134
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,411
or shooting it offset from the actors,

1135
00:47:57,411 --> 00:47:58,912
or shooting it separately?

1136
00:48:00,155 --> 00:48:05,536
Most of the time we would try to keep the virtual camera in lockstep with the actors in actual space.

1137
00:48:05,536 --> 00:48:11,518
For Flying Boat Jump it was just an issue of Dory really wanted to get into the shot he wanted for the first person thing.

1138
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:12,878
So that's what he requested in Offset.

1139
00:48:12,878 --> 00:48:16,779
So he didn't have to be like right on top of the stunt actors while they were doing their stunts.

1140
00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:20,940
But most of the time the camera and the actors were in the actual space we wanted them to be in.

1141
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:21,800
Cool, thanks.

1142
00:48:25,262 --> 00:48:33,766
Are you using MotionBuilder story mode to blend both facial capture and body capture together?

1143
00:48:33,766 --> 00:48:38,528
The question was, were we using MotionBuilder also for the facial capture?

1144
00:48:38,528 --> 00:48:46,112
No, we did mostly body cleanup in MotionBuilder, and then we would do all of the facial cleanup and pasting in Maya.

1145
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:47,126
Oh, OK.

1146
00:48:47,126 --> 00:48:51,347
And then also, what was the frames per second

1147
00:48:51,347 --> 00:48:53,988
when you're making the cinematics in Maya

1148
00:48:53,988 --> 00:48:54,769
or Motion Builder?

1149
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:56,349
We would shoot at 30 frames per second.

1150
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:56,449
Yeah.

1151
00:48:56,449 --> 00:48:56,769
Thank you.

1152
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:58,290
Thank you again for the talk.

1153
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,850
It was super informative.

1154
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:06,392
How much of the team came from more of a cinema background?

1155
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:09,773
And how much interplay was there between cinema and games?

1156
00:49:09,773 --> 00:49:12,734
And what kind of challenges from the game side

1157
00:49:12,734 --> 00:49:14,955
versus maybe a more cinema side did you

1158
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:15,835
have to kind of consider?

1159
00:49:17,464 --> 00:49:20,387
For our animators, we tried to hire specifically

1160
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:23,029
for cinematic, so people, if they hadn't gone

1161
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:24,210
through film school or anything,

1162
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,812
that they at least worked in cinematics on previous games.

1163
00:49:26,812 --> 00:49:28,613
But our real rock star was Doria Razzi.

1164
00:49:28,613 --> 00:49:31,215
He comes from film and he's done a bunch of stuff

1165
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:32,657
and he had the eye for doing it.

1166
00:49:32,657 --> 00:49:35,399
So he was really driving the look and feel of our scenes.

1167
00:49:35,399 --> 00:49:36,379
Hi, could you tell me a little bit about

1168
00:49:36,379 --> 00:49:40,723
why you created the tool for Maya into Motion Builder?

1169
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:45,907
I'm a little more familiar with Motion Builder to Maya.

1170
00:49:46,727 --> 00:49:50,089
Yeah, because most of the time we're animating in Maya,

1171
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:51,469
all the gameplay animators work in Maya,

1172
00:49:51,469 --> 00:49:53,650
and all of our rigs are set up to work with Maya,

1173
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,031
and we have several tools,

1174
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:56,351
and just the way that the rigs are built

1175
00:49:56,351 --> 00:49:57,192
to work with those tools,

1176
00:49:57,192 --> 00:49:59,613
it makes it a little more proprietary

1177
00:49:59,613 --> 00:50:01,013
and harder to translate directly

1178
00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:02,894
into MotionBuilder one for one.

1179
00:50:02,894 --> 00:50:04,955
So the tool was just a way to get those proprietary nodes

1180
00:50:04,955 --> 00:50:05,715
kind of stripped out and locked down

1181
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:06,396
and putting it into MotionBuilder.

1182
00:50:06,396 --> 00:50:07,016
And it also goes both ways.

1183
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:07,796
So we would go then from MotionBuilder

1184
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:08,657
once we cleaned up back into Maya

1185
00:50:08,657 --> 00:50:10,678
and back onto our proprietary rig so we could keep working.

1186
00:50:10,678 --> 00:50:11,818
we would go then from MotionBuilder

1187
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:13,139
once we cleaned up back into Maya

1188
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:15,640
and back onto our proprietary rig so we could keep working.

1189
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,705
So like easier for pose mashing and motion building.

1190
00:50:19,705 --> 00:50:22,788
And also our rigs in Maya are at a different scale.

1191
00:50:22,788 --> 00:50:25,692
They're not one to one in meters or whatever.

1192
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,474
So we would have to scale everything up

1193
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:28,716
when we brought it into Motion Builder

1194
00:50:28,716 --> 00:50:30,358
and scale it back down when we came into Maya.

1195
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:30,598
Thank you.

1196
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:43,072
Hi, I have a question because I noticed that the stunt was a woman and the main actor for

1197
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:49,914
Atreus was a child and did you have some trouble with the difference of the performance? This is

1198
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:55,056
the first question. The second one is Atreus' main actor is a child so I would like to know

1199
00:50:55,056 --> 00:51:01,138
if you had a problem because the child is growing up really fast and during the shooting it could

1200
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:01,718
be a problem.

1201
00:51:01,936 --> 00:51:06,120
Yes, the question was about the challenges of working with child actors versus a stunt

1202
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,441
actor who was an adult.

1203
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:12,045
Yeah, I mean, as much as possible, we tried to use Sonny.

1204
00:51:12,045 --> 00:51:15,208
Occasionally, he would have to be in school for certain hours, so we would bring in a

1205
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:19,092
stand-in while he was in school, and we would try to hire actors who could.

1206
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:22,034
mimic the motions of a child as much as possible,

1207
00:51:22,034 --> 00:51:23,975
but of course there is advantages of using

1208
00:51:23,975 --> 00:51:26,596
an actual child actor, it does look a little different.

1209
00:51:26,596 --> 00:51:29,178
So we would then have the animators kind of try

1210
00:51:29,178 --> 00:51:30,899
to match the data across and try to create

1211
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:33,100
a consistent workflow.

1212
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,762
As for Sonny growing throughout the production process,

1213
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:37,263
that was a concern.

1214
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:40,665
It didn't affect us too much, he did grow an inch or two,

1215
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:43,847
but it wasn't enough to cause a big problem for us.

1216
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:51,041
All right, before I let, oh, yep, go ahead.

1217
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,263
Hi, one last question.

1218
00:51:53,263 --> 00:51:53,583
Great talk.

1219
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:58,206
You mentioned cinematic artists, I believe, doing cameras.

1220
00:51:58,206 --> 00:52:01,348
How big was that team, how many people?

1221
00:52:01,348 --> 00:52:03,309
I mean, Dory was doing a lot of work

1222
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:07,392
and then he was able to bring in a second person

1223
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:08,432
to help him out.

1224
00:52:08,432 --> 00:52:12,195
We had a third person who was helping out

1225
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,376
with the VCam on set, and then the other one

1226
00:52:14,376 --> 00:52:16,197
was focused mainly on motion builder cleanup.

1227
00:52:16,197 --> 00:52:16,398
Yeah.

1228
00:52:16,398 --> 00:52:16,758
Thank you.

1229
00:52:19,676 --> 00:52:23,140
Hi, my question maybe would have been better for Dory,

1230
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,662
but maybe you can help me out with it,

1231
00:52:24,662 --> 00:52:28,786
because I was wondering with the single cuts,

1232
00:52:28,786 --> 00:52:32,691
with the no-cut directing that you had,

1233
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,314
that tends to be kind of exhausting

1234
00:52:35,314 --> 00:52:37,997
for long periods of time as a spectator.

1235
00:52:37,997 --> 00:52:40,039
Yes, as a spectator.

1236
00:52:40,299 --> 00:52:47,289
What did, um, like, how did you guys, like, sort of make it so that you could actually play the game for, you know,

1237
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:54,881
the way people play, which is several hours generally, if you can, like, you get into the story and not have you be exhausted by the time you're finished?

1238
00:52:55,585 --> 00:52:56,605
Yeah, I mean, Dory's right there.

1239
00:52:56,605 --> 00:52:58,066
You can come talk to him afterwards.

1240
00:52:58,066 --> 00:53:01,708
But I think it's just about having enough interesting

1241
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:04,289
things happening on the stage and making sure

1242
00:53:04,289 --> 00:53:05,690
that the staging is very interesting

1243
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,691
and the characters are moving around

1244
00:53:07,691 --> 00:53:10,552
and having things to do to keep the eye going.

1245
00:53:10,552 --> 00:53:12,433
And as for viewer fatigue, yeah, I

1246
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:14,134
guess Dory might be the guy to answer that one.

1247
00:53:14,134 --> 00:53:16,935
Yeah, because that's mostly because I'm thinking, you know,

1248
00:53:17,735 --> 00:53:20,077
For example, in The Haunting of Hill House,

1249
00:53:20,077 --> 00:53:23,160
they have that one episode that's just no cuts for like 20 minutes,

1250
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,581
and by the time you finish,

1251
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:25,542
you just want to die.

1252
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:29,024
It's exhausting and depressing and very sad.

1253
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:35,049
Yeah. It might be that once you're back in gameplay,

1254
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:37,531
you feel like you're in control again.

1255
00:53:37,531 --> 00:53:39,473
Maybe that helps alleviate some of that as well.

1256
00:53:39,473 --> 00:53:39,733
Right. Yeah.

1257
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:39,813
Yeah.

1258
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:40,173
Okay. Well, thank you.

1259
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:42,155
Yeah. Thank you. All right.

1260
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:44,643
Just before I let you go, we are hiring.

1261
00:53:44,643 --> 00:53:46,184
We have many positions open,

1262
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:48,165
so make sure you check out our website,

1263
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:50,666

1264
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:52,626
especially animators, if you have what it takes.

1265
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:54,707
Come see me, or I think we have a recruiting booth

1266
00:53:54,707 --> 00:53:56,408
downstairs, but yeah.

1267
00:53:56,408 --> 00:53:57,708
Thank you again for coming.
