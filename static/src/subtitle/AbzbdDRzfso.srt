1
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:25,157
How many of you here have personally witnessed a total eclipse of the sun?

2
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:30,861
To stand one day in the shadow of the moon is one of my humble goals in life.

3
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:39,300
The closest I ever came was years ago, the last time the path of the eclipse had crossed the continental United States.

4
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:46,185
Of course, I form no memory of this event as I crawled around in the grass with my pacifier and my sippy cup.

5
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:47,547
How could I have?

6
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:50,369
I was only 22 years old at the time.

7
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:56,507
But fortunately, history has a way of repeating itself.

8
00:00:57,147 --> 00:01:05,050
And if you are patient and put yourself in the right place at the right time, you may just get a chance to do it all over again.

9
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,573
In June of last year, I released a game called The Looker.

10
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,254
It was a direct parody of 2016's The Witness.

11
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:25,439
The Looker was well-received, and it garnered the attention of hundreds of thousands of players who have given it over 97% overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.

12
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:33,842
Like its inspiration, it's a first-person puzzle-solving game set on an enigmatic island full of mystery.

13
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:45,346
But unlike its inspiration, it is chock-full of novelty puzzles, on-the-nose intertextual references, and tastefully constructed wiener jokes.

14
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,560
As I released the game, I wondered idly why video game parodies were typically so rare.

15
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,603
Little did I know, all of this had happened before.

16
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:12,128
In 1996, developer Parity Interactive released a point-and-click parody of Myst, the famous contemplative puzzle game that was itself a direct inspiration for The Witness.

17
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:14,689
The game was called Pissed.

18
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:24,826
Pissed was a proper, full-blown parody, with all the big-budget bells and whistles, and incorporating a decent amount of full-motion video.

19
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:27,128
Remember full-motion video?

20
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:39,098
The development studio boasted an experienced team of writers and actors, all under the auspices of the Grammy Award-nominated parodist and comedian Peter Bergman.

21
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:45,696
The parody is a slippery slope down which many a fine mind has slid to its doom.

22
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:49,920
The clip I am about to show you is from that game.

23
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,324
If you value your peace of mind, cover your ears now.

24
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:06,074
Yes, I am the king of the game, and I have many secrets.

25
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:10,313
Wee!

26
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:11,394
Wee!

27
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:13,255
Wee!

28
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:15,696
Are you still here?

29
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:18,697
Can't you see that I'm brushing my kiddies?

30
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,339
A man, no, no, a king needs his privacy.

31
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:27,021
Therefore, we, I mean, I declare myself private.

32
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:28,042
No, private!

33
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,324
Your eyes do not deceive you.

34
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:35,065
This is John Goodman.

35
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:45,490
Needless to say, Pissed has enjoyed a very mixed reception in the sense that some reviews are negative while other reviews are devastating.

36
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:52,738
PC Gamer calls it, quote, as funny as a wire pipe cleaner up the penis tube, end quote.

37
00:03:55,848 --> 00:04:08,619
How can such a promising project leave behind such a disappointing legacy in a world where The Looker, a game with no budget and little experience, receives the highest honor that Metacritic's users have to offer?

38
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,020
A 7.7 out of 10.

39
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:23,893
The problem with Pissed wasn't lack of budget, it wasn't lack of experience, and as any big Lebowski fan can tell you, it wasn't lack of talent either.

40
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:31,376
The problems of Pissed, along with a lot of other recent comedy games, are actually very concrete and mostly structural.

41
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:46,273
As such, I will do my best to tell you what I've learned about comedy and parody through the process of developing The Looker and highlight some of the core appeals and fundamental pitfalls that determine whether parody resonates with players or ultimately falls flat.

42
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:56,081
To begin with, parody is a form of scripted humor that delivers content for the player to engage with.

43
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:02,724
This is to say its content comes from a definite authorial voice and not from emergent gameplay.

44
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:14,891
A game with emergent humor like QWOP is funny, but what emerges from the gameplay mechanics generally cannot serve as parody because it doesn't have any plausible authorial intent.

45
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:23,962
parody, and its evil twin satire, both primarily function by subverting expectations in one way or another.

46
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,026
There are two ways of doing this, exaggeration and inversion.

47
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:36,392
Exaggeration involves taking a distinctive element of the source material and exaggerating it to comical proportions.

48
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:43,017
Inversion, on the other hand, involves taking a distinctive element of the source material and switching it out for its opposite.

49
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:49,918
Between these forms of subverting expectations, exaggeration tends to seem more critical than inversion.

50
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:54,802
After all, isn't it bad if something is ridiculous when it's missing?

51
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,607
And isn't it, sorry, isn't it bad if it's ridiculous when it's taken to its logical conclusion?

52
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:04,430
And isn't it good if it's ridiculous when it's missing?

53
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:12,536
Looking at parity this way can provide a pretty decent heuristic for understanding what might be critical and what might be flattering

54
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:23,857
You can even use this lens to very neatly categorize satire as a special case of parody in which expectations are consistently exaggerated rather than inverted.

55
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:28,540
But this breakdown is a little too neat, and it's not very reliable.

56
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:39,208
Ultimately, I think the real difference between parody and satire is its function, its objective, which is a lot harder to nail down, and it can seem very different to different people.

57
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:47,058
In my view, satire is the use of humor for the sake of commentary, whereas parody is commentary for the sake of humor.

58
00:06:49,701 --> 00:07:01,032
When I released The Looker, the most surprising thing about its reception, other than the fact that there was one, was that people's enjoyment of The Looker seemed to be independent of whether or not they liked The Witness.

59
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:03,895
I found this confusing.

60
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,384
Why would the witness's critics show up for a rousing tribute to something that they didn't like?

61
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:18,870
Or, on the other hand, why would its admirers show up for a blistering, biting satire of something that they hold so dear?

62
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:32,801
The answer I found was this, that the central appeal of parody is not the endorsement of a positive or a negative view of the source material, but rather the feeling of validation that the player gets from realizing

63
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,941
that they were not alone in seeing it.

64
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:39,729
That for better or worse, somebody else saw what they saw too.

65
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:47,581
And when I would see a Twitch streamer laugh at a joke in the Looker, they would often throw back their head and say, that's so true.

66
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:57,306
Most of the really impactful moments in the game tend to come from these references to under-noticed or under-discussed characteristics in the source material.

67
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:05,110
These moments offer the player a chance to relive that experience and to relieve some of the tension that they've been carrying around for so long.

68
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:20,159
These moments actually wouldn't even necessarily get the kinds of big, bodacious belly laughs that some of the more absurd jokes might get, but making people laugh isn't the only thing that parody is good for.

69
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:25,482
As Norm Macdonald put it, it's one thing to make people laugh, it's another to make people smile.

70
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:43,528
If you look carefully at The Looker, you will find that the majority of the humor comes from one specific type of expectation subversion, bathos, the sudden juxtaposition of the lofty and profound with the commonplace and completely pointless.

71
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:47,272
This is what made The Witness such a good subject for parody.

72
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:54,198
The Witness is a very reserved and contemplative game.

73
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:07,370
Every time you solve a puzzle or learn something about what it has to say, the game draws you further into a state of unresolved reflection, encouraging you to think ever more deeply about what its themes and its design imply.

74
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:15,216
Most of the conversation around The Witness also uses this tone, which is only served to ratchet up the tension even further.

75
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:24,803
Popular online video essays about it have tense and enigmatic titles like The Unbearable Now and

76
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:27,873
A great game that you shouldn't play.

77
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:35,115
To me, The Witness and its surrounding discourse was like the first half of a roller coaster.

78
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:42,156
Even the title of The Witness has several interpretations, each of which intimates a piece of its deeper meaning.

79
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:47,557
The title of The Looker, on the other hand, barely even has one interpretation.

80
00:09:48,057 --> 00:09:53,278
And it is so indecently literal that you must avert your eyes in the dread of awe.

81
00:09:55,282 --> 00:10:01,767
This sense of bathos is the main engine of humor throughout the looker, and it wouldn't work if the witness weren't so distinctive.

82
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:10,414
People like the witness because it brings them to such singular heights, and people like the looker because it drops them so pointlessly to such depths.

83
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:15,798
Consider the following quotation for a moment.

84
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:22,904
The journey is more important than the destination, but without a destination, there can be no journey.

85
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:30,141
These words may have been written hundreds of years ago by William Shakespeare, but I found that the same is true of parody.

86
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:37,824
When creating a parody, it is poisonous to treat humor as the goal in and of itself.

87
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:44,566
This is a major misconception that will completely sink a parody, because humor is not the goal.

88
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:51,729
The goal is to relate to the audience over the source material, and humor is what naturally arises from that process.

89
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:58,942
This confusion is kind of like an is a versus has a confusion in software engineering.

90
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:06,025
Developers go amiss by thinking that parody is a form of humor that has references to the source material.

91
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:07,726
This is backwards.

92
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:14,270
Really, parody is a creative take on the source material that has jokes in it.

93
00:11:15,182 --> 00:11:19,783
For example, you should never think the evil thought to yourself, I've come up with a joke.

94
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:24,044
How can I slot in references to the original game or genre?

95
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:30,185
A much better thought would be something like, I noticed something interesting about the original game or genre.

96
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:31,585
I'll bet other people did too.

97
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:34,185
How can I represent that in a funny way?

98
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:44,487
Another major confusion that developers run into when trying to make a good parody is leaning on the shallow trappings of parodies that have gone before.

99
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:45,870
I'm trying to imitate them.

100
00:11:47,051 --> 00:11:50,033
This is probably best illustrated at the end of Pissed.

101
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:55,718
Pissed ends with a big theatrical musical number called I'm Pissed.

102
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:03,846
The lyrics contain a few shallow references to Missed, but it's mostly just John Goodman listing off the reasons why he's pissed.

103
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:11,693
Dead-end jobs, consumerism, his girlfriend smashing his hoochie-coochie lamp, etc.

104
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:29,086
You start to figure out pretty quickly that the point is not to parallel Myst, but to follow in the footsteps of broad, burlesque, vaudevillian parodies or farces with over-the-top blowout musical numbers at the end, like Blazing Saddles or The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

105
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:35,238
Pist's creator, Peter Bergman, had his roots in the theatrical comedy world.

106
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,701
And obviously he had a firm handle on what parody meant there.

107
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:44,466
But as a result, the game ended up seeming a lot more steeped in show business than in gaming.

108
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,708
And this did not seem to resonate with players.

109
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:50,951
It seems to be a common complaint with Pist.

110
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:54,954
PC Gamer writes, it's not actually a game.

111
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,597
It's simply a series of rendered slides in sequence.

112
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:17,904
The director, Quentin Tarantino, has said that when you are trying to present a new twist on something familiar, whether it's a stock character or a movie genre, it's still necessary to, quote, deliver the goods that fans of the original text or genre enjoy and expect.

113
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:28,407
When I mentioned this to my older sister, she rolled her eyes New Yorkily and told me that all film students have already heard this a million times.

114
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:32,880
But it bears repeating one more time, because the same applies to games.

115
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:42,056
In keeping with this rule, The Looker needed to succeed not only as a funny comedy game, but also as an interesting puzzle game in its own right.

116
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:49,248
During development, I never stopped looking for gameplay ideas that I thought were interesting given the design constraints.

117
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:59,233
Since the core appeal of The Witness was the creative reframing of its puzzle mechanics, it was important for The Looker to reframe its own puzzle mechanics in as many ways as possible.

118
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:08,298
It had to tell its jokes through the gameplay itself and not just through animations or novelty multimedia assets or cutscenes.

119
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:16,040
As I mentioned earlier, the main tool of parody is the subversion of expectations.

120
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:22,785
This is something that is easy to do once, but it's very difficult to do over and over again.

121
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,047
For a joke to land, there has to be a sense of contrast.

122
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:27,588
Let me tell you a story.

123
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,734
One time, when I was very small, my older sister and I were watching a movie.

124
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:44,421
It was a kids movie, so the main character got out of quite a few scrapes by tickling his assailant until he was incapacitated.

125
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:52,390
This went on until he came across a hired bodyguard who was completely unfazed by the tickling.

126
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:55,714
I turned to my sister and asked why he wasn't laughing.

127
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:09,514
She paused the movie and explained to me that bodyguards, secret service, and all other manner of security professionals all had to undergo a secret training exercise.

128
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:15,056
They take them into a room and tickle them, and they laugh.

129
00:15:16,055 --> 00:15:18,677
This is what you do when you put a bunch of jokes all in a row.

130
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:43,058
The player shouldn't see the punchline coming a mile away.

131
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:46,999
Ideally, they shouldn't even see that a punchline is coming a mile away.

132
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:53,040
If a player can be sure that a joke will come, it will have a lot less impact when it does.

133
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:01,462
So you have to remain unpredictable and break up the flow in order to bring the player's expectations closer back to baseline.

134
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:09,083
Recent comedy games have been falling short in this regard due to some overly simplistic assumptions.

135
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:26,187
On one hand, I've seen a lot of forum posts and advice from experienced game developers telling new developers that comedy games should be wacky, the graphics should be cartoony, and the gameplay should be fun and frivolous.

136
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:35,471
On the other hand, there's also a counterculture of games that employ poorly drawn or out-of-place elements to play up the shitpost factor.

137
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:41,827
But funny or intentionally low effort content still requires contrast to be effective.

138
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:49,874
Quote, where this is not kept in mind, there is no true humor, but only an infernal clamor and ranting.

139
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:51,395
Sir Francis Bacon.

140
00:16:53,917 --> 00:17:02,964
The looker has been called a shit post, but it can only get away with having janky elements by supporting them structurally with other elements that provide a sense of contrast.

141
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:10,357
For example, The Witness has very elegant and forgiving-feeling puzzle screens with a pleasing, minimalistic visual design.

142
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:18,383
The Looker inverts this by having drastically inelegant, bare-bones, scribbling-around-on-Microsoft-paint-looking puzzle screens.

143
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:32,653
And instead of having an original, abstract puzzle design, they are all mazes that follow the same gameplay rules as a Chili's Kids Menu or a Field of Corn.

144
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:43,687
However, these crummy-looking puzzle screens are couched within a world that is relatively high fidelity and does actually somewhat resemble The Witness.

145
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:51,012
This helps to remind the player of some of the original game's gravitas and reset some of the player's expectations closer to baseline.

146
00:17:52,153 --> 00:18:04,422
If The Looker hadn't included some high-effort content to offset the low-effort nonsense, it would have gone stale like a bad stick of gum and fallen dead, slain by the tireless armies of goofiness.

147
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:18,571
There's also a major general principle that I need to mention, not because it's unique to parody, it isn't, but because it is extremely tempting in a work of parody to violate this principle by accident.

148
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:34,462
You should always respect the player's time under all circumstances, and maintain a decent payoffs per minute average, whether those payoffs come in the form of jokes, genuine challenges, or just chill exploration and reflection time.

149
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:57,001
It's easy to violate this principle by trying to make a certain point or strike a certain tone, like one of exasperation.

150
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:01,043
For example, in The Witness, there are several laser cubes.

151
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:07,545
When one is activated, it turns on, orients its laser toward the target, and then turns it on.

152
00:19:09,068 --> 00:19:12,033
It does all of this really, really slowly.

153
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:18,103
I hadn't heard anyone talk about this before, so I decided to put a laser cube of my own in the looker.

154
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:22,391
You may notice a couple of extra steps.

155
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:39,792
Obviously the Looker exaggerates the slowness of the laser, but instead of subjecting the player to a full minute and a half of uneventful animation to make its point, the Looker still finds a way to hold the player's interest by presenting several gratuitous steps in the activation process.

156
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:46,697
So it still is actually delivering payoffs and respecting the player's time, even when it's pretending to waste it.

157
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,522
It is important to keep player motivation in mind, too.

158
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:59,171
Parodies are based on scripted content, and if players like your game, they won't want to miss anything.

159
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:03,632
Fear of missing out and completionism can become major factors.

160
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:11,393
Soren Johnson famously observed that, given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game.

161
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:20,415
Some of you may be tempted to roll your eyes San Francisco-ly and tell me that every game designer has already heard this a million times.

162
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:31,847
But it's completely true and not completely obvious that this observation still applies when the object of the game is to take in all of the interesting content that the game has to show you.

163
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:45,091
If players are led to believe that they might find morsels of good content by hunting around everywhere, their trust that you know what you're doing will lead them to waste a ton of unfun time hunting for it.

164
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:47,772
And it's not their fault for wasting their time.

165
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:50,193
It's the designer's fault for teaching them to.

166
00:20:52,389 --> 00:21:04,872
In parity, your license to subvert expectations is very far-reaching, and it will become tempting to subvert some expectations that are actually load-bearing and indispensable to the game's structural integrity.

167
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:12,933
The most important set of expectations that is typically not suitable for subversion is the input-output grammar of the game.

168
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:21,935
In order to maintain clear input expectations from the player, their action space should always be clear.

169
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:31,703
while developing The Looker, I thought about making certain objects in the world secretly interactable by clicking on them in an homage to older point and click type games.

170
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:37,025
This would have subverted the expectation that only puzzle screens are interactable.

171
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:39,166
It might even have made for a funny joke.

172
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:40,007
However,

173
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:53,765
It would have accounted for very little payoff relative to the immense structural damage it would have caused the game, making the player suspect that it might be useful to spend time hunting for more interactable objects.

174
00:21:54,706 --> 00:22:00,051
The player's FOMO will compel them to interrogate literally every object for a good payoff.

175
00:22:00,831 --> 00:22:04,552
The same goes for an idea like including a false wall with an Easter egg behind it.

176
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:12,875
The player will instantly start to slam into every wall in the game, scrabbling around in the dirt for one last desperate scrap of content.

177
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:18,718
It's also important to uphold certain output expectations from the player.

178
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:27,381
If the player does something that they're supposed to do, they will expect something to happen in order to tell them that it's time to move on to the next thing.

179
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:37,312
If this is not communicated, they will feel like they're missing something, and they will waste time looking around before supposing that it is time to move on.

180
00:22:39,394 --> 00:22:45,801
The looker never tries to subvert this output expectation, but unfortunately, it did still manage to break this rule.

181
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:58,126
After finishing all the puzzle pages in a particular book in the labyrinth, an achievement pops up and the player is now supposed to be armed with the knowledge that they need to finish a similar puzzle elsewhere in the game.

182
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:10,516
Because the purpose of this book is to teach the player a puzzle rule through trial and error, when it's completed, it just starts over again from the beginning, in case the player wants to test their conclusion further.

183
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:15,981
But this also deprives the player of the feedback that they've come to expect from the game.

184
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:19,349
so they persist in trying to look for more clues.

185
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:28,398
Sometimes they solve the first few puzzle pages again to see if something's changed, but eventually they give up and move on, feeling unsatisfied.

186
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:37,988
Hopefully, by now I have demonstrated that parity relies on structural elements to support its fundamental appeal.

187
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:45,297
Good parody makes use of humor that grows organically from a central relationship with the source material.

188
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:51,723
It does not start with humor and then attempt to justify it with references from the source material.

189
00:23:53,424 --> 00:24:04,234
Good parody is a creative twist on a worker genre that still has to, as Tarantino put it, deliver the goods that fans show up for in the first place and make good on its core promises.

190
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:15,231
Good parody remains unpredictable and takes the time and effort needed to regrow the game's sense of tension and contrast before harvesting it for a joke.

191
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,112
And good parody respects the player's time.

192
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:25,394
It is careful not to, in a fit of giddy exuberance, damage the input-output grammar of the gameplay.

193
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:32,957
And it is careful not to hide content in such a way that players will feel compelled to waste time looking for more.

194
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,659
For those of you who may want to make a parody yourselves, I have one more piece of advice.

195
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,862
Parody something that you have strong feelings about, and make a game that you would love to play.

196
00:24:46,582 --> 00:24:47,602
Make yourself laugh.

197
00:24:48,483 --> 00:24:56,665
Don't appeal to the multitudes by jumping on a hot trend, but appeal to someone who is just as interested in the source material as you are.

198
00:24:58,026 --> 00:25:03,688
If the stupid joke that you spent 10 months on lands with them, then all of it was worth it.

199
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,000
One more thing before I go.

200
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:16,465
In April of 2024, there will be a total eclipse of the sun visible over the continental United States.

201
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:24,229
At that time, I will make the journey to its path in order to see nature's greatest work of parody.

202
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:37,624
Our moon will perform the ultimate subversion of human expectations, the ultimate act of inversion, as the shining disk of our only sun becomes the darkest spot in the sky.

203
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:48,395
It is safe to look directly at the sun in that moment of totality, and at the same time to wander hopelessly at the dark side of the moon.

204
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:55,686
Maybe for the first time, you can be sure that everyone around you is seeing what you're seeing.

205
00:25:56,787 --> 00:26:09,879
That you are not alone, as you, awestruck, cast your clear eyes heavenward toward the world's most magnificent pair of balls.

206
00:26:35,515 --> 00:26:38,316
I have, do I have time for Q&A?

207
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:40,676
Okay, we have a little bit of time for Q&A.

208
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:45,378
Here?

209
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:46,018
Okay.

210
00:26:46,498 --> 00:27:00,662
So I just wanted to say, I've been telling my co-workers that my office has heard the shipboat joke like at least five times, because since I heard it, I knew that was the best joke I ever heard.

211
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,945
I was about to read it here, but I'm going to spare you from that.

212
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:09,090
So I wanted to ask, how did that particular joke come to be?

213
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,193
Because the setup is so good.

214
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:12,594
The punchline is so good.

215
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:14,596
I love that joke so much.

216
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:18,741
Without spoiling it, which joke was it again?

217
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:22,205
The one that starts talking about the ship owner.

218
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:24,850
Oh my god, oh yeah.

219
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,032
So that's what I'm talking about with like under-noticed or under-appreciated parts of the source material.

220
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:36,535
That was a particularly distinctive audio message from the witness that really stuck in my mind for a long time.

221
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:42,738
So it was kind of natural that it would come out in the looker just in some form.

222
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:50,482
So I found like a hook where it started going on for a while and I kind of like lost the train of thought with my metaphor.

223
00:27:50,982 --> 00:27:51,102
So

224
00:27:51,883 --> 00:28:13,268
the way that you would approach like turning your observation into a joke like that is what's the central thing that's like distinctive about what I found so interesting about the source material which was like this ship owner parable and I thought like what's the dumb version of that parable that I can tell for a joke so that's kind of what my thinking was.

225
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:14,308
Thanks.

226
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:20,988
Hi, is this on?

227
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:26,050
One of my favorite jokes in The Looker is the first person shooter reference.

228
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:30,312
I think it comes out of nowhere and always makes me laugh.

229
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:34,754
And my favorite part of The Witness was also the first person shooter section.

230
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:47,220
I wanted to know how far can you go pulling in joke mechanics from other games before you get too far off of the source material, if that makes sense.

231
00:28:48,850 --> 00:29:00,113
So that was actually not really meant to be apart from the source material.

232
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,934
There's another part that is similar that was that I'll touch on.

233
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:05,075
But the actual motivation for that was

234
00:29:06,941 --> 00:29:13,207
Jonathan Blow mentioned that a lot of players, this was feedback he didn't expect from players, they kept expecting like a jump scare.

235
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:23,818
Like they kept expecting this like silent island with nothing going on to like suddenly there was going to be a jump or a monster or like something like there was an eerie feeling on the island.

236
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:30,645
So I tried to just like satisfy that with like a ghost comes out of nowhere, like all that stuff.

237
00:29:32,065 --> 00:29:34,486
So that was actually the motivation behind that joke.

238
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:44,209
There's another part earlier on which was, it was kind of just a reference to, I'm talking about like the pickup boxes.

239
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,592
That was kind of just a joke of like, what's the opposite of a puzzle game?

240
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:56,334
It's like a boomer shooter where you're like picking up like weapons and ammo.

241
00:29:56,574 --> 00:30:00,295
You never use it for anything but like you got it and it's floating there and you're ready.

242
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:02,763
Thank you.

243
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:05,605
Two more questions.

244
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:07,186
Hi.

245
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:07,927
Amazing talk.

246
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:11,970
It's finally great to find someone who likes dick jokes almost as much as I do.

247
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:12,610
Thank you.

248
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:18,594
I wanted to ask, just how much did you study The Witness?

249
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:23,058
Because clearly there is just so many references.

250
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:25,259
What is your hourly play time?

251
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,080
I'm so curious.

252
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:27,429
a lot

253
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:54,837
just having it percolate in my mind a while that it was very natural for me to make these references and to try and like express some of these observations that I wasn't necessarily seeing observed elsewhere.

254
00:30:55,298 --> 00:31:00,201
Like it wasn't really part of the conversation but it was like an elephant in the room in my mind at least.

255
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:22,359
Yeah, there were some particular parts, especially the art style, where I had to do a lot of side-by-side comparison and really try and nail that in order to get the contrast between we're in the witness, but also things are going in a very non-witness direction.

256
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:31,367
So yeah, I had to do all kinds of stuff of just tabbing into the witness and then tabbing into the

257
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:32,652
unity editor.

258
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:45,117
Hi.

259
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:56,520
I was wondering, based on your portfolio, which I just Googled, most of your work is pretty, like, your previous work is pretty straight-laced and, like, serious from what I could tell.

260
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:03,342
So I was wondering what kind of pushed you to jump into the comedic cesspool?

261
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:04,842
Great question.

262
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:08,063
It's a very comfortable cesspool.

263
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:15,222
what inspired me to do that was actually I was making like a GDC.

264
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:17,663
I've seen like all these people who are presenting their

265
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,782
five years, seven years, I put my whole self into that game.

266
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:27,044
Like this is the ultimate game and I'm going to start it right off the bat.

267
00:32:28,124 --> 00:32:41,750
And sometimes that works and sometimes you realize that level design takes a really long time and you start to run into some realities of how much bandwidth you actually have as a human.

268
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,981
That's what happened with me.

269
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:52,387
I was working on Skyrim and Dishonored, and it's going to be all these things in one, and then I'm going to put Mass Effect on it.

270
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:55,309
And you can turn back time with Braid.

271
00:32:55,469 --> 00:32:57,951
It was going to be all those things.

272
00:32:58,051 --> 00:33:03,695
And then I was like, I kind of got some of the mechanics working, and then I was like, oh, I have to do level design?

273
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:05,035
I have to do audio design?

274
00:33:05,055 --> 00:33:06,777
I have to make a game?

275
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:09,058
So it got ridiculous, and I started

276
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:13,958
thinking of other ideas, like, what's the dumbest idea I can think of?

277
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:17,121
It's like, well, the answer is the Looker.

278
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:19,803
That was the dumbest idea I could think of.

279
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:24,126
So I kind of, like, had these ideas that, like, a few things made me laugh.

280
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:32,253
And then they just, like, started accumulating in my mind until I was like, oh, I think I should make a prototype of this.

281
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:37,917
And then I got to kind of, like, cheat on my main project with this, like, other project that was more fun and interesting.

282
00:33:39,847 --> 00:33:41,388
It ended up holding my attention a lot better.

283
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:42,949
Thank you.

284
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,751
Alright, I think that's all the questions we have.
