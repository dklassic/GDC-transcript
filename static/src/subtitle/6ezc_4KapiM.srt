00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:14,326
Welcome. Welcome to our three micro-sessions about indie arcades and events.

2
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:18,349
My name is Yon. I have Zurida and Marie.

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,434
Zurida's going to kick off by giving a short history or overview of playful culture and events.

4
00:00:25,014 --> 00:00:27,236
Marie will talk about her activities in The Wild Rumpus,

5
00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:33,782
and I'm going to round it off with some of my experience in building arcades and going to these events.

6
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:45,848
Thanks, Sion. My name is Sarayda Buter. I have my own company called Zoe,

7
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:49,831
and I am co-founder of Playful Arts Festival in the Netherlands,

8
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:53,194
and I'm a worldwide co-director of the Global Game Jam.

9
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:59,719
One of the things that I've been doing in the past few years is organizing events to bring

10
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:06,624
people together, to connect them and give them a sense of community for different kinds of purposes.

11
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:14,829
For example, in 2010 I set up in the Netherlands Indigo Showcase, which is a showcase for game developers,

12
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,911
Dutch game developers, to show their games to each other, but also to

13
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:21,473
do a different audience,

14
00:01:22,353 --> 00:01:27,916
audience that normally never go to game events, and show them what kind of games are made in the Netherlands.

15
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:30,318
We did that by using these

16
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:36,101
Arcade cabinets that give a more of an exhibit feel than a messy

17
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:42,445
different kinds of PCs and stuff like that that you normally or which you usually saw but with

18
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:48,629
game exhibits. So we tried to use these and you can actually see them as well in

19
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:55,793
at GDC or at Gamescom this this week at the Holland Pavilion and booth number B030.

20
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:02,597
Another event I started last year was the Playful Arts Festival,

21
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:08,661
which is a festival where we try to connect people from different kinds of audiences together

22
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:10,323
and have them play together.

23
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:15,587
So join us, come together with us,

24
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:19,009
spectacle games, bring you toe-to-toe and head-to-head with your friends,

25
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,091
collaborate, play, sneak, team up.

26
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:29,137
We tried to get people together and play with each other so they could mix and mingle and experience new things.

27
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:34,140
Like you can see here that you have Hit.Me!, which is more of a physical game,

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,924
and then other games like MegaGurrp or Hocrum.

29
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:45,199
We also brought the Play for Arts Festival to an art fair in the Netherlands in Rotterdam,

30
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:54,582
where we try to give new audiences new experiences like this game and put them in an art fair,

31
00:02:54,642 --> 00:03:00,083
which is a different place than what games would normally be experienced in the Netherlands, at least.

32
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:06,468
And then last year I organized Day in the Park in the Netherlands.

33
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:10,451
And it was actually meant to take place in the park, but it was pouring down.

34
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:15,976
So we decided to do it inside and get people together and play more folk games

35
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,218
and games that you used to do on the playground.

36
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:24,162
And you can see how this makes people smile in this setting

37
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:28,145
and get them a little bit closer together than what they normally would do.

38
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:34,850
And you can see here a little bit of lemon-yousting going on in the middle of the Dutch game garden.

39
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:40,675
So Eric Zimmerman said in the introduction to game design,

40
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:43,257
the 21st century will be a century of play.

41
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:46,280
Game designers will be the architects, the storytellers,

42
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:49,503
and the party hosts of this playful new world.

43
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:52,205
So how is this done?

44
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:55,167
I think play is...

45
00:03:56,808 --> 00:04:01,232
A couple of things are part of play and playful culture, according to me,

46
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:03,974
which is there's a certain sense of participation.

47
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,195
People have to participate to make things happen.

48
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:10,659
There's a sort of performance going on and spectatorship,

49
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,600
which helps this performance.

50
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,641
And then encounter.

51
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:15,743
And encounter can be getting together,

52
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:19,926
but also experience and encounter new games and be curious about it.

53
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:24,607
So this happens around the world in different kinds of places

54
00:04:25,187 --> 00:04:27,627
through game makers, people that make games,

55
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,188
events that happen worldwide, public space,

56
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:33,529
in public space or in a certain space,

57
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,589
and collectors that make stuff like this.

58
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:36,989
For example, games.

59
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,530
And games can be folk games like this,

60
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,611
or local multiplayer games, which you can see here,

61
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:47,172
or performative games like Hit Me from Kao Abe.

62
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:55,806
Ramiro Cobeta is a game designer and he was asked what he's doing and he said,

63
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:59,971
I focus a lot on making games that bring people together.

64
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:05,939
So he's interested in social behavior and interactions between different people.

65
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,284
And a whole bunch of people and events and collectives do this in the world.

66
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:21,254
And it started, well it didn't start, but you can see here an overview of a couple of events and collectors that were starting this, like Cocoromi in 2006.

67
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:27,160
And then, well these are kind of events and collectors that are doing this.

68
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:31,543
throughout the world. And what's interesting about this is that they're all inspired by each other.

69
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:37,166
So when I asked in a mailing list, why did you start doing this, then they were

70
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:38,687
answering with things like

71
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:43,189
Cocoromian baby causes were happening and we wanted to have something like this as well.

72
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,212
And this can be in the UK, but also in Argentina and in Sweden and in Australia.

73
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:50,874
So Baby Causes is mentioned a lot.

74
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,356
Baby Causes is this underground collective in New York,

75
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:57,698
and they had a mission of bringing things to a larger audience.

76
00:05:57,998 --> 00:06:02,100
As you can see here, either through do-it-yourself arcades

77
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,722
or getting them together and showcase these arcades

78
00:06:06,823 --> 00:06:10,465
and get people to play, which normally wouldn't maybe not do,

79
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:14,607
but they were just pulled into the whole playing experience,

80
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:18,490
sometimes literally by having these things surrounding them.

81
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:27,550
Douglas Wilson, creator of Johann Sebastian Jaust, says that there is a lot of ground to be explored

82
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,733
between the intersection between games and more experience-based creative traditions.

83
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:35,496
And you can see what he did, for example, with Johann Sebastian Jaust.

84
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:42,879
As we are now in Europe, I was looking to see what kind of stuff is happening in Europe.

85
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:48,181
And there's a whole bunch of them out there, like the Indie Games Arcade at Eurogamer brings games to...

86
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:53,303
Indie games to an audience, a AAA audience normally.

87
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:59,526
Game City in the UK, for example, who tries to experiment with new kinds of events.

88
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:02,707
Like this, for example.

89
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:15,195
A maze in Berlin where they try to have an indie connect, where they put things up like this and try to have gravity on the wall.

90
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:25,222
But also, this is a little bit an example of the exhibition.

91
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:30,646
And also, a pop-up event like this, like the Nifflas dance was happening there.

92
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,173
And we brought it also to Croatia, for example, Beach Game Jams,

93
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,614
what Rumpus and Marie are going to talk about,

94
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:40,915
and the Wood Festival in Copenhagen is happening,

95
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:47,719
and then where these kind of people, you see the joy in their faces,

96
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,841
and it's a new festival that's going to take place next year again.

97
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:56,204
And then it's not only game events, but also in the theater,

98
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:57,385
stuff like this is happening.

99
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:08,098
What Kony is doing, they try to have people experience new adventures in the theater and outside the theater

100
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:10,061
and use these theater aspects of it.

101
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:13,325
So there's a lot of stuff happening out there.

102
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:18,829
We try to engage, Chad Toperk and me try to engage

103
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,190
new, all these curators and collectives

104
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,751
in conversation with each other.

105
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,813
So we have the new game salon, which is a hangout,

106
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:29,854
bi-weekly hangout, which we started recently.

107
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:32,656
And if you want to know more of these things

108
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,817
that are happening everywhere, I set up a Tumblr

109
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:38,278
where I collect all these videos for playful culture.

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,021
which you can see, have a look here.

111
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,465
So this was my talk for now. Thank you so much.

112
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:53,513
Applause

113
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:57,657
They asked us to take the questions at the end, outside, because we're short on time.

114
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:09,738
There we go. Hi everybody. My name's Maria Zoe, just sort of mentioned I work as, or I run, help run the World Rumpus, self-titled Queen Ruffhauser.

115
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:20,321
I guess sort of I refer to myself as Queen Ruffhauser because the work that we do, or the work that I do running it is sort of very wide and varied, so there's a lot of tasks involved.

116
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:23,122
The World Rumpus is within itself I guess sort of.

117
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:29,142
I have arcade, indie games club nights, and I really hate referring to it as a club night

118
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:32,311
because there's something sort of inherently sort of 90s and kitsch about that.

119
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:37,301
I can't really think of a better way to phrase events which bring together indie games and

120
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:38,743
alcohol and late night events.

121
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:44,308
And so we've run seven events to date, and we predominantly run these in London, but

122
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:50,895
we've also run events as far afield as San Francisco in partnership with Venus Patrol

123
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:55,460
and One Life Left, and we've run events as well on a fucking boat.

124
00:09:56,815 --> 00:10:01,299
So, generally this sort of stuff that we curate at these events,

125
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:04,663
so the selection of games that we present is stuff that we curate.

126
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:08,126
So, it tends to be, we started off with a very strict rule of saying,

127
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:11,049
right, it's going to be local multiplayer games only.

128
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,814
And then we accidentally broke that rule by showcasing games such as Super Hexagon,

129
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:19,738
which were sort of, okay, well actually no, it's competitive single player as well.

130
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:26,514
At our GDC event, sort of two years ago, we then hosted or presented Proteus, which is

131
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:31,358
the furthest away that you could probably get from local multiplayer and sort of competitive

132
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:32,099
single player games.

133
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,823
So when it comes to talking about the games and the events, the games that we show at

134
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:40,147
our events, it's kind of, I guess with the logic of, we kind of know it when we see it,

135
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:40,407
but...

136
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,118
But yeah, so we've also been branching out

137
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:43,999
sort of in the past year.

138
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:49,123
So this past year at GDC, we also ran the World Rumpus

139
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:52,286
Rumpus Royale, which was an indie games world tournament.

140
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:56,650
And we've also worked alongside Venus Patrol and Keita

141
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,852
Takahashi's company, Yuvula, to create the game Tenuonya Teams,

142
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:04,056
which we presented at our event or a party last year.

143
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,138
So who are the World Rumpus?

144
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:07,279
So it's not just myself.

145
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,260
I work alongside.

146
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,723
This rag-tag bunch of people who are Dick Hogg and Ricky Haggett,

147
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:13,784
who work to...

148
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:17,846
They work creating the games Ho-Ho-Kum and Fro-Wish-a-Says,

149
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:20,248
and George Buckingham, who you can probably not believe

150
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:23,970
was retrospectively photoshopped into that picture afterwards.

151
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,012
He was probably best known for creating the game Punch the Custard.

152
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:31,255
So, why do we do the events that we do?

153
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:33,216
And I think for me it's that...

154
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:38,167
I look around at sort of the events and things that were happening within London at the time

155
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:42,209
when we started World Rampus, and there were a lot of events which were for sort of indie

156
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:45,010
developers to showcase their work to other indie developers.

157
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:50,338
And there was also a lot of events which were showcasing indie games within larger game

158
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,720
expos and established spaces.

159
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,104
I don't want to use the word gamer, but as it's only a seven-minute talk, I've got to

160
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:57,744
paraphrase.

161
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:58,845
So I'm going to use that term.

162
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:03,389
But neither of these spaces were actually places that I felt welcome or I felt that

163
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:05,150
I was really supposed to be in.

164
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,914
But as someone who wasn't really a game developer or someone who wasn't really that involved

165
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:11,576
with playing that many sort of AAA games.

166
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,072
We're sort of thinking, well, where do people like me go who are sort of creatively curious

167
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:18,413
about these sort of games to run these events?

168
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:22,656
And exactly as Zoe just sort of mentioned in that talk, that I feel like a cliche that

169
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:29,099
we were inspired by looking at these photographs of events that were happening elsewhere.

170
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:33,241
So the events that Gamma were putting, or Cocoromi were putting on, and the Gamma events

171
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:36,722
which you can see here, and the events that Babycastles were running in New York.

172
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:49,493
I looked at these spaces and I looked at these events and the people that were at them and I could see myself in those places and it felt like a space where I would be welcomed in this sort of event that I was passionate about recreating and running this sort of event.

173
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:54,377
So we sort of took inspiration from those and started setting up our own events.

174
00:12:54,477 --> 00:13:03,685
And it's kind of interesting listening to sort of Kelly Wallach talking this morning about the reason why they don't look at or when questioned why they don't bring.

175
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:07,848
Why they bring the indie mega-books to PAX and they don't look at creating.

176
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:11,619
a separate showcase is specifically for those games.

177
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,400
Because if they thought that they'd be putting a filter

178
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,760
onto the audience that you'd be bringing in.

179
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,841
And I guess the point that I'd argue

180
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,742
is that it's completely correct that you

181
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:20,822
would be creating a filter.

182
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:22,943
But by running those events at PAX as well,

183
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,663
there's still already a filter in place.

184
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:27,124
And it's not a filter that someone like myself

185
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,725
passes through quite comfortably.

186
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:31,786
But also, these events like the stuff

187
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:34,727
that Baby Castles were doing and that Kokoromi

188
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,467
were doing as well.

189
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,673
They weren't just necessarily about sort of creating these sort of neutral spaces.

190
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:45,822
They were spaces which were born out of the creativity and passion of the games that they were showcasing.

191
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:49,288
For me, when I look at a game like Johann Sebastian Joust,

192
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:51,188
which if I have to hold up one game as being

193
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,129
the real sort of inspiration for running the events that we do,

194
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:54,809
it is this one.

195
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:57,009
And it's a game that just for me does not

196
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:59,210
equal being showcased necessarily

197
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,590
in a convention center like you can play there.

198
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,891
But for me, playing Johann Sebastian Joust

199
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:06,652
is about being in the hull of an ex-Cold War fishing

200
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:10,072
ship in the middle of night with sort of this audience

201
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:12,353
of people passionately around, the people playing sort

202
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,053
of bane for blood as they're watching the players.

203
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:16,964
without these games.

204
00:14:17,044 --> 00:14:19,865
So it's about creating spaces which aren't just

205
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:22,666
neutral spaces for people that are outside

206
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:25,126
of our established games-led audience,

207
00:14:25,186 --> 00:14:27,007
but it's about creating spaces which

208
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:30,548
are boring and sympathetic to the games and work

209
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:31,648
that they're showcasing.

210
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:34,669
And so I've just put up here a few of the details of the events

211
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:35,590
that we've run to date.

212
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:40,348
Our first event was back in 2011, and that was an event that we ran for...

213
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:42,069
Attendance for that was free.

214
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:44,790
And I looked at our budget the other day, and it actually made me laugh,

215
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,232
because it was about five lines long, and it came to about 400 euros

216
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:50,133
or something for the amount that we spent on it.

217
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,614
And the attendance for that was 300.

218
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:56,215
So it was great that we managed to keep costs down by borrowing a lot

219
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:59,057
of equipment, which does make a lot of extra work for yourself.

220
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:02,558
But there are ways of doing these events and creating and setting these things

221
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:03,939
up and running them at sort of low...

222
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:08,609
low cost and none of these costs that are up on the screen as well either take into

223
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:11,611
account the time that we work or that we do to run these events.

224
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:15,773
We're doing all of this as a labor of love and we don't pay ourselves to run these, but

225
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:20,776
you can then see that we've progressed up to GDC, which is a bit of an anomaly because

226
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:24,938
we've kind of got a captive audience out at GDC when we run the parties because there's

227
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:28,300
already a really big, enthusiastic indie games audience there.

228
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:32,635
But then coming to the most recent event that we did in London,

229
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:36,338
which was, as I say, it was on a fucking boat.

230
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:39,460
And that was the first event in the UK

231
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,061
where we charged entry for.

232
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,743
Because as this audience grows and as we manage

233
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:45,604
to reach these bigger creative audiences that

234
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,386
sit outside this sort of games literate sort of audience,

235
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:50,227
that of course, the costs.

236
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:51,408
And we need a bigger boat.

237
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:52,349
We need a bigger venue.

238
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:53,489
We need bigger spaces.

239
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:55,171
And because of that, that costs money.

240
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:57,672
And we want to put on these bigger exhibitions and larger

241
00:15:57,772 --> 00:15:58,473
showcases.

242
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:00,976
But to do that, it costs more money.

243
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:03,117
And so we had to put a ticket price on the event.

244
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:05,658
And it was great that our attendance was sort of double

245
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:06,898
what it was for the first event.

246
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,259
But what we did find retrospectively was sort of

247
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,620
being at that event is that you could see by the audience

248
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,821
who had attended that it wasn't quite the same balance

249
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:16,221
that we'd had for the first event.

250
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:19,462
Instead, we were kind of missing the people that we'd

251
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:21,523
seen at our first event, which was for free, which

252
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:25,845
We were kind of missing the people that weren't perhaps already in that indie games or games

253
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:26,566
literate space.

254
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:30,727
So I think it's something that retrospectively I want to look back at what ways we can work

255
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:34,349
to potentially still make sure that we're building these events up and we're able to

256
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:35,169
grow with the demand.

257
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,972
But also making sure that we remain sort of open, neutral spaces that do welcome people

258
00:16:40,012 --> 00:16:44,574
from outside of this space to come and realize that, okay, so that they don't, you don't

259
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:48,035
feel that you necessarily like games or you don't classify yourself as a gamer.

260
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:51,263
But there are things here that you can get passionate about.

261
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:56,124
And we need to create events and build this sense of culture

262
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:57,984
and community around these things.

263
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:00,464
And one of my favorite quotes that we had for events

264
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:03,025
was from The Guardian, which was this one which I've highlighted

265
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,565
in blue at the bottom, which I'll leave on,

266
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:08,006
which was that our events are a glorious mashup of music, play,

267
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:08,586
and alcohol.

268
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:10,706
Seriously, if you've never caught one of these things,

269
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:12,847
come along and bring lots of people

270
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:15,287
who don't usually play games because their lives are

271
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:16,087
about to change.

272
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:18,506
And that's what we want to do at Cyc.

273
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:21,428
We want to introduce more people to this stuff

274
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,109
and run more fun and interesting events.

275
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:24,990
So if you want to find out more, you

276
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,471
can visit theworldrunperstock.co.uk,

277
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:29,713
or you can find me on Twitter at CycIsHungry.

278
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:30,213
Thank you.

279
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:45,947
Hi, I'll try to make this real quick.

280
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,809
I think I have seven minutes.

281
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,391
My computer starts.

282
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:21,107
So hi, my name is Yon.

283
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:25,329
Um, I made a little weird presentation.

284
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:26,070
It's an experiment.

285
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,750
Please bear with me.

286
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:30,873
Uh, welcome.

287
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:31,513
Um,

288
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:39,088
Please, please hold your claps.

289
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,351
I'm going to be saying we a lot probably.

290
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,973
It's because I have a company that's called GlitchNap.

291
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:49,256
We're starting up a collective in Antwerp called the House of Indie, probably.

292
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:56,342
I'm affiliated with the ITU of Copenhagen, where I'm doing, where I have started a student organization that's doing events.

293
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,024
And with the Copenhagen Game Collective.

294
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,846
Let me tell you the story of the last year of my life,

295
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:04,247
because that's kind of really related to all of this.

296
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,788
It all started when we made this game called Laser Knights,

297
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:09,169
which was a four-player locomotive-player game we made

298
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:11,690
because we didn't want to write an AI or do level design.

299
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:13,991
We were lazy.

300
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:17,472
So it ended up like this, where four people,

301
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:20,074
because obviously you can't play four players on a keyboard

302
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:21,974
because of physical space and hardware limitations,

303
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,335
it ended up four people crouching in front of a computer,

304
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:26,676
having a blast, kicking the floor, you know, jumping in the air.

305
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:27,417
But...

306
00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:31,070
Yeah, that's not really something you can sell.

307
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,072
But the interesting thing that happened here...

308
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:36,013
This is a tilted thing. This is annoying.

309
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:37,694
I'm just going to use a touchpad.

310
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:39,876
Bear with me.

311
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:46,399
So really quickly, we realized that this creates a space around your game,

312
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:50,602
like a sort of almost physical area that you're now playing in with people.

313
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:56,545
But it's really confining to, like, stand bent over and look at a laptop.

314
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:58,086
So...

315
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:03,408
What we did was we put the game in an old arcade machine, you know, like one of those old fridges,

316
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:06,349
and we were able to, when we set it up in a public space, attract a lot of people

317
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:09,111
because of the familiar shape of a fridge that plays video games.

318
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:13,043
And then we were invited to the Nordic Game Indie Night

319
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:16,184
as a nominee on the one condition, unofficially,

320
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:18,364
the one condition that we would actually bring the arcade machine,

321
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:21,245
which was a problem because we didn't actually own that one,

322
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:22,145
we borrowed it from someone.

323
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:24,866
So we decided to build our own, which led to this.

324
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:28,307
With no money and no carpentry skills,

325
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,047
we ended up buying two IKEA coffee tables,

326
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,128
the cheapest ones you can get,

327
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:34,228
and putting them together, putting a screen in there,

328
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:37,809
and popping out four controllers, which resulted in this.

329
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:38,789
This is my favorite picture.

330
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:40,530
This guy is obviously having a blast.

331
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,311
at playing LaserNate.

332
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:46,514
We ended up actually winning that award,

333
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:49,757
which I think no small part to bringing this arcade

334
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:51,618
because we just dominated the space.

335
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:53,140
Every game had its own booth.

336
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,080
They all looked identical.

337
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:56,883
Ours was really special because we built this physical thing.

338
00:20:58,788 --> 00:20:59,909
And it kind of went on from there.

339
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:02,771
The problem with this one was the IKEA wood is actually cardboard,

340
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:04,612
so the wheels we put on there kept on breaking.

341
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,674
So we decided we need a new one, and let's make mobility our priority

342
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:08,634
so we can take it everywhere.

343
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:12,156
So we made the Babycade, which looks kind of like this.

344
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:17,139
Again, there's a young person having a blast.

345
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:25,318
Yeah, that's it. We couldn't get a shopping cart, so we ended up just buying the cheapest

346
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:30,501
vintage baby stroller we could get. This has been showcased several places, and we're hoping

347
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:36,044
to bring it to parks and just drive it around downtown with both our indie games and your

348
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:36,944
indie games and whatever.

349
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:42,310
A bit later, I went to Global Game Jam in Antwerp, which is my hometown, although I live in Copenhagen.

350
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,693
I decided to bring part of this culture that I'm engaged with back home.

351
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:49,537
So again, I had no money, so I bought the cheapest vintage coffee table I could find.

352
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:54,682
I put a screen in it, and I brought it and played some of the games that I play so often in Copenhagen.

353
00:21:56,382 --> 00:22:00,184
That ended up, I ended up meeting exactly the right person who wanted to help me with this, took it forward,

354
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:05,087
and we ended up making it into The Press X, which is a platform where we curate indie games and bring them to events.

355
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:11,810
We've exhibited Proteus and Super Hexagon, Tengami, and other games at places that have never seen those types of games before,

356
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,132
which is really awesome, and this was made in January, we finished it in February, March,

357
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:19,154
and it's been to like ten different events, and it's gonna be hopefully more and more.

358
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:29,375
This is a beautiful, it turned into this beautiful thing with like, we put like gold, gold plate on there that says press X and it has like gold hooks for your Xbox controllers. Really nice.

359
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:35,451
And in this one, actually, I got invited to showcase a game at Wild Rumpus.

360
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:38,052
And I arrived a day early, and that's a bit of a right conference.

361
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:41,594
And I arrived a day early and I decided, well, I don't really want to see London.

362
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:42,975
I'll just build an arcade.

363
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:46,177
So I got somebody... I spent the whole day making phone calls.

364
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:47,358
Again, I had no money.

365
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:49,058
So I, um...

366
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:56,924
I got somebody to lug these pallets through downtown London with me on foot, like a kilometer

367
00:22:56,944 --> 00:23:01,668
or two, and ended up at the venue and just cut a hole in the top, put a screen in there,

368
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:06,112
and again, I made this thing with very little effort that just completely dominated the

369
00:23:06,632 --> 00:23:09,014
space at the Bit of Alright conference and at Wild Rumpus.

370
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:13,017
So, to sum up, what I'm trying to say is,

371
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:16,239
build arcades, it works out, it's great,

372
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,960
it's great fun and it's really rewarding.

373
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,662
Use whatever you can find, bring them wherever you go,

374
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,223
and organize meetings for them.

375
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:26,845
Basically, if you build them, if you build it, they will come.

376
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:33,828
So I wish I could tell you that I have some master plan where a year ago I decided to become a game installation artist.

377
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:39,810
I wish I could tell you it was super easy getting these projects funded and finding materials, etc. etc.

378
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,391
I wish I could tell you there's never been any hammering or gluing or sawing mistakes.

379
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:48,978
I can't, but I can guarantee that these machines are a really good way to get your game to

380
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,261
actually be played by people you otherwise have a difficult time reaching, because they

381
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:58,084
don't necessarily understand computers, but they understand the shape of whatever it is

382
00:23:58,124 --> 00:24:00,786
you have there, or they understand that this is something interesting that they should

383
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:01,366
pay attention to.

384
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:06,149
It can also get you invited to a lot of cool parties, like GDC Europe.

385
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:11,055
In our case, it won us our first award.

386
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,457
I got here to come to GDC Europe and sort of host a panel.

387
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:17,419
I really recommend it.

388
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,061
The thing we started in Antwerp, I put a screen in a coffee table

389
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:24,123
and since then we've curated two entire exhibitions

390
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,304
and we've brought it to ten other events.

391
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:31,907
So, to round us all off, I have no idea how I am on time.

392
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:40,277
Why I think this matters from a sort of higher point of view,

393
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:44,999
these devices are the only gateway, or every device is a gateway

394
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,560
to the digital world inside.

395
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,600
If you want any game to be played by humans,

396
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,721
you have to make an interface to the physical world,

397
00:24:53,582 --> 00:24:55,163
which means you're giving it a physical shape.

398
00:24:55,443 --> 00:24:57,903
You don't do this consciously when you make a computer game

399
00:24:57,943 --> 00:25:00,544
because the computer is your shape, but you totally have the power

400
00:25:00,604 --> 00:25:02,965
to put it in any other shape, and every shape is different.

401
00:25:05,762 --> 00:25:08,406
Using shapes that we're familiar with has really interesting consequences.

402
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:11,691
The three crates, pallets I put on top of each other were so sturdy,

403
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,935
people were standing on them and dancing and sitting,

404
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:17,500
and it was so makeshift, I was just going to trash it, I wasn't going to bring it back home.

405
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:22,327
I handed out markers and duct tape for people to tag it and make it, you know, this sort

406
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,968
of old, you know, here today, gone tomorrow thing.

407
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:29,849
The Press X, on the other hand, became this beautiful ornament, like we ended up lacking

408
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:34,491
it so it's shiny and it's beautiful and people just want to go in there and be enthralled

409
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:37,571
in whatever magical, beautiful indie game we put on there.

410
00:25:40,732 --> 00:25:46,074
So and to connect it to the other things, events and showcases is where these installations

411
00:25:46,114 --> 00:25:46,754
come to fruition.

412
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:53,019
The importance of local multiplayer games has been argued quite a lot in last year's, you know,

413
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,699
Dispatch Friends, Kickstarter, and stuff like that.

414
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,741
These events, they can provide the critical mass that those games need to make sense,

415
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:01,582
both for players and spectators.

416
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:06,563
Games like that often don't make any sense when you just play them like a four-player game

417
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,444
with only three people and there's no spectators.

418
00:26:08,504 --> 00:26:10,044
That's not the same.

419
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:17,427
To me, they are to games what movie nights are to movies, or concerts are to music.

420
00:26:18,425 --> 00:26:21,892
It's a place where you come and you enjoy the games that are being curated or that you

421
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:23,515
brought yourself with your friends.

422
00:26:27,364 --> 00:26:32,466
Then also at these events, interesting things happen where these

423
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:34,567
concerts or movie nights overlap.

424
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:37,649
This is Chipsle playing at the Wild Rampus party in front of Super

425
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:42,892
Hexagon, which is a super interesting combination of two forms of media.

426
00:26:43,932 --> 00:26:47,634
Same thing happened to the game I made Go Nuts, and DJ's wearing

427
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:51,616
robot masks while we're trying to play it on his body.

428
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:55,298
And that's all I have to say.

429
00:26:57,412 --> 00:27:01,814
I hope you are inspired to start doing the same thing I have so I can bring my arcades

430
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:02,494
to your parties.

431
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,076
Thanks a lot for listening, thanks for coming.

432
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:08,478
This has been a great turn up, great opportunity.

433
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:11,679
These are all the people I would like to thank and mention, etc.

434
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:14,841
Thank you Marie and Zoraida, and see you later.

435
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:15,321
Questions?

436
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:16,342
We'll meet us outside.

437
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:21,745
There's one last thing.

438
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,145
I almost forgot.

439
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:22,825
There's one last thing.

440
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:26,287
I almost forgot.

441
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,906
So when I got invited to come to GDC,

442
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:32,348
I thought it would be so cool if we could bring,

443
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:33,509
or we thought it would be so cool

444
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,691
if we could bring an arcade, but what's possible?

445
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,172
So I booked my Air Berlin Fair,

446
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:38,574
and they said you can bring one luggage.

447
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:40,015
And I was like, I don't need a luggage.

448
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,636
I can just put some t-shirts in my hand luggage.

449
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:46,499
Then I decided, why not build an arcade inside a suitcase?

450
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,261
So we came up with the Lugatron, which you can see right here.

451
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,322
And I'm going to be playing on it until they kick us out of this room.

452
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:56,545
But more interestingly, it'll be in the Expo Hall next to SOS's amazing

453
00:27:56,665 --> 00:28:00,907
Achtung Arcade, which actually has a place in the Expo Hall until tomorrow

454
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:01,367
afternoon.

455
00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:04,609
So please stop by, come play it, talk to me, or find me on the internet.

456
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:05,730
That's where I live.

457
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,471
So thank you.
