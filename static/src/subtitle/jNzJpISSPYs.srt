00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:09,091
Good morning everyone! Welcome to the GDC Twitch channel. My name is Bryant Francis and I am here

2
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:16,915
today checking out a game called Ashwalkers with Herve Bonin and Matteo Garnier. Herve, Matteo,

3
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:20,857
you guys come from the studio Nameless13. Would you please introduce yourselves?

4
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:28,020
Yeah hello so thank you very much for reaching us. So I'm Herve Bonin. I was one of the previous

5
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,602
founders of Dontnod and I am the general manager of Nameless13.

6
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:41,443
And hello, I'm Mathéo Gollemier, and I'm the creative director slash writer of Ashwalkers.

7
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:42,324
Nice.

8
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:45,226
Ashwalkers, like I said, it's the game we're checking out today.

9
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:49,089
If you paid attention to the menu a second ago, you might have noticed it was called

10
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:54,153
Ashwalkers A Survival Story, which, you know, as far as game titles go, it's very accurate.

11
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:55,974
It's a story, and you survive in it.

12
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:58,196
That's been my impression so far.

13
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:08,784
For folks not familiar with the channel, today we are looking at pre-recorded videos, so if you want to yell at me about if we're, you know, if you wanted to vote on decisions that we could make, sadly not happening today.

14
00:01:08,924 --> 00:01:15,809
That's my fault. I'm bad at video games, and you know what? It's hard to talk to smart game developers and play video games at the same time.

15
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:17,491
I didn't know if you knew that. Maybe you did know that.

16
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:26,978
Um, well let's get started. As the intro rolls before us, and we're gonna see the tutorial in just a second, um, uh, uh, Mateo and Erv, um...

17
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:32,414
What the heck is this game? Where did it come from? Why is it here? Why is it so beautiful?

18
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:39,936
Like, I could keep gassing you guys up more, but what I really should do is let you introduce your game and explain sort of where it came from.

19
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:42,297
Okay. Um...

20
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:47,058
The whole adventure started four years ago.

21
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:52,119
It started as a student project in a school in Toulouse, the ETPA.

22
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,720
And it started as a project of...

23
00:01:57,204 --> 00:02:00,046
end of formation, end of school.

24
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:05,469
And we had to produce a game during the year.

25
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,713
And this idea first has born in the school.

26
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:20,098
We were with some friends and some classmates and we produced a first game during the year

27
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:21,859
that was called Sombre.

28
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:37,301
end of year ceremony, we met one of the jury, Hervé Bonan, and Hervé liked our game and

29
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:38,841
liked what we had to propose.

30
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:47,723
And from this point, we talked with Hervé, we had a long discussion about how we should

31
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:50,003
we continue to produce this game after.

32
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:52,223
And finally, we decided yes.

33
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:03,876
So, three years ago, we started Nameless 13 and we started to produce directly from student

34
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:13,163
to NVIDIA this game, and we had three years to bring the best of us to prove that this

35
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:14,044
idea was nice.

36
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:22,230
And we had this game releasing last week, and you have Ashwalkers under your eyes.

37
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:26,156
Yes, perfectly said. Nothing to add.

38
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,437
Nothing to add.

39
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:28,918
Yeah, that's it.

40
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:39,335
Well, Mateo, I want to learn more about the games making first, but, um, Erev, um, you know, as a co-founder of Dontnod, I want to...

41
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:46,001
I gotta admit, that's kind of a new pitch, that's kind of a new thing I've heard about a studio, you know, like, Dontnod's an established studio,

42
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:55,729
um, and not just in the world of, um, Life is Strange, but you've got games like Vampyr, real neat game, I was playing it a lot, uh, pre-pandemic, or on my Nintendo Switch when it launched there.

43
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:06,098
I'm really impressed that you have one company that's there, it's moving along, you co-founded it,

44
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,199
and then you see a student game that makes you go,

45
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,264
okay, yeah, I'm done with the established company, I want to go help a student game move to commercial success.

46
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:16,726
So what made you want to make that jump?

47
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,087
No, it's not exactly that way.

48
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:20,908
That things happen.

49
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:27,533
In fact, it was the end of my adventure with Dontnod because it was nothing to do anymore

50
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:28,273
in that company.

51
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:30,035
It was quite a few years ago.

52
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:36,560
And then after a little bit of rest and experimenting with new kind of gameplays, because at Dontnod

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,922
it's a huge machine and it was just managing people.

54
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:45,927
I was willing to do something by myself, reprogram because I'm first a programmer.

55
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:50,752
So I tried some new prototypes of my own.

56
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:55,556
And also I was looking for indie games because I think it's a great area of play.

57
00:04:55,976 --> 00:05:00,680
And at that time, I just came back to my own city in the countryside because I'm from Toulouse.

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,902
And there was a student school.

59
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:09,732
I was wanting to do a new indie game company and I see this student project and I said to the guy,

60
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:14,155
hey we have something to do together because I think you are doing a great job and there

61
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:20,040
is narrative parts that I recognize and you are about to do something, picture a story with song,

62
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,784
music and everything and I think we should do something together and that's just how it

63
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:30,508
starts and the meeting was very cool and so the student became my partner.

64
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,643
Nice. Mateo, let's swing back to you for a second.

65
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:43,428
Okay, so Ashwalkers, to me, as an outside observer, I look at this game, I see a survival game,

66
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:48,491
I get shades of Oregon Trail, you know, that classic, like, a party across a landscape.

67
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:52,713
Party members can drop dead, but the goal is to keep them alive.

68
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,234
In this game, the challenges include...

69
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:59,016
Moral challenges might be too far of a swing to describe, but you know,

70
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:02,077
but it's kind of like, it's like how do we approach kind of a social problem,

71
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:06,079
as well as, you know, physical survival problems, are some of the choices you make.

72
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,300
So what was kind of the underpinning architecture for...

73
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,221
taking this game from, you know, let's go all the way back to like, you know, kind of those student days when you were like

74
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:18,842
prototype and then you were like, okay, we can we can leave the prototype space and go into shipping something space

75
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:21,002
So what was kind of the architecture of the design for this game?

76
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:27,423
From the start of, uh, since we left school

77
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:32,024
Kind of that transition from you know, the start to like, okay, this is a game we can make this game

78
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:36,085
I'm, sorry, that's not as clear but no no no problem. I wanted to be sure

79
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:37,565
um

80
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:38,365
Okay, so

81
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:45,677
The whole idea behind the game was the choices and what happened inside the game.

82
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:55,502
And we are huge fans of tabletop role-playing and fun fact, the game was first prototyped

83
00:06:55,882 --> 00:07:03,325
as a tabletop role-playing, almost as a board game at first, on paper, on table.

84
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:05,666
And this idea of

85
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:15,829
Especially one question, what do you do and how you approach this situation, was something

86
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:23,150
we liked and we wanted to take a bit of a, I won't say a twist, but a bit of an approach

87
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:30,492
that was a bit more, a bit less moral in terms of good or bad, what you do is good or bad,

88
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:33,052
and a bit more like, okay, what do you do?

89
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,273
How do you approach a situation?

90
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:42,852
In the text we see on screen, you can see you approach a wolf and you have to decide

91
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:44,593
how you approach the situation.

92
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:54,037
And we wouldn't want to do the judging side of the game.

93
00:07:54,958 --> 00:08:02,802
We wanted to avoid just saying, okay, you have this situation, do you take the bad decision

94
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:05,143
or the good decision, are you good and evil?

95
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,901
And we wanted to avoid this at maximum level.

96
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,482
And so this is what kept us since the beginning of the game.

97
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:16,282
And since the beginning of the project, even at school,

98
00:08:16,823 --> 00:08:19,523
it was, okay, we won't judge.

99
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:26,445
We just put the situation and try to give the players

100
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:30,305
the maximum possibilities and options in front of a situation.

101
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:40,287
And this is why it drives everything from the game, this idea of choice.

102
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:49,590
Even the text-based events that you can see on the screen, the choice of going with the text instead of, I don't know, voiceover,

103
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:58,334
or something that is more standard in the industry, like you can see in Deltas or even at Donknotes.

104
00:08:58,574 --> 00:08:59,615
We wanted to have this.

105
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:07,418
place for the mind to wander and to find, okay, you see a shape in the horizon, but

106
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:15,341
you can imagine what it is, even the silhouette you can see on the screen right now, you don't

107
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:21,283
know exactly who it is, how does it work, you only have the text and your own choice

108
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,144
to discover that.

109
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:25,305
And we wanted to push this idea to the game.

110
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:33,969
I... we can build off the tabletop angle there that you mentioned real quick.

111
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:39,011
Um, when I play tabletop games, I've noticed that, and there's actually an interesting overlap here

112
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:44,392
with the survival genre, um, my party members in a lot of tabletop games are most concerned with

113
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:49,634
with dying. Um, they, if I'm playing, you know, if I'm playing an experience and I,

114
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:53,216
and it's something like this where like, what I decide to do...

115
00:09:54,756 --> 00:10:02,960
Uh, you know, it's sort of like there's no skill, you know, like there's no amount of skill I can bring to the table with a controller, or with combos, or with knowing a...

116
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:14,164
You know, something more abstract, like, you know, like think Frostpunk, you know, like, I'm like, oh, like, I have this much knowledge of my resources in Frostpunk, I could probably worm my way out of these bad situations if I play my cards right.

117
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:17,265
And in a game like Ashwalkers or in a tabletop game...

118
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:23,809
Kind of the death-averse mentality is something I found a lot because, you know, like you said, like,

119
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:28,352
what do you do is a question that often goes to, I feel like, as a player, I feel like,

120
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,274
uh, I hear a lot, what I hear from my fellow players a lot is, oh no,

121
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:38,658
if I do the wrong thing, I'll die. Um, and sort of, um, I'm kind of curious, uh,

122
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:46,188
And death is right there on the table, because one of the first things you learn playing this game is if three of your four party members die, game over.

123
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:53,171
And those little timers, all those little bars in the bottom right hand corner of the screen are all different countdowns towards death.

124
00:10:53,771 --> 00:11:05,555
So I'm kind of curious how, as a designer, you were able to encourage players to fear death less and make interesting choices more.

125
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:19,966
I think we kind of linked the choices to the survival condition.

126
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:26,511
And what we wanted to avoid is less than fear of death,

127
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:32,775
we wanted to avoid absolutely the optimization of your play.

128
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:37,579
And we do that choice because I know this is how I will win the game.

129
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:40,898
This is what we wanted to avoid.

130
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,441
And the most...

131
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:50,325
The question you ask when you are in front of a choice of Ashwalkers is most commonly,

132
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:55,469
Okay, how will I survive this encounter?

133
00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:58,311
How would I decide to face this?

134
00:11:58,691 --> 00:11:59,332
Okay, I have...

135
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:00,432
I don't know.

136
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,873
I have some wood.

137
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:04,335
I can light a fire to scare an animal.

138
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:11,979
But this food will be consumed for the next camp that I will make and maybe my character will be thrown to death.

139
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:23,608
So this is more about what you are able to sacrifice to make your squad and people live than what is a good or bad choice.

140
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:32,815
And I don't know, optimization? I don't know if that's a word in English.

141
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:39,457
This is about optimization, but you are the squad.

142
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:47,441
So you have to think about, okay, what I am ready to sacrifice to advance inside the game.

143
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,922
And this is most of our choice like this.

144
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:58,426
And fear of death is always here, and you have to think forward and to prepare for what's

145
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:58,966
coming up.

146
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:06,638
That's a good answer. I liked the part about trying to avoid there being an optimal choice.

147
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:07,839
I really like that part.

148
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:12,882
I'm going to have some more questions for Matteo and Hervé in just a second, but I

149
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:16,344
wanted to go to chat first, because chat, we've had some wonderful folks show up who

150
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:21,087
wanted to say some things. Before I start reading this off chat, if you have questions

151
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:26,230
for Matteo and Hervé, you can ask about Ashwalkers, you can ask about running a company.

152
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,794
Whatever you want to know, you know, whether you're fans of games or want to make games yourselves,

153
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:35,758
here at Game Developers Conference, especially on the Twitch channel, we're trying to get answers for you.

154
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:41,002
Knowledge, learning, excitement, these are the vibes we want to give off.

155
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:43,905
Let's start off, we've got a lot of heart emojis in here.

156
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:50,191
Verdinggoodenough wants to say that the amazing game and art direction, so many paths and vendors,

157
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:53,373
perfectly balanced difficulty, thanks to the team.

158
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:58,887
MJADAC says, Baguettes?

159
00:13:59,107 --> 00:13:59,587
Baguettes.

160
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:03,410
I hope it's a meme for someone, because it's not a meme for me.

161
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,113
And Kenzekoya wants to say that they're in love with this game.

162
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:11,016
Oh wow, so much love for this game coming in.

163
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:12,938
That's nice.

164
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:17,601
This is a name we've heard a lot.

165
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:22,886
Bernon was an early streamer of the game, and I salute him.

166
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,004
Your video has outgrades.

167
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:27,305
Oh hey, Verdon.

168
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:35,747
Verdon, as a streamer, as an amateur streamer over here, thank you for dropping by our stream, I appreciate it.

169
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:45,030
Erve, I want to ask you, you know, what were some of the challenges, you know, kind of helping, you know, guide, shepherd this team and this game from start to finish?

170
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,672
You know, what kind of new challenges came with this smaller game as opposed to the kind of games you worked on at Dontnod?

171
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:56,895
Yeah, it was something very different because DotNet was a huge enterprise.

172
00:14:56,935 --> 00:15:01,898
We had huge investments in the beginning and we started really to hire a core team

173
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:05,380
with only senior and very experimented people.

174
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,383
And so it's really not the same kind of company because I wanted to have something lighter.

175
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:14,605
And there was also one business hypothesis I was making myself.

176
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:17,368
I think there is a huge waste in student school.

177
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,589
There is a lot of very talented people,

178
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:23,893
there are sometimes some I don't know as a junior,

179
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:26,255
but I think there is a huge waste of creativity.

180
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:31,600
And I wanted to check if some young student people

181
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,482
were able to finish a game from beginning to start.

182
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:38,686
And the concept of Arsh Walker is proving it.

183
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:43,936
So I'm very happy that my business hypothesis is valid.

184
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:48,760
And my goal is to make more indie games with this team.

185
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,882
And with something fresh and new.

186
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:55,625
And with a small team it's very easy to...

187
00:15:56,425 --> 00:16:01,249
I think on my side there is less financial pressure than for huge big games.

188
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:02,230
It's very different.

189
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,151
For the guys, there is a huge pressure because it's their first game.

190
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:10,273
And so, in a way, it's their life they're putting on the game.

191
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:15,595
But I'm a little bit older and I've seen other things, so for me it's far much easier.

192
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,776
So I have far much less pressure.

193
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:20,998
And I try just to help the guys, to give them the best.

194
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:23,619
But I cannot give them all they wanted.

195
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,340
I'm sure if I gave more to Matteo on the financial aspect,

196
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,562
he could have done something more and bigger and greater.

197
00:16:30,862 --> 00:16:32,102
But that was not the goal.

198
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:38,425
We were here to do an indie game and just push more further a student project into a real game.

199
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:40,906
It was an experience of its own.

200
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:43,547
I start a new company and so that the guys...

201
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:47,137
Learn and be confident in themselves.

202
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:50,240
And I think it's something that I can do,

203
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,462
and that was my goal to help them.

204
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:58,179
Also, in love with this game, when I first tried the prototype, I thought it was something great.

205
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:03,080
And remembering some books I was reading, and remembering the first sentences with Matteo,

206
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,781
was a reference of a great book in France.

207
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:14,483
And we have the same narrative, how can I say, origin books, I don't know in English.

208
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,683
Interests, would interests be the right word?

209
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:25,432
Interesting, yeah, it's the same universe, same kind of reading, I'm also a tabletop gamer.

210
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:28,313
Influences, I think influence is actually the word.

211
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:29,974
Influences, yeah, that's it.

212
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:32,114
Yeah.

213
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:32,774
That's it.

214
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:38,336
And so yeah, it was not only a game, it was a start-up to start with talented people.

215
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:44,338
So, different level of success, the game and also the company, and make them progress.

216
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:45,458
So I'm very happy.

217
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:52,293
I'm going to pivot back to Mateo here, because we're coming up on one of my favorite parts

218
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:57,579
from my experience with the game, which is the Hound's mansion that you encounter.

219
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,153
So, I want to comment on what's going on on screen right now specifically.

220
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:09,696
Um, this is me, uh, you know, when I've played a bunch of these games by now, I sort of know,

221
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:13,558
like, I know how to ride, you know, in my view I'm like, I feel like I know how to ride.

222
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:17,981
You know, okay, my party's tired, people are hungry, but I'm looking at the road ahead

223
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:19,342
and I don't see anything.

224
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:25,183
obstacle-y coming up so I can maximize how long we go and then feed and then keep going.

225
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:29,144
And as you can see poor Petra here is actually not maximized because she took some damage

226
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:32,184
and I'm out of med kits. But don't worry, she'll be okay.

227
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:39,405
So the how I did this because I saw that mansion I went all right something's happening there and

228
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:46,727
I want those numbers up to make it through that mansion. And when I got in there I was rewarded

229
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:48,927
with an encounter that actually didn't.

230
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:53,859
Like, it was not entirely necessary for me to go through the steps that I'm going to go through here.

231
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:54,459
Mild spoiler.

232
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:59,224
But, um, uh, and what I got was something actually that I thought was a little more interesting,

233
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:04,691
which was like, instead of a boss fight, I got an encounter that I had to navigate using, um...

234
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:08,923
What I liked about this the most was that I...

235
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:14,288
I kind of got to bring my own vibe for how I would manage this situation

236
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:15,510
into the...

237
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,393
Like I felt genuinely like the choices were wide enough that I could navigate it in my way

238
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:20,154
as opposed to like...

239
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:20,975
I don't know...

240
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:22,977
Something inspired by...

241
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,698
Cormac McCarthy's The Road, which is...

242
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:28,342
You know, what a lot of post-apocalyptic fiction takes inspiration from.

243
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:43,354
But I still have that tension, you know, where coming up I'm like, okay, like, something's on the horizon, like, I'd better gear up, you know, like, like that classic, you know, like, shooter or third-person platformer vibe of, like, there's a boss up ahead, there's a room full of loot, I'd better make sure, like, I'm good to go.

244
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:48,717
Um, uh, as a designer, like, how do you sort of navigate, you know, like, players, like...

245
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:53,738
What, like that anticipation versus like what was actually waiting for them in the room?

246
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:55,958
Because like player behavior is so much more used to, you know,

247
00:19:56,399 --> 00:20:01,179
like I need to come into these things as ready as possible versus, uh, once you get in there,

248
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:06,540
it's like, oh, nothing. That little rest moment actually didn't help me, but it did.

249
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,541
Yeah. I don't know, but it wasn't a waste either. Like, I guess like, like that's my,

250
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:12,762
that was my experience. And I'm kind of, I want to throw that at you and go, what do you think?

251
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:14,802
Sorry. There's a question in there somewhere.

252
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:15,982
Yes. Um, so.

253
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:24,937
Intensity and tension, this is what you are talking about.

254
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:31,039
This hound and the manor was a big challenge for us,

255
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:35,480
as it was the first zone of the game and this was the end of it.

256
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,301
And we wanted to be memorable.

257
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:45,002
We wanted people to talk about what did you do with the hound,

258
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:46,463
how did you manage to go through it.

259
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:48,543
So we did the...

260
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:55,272
The tensions in the beginning of the zone, and you have in the outpost at the beginning,

261
00:20:55,312 --> 00:21:02,655
you have a tag on the wall that says, okay, you have this tag with people from the outside

262
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,776
and it's pictures of wolves.

263
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:13,078
If you go further, we put hints of what's coming on all along the zone.

264
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,800
And finally, you came in this place in the front of the manor.

265
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:25,661
And you have this house that's sort of nowhere, and you have this road that goes up.

266
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:31,742
And we wanted to stress the player and to do exactly what you did.

267
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:38,704
And we wanted to, okay, you have something here, you don't know what it is, but it can be dangerous.

268
00:21:39,644 --> 00:21:45,665
And we pushed the player to go through it and to go inside the manor.

269
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:54,248
And once you prepare, here it was very difficult to write because we wanted to have all kinds

270
00:21:54,349 --> 00:22:04,316
of behavior just like in what we said before, but we wanted them to feel more heavier and

271
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,578
more important.

272
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:11,301
And by that, one solution we found was to reduce the number of choices.

273
00:22:12,262 --> 00:22:12,382
I...

274
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:12,982
Um...

275
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:22,278
When the player is getting used to have four choices or three choices,

276
00:22:22,978 --> 00:22:26,740
when you put him in a situation where he has now only two choices,

277
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:33,144
this starts to create tension because you don't have much to do.

278
00:22:33,364 --> 00:22:35,626
And this is what we want to tell by the system.

279
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:38,528
You don't have much room to act now.

280
00:22:39,428 --> 00:22:45,052
You have to be prepared and this time you have to do one thing and this will be very important.

281
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:50,724
And as you said, you have, for example, if we continue into the spoiler,

282
00:22:51,245 --> 00:23:02,894
and as I see in the video, you decide to not draw your weapons in front of the hounds and to talk with them.

283
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:12,441
If you draw your weapons with the hounds, you will have only two solutions, either fight or flee.

284
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:17,618
and you could not come back to the duel you have encountered after.

285
00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:20,058
And this was very important for us because

286
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:23,259
it was, ok, if you have someone that is...

287
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,920
that did not know the group,

288
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,001
that don't know your intention,

289
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:30,481
show them your intentions.

290
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,942
And we build up the tension like this.

291
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:37,903
We build up the tension by reducing the number of draws.

292
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:40,564
And you have...

293
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,005
You've got a good path and even the duel could have ended wrongly.

294
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:52,930
You've made a good choice and arrived safely to your situation.

295
00:23:54,072 --> 00:23:56,895
Because you trusted them, finally.

296
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:18,355
Um, you know, you put your talkers in the talky problems and your fighters in the fighty problems.

297
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:24,358
And in this case, you know, like a mix of like, oh my quickest fighter is weakened.

298
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,299
Yeah, I have a brawler, but I don't know if I want to kill this guy.

299
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,000
Um, and so I'm left with my diplomat and I'm like...

300
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,283
What if we, what if you just run around like, you know, just like, okay, let's just try running through.

301
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:41,628
And, and, um, and I also appreciate kind of, um, I also appreciated like combat as ritual, the combat as ritual part of it.

302
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:45,531
You know, like a group of people who are like, okay, we have a combat ritual and you just need to best him.

303
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:49,974
And it's like, well, it turns out best is a very broad definition. Um, as opposed to, you know, like.

304
00:24:50,694 --> 00:24:53,697
Trial by honor, the strongest, or trial by combat, the strongest would win.

305
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:58,200
Like the ritual component, you know, the winner mattering more than the violence,

306
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:01,904
uh, was just super neat. That's not a question, that's just a chef's kiss.

307
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:03,885
Um, folks.

308
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:10,351
But that was very, very important for us to picture the people living from the outside.

309
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:18,878
We wanted to have something very, a bit different from what you see with the code of warriors and

310
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:25,238
Even if they were warriors, we wanted to write something with a bit of a twist, as you said.

311
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,640
The best twin and not the strongest.

312
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,143
And this was what we wanted to say with these people, with this group of people.

313
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:40,408
And all through the game, we talked about different people and different behaviors.

314
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:45,331
And this was very important to have something that was not totally cliché.

315
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:53,017
The avoiding of cliches is what I saw the most in my time with this game when it comes to the...

316
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,574
The game refers to them as the Savages, but by the end I was like, man, that's just someone else's word for these guys.

317
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:09,202
As opposed to what the, and also like it's always been, in the real world, it's always been just someone else's name for indigenous people.

318
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:13,925
In chat, we've got, you know, just more love for the game.

319
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:18,469
Vernon's back with kudos for the soundtrack music and sound design, which are totally immersive.

320
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,812
And Heckenrobin, Heckenrobin agrees.

321
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:24,934
Thank you, Norbin. Hello.

322
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:54,170
More ability to pump out like, okay, like we have all this voice acting we need to get done.

323
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,211
We can prioritize that.

324
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:58,994
And on a smaller indie team like this, even if you have a dedicated sound person,

325
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:06,120
there are more challenges to still, you know, like, you know, like produce and manage the content

326
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:07,622
and get it across the finish line.

327
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:11,345
What did you see as some of kind of the challenges of,

328
00:27:11,945 --> 00:27:14,728
of like, you know, like creativity, like, you know, you've got this team of,

329
00:27:15,128 --> 00:27:16,249
of talented young students.

330
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:25,394
Students turn professionals. Their vision is interesting, but your scope is also limited.

331
00:27:27,374 --> 00:27:30,676
Scope management, I guess, is what we're narrowing into here as a question. So as

332
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:35,098
someone who's worked in these two different studio environments, how did you sort of

333
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:39,040
see scope management working on this project compared to other projects you've been on?

334
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:45,903
In fact, it was quite easy because the prototypes they have done, the 3DN project, was already

335
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:49,146
showing what they were able to do by their own.

336
00:27:49,606 --> 00:27:55,131
So for the Sun design, the prototype was quite amazing, so I was quite sure they were able

337
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:56,031
to manage this part.

338
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,874
It was a project of its own with everything.

339
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:06,777
There are already some good visual, there are already some designs, there are already some original music,

340
00:28:07,157 --> 00:28:09,618
so they already have the feeling of what they were doing.

341
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:18,422
And I just had to verify they were able to maintain that talent and keep the scope.

342
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:20,184
They are defining themselves.

343
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:23,326
And so if their promises are for real,

344
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:26,969
they go far beyond what they are about to do.

345
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:31,372
And then I have to just put in front of what we expect to do

346
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:34,414
the investment needed so they arrive.

347
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:37,636
And also what is very difficult is to...

348
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:44,502
to a face in a way, in them it was like in Dothraki, to have a face in a project is not so easy

349
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:49,746
and the more there is time between the beginning and the end, you have to be really confident and

350
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:56,251
give some milestone to be able to check, verify that we are in line with what you expect,

351
00:28:56,631 --> 00:29:02,116
but also that the team is still able to do it and not losing face in what they are doing.

352
00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:08,841
It is very difficult to transform the initial idea into something real that player will have in hand.

353
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:21,007
And my main focus is to give the key to the good people, whatever it was in Dunknode or with Nameless Searching.

354
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:24,528
And I think my talent is to make people have more talent.

355
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:27,590
And so I ask them to do it.

356
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,071
And for the music, it's an indie game.

357
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:38,535
But we have a great new original composition with a young, talented student of his son,

358
00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:40,737
some friend and knowledge of Matteo.

359
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:48,083
And it's always like things like this for indie game company, you can push the limit with a small budget.

360
00:29:48,423 --> 00:29:56,250
I can tell you that the music, we have a lot of music in this game, which are totally original and it's amazing soundtrack.

361
00:29:57,351 --> 00:30:06,978
It's also a product of its own, really. I don't know if you hear it, but I think we have something to do to sell this music by itself as a game.

362
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:07,638
Yeah.

363
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:14,383
So it's a real fun to see that we can do great things.

364
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:20,207
The same thing for the visual. You have to be crutch. We have no room for error.

365
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:23,650
So we have to take a direction and push it further.

366
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,190
Yeah.

367
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:33,442
Um, Arave, while I've got you on the horn here, um, uh, there's kind of a business-y angle that I kind of noticed about this game that piqued my curiosity.

368
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:39,844
Um, uh, pricing indie games on Steam is a, uh, tough topic for every indie out there.

369
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:50,467
Um, I- I know some indies who are very passionate about, um, like, if it's less than $20, um, you know, it's- it's- it's very difficult to make up.

370
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:54,970
Uh, you know, the number of units sold relative to cost for the game.

371
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:59,113
Um, and I know other indies who are like, if I don't go on the cheaper side,

372
00:30:59,194 --> 00:31:04,037
like, it's difficult for me to compete with, you know, like, with something, you know, that's at the same value at $20.

373
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:05,999
You know, like a Frostpunk or something.

374
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:09,181
I think Frostpunk clocks in at more expensive for...

375
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:13,044
I keep referencing Frost... Frost... Frost... I can speak, I promise.

376
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:14,746
Frostpunk!

377
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:18,890
Um, uh, clocks in at more expensive than that.

378
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:25,316
But, but, it's a useful touch point for like, you know, survival, for survival for my brain here.

379
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:31,263
Um, this game does clock in at under $20. What was kind of the decision driving that?

380
00:31:35,332 --> 00:31:37,693
It's also a way to be efficient.

381
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:45,976
So we choose very early to work with a publisher in a way.

382
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:48,477
So we are doing the game, we own the IP,

383
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:54,680
but they are doing marketing and they also determine what is the right price for the game.

384
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,542
Because it's very, very difficult to imagine what is the proper price.

385
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:05,615
When we are confident in people, and it's my way of working with Matteo and all the people,

386
00:32:06,095 --> 00:32:13,179
they say to me, the good price, that's it. I say, okay, that's it. So I do my computation to see,

387
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:21,323
okay, if we sell this car, are we still living? Are we dead or not? And then I say, okay, we go

388
00:32:21,343 --> 00:32:28,087
around and we go around with this price. I think it's a very fair price for the content. And we

389
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,608
also try to be rare.

390
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:38,528
We are in front of this game, so we just have to remember what we are able to pay for a game.

391
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:50,960
And I think as an indie developer, it's far much easier to think as a gamer than a huge big company with hundreds of people who are depending on the price and the huge marketing.

392
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,583
Life is very easier for me and with Deal Villagers, it was great.

393
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:58,685
And also I just want to tell, just a few words also,

394
00:32:58,705 --> 00:33:03,068
that in France we have huge subsidies from the French government,

395
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,910
which help us a lot to do this game.

396
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,672
And so it's also not...

397
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:14,055
It's helped the company to be profitable for this game.

398
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:19,781
Right, yeah. That makes sense. Yeah, especially in countries where the governments are more involved in the arts.

399
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:26,326
I live in a country where, well, it helps fund the Kennedy Center.

400
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:30,929
Beautiful theater, I gotta say, by the way. I saw Phantom of the Opera there.

401
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,932
But yeah, that's interesting. I actually want to...

402
00:33:35,672 --> 00:33:39,775
You mentioned yourselves, you know, thinking as indie developers you get to, quote, think as gamers.

403
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:42,397
I've heard that a lot from some developers who are like...

404
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:49,861
Because, especially here in my part of the world, like knowing the developers I know who work at larger companies,

405
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:55,044
there's so much key-passing back and forth, especially among studios, that I know a lot of game developers who say,

406
00:33:55,464 --> 00:34:00,907
I don't feel personally attached to the price of games anymore because I get so many for free through my friends,

407
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:06,710
I get, you know, I work so much that I just essentially buy them when they go on discount,

408
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,052
or I make one $60 purchase a year, essentially.

409
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:15,275
versus the average player who might want to,

410
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:17,316
whether they play one multiplayer game over and over,

411
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:19,297
or want to check out a bunch of indie games,

412
00:34:19,477 --> 00:34:20,857
or want to check out a bunch of AAA games.

413
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:25,059
I can see why, you know, sort of thinking about yourself,

414
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,800
like, yeah, being in a position where you're not

415
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,421
disconnected from the realities of pricing is important.

416
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:35,846
And also, one of the things I've made with this company, because all the students are

417
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:40,509
partners of the company, so they're really involved in the profitability of the company,

418
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:46,194
and so it's linked also to the price, the work they put in the game, and how much they

419
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:46,614
are paid.

420
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:49,697
Everything is something which is coming together.

421
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:54,621
So it's hard for them because they have a huge involvement in the game, but also in

422
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:56,122
the company and the profitability.

423
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:04,786
It's a good experience, but it's difficult to be an associate and also someone working on a game.

424
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:07,609
So I think it's better for the people, but it's props.

425
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,652
For the mental sanity, sometimes it can be harder.

426
00:35:11,053 --> 00:35:14,977
So, Mathieu, I think, will agree with me.

427
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:18,741
So I give them the key as much as I can.

428
00:35:19,507 --> 00:35:21,769
So that they can figure, OK, we are doing a game,

429
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:25,132
but there is a limit in what we can do for a game,

430
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:26,593
because we expect some sales.

431
00:35:26,953 --> 00:35:28,414
And so we cannot push more money.

432
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:31,576
And if we push more money, we need to have a big you.

433
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,478
We are marketing because we need to reach more people.

434
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:37,821
And you know, it's something which is more and more difficult.

435
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:40,904
The more you give, after you have to be clever.

436
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:42,966
It's not only money that makes good games.

437
00:35:42,986 --> 00:35:46,989
There is some mono games where great with just one people.

438
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:49,571
So every game has its different story.

439
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:53,014
But in our story, we want to share everything.

440
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:57,118
Whatever the price, marketing, everything is clear.

441
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:57,684
Yep.

442
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:03,809
Um, comment from Kenza Koya in chat, uh, saying it's your team's first game, so you can be proud of yourself.

443
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:07,713
Uh, they'll be waiting to hear more from Nameless13. Also, Team Nadir.

444
00:36:08,353 --> 00:36:09,374
Oh. Uh, so...

445
00:36:10,943 --> 00:36:18,408
Um, uh, uh, Mateo, um, let's swing back to, um, we're going through kind of a choice situation now,

446
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:25,732
and I think we've talked a good amount about the game's choice. Um, as a designer, um, how do you,

447
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:31,195
when you're, when you're, you know, still figuring out, uh, the balance of a game of slow, you know,

448
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:34,597
like, like, like, let's go to the bars, which unfortunately aren't on screen right now,

449
00:36:34,618 --> 00:36:37,579
you know, you have to manage, uh, health.

450
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:46,088
Hunger, energy, and rest and kind of a, you know, that sleep factor, or warmth, warmth, warmth, warmth, warmth.

451
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:54,117
You have to manage, and then also hope. You know, you've got, there's a hope meter that's kind of hiding behind the other meters back there in a different way.

452
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:59,721
When you are in the tooling, prototyping stage,

453
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:04,244
but before things are rendering on screen and before encounters are happening,

454
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:12,089
how are you simulating and tweaking the values on those bars to get the optimal results?

455
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,670
And what's your philosophy for like...

456
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:16,692
Seems like a lot of math is what I'm saying.

457
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:19,093
And I'm bad at math, so I want to know how you hit that math.

458
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:21,735
We are bad at math too.

459
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:25,699
I'm bad at math too.

460
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,140
Someone in this chat asked if we're good at math.

461
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:36,622
No, we try to project what we want for the game.

462
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:40,803
And mostly it's the only way you can develop a game.

463
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:43,664
It's testing, testing, testing, testing.

464
00:37:44,244 --> 00:37:46,184
Bringing new players, testing the game.

465
00:37:46,604 --> 00:37:49,405
And this is something that is very difficult,

466
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:53,146
especially like the whole statistics you showed up.

467
00:37:53,795 --> 00:38:00,759
And even in comparison to some bigger games with huge RPG mechanics,

468
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:04,621
we have a smaller amount of values and of parameters.

469
00:38:05,902 --> 00:38:09,264
These parameters can influence a lot on the game,

470
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:13,446
how many you lose by step you take, and etc.

471
00:38:13,986 --> 00:38:18,609
So the whole philosophy behind the balancing of the game

472
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:22,671
was to ensure that there is a good balance.

473
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:31,487
This was more about balancing the experience than in the fairness of the game.

474
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,128
I don't know if I'm clear.

475
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:40,230
It was more about the rhythm of the game than about the difficulty of it.

476
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:51,274
We wanted the player to have a part of his time not too concerned by the survival

477
00:38:52,314 --> 00:38:52,894
and more by...

478
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:57,107
working and exploring the world and making choices.

479
00:38:57,647 --> 00:39:06,331
So we balanced the value to, okay, you are trying to survive and you are trying to endure

480
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:11,793
this harsh weather, but you are also living in a story and you have also choices to make.

481
00:39:12,313 --> 00:39:17,615
And we balanced to have a bit more of this, a bit more of the story and a bit less of

482
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:18,796
the difficulties.

483
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:25,534
And this was a very difficult thing to balance, especially when you have played your game

484
00:39:25,554 --> 00:39:32,156
thousands of hours and now you know exactly what you do to reach an ending.

485
00:39:32,776 --> 00:39:40,538
As a team and as our game designer tried to make, he could not even see the...

486
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:49,000
After three years of production, we just played the game easily and we don't feel like

487
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:53,739
being able to balance the game ourselves anymore.

488
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,542
And we had a lot of playtesters that I thanked, a lot, a lot, a lot.

489
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:03,625
QA teams from the villagers, which helped us a lot.

490
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:11,690
And with them and the playtesters, we could balance the game and tweak the values.

491
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:14,732
Okay, you need a bit more of this, you need a bit less of that.

492
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:17,414
And this was the way we balanced the game.

493
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:25,573
the player feedback with all the experience and what we get from them.

494
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:34,557
And there was a lot in the systems, even if we had a minimalist system from a survival game,

495
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:41,120
but it was only thanks to the players we can balance this game.

496
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:45,202
Yeah, we don't have a magic formula behind it.

497
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:47,919
Yeah.

498
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:49,379
Not right now.

499
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:53,400
If anyone had a magic formula, I'd love to see the GDC talk on it.

500
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:53,820
Hey!

501
00:40:54,881 --> 00:41:00,502
Hey, I was just paying you.

502
00:41:00,782 --> 00:41:06,703
Let's talk about, I'm surprised to get this far without talking about the black and white aesthetic.

503
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:14,598
I feel like this is one of those things that was there since the prototype.

504
00:41:14,618 --> 00:41:17,099
You know, it's a defining look.

505
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:23,402
We're sort of seeing an example here, you know, how an object on screen is made more

506
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:26,384
hey, I'm here, come over to me, I am resources.

507
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:31,606
You know, in the final product of this game, what did you learn about, you know, when you

508
00:41:31,646 --> 00:41:36,709
go for a black and white aesthetic, on the one hand you gain some clarity, because anything

509
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,990
that sticks out from the color scheme.

510
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,671
uh... uh... you know stands out and therefore players will navigate towards

511
00:41:43,691 --> 00:41:44,532
a drift towards it

512
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:47,612
and on the other hand on how do you navigate

513
00:41:47,632 --> 00:41:51,153
uh... you know sometimes you want things to be more obscure sometimes you want

514
00:41:51,913 --> 00:41:53,574
uh... information you want

515
00:41:53,974 --> 00:41:56,655
a little bit of nuance in there you don't want things to be strikingly

516
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,095
obvious

517
00:41:57,735 --> 00:42:00,636
uh... i was gonna make in there somewhere up until i realized like wait

518
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:02,236
why is this black and white thing like

519
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:04,157
where is this also higher part of my brain

520
00:42:04,457 --> 00:42:08,319
And I realized it's that classic book we all read in middle school in the United States, The Giver.

521
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,402
So I was like, wait, why is red such a standout?

522
00:42:13,422 --> 00:42:14,362
I'm like, right, The Giver.

523
00:42:14,683 --> 00:42:18,725
So yeah, so I'm just kind of, that makes me kind of curious, like as a team,

524
00:42:19,345 --> 00:42:24,008
what were some of the challenges of working in this black and white, kind of grayscale space that you have?

525
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:28,250
It was a huge challenge.

526
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:32,902
So it was a very cool idea.

527
00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:37,285
And we dived into it in school.

528
00:42:39,146 --> 00:42:41,928
And it was, OK, we wanted to keep that.

529
00:42:42,048 --> 00:42:45,711
It was very resonant with the theme of the ashes

530
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,573
and the theme of the post-apocalyptic

531
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:51,395
and the theme of violent despair.

532
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:56,358
It was resonating with all of what we wanted to talk.

533
00:42:56,979 --> 00:42:58,260
So we went for it.

534
00:42:59,021 --> 00:43:06,043
The hardest thing I think, but was the biggest challenge we had to face,

535
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:10,424
was the clarity of the game in all of these aspects.

536
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:15,666
When you work with grayscale, and especially with the one we have,

537
00:43:16,046 --> 00:43:21,707
which has finally not so much contrast, you don't have pure black and pure white.

538
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:28,469
You have to balance the contrast all around the game, all around the environment.

539
00:43:29,003 --> 00:43:33,125
And especially this zone that you see on the screen, the volcanic tomb rock,

540
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:40,508
was very difficult to work with because we had all these vegetations, the black ground,

541
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:49,791
and at night, night is... was a nightmare. At night, you want to have this feeling of

542
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:56,193
it's night, it's dark and you will get lost, but you don't want your player to get lost inside.

543
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:56,313
So...

544
00:43:57,705 --> 00:44:03,806
You try to make things different and you work on the lights.

545
00:44:03,946 --> 00:44:07,947
The lighting of the scene was very difficult to put and to work with.

546
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:15,449
And the main advantage we got from working with that is, as you said,

547
00:44:15,669 --> 00:44:19,030
when we want to put something in evidence, we use a color.

548
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,591
And that color was red, which was...

549
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:26,651
definitely working with what we were saying also, with the blood, with the violence, with

550
00:44:26,671 --> 00:44:32,736
the danger, and with the lava, with the fire, it was resonating also with what we wanted

551
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:33,396
to say.

552
00:44:33,977 --> 00:44:42,364
So, as soon as you put something different in that environment, you can see it from everywhere.

553
00:44:42,964 --> 00:44:50,630
So the red, for example, was a great way of telling the player, okay, you're in danger.

554
00:44:51,534 --> 00:44:54,274
or you just killed someone or something.

555
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:59,376
And this was a way to bring the player's attention

556
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:02,777
and to bring him back to the game.

557
00:45:03,538 --> 00:45:06,619
And so he doesn't walk just and say,

558
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:08,859
oh, damn, my character died.

559
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,820
No, no, your character was bleeding five minutes ago

560
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:13,421
and you saw it.

561
00:45:13,641 --> 00:45:16,422
So now this is dangerous.

562
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:19,463
We had trouble working with that view.

563
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:25,218
all priorities of the game and we are still taking improvements and feedback from it.

564
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:33,061
And we are working with, from the demo maybe, we had a lot of feedback from the players

565
00:45:33,281 --> 00:45:44,384
and it was troubling with reading some white on grey text and we went and added shadows

566
00:45:44,604 --> 00:45:47,485
all over our interfaces.

567
00:45:48,138 --> 00:45:55,323
and our UI, and we added a lot of shading around that to make it stand better.

568
00:45:56,084 --> 00:46:03,729
And yeah, working, telling something to the player when you remove the colors to a designer,

569
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:07,732
I think that's a great challenge and that was difficult.

570
00:46:08,012 --> 00:46:13,296
However, our game designer and UI designer found a great way to evoke that.

571
00:46:13,768 --> 00:46:18,869
Yeah, um, I have a specific and maybe nitpicky question about the black and white.

572
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:25,491
Um, uh, as a player, I'm playing this game, I see the black and white, and what I've internalized,

573
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:29,753
you know, and on one hand I get like all the red, you know, like the red on, um, uh, um,

574
00:46:30,073 --> 00:46:33,674
Sin, Sin's got some red on his body right now because he's got those little wounds.

575
00:46:33,694 --> 00:46:36,895
He's off camera right now. God dang it. Um, uh.

576
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:42,151
Some part of me is like, some of this is literal and some of this is abstract.

577
00:46:42,311 --> 00:46:47,376
You know, like, some of this is video game and some of this is what the characters are literally seeing in this fictional world.

578
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:53,542
And then at one point in the dialogue, uh, there was a line that referred to the yellow kind of fog.

579
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:54,603
It might have been in this area.

580
00:46:55,024 --> 00:46:57,246
And my brain, like, I swear to- I had like a whole-

581
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:08,423
thing. I'm like, yellow? What's yellow? So it's just one line...and maybe it's just the

582
00:47:08,443 --> 00:47:12,485
problem you were just talking about. I'm curious how you...I mean, there was a lot of writing

583
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:16,768
that went into this game too. And to have something like that happen, and how it hits

584
00:47:16,828 --> 00:47:20,790
with player expectations. Maybe I'm the only one who noticed it, but it broke my brain

585
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,971
a little bit because I'm like, wait, I thought everything was black and white, I thought

586
00:47:23,011 --> 00:47:27,093
this was a black and white earth. But yeah, I'm curious if you had any...

587
00:47:28,174 --> 00:47:33,396
Does that... I don't know what the question is there to be honest, but I'm just like, that was my experience.

588
00:47:33,696 --> 00:47:34,016
Did you...

589
00:47:36,277 --> 00:47:40,539
I get your point, I get your point, but this was a bit of...

590
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:44,861
This was a true question in design phase.

591
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:47,802
And it was about the perception.

592
00:47:48,162 --> 00:47:52,224
Who is looking at the game right now.

593
00:47:53,672 --> 00:47:57,156
Who is that camera? Who tells the story?

594
00:47:57,356 --> 00:48:03,885
And if you play the game, you have a better idea of who is talking and who is telling the story.

595
00:48:04,586 --> 00:48:09,872
And so this kind of...

596
00:48:11,361 --> 00:48:16,784
I don't know if that's a word or a phrase.

597
00:48:16,844 --> 00:48:19,386
Look, the phrase that we all lean on is ludonarrative dissonance.

598
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:23,268
But if you say it, you have to take a shot and pay, what's his name?

599
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:27,130
You have to pay Clint Hawking $10 if you say it.

600
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,692
I don't know if that's in the budget for the show.

601
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:32,053
Okay, sorry.

602
00:48:32,393 --> 00:48:33,314
Okay.

603
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:36,576
So this was a bit of a...

604
00:48:36,756 --> 00:48:39,197
We avoided at maximum to say...

605
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:41,200
of the colors inside the game.

606
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,101
Except for the...

607
00:48:43,981 --> 00:48:46,262
Even when we talk about vegetation,

608
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:47,683
we talk about how it's

609
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:50,565
humid, warm, and

610
00:48:50,605 --> 00:48:51,345
something like that.

611
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:53,246
So we try to avoid that.

612
00:48:53,746 --> 00:48:55,887
But sometimes we have to tell

613
00:48:55,947 --> 00:48:57,888
the stories, and especially

614
00:48:58,129 --> 00:48:59,389
that's the characters

615
00:48:59,589 --> 00:49:01,670
that are inside it, that are telling it.

616
00:49:02,271 --> 00:49:04,112
So, the squad,

617
00:49:04,492 --> 00:49:05,673
if they are saying,

618
00:49:05,793 --> 00:49:07,393
I see something that is green

619
00:49:08,074 --> 00:49:08,574
on the other side.

620
00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:14,633
This is a bit logical for us to have our characters see the world as it is,

621
00:49:14,853 --> 00:49:18,198
and ourselves see the world as we perceive it.

622
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:21,723
And so this was our link to the game.

623
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:24,183
I think that's the best answer I can give you.

624
00:49:42,198 --> 00:49:46,661
And within this space of time, while I give you all time to answer questions, I'm going to do a little bit of housekeeping.

625
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:51,904
This is the GDC Twitch channel with Game Developers Conference, as you can see right above my head.

626
00:49:53,405 --> 00:49:57,728
What we are all about is just about the art and business of making video games.

627
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:01,690
We stream games here on this Twitch channel and talk to developers who make them.

628
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,331
That's our whole oeuvre.

629
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:06,593
If you want more of that, please click the follow button.

630
00:50:06,973 --> 00:50:07,854
But more importantly...

631
00:50:08,314 --> 00:50:12,656
We have an excellent opportunity for you, especially because you're watching this on Twitch at home.

632
00:50:14,156 --> 00:50:19,318
GDC 2021 this year is going to be online. It's going to be in July, starting on July 19th.

633
00:50:19,738 --> 00:50:24,120
If you want to register for GDC, I have a button down below somewhere. Somewhere down there.

634
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,440
Yeah, we're all pointing down.

635
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,981
Um, uh, uh, if you go click on that button you can register, you can get a pass.

636
00:50:31,522 --> 00:50:34,382
Um, I've already, there's already a whole schedule of talks up that you can see.

637
00:50:34,902 --> 00:50:38,223
Um, whether you're just coming with the expo pass, there's some amazing talks if you decide

638
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:43,244
to go in for something more specific to see more in-depth talks that it's just the schedule is

639
00:50:43,304 --> 00:50:46,585
packed everyone like I cannot stress enough I just went through the talks yesterday I was picking

640
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:50,786
out some favorites and it's kill it's a killer session this year and I don't just say that

641
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:51,866
because I work here but.

642
00:50:53,226 --> 00:50:54,988
I love watching GDC talks and they're great.

643
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:58,830
Yeah, if you need other- if there's anything else you need from the GDC brand,

644
00:50:59,751 --> 00:51:02,412
we also have the GDC YouTube channel where you can watch more amazing talks,

645
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:04,213
including ones we just had from GDC Showcase.

646
00:51:04,934 --> 00:51:07,936
And as always, you can find me, myself, Bryant.

647
00:51:08,216 --> 00:51:09,517
I'm on Twitter at rbryant2012.

648
00:51:10,517 --> 00:51:15,300
And you can also find my writing frequently on Gamasutra,

649
00:51:16,721 --> 00:51:19,243
the website about the art and business of making video games.

650
00:51:19,912 --> 00:51:26,953
With that, looks like questions from chat have not quite piled in, but we're gonna go out on one final question for each of you here.

651
00:51:27,154 --> 00:51:36,116
I really like the story that we have here of a student game that went from class project to, you know, kind of thesis, all the way to commercial success.

652
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,816
So, first Matteo, then Hervé.

653
00:51:38,517 --> 00:51:42,938
If you had another student in front of you working on a project of similar scope...

654
00:51:44,131 --> 00:51:48,553
What is something you would want them to hear based on your experience on this?

655
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:54,657
Go feel free to make it as optimistic or as cynical as you like, but you know you get you've got a student

656
00:51:54,677 --> 00:51:56,678
There's probably you know student display. Oh wait

657
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:03,799
Kenza Koya is actually kind of summing up the energy of the question, which is

658
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:06,580
how do you manage going directly from school to the professional world?

659
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,760
So we're going to throw my question out the window because I don't care about my questions.

660
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,161
I'm useless. We're going to go with Kenza Koya's question. For each of you,

661
00:52:14,241 --> 00:52:19,982
I'd like to know from each of you, how do you manage going directly from school to the professional world?

662
00:52:20,022 --> 00:52:22,683
Mateo, I've got you on screen first, so I'm going to command you first.

663
00:52:22,843 --> 00:52:25,783
I'm going for it. Thank you, Kenza.

664
00:52:28,255 --> 00:52:29,195
This was...

665
00:52:32,398 --> 00:52:34,420
I'm gonna be pessimistic. Can I?

666
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,921
You can be pessimistic.

667
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:38,163
Pessimism is...

668
00:52:38,683 --> 00:52:40,264
You have to...

669
00:52:42,846 --> 00:52:44,467
You have to respect the luck.

670
00:52:44,948 --> 00:52:46,889
And this is one of the

671
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,911
rules of what we...

672
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:50,552
We are very

673
00:52:50,892 --> 00:52:52,374
lucky to have met

674
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:54,235
Hervé

675
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:56,016
through this jury and I...

676
00:52:57,125 --> 00:53:00,648
I know this will be difficult to hear, but I want to...

677
00:53:01,188 --> 00:53:03,550
people who are working and starting...

678
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:07,432
and leaving school soon or already left,

679
00:53:08,613 --> 00:53:12,976
we are very lucky to have all these people that have accepted to trust us

680
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,337
and to work with us.

681
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:16,859
And even if we...

682
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,982
you can meet the good people

683
00:53:22,022 --> 00:53:24,204
and you can have them to help you to move to...

684
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,872
something more professional and something more strong.

685
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:30,075
You have to respect the luck.

686
00:53:30,095 --> 00:53:32,037
So you have to work hard.

687
00:53:32,317 --> 00:53:38,803
You have to understand that maybe not everything will work in the beginning

688
00:53:38,863 --> 00:53:44,488
of your career and of your experience with video games.

689
00:53:44,928 --> 00:53:49,633
You have to be patient and you have to respect and seize opportunities

690
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:50,553
when they show up.

691
00:53:51,014 --> 00:53:51,494
This is.

692
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:59,192
what we did when we were at school and this is what we thought, okay, maybe it's too much,

693
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:00,776
maybe it's too difficult, maybe...

694
00:54:01,256 --> 00:54:07,539
It's hard, maybe. It was! I'm not gonna lie. It was hard, it was difficult, and it still is,

695
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:14,221
because we are facing now the public, and this is something that may be difficult for some people,

696
00:54:14,682 --> 00:54:22,785
and for me too. And it was difficult, but it's kind, it's worth it, it's worth it. So,

697
00:54:23,285 --> 00:54:28,287
if you want to take a risk, make sure the people you talk with is...

698
00:54:30,416 --> 00:54:36,061
work for your trust and if they trust you and you want to work with them this is the opportunity.

699
00:54:36,402 --> 00:54:45,150
Say yes to risk and accept that it's risky, accept that it's difficult but this is how things work

700
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:50,635
here I think. Hervé and now I will throw the question to you which just for repeating which

701
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:53,558
was how do you manage going directly from school to the professional world?

702
00:54:54,939 --> 00:55:02,233
I think I agree with Mateo, it's some kind of luck, but as you know, you can have a little

703
00:55:02,273 --> 00:55:05,860
influence on luck by showing yourself on the best way.

704
00:55:08,035 --> 00:55:11,637
What's important is that people should be confident and be resilient.

705
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:16,180
What interests me as an investor, for example, is something I cannot do myself.

706
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,200
Something different.

707
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,021
Something I have not seen.

708
00:55:19,201 --> 00:55:20,322
It's much riskier.

709
00:55:20,382 --> 00:55:21,803
It's more difficult to convince people.

710
00:55:22,183 --> 00:55:26,746
And even when we started Dota, it was a long, long, long time before we started this huge

711
00:55:26,766 --> 00:55:27,166
company.

712
00:55:27,466 --> 00:55:28,687
It was difficult.

713
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:32,269
People were confident because we bring something they have not seen elsewhere.

714
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,951
I don't say you must be a rock star.

715
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,054
Try to act as a rock star. You are right.

716
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:43,497
And if you don't find anyone who believes in you, it's perhaps that you are wrong.

717
00:55:43,878 --> 00:55:45,599
But if you don't try, you will never know.

718
00:55:45,899 --> 00:55:51,344
So you have to try first, and then luck comes with trying, showing what you are doing,

719
00:55:51,684 --> 00:55:56,808
whatever it is. And so try to bring difference, something new, fresh.

720
00:55:57,709 --> 00:56:00,731
Even if people say you should do this and that,

721
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:05,869
If you don't agree, don't say I will do this and that. I think that's one of the key.

722
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:14,944
I think the greatest student project and greatest indie project are projects that are different and that nobody believes in first.

723
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:19,012
And then, okay, there is huge, big success.

724
00:56:19,312 --> 00:56:24,154
And they're always coming from outside, outside of anybody's mind.

725
00:56:24,754 --> 00:56:27,455
And so if you want to be a student and go to video games,

726
00:56:27,475 --> 00:56:29,056
so you have to take risks first.

727
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,556
And you can take another path,

728
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,677
is that going to be more senior,

729
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:35,738
exert yourself in other companies,

730
00:56:35,778 --> 00:56:37,078
it's a wiser way.

731
00:56:37,658 --> 00:56:42,759
Because when you are a student, sometimes you also have to pay for your studies,

732
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:45,620
and so it's not easy to start a company at the same time.

733
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,800
So there is a very different way, but believe in your luck.

734
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:53,421
But to believe in luck is because you work and do things different.

735
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:55,862
And also, help people who have great ideas.

736
00:56:56,142 --> 00:57:02,163
It's not easy to have good and great ideas, so help people who are about to have ideas.

737
00:57:02,943 --> 00:57:05,403
Don't be too pretentious, also.

738
00:57:06,692 --> 00:57:10,274
Right on. Well, uh, Mateo and Hervé, thank you so much for joining me.

739
00:57:10,334 --> 00:57:15,797
For everyone in chat, y'all came up with some good questions right at the end, but unfortunately our time is running out.

740
00:57:16,817 --> 00:57:21,139
Nameless13 has a Twitter account, uh, at underscore nameless underscore thirteen.

741
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,580
Or maybe there's another underscore in there.

742
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:23,220
Um...

743
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,222
Oh, Vernon, thanks so much. Yeah, we're so glad we can do these kind of Q&A streams.

744
00:57:28,262 --> 00:57:32,443
And I'm glad y'all like the game. This is a super neat thing. I was super excited to play it myself.

745
00:57:33,423 --> 00:57:38,305
And to Hervé and Matteo, thank you so much for bringing this. This is a neat game.

746
00:57:39,025 --> 00:57:43,146
The story inside the game is neat, and the story of how it was made is also neat.

747
00:57:43,486 --> 00:57:47,767
So with that, I'm going to sign off, and I hope everyone has a very good Thursday. Bye.

748
00:57:47,787 --> 00:57:49,448
Bye. Thank you.

749
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:51,408
Thank you very much.
