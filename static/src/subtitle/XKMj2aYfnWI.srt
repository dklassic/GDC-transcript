1
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:07,804
Yeah, we're gonna talk about AR today.

2
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:11,405
The talk says the state of AR and the future.

3
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:13,887
And I have a confession to make.

4
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:16,828
I don't actually believe in predicting the future.

5
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:19,069
I think it's kinda hard to do.

6
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:21,410
But I am a big fan of a quote by Alan Kay,

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,932
which is the best way to predict the future is to invent it.

8
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,248
or to build it.

9
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:30,890
And so, I think what we're gonna do today is,

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,973
we're gonna talk a little bit about our learnings

11
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:37,796
at Niantic, having launched some AR products

12
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:40,138
and run them over the past couple of years.

13
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:43,161
And then, I'm gonna share some about our thoughts

14
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:45,363
about stuff that's under development right now.

15
00:00:45,363 --> 00:00:47,124
So, stage one's looking back,

16
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:49,326
stage two's about what tech is getting built

17
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:50,407
and the importance of that tech.

18
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:55,171
And then stage three of the talk is going to be about what we think the implications

19
00:00:55,171 --> 00:01:00,214
of that technology are for the kinds of products that we can build, whether they're games,

20
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:01,715
game developers in the room?

21
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:03,596
Fair number.

22
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:03,857
Good.

23
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:04,837
So we're talking about games.

24
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:06,919
We're talking about non-game applications as well.

25
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:12,631
So looking backwards, let's start with just a little bit about Niantic.

26
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:17,195
I know some people know us as the company that made Pokemon Go or the company that spun

27
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:22,919
out of Google, which is cool, that's what we are, but we're our own thing too, and the

28
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:28,944
thing that we're kind of proud about is not in a chess-beady way, but proud of is why

29
00:01:28,944 --> 00:01:30,005
we're doing what we're doing.

30
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:34,108
And so I want to give you some insight into why we're building these products.

31
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:42,056
These things never really work when they're supposed to work.

32
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:42,977
I can push this button.

33
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,501
So why do we do this stuff?

34
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:50,706
So the journey actually started quite a ways back for us.

35
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:53,470
There's kind of a through line that connects.

36
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:59,143
So, for me, it started when I was a kid, actually.

37
00:01:59,143 --> 00:02:02,645
I grew up in a small town, there wasn't a lot to do there.

38
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:05,648
But at one point, somebody came and they dropped off

39
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:10,131
grocery bags full of old National Geographic magazines.

40
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,793
And for me, I fell in love with the maps

41
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:14,174
that you could pull out.

42
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:16,676
Like, I can still see the one at the Nile Delta

43
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:19,177
and all of the kingdoms, just amazing stuff.

44
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:20,458
So I spent hours with those maps.

45
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,980
A few years later, I saved up my money for mowing lawns

46
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,741
and bought a computer.

47
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:27,095
And so that's kind of my whole story right there.

48
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:29,556
Like a bunch of National Geographic maps and a computer

49
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,277
and basic and no money to buy any software.

50
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,939
So then things happen.

51
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:35,880
But that led me through a series of events

52
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,061
to meet some really cool people,

53
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:39,322
including a guy named Phil Kesslin.

54
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:41,723
Phil is the CTO of Niantic.

55
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:43,904
Back then, Phil was an engineer that I met

56
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:46,165
out of Silicon Graphics.

57
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,787
And we and some colleagues,

58
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:51,048
Shikai, Owazama, Avi Barzev, Mark Aubin,

59
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:54,030
Michael Jones, Brian McClendon.

60
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,612
We founded a company, the company was called Keyhole.

61
00:02:56,612 --> 00:02:59,413
It's a small company, we didn't have a ton of resources,

62
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:03,076
but we had kind of an audacious vision,

63
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:06,838
an especially audacious vision for a company that size.

64
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:11,401
We wanted to take 3D technology, new digital satellite

65
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,642
imaging technology, and broadband,

66
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:15,183
and make a map of the world.

67
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:17,485
unlike any map that had been made before.

68
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:20,548
A map of unprecedented level of detail

69
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:23,130
built on imagery for the entire planet.

70
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,671
So we got started with that.

71
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,594
We actually were acquired by Google along the way.

72
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:29,956
And with help from a bunch of other talented people

73
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:33,198
inside of Google, Brett Taylor, Jim Norris.

74
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,402
Andrew Kirmsey, to name a few,

75
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:38,324
but actually a very large team.

76
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:41,207
We were able ultimately to realize that vision,

77
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:44,751
to build a map, and really to put the whole world

78
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:46,513
on your desktop initially.

79
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:50,237
And then later we brought it to the palm of your hand

80
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:53,600
when we brought it to iOS, brought it to the iPhone,

81
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,521
and brought it to Android.

82
00:03:56,176 --> 00:03:57,837
So after we built the map, at that point,

83
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,937
there were thousands of mashup sites,

84
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:02,759
people doing all kinds of crazy things with maps.

85
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,019
And so we started thinking about,

86
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,840
well, what can you do with a substrate that we've created,

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,401
this geographic substrate of the world?

88
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:11,042
And we also got interested in the kinds of devices

89
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,143
that people were tinkering with that

90
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:15,724
look like they might come after the cell phone.

91
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:16,844
They might be that next.

92
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:18,385
thing that would come.

93
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:20,866
There were early versions of wearables,

94
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:24,608
watch-type devices, people were playing around with HMDs,

95
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:26,890
different kinds of AR glasses.

96
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,432
And so the thinking was, okay, maps, location,

97
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:32,893
information, the real world,

98
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:36,995
these things probably combine in some interesting way.

99
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:40,017
I got interested in part because I became a parent,

100
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:40,717
I had kids.

101
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:43,386
And you know, when you become a parent, it's like,

102
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:45,067
it's your chance to do everything over again.

103
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,028
It's great, it's like you reset.

104
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:49,289
And so I was thinking about all the places I wanted to go

105
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,891
and explore with my kids.

106
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,392
So we started Niantic with kind of those themes in mind,

107
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:57,494
like let's see what happens with maps and location,

108
00:04:57,494 --> 00:05:00,755
wearable technology, to build stuff that brings

109
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:03,176
those worlds together, the digital world

110
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,237
and the physical world.

111
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:06,782
So we built some products.

112
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:09,328
By the time we spun out of Google,

113
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:10,872
Pokemon Go was in development.

114
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:13,458
And we had a pretty clear notion at that point in time.

115
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,910
of kind of what our value would be.

116
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,533
The things that we wanted to, I mean with software,

117
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,875
you guys know how it is, like you can build anything.

118
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,136
You know, sometimes the hardest thing is to decide

119
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:24,237
what you actually want to build.

120
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:26,619
So we said, well let's put some parameters

121
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:29,941
around our efforts here to guide us in a particular direction.

122
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:33,244
And the ones that we came up with based on our experiments

123
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:35,625
and based on the early games that we pushed out

124
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,087
to users and beta tests and so on, were these.

125
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,068
It started with this idea of exploration.

126
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:42,770
So sort of the key thing that we settled on was,

127
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,471
you know,

128
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,845
In every neighborhood, there's probably a story that's interesting.

129
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:52,269
There's a mystery that can be built there, everywhere in the world.

130
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,233
So it was this idea of exploration.

131
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:59,759
The second thing we settled on was, you know, being computer people and spending a lot of

132
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,281
time at our desks.

133
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:04,364
you know, we realize that hey,

134
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,647
everybody needs a little nudge sometimes to go outside

135
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:10,489
and get their 10,000 steps in or get their daily workout in.

136
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:13,651
Maybe some of you have had a chance to check out our garden

137
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:15,393
over outside the Metreon.

138
00:06:15,393 --> 00:06:17,594
Good, if you get tired of sitting inside,

139
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:19,176
we've created a nice space for you out there.

140
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:27,804
And we heard back from some of the early users of our games from Ingress that people who didn't consider themselves athletes really appreciated that

141
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:33,309
gamified kind of nudge to to exercise. So we we adopted that as one of the three principles.

142
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,211
And then the third one was social.

143
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:41,337
So the other thing that you know and this really came from feedback not from originally from our own insight, but from what people

144
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,579
told us when they were using our products,

145
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:47,821
was that they loved the opportunity to meet new people

146
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:50,423
and have a thing to do together with their friends or family

147
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:52,344
or parents with their kids outside,

148
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:54,366
like an activity that people could do together.

149
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:56,527
Just lots of love, lots of fan mail,

150
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:58,529
lots of positive reinforcement around that.

151
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,710
So we adopted that as the third principle.

152
00:07:01,677 --> 00:07:03,298
So this is sort of guiding us.

153
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,540
We track our progress, I mean just to give you a sense

154
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,602
of scale of how this is going.

155
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:09,923
We measure various things.

156
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:11,584
In terms of the exploration piece,

157
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:13,765
we measure the total number of places

158
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:16,787
that have been observed as special, unique places

159
00:07:16,787 --> 00:07:18,668
in neighborhoods where people live

160
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:21,410
that people have photographed and named and described

161
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,312
and added into this global game board.

162
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:27,153
So that now numbers in the many millions.

163
00:07:27,153 --> 00:07:29,575
We've opened up that submission process in Pokemon Go,

164
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:29,815
so it's.

165
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:33,823
growing rapidly worldwide.

166
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:36,608
So this idea of stitching together a global game board,

167
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,752
a place that we can play out of all the interesting nooks

168
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:41,477
and crannies in the world, is going pretty well.

169
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:45,991
On the exercise front, this one is just,

170
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:47,031
you know, it blows us away.

171
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:48,612
We check this number, it's like bigger

172
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:49,772
every time we check it.

173
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:52,614
It's currently three billion total kilometers walked.

174
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:55,055
And it's interesting.

175
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:59,657
I know here at GDC, maybe four years ago, five years ago,

176
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:03,179
there was a speaker talking about some of the early efforts

177
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:05,180
to do outdoor games.

178
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,921
And the conclusion of the talk was,

179
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,461
hey, people aren't gonna go outside and play.

180
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:09,222
Give up.

181
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,223
Gamers wanna stay seated in their couch.

182
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:14,940
And I don't know if it was just timing or the evolution

183
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,241
of the technology or that right combination of gameplay

184
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:19,823
and design and tech, but that's not true.

185
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,824
Like people like to go outside

186
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:24,826
and they really enjoy that part of the experience.

187
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:33,367
In terms of social we measured in 2 ways, we measure it in terms of like the formal connections that people form in the game.

188
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:44,315
We added the friend feature in Pokemon Go last year so you can identify your friends, you can exchange gifts with those friends, you get bonuses for playing together in raids.

189
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:49,298
So now there are over 190 million friend connections, so lots of activity there.

190
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:52,320
And we also measured in terms of the events that we hold.

191
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,925
Has anybody been to a GoFest event or a Pokemon Go community day?

192
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:00,107
Okay, decent number.

193
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:05,452
So if you haven't been to one, these events look a little bit like music festival,

194
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:09,796
if you've been to like Outside Lands or Lollapalooza or something like that.

195
00:09:10,312 --> 00:09:14,215
maybe combined with like a healthy dose of comic on with a little bit of 5 K if

196
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:19,879
you can like combine all those ideas. Um, so people coming, uh,

197
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,641
really fully, you know, into the game,

198
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:25,564
living out their fantasy of being a Pokemon trainer or.

199
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:29,127
part of that world, and families will come together,

200
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:31,589
groups travel from across the country,

201
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:34,171
carpooling together, people travel

202
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:34,951
from continent to continent.

203
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:38,154
So really neat, these have been very successful for us.

204
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:40,696
Last year we had three million people in total

205
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:43,378
come to these events, and single day attendance.

206
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:45,220
At a single event, we've had events

207
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,840
with over 100,000 people.

208
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,642
So this idea that games can be part of that

209
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:53,066
festival-like outdoor world is very much true.

210
00:09:55,189 --> 00:10:02,455
So just in terms of catching up and looking back retrospectively, a lot of people know

211
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:07,981
us as a company that helped to pioneer this idea of consumer AR.

212
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:11,804
The first game we launched was Ingress back in 2012.

213
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:16,027
Going very well. It's played in a bunch of countries. I think 175 countries around the world.

214
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:19,868
We've held hundreds of the events of the kind I was describing.

215
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:22,289
We were doing it with Ingress before Pokémon Go.

216
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,151
We launched a new version of it last year, Ingress Prime.

217
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,532
And this was our learning place.

218
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:31,594
This is where a lot of the feedback that's informed our later work came from.

219
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:34,515
Pokémon Go continues to set records in terms of...

220
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:41,679
users, revenue, it's now over a billion installs in total,

221
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,665
over two billion dollars in total revenue,

222
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:50,751
and a really awesome, amazing global community.

223
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,814
And we're continuing to obviously invest.

224
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:54,115
heavily in that product.

225
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:58,237
We recently rolled out our AR photo feature in Pokemon Go.

226
00:10:58,237 --> 00:10:59,878
I don't know if anybody's tried that.

227
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:04,521
It was the third version of AR in the game.

228
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:06,082
So the very first version of Pokemon Go

229
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,523
had a really crude implementation of AR.

230
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:10,664
We did AR+, about a year and a half later.

231
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:15,167
And then this is our third iteration

232
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:18,028
of figuring out how is the best way to actually utilize AR

233
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:20,650
in a helpful and fun way within a game.

234
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:28,755
So, check it out if you're kind of looking to understand our thinking about this at the moment.

235
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,916
Next up for us is Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.

236
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,218
Hopefully there are some Harry Potter fans out there.

237
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:37,299
So, this will come later this year.

238
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:41,021
I will play a short trailer for you.

239
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:51,878
Immobility!

240
00:11:51,878 --> 00:12:17,237
I don't know about you, but when I hear that music, I'm ready to play the game.

241
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,111
I love the world of Harry Potter.

242
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:23,313
My kids grew up with it, reading the books.

243
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:25,774
I read them aloud to all, I have three kids,

244
00:12:25,774 --> 00:12:28,095
to all three of them at this point.

245
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,856
So we're excited about this product.

246
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:32,257
We just gave a first look to the press a few weeks ago,

247
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:34,999
released some of the first screenshots

248
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:37,160
and video of gameplay.

249
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,922
So we're looking to this as a platform

250
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:43,283
to evolve our work around real world

251
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:44,484
and around augmented reality.

252
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:49,111
A lot of people talk about AR and AR games, by the way,

253
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:50,572
and we really prefer the term real world

254
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:55,014
because we think it's that fusion of the digital

255
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:58,416
and the real world that's the interesting part of it.

256
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,617
And AR, sometimes people think AR and it's that technology

257
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:02,699
of seeing something through a viewfinder,

258
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,520
which is certainly part of what I think of

259
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,462
as the full breadth of augmented reality,

260
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:09,243
but that's not all of it.

261
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:11,404
It's really about how you integrate that

262
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,705
with the physical world.

263
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:16,644
Okay, so behind these games is a platform.

264
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:19,665
And this is the set of tech that drives the games.

265
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,167
It's evolved with each of these products.

266
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,307
We actually have several projects under development

267
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:25,648
that have not yet been announced

268
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:27,309
that are built on the same technology stack.

269
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,070
At present, we have as many people working

270
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,391
on the platform technology as on Pokemon Go itself.

271
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:35,732
So there's a robust effort to mature this and productize it.

272
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:45,355
This tech is the part of the system that does the heavy lifting so that we can all play in a single game instance.

273
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:48,476
So if any of you played World of Warcraft like I did back in the day,

274
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:54,138
of course we had to pick what server to join when we wanted to join a massively multiplayer game.

275
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:58,639
The innovation here is that this system holds state for all users in a single...

276
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,902
instance, if you will, of the game.

277
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:05,626
It's, of course, striped across tens of thousands of servers,

278
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:07,228
but you don't have to think about that as a player.

279
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:11,252
This system also supports all the social features that I've talked about,

280
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:13,955
all the mapping, all the location,

281
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:15,577
information that's integrated into that,

282
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:20,262
really all the support that you need to develop and publish a game like this.

283
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:22,203
And of course, advanced AR.

284
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:25,085
And we're gonna spend maybe the rest of the talk

285
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:26,266
talking about the advanced AR part.

286
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:30,288
That gives you a common layer between

287
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:31,169
ARKit and ARCore,

288
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:34,851
and also provides a way for us to extend that functionality

289
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:37,612
with cloud-based AR capability.

290
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:40,734
And that's where a lot of our R&D is going.

291
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:44,859
We do have a developer contest that's open right now,

292
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:47,382
the Niantic Beyond Reality Contest.

293
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:51,406
There are a million dollars in prizes for that contest.

294
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:53,148
It's open for submissions until the end of the month.

295
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:56,953
There'll be a sort of game jam session through the summer

296
00:14:56,953 --> 00:14:59,436
where we'll be working with the finalists.

297
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:01,038
And we've set aside.

298
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:04,272
actually several tens of millions of dollars to fund,

299
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:07,314
hopefully some projects that emerge out of that,

300
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:09,334
beyond the prize money, and also other projects

301
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:11,235
that we'll identify next year.

302
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:13,656
So something to check out if you're interested

303
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:16,598
in building products like this.

304
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:18,378
Why do we want to see more games like this?

305
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:22,240
One of the reasons that we do our events like this,

306
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,142
so I talked about our Niantic-hosted events.

307
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:27,242
Within that are a subset of things

308
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:29,003
that we do with civic organizations.

309
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,243
So we think about technology.

310
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:34,226
There's a lot of bad press about tech right now.

311
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,566
I think that tech can actually have

312
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:37,007
a very positive impact on the world,

313
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:38,909
and this is one example of that.

314
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,410
We partnered with the Knight Foundation.

315
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,292
They do a lot of work in cities that are distressed,

316
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,633
that are trying to rebuild,

317
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,574
that have serious economic and social problems.

318
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,956
And one of the ways they do that is they host festivals

319
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:52,399
to get people into the city and just walking the streets,

320
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,063
meeting their neighbors, rediscovering what's there.

321
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:59,426
So, Soclavia in Los Angeles is an example of that.

322
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,789
The Philly Free Streets Initiative is another.

323
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:05,051
There's a UK org that we work with

324
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,913
which is independent of the Knight Foundation.

325
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:11,477
called Big Heritage and they're devoted to teaching history to kids

326
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:14,979
by having these big festival style events, families come together

327
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:18,422
and then they learn about the history of the town

328
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:22,986
in this really fun interactive way. So in all these cases we're overlaying gameplay.

329
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:26,126
onto an existing kind of civic festival,

330
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:27,907
dramatically increasing their attendance

331
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:29,207
and drawing in an audience that wouldn't

332
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:31,087
otherwise probably attend.

333
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:33,348
So we want to see more events like this,

334
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:35,688
and that means opening up our platform

335
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:37,949
so that many people can build,

336
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:39,969
hopefully really fun experiences on top of it.

337
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:43,209
Okay, so what have we learned?

338
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,370
You know, this is the part where we share

339
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,470
some of our stubbed toes,

340
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,611
some of the mistakes that we've made.

341
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:56,397
You know, the first one is really a message of encouragement

342
00:16:56,397 --> 00:17:01,988
about the potential to build games that are broadly inclusive

343
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,130
and broadly appealing.

344
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:08,813
Whenever I first started investigating the idea of us doing a game,

345
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:12,538
I was doing my research and people talked about casual games and mid-core games.

346
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:17,804
And casual games had a certain look and feel, they attracted a certain audience,

347
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,646
they had strengths and weaknesses.

348
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:23,131
Mid-core games were for real gamers and they had a completely separate dynamic to them.

349
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:27,575
And then there are hardcore games or like the real serious console games.

350
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:31,619
We didn't want to put ourselves into a single category.

351
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:38,305
We wanted to build something that was broadly appealing, but we had ambitions around retention.

352
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:40,728
We wanted it to be financially successful.

353
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,269
And so this was a risky shot for us.

354
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:48,470
And what I'm reporting back to you is that it is possible

355
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,912
to build this kind of game, and I don't think it fits

356
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:54,512
an existing category, I wanna call them accessible games.

357
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:57,173
You know, games that are gonna appeal to males, females,

358
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:58,674
people from all walks of life,

359
00:17:58,674 --> 00:18:00,314
multiple demographics and age groups.

360
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,256
With Go today, based on third party research,

361
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:06,518
polls that have been done,

362
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,579
we see more than 40% of the players are women.

363
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,801
We see underrepresented minorities in excess of 30%,

364
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,182
which is great.

365
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:18,664
That begins to approach what the world looks like

366
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,905
in terms of those distributions.

367
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:21,686
So gamers, not a subset of the world,

368
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:25,028
gamers are just, they look like everybody else.

369
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:31,397
And we've seen very good long-term retention,

370
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:32,757
good spend in terms of the revenue.

371
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:34,979
So it's possible to build broad games that

372
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:38,281
keep people for a long period of time playing very intensively.

373
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:42,203
So mid-core, casual, there's something in between, I think.

374
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:47,652
So AR, I want to tackle this head on,

375
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:50,634
because I know you guys, many people are probably curious

376
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:52,335
about AR, many people are thinking about starting

377
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:58,640
AR projects, and we've had some learnings here, right?

378
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,884
AR in and of itself is not a magic bullet for a hit game.

379
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:05,825
There are some real drawbacks to it.

380
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:10,989
The ergonomics are one of them.

381
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:11,750
We know that...

382
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:15,382
Oops.

383
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:18,765
We know that people really don't like to hold up their

384
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:20,386
phones for long periods of time.

385
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:24,950
We think the right session length for holding up your phone

386
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,832
is not more than two to three minutes, for example.

387
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,214
So if you think about AR, you wanna think about it

388
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:33,016
as a type of play that happens within a broader game

389
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:37,280
where a lot of the gameplay is not happening in AR mode.

390
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,861
Social stigma.

391
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,921
So when you hold up your phone and you wave it around,

392
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:44,022
it looks like you might be taking a picture

393
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:46,362
of everybody who's standing around you.

394
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:49,403
This is a big drawback to AR in certain situations

395
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:51,603
and is something that really needs to be designed around.

396
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:54,324
The other thing is just efficiency.

397
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:55,564
And by that, I mean two things.

398
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:58,305
Device efficiency, so there's a power drain

399
00:19:58,305 --> 00:19:59,425
that one has to take into account.

400
00:19:59,425 --> 00:20:03,026
And there's also just gameplay, game loop efficiency.

401
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,807
If people are power leveling through a game.

402
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:08,422
they're not maybe happy to take that extra time it takes

403
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:12,623
to instantiate an AR session and play in that way.

404
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:15,784
So, short sessions and really thoughtful design.

405
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:18,765
We think the right approach here is to design things

406
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:22,185
for AR that really can't be done outside of AR.

407
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:26,186
So to try to think of game mechanics where you're

408
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:27,827
in AR mode and it's obvious why you're there,

409
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,447
you're having an experience that you can really

410
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:32,028
only realize through AR.

411
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:39,238
The other thing that I want to sort of flag here is you hear a lot of hype in the industry

412
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:44,384
about augmented reality. You hear it from large tech companies other than us, like the really,

413
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:49,370
really big tech companies. You hear us talking about AR. It's important to understand that

414
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,275
sometimes when we talk about it, and certainly when some of the other companies talk about it,

415
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:56,630
Really talking about the potential for AR in devices

416
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,072
that are going to come after the phone.

417
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:03,876
So there are inherent limitations to AR in phones.

418
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,798
I, for one, don't believe that AR

419
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,679
is going to take over the phone and everybody's just

420
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,180
going to walk around in AR mode all the time.

421
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,023
That's definitely not going to happen.

422
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,725
But I do believe there's huge potential.

423
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:16,226
I believe that potential is going

424
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:17,947
to come in future devices.

425
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:21,269
Having said that, there's huge incentive for all of us

426
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:24,231
to try to learn about AR, to learn what works and doesn't

427
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:28,054
work, to evolve the technology on mobile devices today.

428
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:31,656
So a lot of the interest you see from other tech companies

429
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:34,478
that I won't name by name and us is

430
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:37,360
trying to figure out this technology

431
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,182
and advance it and evolve it while this other kind

432
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:41,843
of hardware is being developed.

433
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:46,697
So, what's the killer feature for a real world AR game?

434
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:49,019
You know, some people ask that of us a lot,

435
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:50,660
and I don't think it's the AR.

436
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,224
I think AR is nice embellishment on top.

437
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:55,685
It's the icing on the cake.

438
00:21:55,685 --> 00:22:00,089
The things that we think are really the killer features

439
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:02,011
for games of this type are the ones that we adopted

440
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:02,811
as our core principles.

441
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:04,753
That's why we adopted them.

442
00:22:04,753 --> 00:22:06,915
But it is exploration, exercise,

443
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:08,256
and real world social interactions.

444
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,800
In terms of the, you know, I said earlier we had 3 million people come to events that we host.

445
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,821
Pokemon Go players organize their own event once a month,

446
00:22:17,821 --> 00:22:19,102
it's called Community Day.

447
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:21,163
We support it with a little live ops programming

448
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:22,324
behind the scenes.

449
00:22:22,324 --> 00:22:24,025
But there were over 100 million players

450
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:26,967
that participated in Community Day last year.

451
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:30,950
So intense interest in people getting together in real life.

452
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,453
And we think there are reasons behind the exercise

453
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:38,115
and the real world social that are pretty obvious.

454
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:41,117
Both of those things make people feel better, ultimately.

455
00:22:41,117 --> 00:22:43,979
So there's a feedback loop there that's driving that.

456
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,571
Okay, so that's the past, all right?

457
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:51,231
Now it's time to look towards the future.

458
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:55,133
So what is the interesting technology that we're working on

459
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,834
and other people are working on with AR?

460
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,994
We're gonna get into the meat of that.

461
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:03,536
So the way I like to characterize it

462
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:05,817
is connecting the atoms and the bits.

463
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:10,318
So if AR sort of V1 is open your phone,

464
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:11,138
see a hologram,

465
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:15,204
Maybe it is sort of situated more or less accurately

466
00:23:15,204 --> 00:23:17,166
in space, it's glued to the ground.

467
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,588
It doesn't really know where it is.

468
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:21,429
It's not really part of the world.

469
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:22,970
It's sort of a parlor trick.

470
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,133
It's an illusion that's fun,

471
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:28,175
but there are limits to how far you can take that.

472
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:32,578
So ARv2 is about really connecting those bits,

473
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,500
the thing that we make in the computer

474
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,921
with the atoms of the world.

475
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:40,385
And having those objects be grounded in specific locations

476
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:42,947
being aware of those locations,

477
00:23:42,947 --> 00:23:44,209
being shareable, and being persistent.

478
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:47,091
So when we think about what's next,

479
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:52,316
there are three kind of key areas of technology development

480
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:55,039
that we think are essential to realize that vision

481
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,080
that I just described.

482
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,182
The first is mapping,

483
00:23:58,182 --> 00:24:00,684
and I'm gonna talk about each of these in more detail.

484
00:24:00,684 --> 00:24:03,347
The second is understanding or interpreting

485
00:24:03,347 --> 00:24:05,889
that flow of pixels that's coming into the device.

486
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:09,534
And the third is sharing, the ability for all of us

487
00:24:09,534 --> 00:24:12,115
to have a common, shared experience with AR.

488
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:15,456
None of these are really possible with today's technology.

489
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:18,717
So each of these three areas are new things

490
00:24:18,717 --> 00:24:21,618
that need to be invented.

491
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:23,538
So let me talk about mapping first.

492
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:24,659
I think this is,

493
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,119
this is the one that's near and dear to my heart.

494
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,740
It is a continuation in some ways of the work that we did.

495
00:24:31,484 --> 00:24:33,346
on Google Earth and Google Maps.

496
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,088
But it's really different in some ways as well,

497
00:24:35,088 --> 00:24:40,253
because we made Google Earth and Google Maps for all of you.

498
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:41,695
We made it for people.

499
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:44,698
It's designed to be a fun, friendly, accessible UI

500
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:48,141
for human beings so that we can never be lost again.

501
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:50,183
We can navigate wherever we want in the world.

502
00:24:50,183 --> 00:24:54,027
The AR maps that we're building are built for machines.

503
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:57,289
So it's a very different kind of map in some ways.

504
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,710
Now, I want to say, when you say we're building maps for machines, it sounds like Terminator

505
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,931
or something like that.

506
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:06,692
It's in the service of helping us be better human beings.

507
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:08,993
And that's a really important thing for Niantic.

508
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:12,774
I think you've seen some of our thinking around that.

509
00:25:12,774 --> 00:25:16,176
It's to allow us to better connect with the world and to have shared social experiences

510
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:16,736
with one another.

511
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:20,220
But fundamentally we're building these maps for computers,

512
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,423
and those computers are cell phones today,

513
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:26,247
those computers may be glasses in the future,

514
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:28,450
and by the way, they may be robots beyond that,

515
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,773
because robots that want to move around in the world

516
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:33,837
need that very same kind of precise localization.

517
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,739
So what the map does by accumulating data

518
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:40,219
is to allow the computer to know x, y,

519
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:42,760
latitude and longitude, exactly where it is in the world,

520
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,740
down to an order of centimeters.

521
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,801
That's what we need for AR,

522
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:49,202
preferably like single digit centimeters.

523
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:51,742
And we wanna know the 6DOF orientation.

524
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:55,323
So we wanna know exactly what that device is pointing at

525
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:58,224
so that we can interpret and add to that scene.

526
00:25:59,622 --> 00:26:01,765
So you sort of go into the next deeper level

527
00:26:01,765 --> 00:26:03,086
of what does that look like.

528
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:05,229
You know, it looks something like this.

529
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:06,890
So you start with lots of images.

530
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:11,109
in different ways those images might come into a system,

531
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:13,911
but from that you're gonna derive a very, very detailed

532
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:16,333
three-dimensional understanding of space.

533
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,355
And you have a bunch of points that almost looks like

534
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:22,238
a solid physical object, but that is a collection of data

535
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:26,241
that lets us understand a specific location.

536
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:29,203
Now you can glean from looking at this image,

537
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:32,606
this is a small statue, lots of photos, lots of points.

538
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:35,540
That's a lot of data.

539
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,442
I mean, you think about the entire world.

540
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:39,525
Like, think about all the places

541
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:42,588
that human beings can walk in the entire world.

542
00:26:42,588 --> 00:26:45,272
If we want AR to work out of the box

543
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,495
without having to remap, re-localize,

544
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:48,896
do a lot of work every time we wanna use it,

545
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:50,639
and I think this is really, really important.

546
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,625
this map's gotta be created, okay?

547
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:58,691
And point number two is that at this scale,

548
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:00,514
the world is not static.

549
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:03,219
Like, stuff changes all the time.

550
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:05,042
It's incredibly dynamic.

551
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,604
So this is the kind of map that...

552
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,733
It's probably a map that never gets finished, really.

553
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,594
This is like a lawn that you mow,

554
00:27:11,594 --> 00:27:13,895
where as soon as you get done on one side,

555
00:27:13,895 --> 00:27:15,716
you start over on the other side.

556
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:20,179
It has to be continually rebuilt and refreshed and extended.

557
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,720
So in our view, we think this kind of thing

558
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,482
can really only be built in a cooperative way

559
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:26,783
by people that are using a system.

560
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:29,384
So a collaborative, ongoing effort

561
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:31,245
to constantly map and remap the world.

562
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:39,651
In terms of a more concrete example of a system working that uses this technique, I'll show

563
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:44,612
you an example of a system from our research team.

564
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:48,854
And this will show you that evolution from photos to points to putting holograms into

565
00:27:48,854 --> 00:27:49,434
the world.

566
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:56,316
So this is the Ferry Building in downtown SF.

567
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:58,437
Maybe you'll have a chance to visit if you're from out of town.

568
00:27:58,437 --> 00:27:59,317
Really cool place.

569
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:03,016
So lots of photos are needed.

570
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:06,017
From that, we get what you might think of as a point cloud.

571
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,178
The points that you pick are really important.

572
00:28:08,178 --> 00:28:10,518
Once we have that, we're able to put things

573
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:12,199
into the environment.

574
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:17,600
And importantly, because it's in the cloud,

575
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,020
you can come back the next day

576
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,621
and see things in exactly the same location

577
00:28:21,621 --> 00:28:23,041
as you saw them on the first day.

578
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:28,223
With this technique, we can put holograms in place

579
00:28:28,223 --> 00:28:30,543
over very large areas, indoors and outdoors.

580
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:35,161
And finally, everybody who's having the AR experience

581
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:37,143
is seeing the same thing.

582
00:28:37,143 --> 00:28:40,145
So it's really as if the hologram's part of the world

583
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:43,829
and not this sort of manifestation that you've created.

584
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,732
Okay, so that's mapping.

585
00:28:46,732 --> 00:28:48,734
The second piece is understanding.

586
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:52,817
So, point cloud, there's a bunch of points.

587
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:55,379
If we want our games, our characters,

588
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:57,601
the story that we're telling,

589
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:01,264
to interact with the world in a meaningful way,

590
00:29:01,264 --> 00:29:02,385
we have to imbue the system

591
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:04,266
with a little bit of intelligence

592
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:07,829
to know what's happening, what objects are in the scene,

593
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,232
what are all of those pixels, what are all of those points.

594
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:17,372
So that falls into an area that some people call segmentation.

595
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:22,377
We're talking about various techniques and there are multiple techniques I'm going to show you too

596
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:30,146
involving deep learning, neural networks, to essentially decipher what we're looking at.

597
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:31,828
And that opens up all kinds of possibilities.

598
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:36,052
So we would think about a vocabulary for AR.

599
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:40,814
In this case, if I wanna put a vase on the table,

600
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:43,155
and I wanna put Pikachu in the chair where he belongs,

601
00:29:43,155 --> 00:29:46,057
which is the point cloud, you can't really do that.

602
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:46,957
You don't know what it is.

603
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:48,738
You know the shapes, you can put something

604
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:51,099
on top of something or hide it behind something,

605
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:52,359
but you can't really do things

606
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,520
that are semantically interesting.

607
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,882
So what neural networks enable us to do are,

608
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:00,683
they enable us to segment a scene like this.

609
00:30:00,803 --> 00:30:03,525
and this is a real screenshot by the way,

610
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:05,587
this is a made up artistic creation,

611
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:07,769
it lets us identify what's in that scene

612
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:10,071
with a pretty high degree of probability.

613
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:11,912
So we know at a high confidence level

614
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:14,414
that that's a monitor, we know that's a chair,

615
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:16,316
we know that's a table, and so on.

616
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:18,838
So we can actually then respond to that

617
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:22,321
and we can put Pikachu in the chair and a Voss on the table.

618
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:31,188
Even more importantly, we can put Comby with our flowers in the garden and we can put Psyduck

619
00:30:31,188 --> 00:30:32,729
with his duck friends in the pond.

620
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:40,430
So that's one type of ML that can be applied to AR that I think for us, for game developers,

621
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,970
people want to tell stories, is really important.

622
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,011
This is another type.

623
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:49,972
So I talked about mapping the world and how hard that would be with all the stuff that

624
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:50,352
changes.

625
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:54,814
Some things actually change second by second.

626
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:58,616
So the idea of mapping them in advance is a non sequitur.

627
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:00,717
People walking down the street,

628
00:31:00,717 --> 00:31:01,698
cars driving down the street,

629
00:31:01,698 --> 00:31:02,558
you don't create a map of that.

630
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:05,520
So that's something that you actually have to understand

631
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,661
in real time if you want to augment the world

632
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:09,322
in a way that's realistic.

633
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:14,124
So this is another piece of work that we're doing.

634
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,446
And this is deep learning.

635
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:24,532
solution that basically can provide the depth of all the pixels in a scene in real time.

636
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:32,378
So rather than mapping in advance everything that's happening here, we're deciphering depth

637
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:38,543
in frankly a dark, kind of a dark and mysterious way in terms of how these neural networks

638
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:39,423
work.

639
00:31:39,423 --> 00:31:43,166
But we can understand the depth of people as they walk around in cars.

640
00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:47,529
So, that nicely complements the map piece.

641
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:50,131
So you can build a map of all the permanent structures,

642
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:51,231
the stuff that doesn't change,

643
00:31:51,231 --> 00:31:53,453
and then for the really dynamic stuff,

644
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,514
with people moving around and cars moving around,

645
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,755
you can add this capability.

646
00:31:57,755 --> 00:32:00,357
And it really is quite amazing to me,

647
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:03,859
as somebody that's worked around computers for 25 years,

648
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,360
that this kind of thing is even possible.

649
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,663
But it is. The rate of change here is phenomenal.

650
00:32:08,663 --> 00:32:13,608
That allows us to sort of fix AR in a way that it's really broken today.

651
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,670
So if you've used our products or others,

652
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,793
you will know that if you drop your Pikachu for photo mode

653
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:20,394
into the scene and somebody walks in

654
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:23,357
in front of Pikachu or other things happen,

655
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:26,100
that illusion of reality gets broken pretty quickly

656
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:30,804
whenever the character is not properly occluded behind things that it should be occluded by.

657
00:32:31,605 --> 00:32:35,987
So we want to see Pikachu ideally here be hidden behind objects and people when it should be.

658
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:42,410
That will help us believe that this hologram is actually part of the world of atoms, the one that we live in.

659
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:48,273
So when we apply the system that I was just describing to the same situation,

660
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:52,475
we see that as people walk in front of Pikachu and as Pikachu moves around these planters,

661
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:55,716
that he's properly hidden.

662
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:58,549
and that's what we want.

663
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:59,850
We want to create believability.

664
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,452
We want to make these atoms and bits

665
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:05,033
indistinguishable from one another.

666
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:06,734
That's the ultimate goal.

667
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:10,537
Okay, so that's, we talked about mapping

668
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:11,938
and we talked about understanding.

669
00:33:11,938 --> 00:33:14,379
The third kind of key piece of technology

670
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:15,880
that I want to describe and show you

671
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,343
some of our work around is around sharing.

672
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:25,206
Games are played between people games are inherently shared experiences.

673
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:31,571
Those of you who are building console and PC games. I'm sure have dealt with latency in a multiplayer situation.

674
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:40,399
It's really hard to share lots of data between users, especially when you have a fast pace game and things are changing all the time and you need to keep everybody updated.

675
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:42,180
and locked.

676
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,303
And we know that with online games,

677
00:33:45,303 --> 00:33:48,405
sometimes we can cheat because we don't really know

678
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:49,766
what that person is doing.

679
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:52,068
And so if you lag behind a few frames

680
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:53,890
because there was a hiccup in the network

681
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,412
for a brief period of time,

682
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:59,254
you can sort of fudge it and then make up for it.

683
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:00,735
With AR that becomes a lot more difficult.

684
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:04,438
because you actually see the atoms, the people moving around,

685
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:08,321
and you see other things that are real visually instantaneously.

686
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:10,142
And so the additive stuff,

687
00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:12,264
the holograms that you're adding into that environment,

688
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:16,127
need to track with the atoms really closely,

689
00:34:16,127 --> 00:34:18,609
or it's immediately obvious that you're out of sync and things are broken.

690
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,279
So why do we care about it?

691
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:25,303
We care about it because we want to make experiences like this

692
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:25,644
better.

693
00:34:25,644 --> 00:34:29,388
We want to have a truly shared, immersive, holographic AR

694
00:34:29,388 --> 00:34:30,329
experience.

695
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:34,093
So we've been working to figure this stuff out.

696
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:36,235
And we built this, which I'll let

697
00:34:36,235 --> 00:34:38,257
one of our amazingly talented designers

698
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:39,498
introduce, David Holland.

699
00:34:39,498 --> 00:34:40,900
And this is code named Neon.

700
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:50,551
So what you're seeing here is high speed, low latency, shared AR.

701
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:53,072
So you have shared resources on the ground.

702
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:56,493
So think of those as Pac-Man pellets.

703
00:34:56,493 --> 00:35:02,335
Those are energy globules that you need to absorb in order to attack the other players.

704
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:04,075
You'll see people walking around.

705
00:35:04,075 --> 00:35:05,996
So each person is being tracked.

706
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:07,938
in real time in this environment.

707
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:10,120
And this is all footage taken directly from device.

708
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,761
There's no CG applied here.

709
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:14,504
And you're seeing projectiles fired between the users.

710
00:35:14,504 --> 00:35:16,846
So it's all being tracked in AR, all being shared to all

711
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:19,208
the users at the same time.

712
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,449
It's really hard to do that right now.

713
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:23,732
There are just some laws of physics that get in the way.

714
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:27,215
You need around 10 milliseconds or so for that

715
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:28,216
to be imperceptible.

716
00:35:28,998 --> 00:35:31,742
OK, and if you were building something today that

717
00:35:31,742 --> 00:35:34,045
has to round trip to a server over the internet,

718
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:36,728
you're talking about 100 or hundreds

719
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:38,690
of milliseconds typically.

720
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,912
Obviously, a lot of folks are trying

721
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:42,235
to get those latencies down for many applications,

722
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:44,918
including cloud gaming.

723
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:47,381
But it is a big problem that has to be designed around.

724
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:52,505
We've found some ways to do some clever things

725
00:35:52,505 --> 00:35:56,067
so that we can do that in many situations today,

726
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:59,550
including in some 4G LTE environments.

727
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,430
But it's not easy.

728
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,632
This is another example,

729
00:36:02,632 --> 00:36:05,174
so it doesn't have to be about shooting.

730
00:36:05,174 --> 00:36:06,715
Let's see, Lena.

731
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:09,236
I'm Lena from Niantic, and this is Tonehenge.

732
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:11,058
She's gonna introduce us to this.

733
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:13,419
So this is a puzzle-adventure-y

734
00:36:13,419 --> 00:36:15,521
kind of shared AR experience that we also built.

735
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,122
just to kind of explore a different dimension of gameplay.

736
00:36:20,122 --> 00:36:27,548
I was a huge Myst fan, so I particularly love this one.

737
00:36:27,548 --> 00:36:31,712
So we'll see in a moment,

738
00:36:31,712 --> 00:36:34,534
a hologram that everybody is sharing.

739
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:36,816
We actually cloaked the other players

740
00:36:36,816 --> 00:36:39,558
just to sort of add to the ambiance.

741
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:47,309
That's really hard to do, and there's some interesting work to be done to really clothe

742
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:50,952
and cloak people in a more intricate way.

743
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:57,678
But this allows a complicated puzzle to be manipulated by all the users at the same time.

744
00:36:57,678 --> 00:37:01,962
You have to talk to one another and synchronize your actions in order to unlock this thing.

745
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,901
and solve a puzzle.

746
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:08,364
So the whole idea is to give people reasons

747
00:37:08,364 --> 00:37:09,205
to talk to one another, right?

748
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:11,188
I mean, that's really the heart of social gaming.

749
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,750
You're creating a context where,

750
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,032
giving people an excuse to be social.

751
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,194
You're making it easy for people

752
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:17,475
to be social with one another.

753
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:36,115
So that's Tonehenge. I'm really hoping we get to turn that into a full-fledged game.

754
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:41,965
So on 4G networks, you can make this stuff work,

755
00:37:41,965 --> 00:37:42,485
but it's hard.

756
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:47,607
5G, for those of you guys that read the tech press

757
00:37:47,607 --> 00:37:49,288
or are into networking technology,

758
00:37:49,288 --> 00:37:51,428
you know that there's a huge amount of hype about 5G.

759
00:37:51,428 --> 00:37:54,329
It's probably one of the most hyped technologies

760
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,530
that's been around in the last several years.

761
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,051
A lot of people would say it's overhyped.

762
00:37:58,051 --> 00:38:01,412
There are some real advantages for AR.

763
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:05,313
So I'm personally grateful that we have 5G networks coming.

764
00:38:05,313 --> 00:38:06,533
It's going to make AR.

765
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:09,756
much easier for us.

766
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:11,517
Number one, latencies are lower.

767
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:13,979
So you can actually get latencies

768
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:15,780
between 5G and edge computing,

769
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,841
which is part of the overall paradigm

770
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:19,042
that's rolling out.

771
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:21,524
You can get 10, 20-second latencies

772
00:38:21,524 --> 00:38:22,585
on a regular basis.

773
00:38:23,265 --> 00:38:28,871
The other area it helps us is that 5G supports a far greater density of users in a given area.

774
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:33,996
So if you want to do mass outdoor AR gaming where you have lots of people playing in the same space,

775
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:35,357
5G is super helpful.

776
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:41,083
It actually supports by spec three orders of magnitude more people per essentially cell tower.

777
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:47,088
Real world performance may vary, but nevertheless it's a much better architecture for shared AR.

778
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,450
So we are forming partnerships with a lot of the companies that are building the networking

779
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,491
infrastructure to make this possible.

780
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:58,093
To help them do it in a way that's going to be good for AR and to also really be on the

781
00:38:58,093 --> 00:39:01,834
cutting edge as this technology lands in consumers' hands.

782
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:07,396
So folks like Deutsche Telekom, SK Telecom, and Samsung are all instrumental in the backend

783
00:39:07,396 --> 00:39:10,077
systems that are going to enable 5G for consumers.

784
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:14,266
Okay, so we talked about history,

785
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:17,587
and we talked about the tech that's being built.

786
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:19,188
So now we get to the fun part.

787
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:21,308
Okay, so since technology exists,

788
00:39:21,308 --> 00:39:23,609
what are the implications for the kinds of experiences

789
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:25,410
that we can build, for the kinds of games

790
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,070
and non-game experiences that we can build?

791
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,931
So I wanted to say something thoughtful about this

792
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:33,112
and not just show a bunch of demos.

793
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,211
Broke it out into a couple of categories.

794
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:42,093
I really think about it in terms of two fundamental kinds

795
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:44,414
of interactions that we can do.

796
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:49,017
We can add information and services

797
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:51,518
to all of the atoms in the world.

798
00:39:51,518 --> 00:39:54,580
So all the physical stuff can kind of work like the web.

799
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,240
Like you can connect to information

800
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,562
and you can make it do stuff through web services.

801
00:39:59,562 --> 00:40:03,404
And then the other major area is to,

802
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:08,460
is to add things to the world, okay?

803
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,402
And I'm gonna talk about each of these separately.

804
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:15,063
So in terms of information and interactivity,

805
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:18,284
as I said, it's about information and services.

806
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:20,745
And in terms of adding things,

807
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:24,327
I wanna talk about those as augmentations, just generally.

808
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:26,428
And here, in the first case,

809
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:28,428
we're talking about connecting atoms to bits.

810
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:32,510
In the second case, we're talking about making bits

811
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,391
that can really fool us.

812
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:37,980
that can realistically masquerade as atoms.

813
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,852
So we want the bits to feel and act as much like real atoms as possible.

814
00:40:44,757 --> 00:40:47,099
When we think about the first problem

815
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,401
and what we might be able to do with it,

816
00:40:49,401 --> 00:40:53,944
this is really the AR vision that we've been sold

817
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:56,185
by sci-fi, by movies.

818
00:40:56,185 --> 00:40:59,148
This is about walking around with glasses

819
00:40:59,148 --> 00:41:01,249
and being able to know more about the world.

820
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:03,611
So you might walk to the Ferry Building in SF

821
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:06,373
and you might learn about the history of that building

822
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:07,734
and who designed it and why it looks

823
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:08,835
the way it does right now.

824
00:41:10,743 --> 00:41:13,965
You might walk up to a piece of artwork and understand,

825
00:41:13,965 --> 00:41:16,125
okay, who is the woman depicted in the statue?

826
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:20,767
You might walk by a restaurant and understand

827
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:23,688
what Yelp has to say about that particular restaurant.

828
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:25,428
Maybe you're running late for a dental appointment,

829
00:41:25,428 --> 00:41:27,549
you run into a building, it's got 20 floors,

830
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:29,910
you know your dentist is somewhere in some office,

831
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,751
you can know exactly where they are and how to get there.

832
00:41:33,851 --> 00:41:34,932
So incredibly powerful.

833
00:41:34,932 --> 00:41:36,433
That's just learning.

834
00:41:36,433 --> 00:41:40,297
Then there's a whole other layer that we can do here,

835
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,818
which is to enable interactions.

836
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:44,360
So we can not only consume information,

837
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,462
all these things can become interactable.

838
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:49,104
So we can perform actions.

839
00:41:49,104 --> 00:41:52,426
If we walk up to the bus stop and we see the bus rolling in

840
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,169
and we don't have money on our card, you can transact.

841
00:41:55,169 --> 00:41:56,670
You don't have to go to a physical terminal.

842
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,271
I go to the airport, you can check in.

843
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,372
When you arrive at your hotel.

844
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:00,873
hotel, you can check into the hotel.

845
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:04,076
Think of all the places in the world today where,

846
00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:06,457
I mean we've tried to kind of do it by installing kiosks

847
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,738
and things like that.

848
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:11,001
All of that can be just a surface that becomes

849
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:15,064
an interactive surface for services.

850
00:42:16,087 --> 00:42:18,327
Now people have thought about what this might look like,

851
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,648
and one of the best known of those is a guy named Keiichi Matsuda.

852
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:26,429
If you guys have seen his work, by the way, the Hyper Reality film series,

853
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:30,570
I know many of you have. I'm going to play about a minute of this just to remind us of it.

854
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,751
It's interesting.

855
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:38,392
Let's just take this in. This is a possible future that we might live in.

856
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:56,770
I already feel stressed and nervous just watching this video.

857
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:20,687
So the system knows where we are.

858
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:35,677
We're going to find out in a second that we know when to get off the bus.

859
00:43:47,104 --> 00:43:50,026
That looks helpful.

860
00:43:50,026 --> 00:43:59,734
You know, there are times when I might like to see a path by guiding me through the world.

861
00:43:59,734 --> 00:44:06,539
What's really crazy is this part, where she goes, she's going outside.

862
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:14,446
Now the world is plastered with ads and distractions.

863
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:14,666
So...

864
00:44:15,937 --> 00:44:20,060
It doesn't have to be like this.

865
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,881
I had a chance to meet, actually I was at a talk,

866
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:24,402
it was kind of like this, I was talking about hyperreality

867
00:44:24,402 --> 00:44:26,783
and I was talking about Keiichi Matsuda

868
00:44:26,783 --> 00:44:29,145
and how smart he was, and this guy on the side of the room

869
00:44:29,145 --> 00:44:31,046
held up his hand and said, I'm Keiichi.

870
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:33,387
So I had a chance to meet him.

871
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:34,508
And I learned about his work.

872
00:44:34,508 --> 00:44:36,769
So he's not showing us that because he wants

873
00:44:36,769 --> 00:44:37,830
the world to look that way.

874
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:43,695
He actually follows something that's called, there's a school of design called critical

875
00:44:43,695 --> 00:44:44,736
design.

876
00:44:44,736 --> 00:44:51,222
And the whole idea there is that you make things, you design things to question certain

877
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,023
things in the world.

878
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:55,366
And so really he was very deliberately challenging.

879
00:44:55,746 --> 00:45:03,112
what the world might look like if sort of current trajectories continue into the future and we build AR

880
00:45:03,112 --> 00:45:06,074
not in a very thoughtful or considered way.

881
00:45:06,074 --> 00:45:12,839
And it's a world where you're tracked everywhere you go, where giant companies know everything about you, your identity is constantly

882
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:20,204
at stake, and the world itself is noisy and busy and literally plastered with distractions.

883
00:45:21,906 --> 00:45:24,868
So that's out there and some people would say,

884
00:45:24,868 --> 00:45:27,631
hey, AR is a bad thing because we've seen this vision

885
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:29,652
of how bad it can be.

886
00:45:29,652 --> 00:45:31,995
The point I want to make to you all is that

887
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,776
it doesn't have to be that way.

888
00:45:33,776 --> 00:45:37,419
And it's up to us to make it the way we want it to be.

889
00:45:37,419 --> 00:45:39,281
And there's some incredibly powerful things

890
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:39,821
that you can do.

891
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,083
So I don't think we should be scared by KHE's vision.

892
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,645
I think we should be informed by it.

893
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:48,488
And actually I know he's continued to work in the field of AR after that and he's helping

894
00:45:48,488 --> 00:45:53,891
do some of the work to really define how AR should work.

895
00:45:53,891 --> 00:45:59,154
But I imagine a future where with the kind of map that we described and with the kind

896
00:45:59,154 --> 00:46:03,097
of understanding that we described that we can have experiences like this where we can

897
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:04,938
learn about the world in a deeper way.

898
00:46:05,398 --> 00:46:06,659
and we can access things.

899
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:08,660
Like, I think, like riding public transit,

900
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,902
I try to ride the subway or the trains

901
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:12,784
or the buses in every city I go to

902
00:46:12,784 --> 00:46:14,805
and I travel a fair amount around the world.

903
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,627
And it's like the most complicated adventure game

904
00:46:17,627 --> 00:46:18,408
that you've ever played.

905
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,789
Trying to figure out how to buy a ticket

906
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:20,990
and navigate through the terminal.

907
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,493
That could all be so much easier with AR,

908
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:26,074
and that would be a social good.

909
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,855
If more people rode public transportation

910
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,116
because they could understand it,

911
00:46:29,116 --> 00:46:32,238
it'd help them get places in a more reliable

912
00:46:32,238 --> 00:46:34,080
and easier to access way, that'd be fantastic.

913
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,202
And it's one of the things that I think AR can do for us.

914
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:40,719
So just to address some of the,

915
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:42,461
you know, if the more technically minded people out there

916
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:44,543
might wanna challenge a few assumptions here,

917
00:46:44,543 --> 00:46:45,744
you might say, hey, you know,

918
00:46:45,744 --> 00:46:47,145
you can do some of that stuff with an app today.

919
00:46:47,145 --> 00:46:49,206
Like, there are a bunch of apps in the App Store.

920
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:52,769
And that's true, but it puts a huge amount of work on you

921
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:53,230
as a user.

922
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,310
You're kind of the in-between.

923
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,353
You're the glue between the world and the digital world,

924
00:46:57,353 --> 00:46:58,614
the atoms and the bits.

925
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:00,375
So you have to go find the app, install it,

926
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:01,276
all the apps work differently.

927
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:04,279
I, for one, know that I'm in venues all the time

928
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,520
that say, hey, use our app.

929
00:47:06,183 --> 00:47:07,343
and I don't download their app,

930
00:47:07,343 --> 00:47:10,225
because I already have a lot of apps on my phone,

931
00:47:10,225 --> 00:47:12,606
and it takes a while, and it's complicated.

932
00:47:12,606 --> 00:47:16,548
So I don't think that really is the solution.

933
00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:18,109
The other sort of counterpoint would be,

934
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:20,991
well, maybe you don't need this kind of complicated

935
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:22,632
AR cloud that you were describing to do this.

936
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:23,732
Maybe there are other ways to do it,

937
00:47:23,732 --> 00:47:26,094
like you could have QR codes on things,

938
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,915
or you could have Bluetooth beacons

939
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:32,357
that tell you where you are and what's going on.

940
00:47:33,293 --> 00:47:38,436
I don't think we really want to put a QR code on every object in the entire world.

941
00:47:38,436 --> 00:47:42,918
I think that would be kind of hard to do and would add a little bit of pollution to the

942
00:47:42,918 --> 00:47:43,259
world.

943
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:45,120
I think that would be a bad thing.

944
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,600
It's not really a very practical idea.

945
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,022
Bluetooth beacons are even more expensive and more difficult to deploy.

946
00:47:50,022 --> 00:47:55,525
Many companies have tried to deploy large networks of Bluetooth beacons and it's expensive

947
00:47:55,525 --> 00:47:57,406
and hard.

948
00:47:57,466 --> 00:47:58,846
I don't think that's really the answer either.

949
00:47:58,846 --> 00:48:00,407
Even like raw computer vision,

950
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:02,948
raw computer vision in some cases can tell you,

951
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:06,429
hey this is a Starbucks or this is a bus station,

952
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:07,990
but it has a very difficult time knowing

953
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:10,811
that this is this specific bus station,

954
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:14,272
this is this specific park bench, a specific anything.

955
00:48:14,272 --> 00:48:16,213
Because it's trained to recognize patterns

956
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:18,274
and specific things are hard to pick out

957
00:48:18,274 --> 00:48:21,595
from all the things that look alike, frankly.

958
00:48:21,595 --> 00:48:23,016
So the AR cloud is essential

959
00:48:23,016 --> 00:48:25,437
even if you have good computer vision.

960
00:48:26,562 --> 00:48:33,003
So, let's move on to the second class of things and I have some examples I want to show you

961
00:48:33,003 --> 00:48:33,724
here too.

962
00:48:33,724 --> 00:48:38,205
So we're talking about augmentations, we're talking about putting things in the world

963
00:48:38,205 --> 00:48:43,106
that look like us or they look like creatures, they look like guides.

964
00:48:43,106 --> 00:48:46,167
So these are things that might entertain us.

965
00:48:46,707 --> 00:48:49,249
they might do useful things for us

966
00:48:49,249 --> 00:48:53,553
or they might even help social interactions between people.

967
00:48:53,553 --> 00:48:55,435
When we think about games, you think about Pokemon,

968
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:56,636
you think about adventure games,

969
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:58,117
you think about putting fictional characters

970
00:48:58,117 --> 00:49:01,721
into the world, it's kind of an obvious thing

971
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:03,983
that we wanna do with the technology.

972
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,745
But, if you tried to do it right now,

973
00:49:06,745 --> 00:49:10,208
you might run up against barriers that you weren't expecting.

974
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,510
Like, you know, one thing that I can imagine is,

975
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:17,332
Okay, imagine that we want to have this great, noir experience in San Francisco.

976
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:18,792
We want to be Humphrey Bogart.

977
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,752
We want to go through the city on an adventure.

978
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:22,793
We might want to meet a hologram.

979
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,114
So imagine that there's a hologram standing down on the waterfront of San Francisco.

980
00:49:26,114 --> 00:49:31,215
If that hologram doesn't know where it is, if it's just something that you popped up

981
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:35,235
in your phone, but it's the same experience that could happen anywhere, there are limits

982
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:36,896
to how sophisticated that interaction can be.

983
00:49:37,756 --> 00:49:42,717
But if that hologram knows it's standing on a specific street corner in San Francisco

984
00:49:42,717 --> 00:49:48,279
and it can direct you a half mile away to Coit Tower on a quest to find a clue that

985
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:52,921
will lead you on the path to the Maltese Falcon, that would be incredible.

986
00:49:52,921 --> 00:49:58,442
But to do that, we have to have holograms, we have to have augmentations that have contextual

987
00:49:58,442 --> 00:49:59,483
awareness.

988
00:49:59,483 --> 00:50:03,704
We need the AR map for that, and able for these things to know exactly where they are

989
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:04,384
in the world.

990
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,129
We, the other thing that it gives us,

991
00:50:10,129 --> 00:50:11,390
and we talked about it earlier,

992
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:13,812
I have to rebuild the whole slide again,

993
00:50:13,812 --> 00:50:16,955
is that it allows us all to share that experience.

994
00:50:16,955 --> 00:50:20,238
So it's not, you know, if only you can see something,

995
00:50:20,238 --> 00:50:23,020
there's a word for that, it's called a hallucination.

996
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,122
Sometimes that's a bad thing.

997
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:27,964
But if we can all see it,

998
00:50:27,964 --> 00:50:29,525
it's an amazing shared experience,

999
00:50:29,525 --> 00:50:30,406
which we all talk about.

1000
00:50:30,406 --> 00:50:32,708
So the sharing part,

1001
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:34,389
the everybody seeing the same thing part,

1002
00:50:34,389 --> 00:50:35,330
is really, really important.

1003
00:50:36,412 --> 00:50:39,094
We've been dreaming about this at Niantic.

1004
00:50:39,094 --> 00:50:41,077
Our designers and artists have the things

1005
00:50:41,077 --> 00:50:42,518
that we want to build.

1006
00:50:42,518 --> 00:50:45,842
We imagine our festivals with real life gems

1007
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,664
and Pokéstops that everybody can see

1008
00:50:47,664 --> 00:50:49,266
and understand together.

1009
00:50:49,266 --> 00:50:50,947
Even going back to the early days of Ingress,

1010
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:52,329
we were thinking about this.

1011
00:50:53,132 --> 00:50:59,578
More recently, we've been thinking about non-game applications and what these kinds of holograms can do.

1012
00:50:59,578 --> 00:51:07,165
The technology is not there yet, but I think you saw from the preceding section that we are getting closer.

1013
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:10,949
This is an example of one of those baby steps forward.

1014
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:17,655
So, this is a project that we did with our colleagues and partners, SoftBank in Japan.

1015
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,441
It's done on HoloLens 1, not HoloLens 2.

1016
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:26,083
And we actually captured this footage

1017
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,504
at the top of Roppongi Hills.

1018
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:28,964
I don't know if anybody's been to Tokyo,

1019
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:30,345
but probably some of you have,

1020
00:51:30,345 --> 00:51:31,685
and you know the big skyscraper.

1021
00:51:31,685 --> 00:51:33,146
So when you see this,

1022
00:51:33,146 --> 00:51:35,047
imagine you're on the top floor of the skyscraper.

1023
00:51:35,047 --> 00:51:37,167
We're gonna look out the window in a second,

1024
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:38,128
you'll understand why.

1025
00:51:39,837 --> 00:51:42,540
So as we look around the room, we're seeing,

1026
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,083
and everybody who comes through the experience,

1027
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:46,684
we ran a bunch of people through this,

1028
00:51:46,684 --> 00:51:49,688
everybody saw the same things in the same location,

1029
00:51:49,688 --> 00:51:52,791
so they were shared experiences, as I was talking about.

1030
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:58,116
We had specific Pokemon inhabiting certain parts

1031
00:51:58,116 --> 00:52:00,599
of this pretty open room.

1032
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:11,534
And then when you walked out to the window and looked out across the city, you could actually see all the Pokemon gems where they're supposed to be.

1033
00:52:11,534 --> 00:52:17,577
We can see our legendary birds flying through the air. I think Moltres is in the background.

1034
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:24,721
So it was really exciting for us because it was one of those glimpses of the future.

1035
00:52:24,721 --> 00:52:26,923
You know, you can only do this in a limited way.

1036
00:52:26,923 --> 00:52:30,926
You can prototype under certain conditions.

1037
00:52:30,926 --> 00:52:34,449
But it is a glimpse of what's going to be possible in the not-too-distant future.

1038
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:36,991
Okay, so I want to wrap this up.

1039
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:40,454
I think we're getting close to time.

1040
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:45,077
So we've talked about AR and we've talked about...

1041
00:52:45,691 --> 00:52:48,012
the history and the things that we've learned.

1042
00:52:48,012 --> 00:52:51,314
We've talked about the technology that we're building.

1043
00:52:51,314 --> 00:52:55,276
And last, we talked about some of the product potential.

1044
00:52:55,276 --> 00:52:57,176
And I think for you product designers and game creators

1045
00:52:57,176 --> 00:52:58,937
out there, your mind is, you probably

1046
00:52:58,937 --> 00:53:01,318
have 1,000 ideas of stuff that you would like to build.

1047
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:03,974
So whenever people ask that question,

1048
00:53:03,974 --> 00:53:09,257
well where is AR in the sort of hype cycle or whatever?

1049
00:53:09,257 --> 00:53:11,718
Is it up, is it down?

1050
00:53:11,718 --> 00:53:13,259
I don't really care about that.

1051
00:53:13,259 --> 00:53:17,241
The question that's interesting is,

1052
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:22,964
is it something that is meaningful with a capital M?

1053
00:53:22,964 --> 00:53:26,746
Like is it something that's gonna affect our lives

1054
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:27,587
in a significant way,

1055
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:30,388
in many people's lives in a significant way?

1056
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,782
And I absolutely believe that it is.

1057
00:53:33,782 --> 00:53:36,964
You know, what is happening on handsets today is a warmup.

1058
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,605
That's the pregame.

1059
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:40,887
What's going to happen with glasses in the future

1060
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:41,268
is the real deal.

1061
00:53:41,268 --> 00:53:45,491
But I think it's one of those platform shifts.

1062
00:53:46,616 --> 00:53:48,797
you see it once every 10 or 20 years.

1063
00:53:48,797 --> 00:53:51,538
You know, and I've lived through a couple.

1064
00:53:51,538 --> 00:53:54,820
We saw PCs, we saw the cloud, we saw mobile.

1065
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,100
I think AR is one of those shifts.

1066
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,922
So it's something that I think is worth our time

1067
00:53:58,922 --> 00:53:59,542
to understand.

1068
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:03,063
It's worth our time and money to invest early in.

1069
00:54:03,063 --> 00:54:05,364
And I think it's gonna be hugely important.

1070
00:54:05,364 --> 00:54:07,165
Rose colored glasses, I wanna touch on that.

1071
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:08,746
That was part of the title of the talk.

1072
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,887
People have knocked AR because they've said,

1073
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,741
Oh, I didn't switch my slide to the beautiful closing slide here.

1074
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:17,901
Perfect, rose-colored glasses.

1075
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:20,242
So some people have said, hey, I always like rose-colored glasses.

1076
00:54:20,242 --> 00:54:21,742
You're taking it away from the world.

1077
00:54:21,742 --> 00:54:24,403
People aren't seeing the world as it really is.

1078
00:54:24,403 --> 00:54:25,543
So it's a bad thing.

1079
00:54:25,543 --> 00:54:28,884
I want to push back on that a little bit.

1080
00:54:28,884 --> 00:54:32,225
A good pair of sunglasses, if it's bright outside,

1081
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:35,185
they actually don't get in your way of seeing the world.

1082
00:54:35,185 --> 00:54:36,706
They help you see the world more clearly.

1083
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:37,886
They eliminate the glare.

1084
00:54:37,886 --> 00:54:38,366
You can focus.

1085
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:40,467
You can see things you couldn't otherwise see.

1086
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:43,381
And that's how I think of AR.

1087
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:44,982
We're adding things to the world,

1088
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:50,046
but the things that we can add can deepen our appreciation

1089
00:54:50,046 --> 00:54:53,389
for the world and our understanding of the world.

1090
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:58,113
I think there are two primary things

1091
00:54:58,113 --> 00:55:00,095
that AR can do for us.

1092
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,998
One is it can allow us to see the world in a fresh way

1093
00:55:03,998 --> 00:55:06,901
by causing us to pause and seeing history.

1094
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,842
everything that's interesting about the world brought forward to us.

1095
00:55:10,842 --> 00:55:15,464
I really think there's an opportunity to deepen our connection with the places that we live.

1096
00:55:15,464 --> 00:55:19,465
The second thing that I think is incredibly important about that

1097
00:55:19,465 --> 00:55:23,526
is that it allows us to do it in a shared way and to have experiences together,

1098
00:55:23,526 --> 00:55:28,788
to have these adventures in real life with our friends, with our family, and with our kids.

1099
00:55:28,788 --> 00:55:31,428
And by deepening our connection with community...

1100
00:55:32,456 --> 00:55:34,839
in the physical sense, and deepening our connection

1101
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:37,122
with community in the meeting our neighbors

1102
00:55:37,122 --> 00:55:39,685
and doing stuff together with our friends sense,

1103
00:55:39,685 --> 00:55:42,389
I think is a really important step forward for technology.

1104
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:44,571
And frankly, I think it's something that we need.

1105
00:55:44,571 --> 00:55:47,715
I think it's something that the world needs.

1106
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:49,462
You've seen how it can go wrong.

1107
00:55:49,462 --> 00:55:51,382
So thank you, Keiichi, for showing us

1108
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:54,183
how horribly wrong AR could go.

1109
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:58,865
But I believe that the positives here outweigh that.

1110
00:55:58,865 --> 00:56:00,726
And I want to put it to everybody here.

1111
00:56:00,726 --> 00:56:02,306
There's a Gandhi quote, which is,

1112
00:56:02,306 --> 00:56:04,287
be the change you want to see in the world.

1113
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:07,508
In our professional lives, I think the quote is,

1114
00:56:07,508 --> 00:56:11,130
it is really up to us to build the future

1115
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,030
that we want to live in.

1116
00:56:14,157 --> 00:56:16,720
It's up to us to build the future that we want to live in,

1117
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,821
that we want to exist.

1118
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:20,545
And more importantly, it's up to us to build a future

1119
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,887
that we want our kids to live in.

1120
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:25,730
So if you guys are inspired by the opportunity here

1121
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,873
and are interested in AR, reach out to us.

1122
00:56:27,873 --> 00:56:29,154
We have a contest.

1123
00:56:29,154 --> 00:56:31,537
We're looking for allies.

1124
00:56:31,537 --> 00:56:32,558
But there's a lot of work to do

1125
00:56:32,558 --> 00:56:34,140
and I think it's important work.

1126
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:34,861
Thank you.
