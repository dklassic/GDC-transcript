1
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:16,748
Thank you for coming to my talk on exploration in Ghost of Tsushima, letting the island guide

2
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:16,908
you.

3
00:00:18,488 --> 00:00:19,849
My name is Parker Hamilton.

4
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:22,090
I'm the lead system designer at Sucker Punch.

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,551
I've worked at Sucker Punch for about the last 10 years, learning and helping to build

6
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:30,693
strong player fantasies through the infamous titles and now through Ghost of Tsushima.

7
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:34,863
Making Ghost of Tsushima required an incredible team effort,

8
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:39,026
and the notes I'm presenting today would just not be possible without all these amazing people.

9
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:40,947
So thanks everybody for your help.

10
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:46,311
When we set out to build Ghost, we knew the core experience we wanted to deliver

11
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,193
was that of being a wandering samurai.

12
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:51,375
That's the absolute heart of the fantasy and the IP.

13
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:52,976
Everything stems from there.

14
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:57,139
And of course, you can't wander without a world to explore.

15
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:01,362
We wanted to create a game where players could get lost exploring feudal Japan.

16
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:05,143
Part of that is delivering the freedom for players to decide if they want to

17
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:07,883
climb a mountain to reach a temple emerging from the

18
00:01:07,923 --> 00:01:11,624
treetops, or ride through a forest to chase down a rogue ronin.

19
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:16,286
Another part was the art team's goal from day one to create an absolutely

20
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:19,646
stunning world with lots of rich biomes dripping with

21
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:20,487
color and movement.

22
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:27,520
For inspiration on building a fulfilling samurai fantasy, we looked to samurai cinema.

23
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:34,265
There are many lessons here, but for this talk, a key part of the samurai cinema that inspired us is movement.

24
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:39,649
If you look at the films of Kurosawa, there's always motion, movement, and wind.

25
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:48,095
You'll likely see clouds of dust whipping around stoic warriors, or leaves blowing through towards tragic characters.

26
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:53,620
As a result, wind became a very early visual art target for our game's identity.

27
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:58,805
It wasn't until much later that the wind evolved to become much more of a mechanical element of the

28
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:03,849
game. So it was a serious technical investment, and we knew we needed to invest early.

29
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:09,935
I remember seeing the first version of the wind blowing in the grass. It was simply stunning.

30
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,590
A couple years later, everything was windy.

31
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,510
The trees, the grass that covered the landscapes,

32
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,811
capes on the hero's back, particles, everything.

33
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,872
The stunning environment and the incredible wind

34
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,953
were one aspect of transporting Polaris to feudal Japan,

35
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:31,013
but we wanted to go further.

36
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,554
We wanted to be as authentic as possible.

37
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:35,734
We wanted to honor the time period

38
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:38,035
and the culture we were targeting as much as possible.

39
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:40,809
We went to great lengths to do this.

40
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,910
In fact, our creative director, Jason Connell,

41
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,650
is speaking about the various steps

42
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,051
we took to educate our team and bring Ghost of Tsushima to life.

43
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,452
For gameplay, this meant we didn't want any UI

44
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:53,832
we didn't absolutely need.

45
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:57,053
We wanted players looking at the world to retain immersion,

46
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,274
and we didn't want any anachronistic elements,

47
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:01,034
like a mini-map, that could compromise

48
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:02,634
the tone we were targeting.

49
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:05,735
So the challenge became.

50
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:08,925
How to solve all the normal game problems

51
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:11,707
without using the standard UI-based solutions

52
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,428
we thought would be immersion breaking.

53
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:16,351
For example, discovering opportunities.

54
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,253
How do I know if there's something interesting nearby?

55
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,194
Or wayfinding.

56
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:23,636
How do I know how to get to a location

57
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:24,717
I'm interested in reaching?

58
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:28,060
Or guiding players to content.

59
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,022
How do I know where to go to progress my current mission?

60
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,562
Our solution was to answer these questions as much as possible

61
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:40,085
through an organic and diegetic presentation of game mechanics.

62
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:42,627
We wanted to keep players immersed,

63
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:46,710
so we asked ourselves, how do we keep players' presence

64
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,191
in the world?

65
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:49,773
Whatever breaks the fourth wall and makes

66
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:52,255
you realize you're playing a game is undesirable.

67
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:54,677
We felt if you were looking at UI,

68
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:57,159
it reduced the incentive to look at the world for context

69
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:57,659
and clues.

70
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,422
We didn't want players missing subtle details

71
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,523
that were transported to the world we were building.

72
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:07,993
We also asked, how can the world provide the information the player needs?

73
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:13,315
How would a samurai traveling on horseback naturally gain information about potential threats?

74
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:17,536
How can the world provide clues if there's something interesting nearby?

75
00:04:18,256 --> 00:04:21,577
And how can the world help lead me to the location I'm interested in reaching?

76
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:28,579
This talk recounts our experience developing the exploration tools we use to drive immersion,

77
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,940
incite curiosity, and motivate a continual sense of discovery and reward.

78
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:38,431
Specifically, tools we used for building a world that invites exploration,

79
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:42,474
and tools we use to make exploration feel natural.

80
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,559
When building a world that invites exploration, players need to be curious

81
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,001
about the world and what opportunities exist.

82
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:56,246
For Ghost, lots of factors ranging from environmental design to content

83
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:58,888
discovery and player reward work together to

84
00:04:58,908 --> 00:04:59,488
accomplish this.

85
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:04,152
For environmental design, we treat the world like a living character.

86
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:08,852
And like a character, the world must have personality and should speak for itself.

87
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:13,113
When this is true, environmental elements can create a call to adventure,

88
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:16,734
driving a player to discover what is over a hill, through a forest,

89
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:18,474
or hidden along the coast.

90
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:23,195
Ghost of Tsushima is by far the biggest game we've ever made.

91
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:25,976
It's almost 30 times bigger than Infamous Second Son.

92
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:28,835
and the map is divided into the three regions

93
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:31,176
filled with more than 40 diverse biomes.

94
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:34,357
There are hundreds of locations in Tsushima to explore,

95
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:36,418
lots of written rewards to find.

96
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,739
So traveling across Tsushima,

97
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,579
you'll journey through lush forests,

98
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,940
cross boggy swamp lands

99
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,781
and enter a frozen mountainous landscape.

100
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,422
As you do, you'll notice nature plays an important role

101
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:50,342
in the world of Tsushima.

102
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:53,863
Unique foliage, weather, wildlife come together

103
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:56,124
to make each prefecture visually distinct.

104
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:02,208
This creates rich, vibrant color palettes that drive the art style and the identity of your game.

105
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:08,011
By eliminating the types of foliage and biomes, we were better able to bring a sense of freshness

106
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:11,714
to each area and create a world filled with lots of memorable locations.

107
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:18,037
This diversity makes players curious and drives them to explore into new areas of the world.

108
00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:24,710
Discovering a location is one of the most rewarding things you can do in Ghost of Tsushima.

109
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:30,394
Each location is rich with personality and is influenced heavily based on the region it is found.

110
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:35,859
For example, the healing town of Akashima is located in the low wetlands of Toyotama.

111
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,402
Moss hangs and grows on every surface and mist lingers above the ground.

112
00:06:41,123 --> 00:06:42,804
Incense burns near the great bell.

113
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:47,828
You might even hear frogs croaking around you. It's mysterious and it's beautiful.

114
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:51,529
We approached the design of a town or a location

115
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:53,231
like building a character for a story.

116
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,172
What happened here in the past?

117
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,234
What state is it in now?

118
00:06:57,495 --> 00:07:02,399
And what happens after the player comes to the location?

119
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,222
We want players to be interested in a location's history

120
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,264
and to be curious to learn more about it.

121
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:12,568
For example, the Golden Temple is where Japanese peasants

122
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,730
are gathering to take refuge from the Mongols.

123
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:20,154
Umugi is a hidden town of Ronin and thieves where players must watch their back.

124
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:24,997
And Yarikawa is home to a warring clan of the hero besieged by Monkles.

125
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:31,121
Our goal when building an open-world game is always, if you can see it, you can reach it.

126
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,583
With as few exceptions as possible, of course.

127
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:38,626
So we create lots of epic vistas to allow players to take in the beauty of the world

128
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:40,587
and to be drawn to new locations.

129
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:44,910
To help with this, we use visual landmarks to incite curiosity.

130
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:48,958
Another name for a visual landmark is a weenie.

131
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:51,198
And a weenie, if you're not familiar,

132
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:52,879
is a term we picked up from Disney.

133
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:56,060
Imagineers use this term when building theme parks

134
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,601
to get guests to go to certain places and directions.

135
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:01,421
Weenies are large, identifiable elements

136
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,522
guests can see from lots of different locations

137
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:04,942
and from even very far away.

138
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:07,423
You're probably familiar with a couple of them.

139
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,244
The Magic Kingdom has Cinderella Castle.

140
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:12,845
Epcot has Spaceship Earth.

141
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:15,565
And Animal Kingdom has the Tree of Life.

142
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,443
In Ghost, we use two main types of weenies, flags and breadcrumbs.

143
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:29,286
Flags are tall visual elements that extend upward from the content they're meant to attract you to.

144
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:35,050
For example, this black smoke signal could be a rogue building with its head peeking

145
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:40,133
up over the forest. Could be a red maple tree with steam nearby.

146
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:47,037
Or the motion and movement of this flock of birds hanging over a tatami mat might draw your attention.

147
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:55,422
Breadcrumbs, like this Torri gate, might lead you towards an actual location up above towards this Shinto shrine.

148
00:08:56,423 --> 00:09:01,006
Breadcrumbs are great because you can discover them even amidst a dense forest,

149
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:06,169
and be pulled with anticipation eagerly towards content and new areas.

150
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:19,647
Particles are a great tool to use when creating a visual landmark.

151
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:22,690
They're visible from great distance.

152
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:25,852
You like these black and white smoke clouds,

153
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:28,354
you can see all the way across the island.

154
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:32,898
They can also be visible in day or night, like these fireflies.

155
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:37,682
They're also dynamic.

156
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:39,423
They can change state as you approach them.

157
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:44,292
This flock of birds circle to draw your attention and scatter as you approach

158
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:46,873
to not get in your way as you compose your haiku.

159
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:58,661
Particles are also stateful. They can be easily changed or disabled based on content completion.

160
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:02,323
This way the player knows whether they've engaged the content or not.

161
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:09,568
Sound effects is obviously also another good method for drawing a player's attention.

162
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:16,088
Ambience from a location like diegetic music or chanting is another good way to draw the player

163
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:21,255
forward. In this example, the player knows that there's a roadblock nearby when they

164
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:25,381
start to hear the sounds of Mongols chanting down below the cliff near the fire.

165
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:55,000
Short flags, like the white flag next to this bamboo stand, can only be seen when you're very

166
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:02,362
nearby. As a result, they are not as effective as other weenies. For example, can you see the white

167
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:08,943
flag in this picture? There it is. If the weenie doesn't pass the squint test and you have to play

168
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:12,084
hidden pictures to find it, we might need to reconsider it.

169
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:16,826
We found that the density of points of interest

170
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:18,988
is a balance between building a believable world

171
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,068
and a functional world.

172
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,870
Players must be drawn by something of interest

173
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,252
every 30 seconds or less while traveling the world.

174
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,373
This can be a building in the distance,

175
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:30,375
a peasant held hostage, or actual content.

176
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:33,077
This doesn't mean the player must bump into something

177
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,078
every 30 seconds,

178
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:37,040
but instead can see something calling to them.

179
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,442
This was the learn time limit from people's patience

180
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:41,643
with the world feeling empty.

181
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:47,778
And a lot of environment and VFX work goes into this to ensure the players can see weenies from a distance.

182
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,464
In an attempt to provide clear sight lines and more obvious traversal routes as players explore the world,

183
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:58,947
the environment team carried out a comprehensive weed whacking initiative

184
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:03,951
that thinned out and eliminated large swaths of foliage and simplified terrain.

185
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,392
The net effect was it became much easier to maintain situational awareness

186
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:11,594
while traversing the open world and see visual landmarks in the distance.

187
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:13,075
Here's some examples.

188
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:16,438
The first one here is clearing out a patch of trees

189
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:18,860
that helped make the town of Komatsu more visible

190
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,082
and build anticipation as the player approached.

191
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:26,885
And here, clearing sight lines to this Mongol war camp

192
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:29,487
helped create an increased chance of discovery

193
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:33,270
and also a better scouting opportunity for players planning their assault.

194
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,502
Here, the smokestack hidden behind the trees

195
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:38,523
is barely visible.

196
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,186
However, after clearing out the trees,

197
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:43,127
both the burning house and the smokestack

198
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:43,968
are much more visible.

199
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:45,589
So riding down the road,

200
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:47,311
you're more likely to notice the location

201
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,032
and be compelled to investigate.

202
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,736
Tall mountains that block the player's path

203
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:55,058
can be frustrating if the player has to detour

204
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:57,039
for too long to find a path around.

205
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,662
If the path that allows the player to send

206
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:00,602
quickly is hidden,

207
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,125
the geography can be even more frustrating.

208
00:13:04,374 --> 00:13:07,355
Clearing out the view to let the player see the path from further out

209
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:10,217
creates a micro-navigational goal for ascending the mountain.

210
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:14,458
So, with a world prepared for exploration,

211
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:17,159
it needs to be filled with stories and secrets to discover.

212
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,061
While the hero's journey pulls him through the world,

213
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:23,502
we want the world to be as rich with content opportunities as possible,

214
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:26,063
to support the fantasy of the wandering samurai.

215
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,424
And a wandering samurai wanders,

216
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,905
which means the player needs to encounter surprises

217
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,366
often when exploring the world.

218
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:35,760
So what is stumble upon content?

219
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,162
Well, it's content you find en route to something else.

220
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:40,723
It's a minor diversion from your current goal,

221
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,785
and players grow over their journey

222
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:43,966
to seek this content out,

223
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,228
but initially players aren't aware of it

224
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:47,569
and typically stumble into it.

225
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,371
We describe the target player experience

226
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:51,892
for stumble content as,

227
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:54,394
a funny thing happened on the way to Azamo.

228
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,256
To achieve this dynamic,

229
00:13:57,376 --> 00:13:59,277
we try to fill the world with both bespoke

230
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:00,979
and dynamically spawned content.

231
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:03,666
Bespoke content, like this onsen,

232
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,387
is meant to make the player feel like they've

233
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,788
encountered a hidden secret.

234
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,730
Dynamic content, like a hostage rescue,

235
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,991
helps make the world feel alive and incite

236
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,072
more of a reactive response from the player.

237
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:16,993
We're looking for a mix.

238
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:20,035
We want to create a mix of content experiences

239
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:22,276
that add role-playing opportunities,

240
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:26,678
like a bamboo cut mini-game, or treasure-hunting opportunities,

241
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:27,819
like these collectibles.

242
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:30,708
And finally, world-building opportunities,

243
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:33,250
like this buddy mission with Sensei Ishikawa,

244
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,012
or this mythic mission about a legendary hero's

245
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:37,053
devastating attack.

246
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:40,616
Each piece builds to the fantasy of the wandering samurai.

247
00:14:42,337 --> 00:14:45,219
Content length is also a means to encourage exploration.

248
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,062
It's a tough balance, but you want your stumble-on content

249
00:14:49,102 --> 00:14:51,184
to be fairly quick and engaging, then

250
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,145
move on to the next thing.

251
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,882
For minigames, this is pretty straightforward.

252
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:58,083
However, stumbling into a long quest line and getting lost

253
00:14:58,183 --> 00:14:59,744
can actually discourage exploration.

254
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:03,205
We try to never end a quest near another quest start.

255
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,786
This is to push people back out into the world

256
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:08,226
to engage with stumble content as much as possible.

257
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:12,368
In fact, we will often end quests with an ally

258
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:14,088
and then have you meet them somewhere else

259
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,949
for the next objective for quest start.

260
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:19,050
Again, to push you out into the world to stumble content.

261
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:23,770
We also try not to put too many quest starts in a town or a hub.

262
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,552
We tried this, but it causes players to stay in one area for too long

263
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:28,973
and reduces exploration.

264
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:32,115
Stuff might seem obvious, but it definitely works.

265
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:38,219
So now that the world is filled with content a wandering samurai can discover,

266
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,720
we need to make sure the player is rewarded for their time.

267
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,795
Players have a range of motivations.

268
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,377
Some are driven by cosmetic role playing.

269
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:50,660
Others are more driven by stats, gears, and power level.

270
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:52,522
Rewards can always vary,

271
00:15:52,722 --> 00:15:55,985
but make sure to always reward at player exploration.

272
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:57,946
We had a rule.

273
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,788
If there's a building or structure in the world,

274
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:01,730
there must be some reward for visiting it.

275
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,873
It could be a quest, loot chest, a vanity item, anything.

276
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:08,535
Something has to be the point to visiting the building.

277
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:11,338
Players are gonna be drawn to them and go to them anyway.

278
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:14,807
If players aren't rewarded, they're going to stop visiting,

279
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:17,628
and they're going to stop exploring, and stop scavenging.

280
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:21,968
So we employed a range of rewards

281
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:24,589
to scratch the itch of as many player types as we could,

282
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:26,209
starting with content.

283
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:29,330
Anything that builds directly to the fantasy we're creating

284
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,350
or to the player's mental model of the world is just gold.

285
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:35,531
This includes missions that offer story progression,

286
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:37,692
character relationships, or world building.

287
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:43,844
Revealing new content locations is also great. Information is a form of reward and can encourage

288
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:49,871
players to explore a new area of the world they haven't visited yet. And world lore, this adds

289
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:54,035
just more narrative and world-building depth for the most archaeologists of player types.

290
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:58,180
Gameplay advantage, super important.

291
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:00,579
The world of Tsushima is lethal.

292
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,821
You need to invest a player growth to scale and match the difficulty of the island.

293
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:11,124
This includes simple things like hero stat boosts to bumps in health, resolve, or stance progress,

294
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:15,447
crafting resources to upgrade weapons or purchase cosmetics,

295
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:21,630
or new gear items like armor that can provide gameplay perks and highlight a particular combat style.

296
00:17:22,816 --> 00:17:25,899
It's worth noting crafting resources are an awesome way

297
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,642
to motivate scavenging and exploring at a micro level.

298
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:32,626
Crafting resources and ghosts exist in common,

299
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:34,067
uncommon and rare forms.

300
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,091
Common items are easily found riding your horse

301
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,493
or exploring buildings throughout the world.

302
00:17:40,214 --> 00:17:42,356
And uncommon or rare items are rewards

303
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,518
that can only be found at certain locations

304
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,540
or for completing certain types of content.

305
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:53,337
And player customization is important for both role-playing and mechanical gameplay preferences.

306
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,681
Ghost offers a wealth of cosmetic options to customize Jyn's look,

307
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:00,944
and an array of charms that offer unique gameplay perks.

308
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:07,370
Players can make the Ghost experience their own by personalizing Jyn's appearance and their combat build.

309
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:09,653
Finally,

310
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:12,770
reward players for their exploration with fast travel.

311
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,191
This will keep them excited to explore more

312
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:17,412
and not fatigued by re-traveling areas

313
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,492
they have explored already.

314
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:23,754
Another term we use at Sucker Punch is player safari.

315
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:27,896
We use this term to refer to intentional exploration.

316
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:31,058
We believe this occurs when player has developed

317
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:33,219
enough information to know how to look

318
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:34,179
for something desirable,

319
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,600
but doesn't have perfect knowledge of where to go.

320
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:44,213
So the canonical example is finding an apple in an orchard. Players know if they want to find an

321
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:49,415
apple, that they can't if they can't make it to the grocery store, that apples grow on trees.

322
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:53,817
And apple trees are always found together with other apple trees in an orchard. So

323
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:57,958
if you're looking for an apple, you should start by looking for an orchard.

324
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:03,907
When an identifiable weenie is always associated with a specific reward,

325
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:06,648
it fulfills the apple-on-the-orchard metaphor.

326
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:10,010
All of Ghost's open-world content follows this model.

327
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,032
For example, those black smoke signals,

328
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:16,733
they lead to Mongol-occupied territory, or liberation content.

329
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:20,895
And if you complete those content, you'll often earn stance progress

330
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:23,396
or rare craft materials for upgrading your sword.

331
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,581
Those Torii Gates we talked about earlier, they lead to Shinto Shrines,

332
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:34,704
and Shinto Shrines end with an Omomori Charm for gameplay, customization,

333
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:37,445
and also another rare resource reward.

334
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:42,548
Steam rising around the red maple leaf tree is an Onsen,

335
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:47,190
and those Onsens are great opportunities for Jin to reflect on content experiences

336
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,671
and get a little stat boost to his health.

337
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:55,575
We discussed how Ghost of Tsushima creates a world that invites the player to explore

338
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,476
and rewards them for their curiosity.

339
00:19:58,376 --> 00:20:02,018
Ghost of Tsushima builds on this foundation to keep players immersed in the world with

340
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:07,842
a unique spin on several familiar and common open-world experiences to achieve a more natural

341
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:08,482
exploration.

342
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:12,886
Every open world game needs to help players find their way

343
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:16,447
to the next mission objective or to a player-targeted location.

344
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:19,568
Having content that self-advertises in-world

345
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:22,149
is a great first step at drawing players to content,

346
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:25,110
but it isn't sufficient for helping players navigate

347
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,190
through a mission's progression.

348
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,051
For that, we needed something much more dynamic,

349
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,632
which could point the player in the right direction

350
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,152
from any spot in the world.

351
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:36,153
Finding our way to lead the player

352
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:37,814
and keep them present in the world

353
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:39,294
was a lot like Jen's journey.

354
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:41,543
We weren't successful out of the gate.

355
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,505
We had to experiment and evolve our strategies

356
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:45,766
before we found success.

357
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:50,669
It may surprise you, but when we started out building Ghost,

358
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:52,290
we actually started with a compass.

359
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:55,152
We were tackling a lot of new challenges,

360
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,474
and a familiar wayfinding tool helped

361
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:59,155
reduce some of the initial questions

362
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:02,257
and uncertainty of building content in a brand new IP.

363
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:07,292
Our compass provided a one-stop shop for all wayfinding needs for a player.

364
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:12,574
Specifically, the compass pointed the player in the direction of mission objectives,

365
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:17,856
including multiple at one time. It advertised discovered and undiscovered locations,

366
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:22,478
like that outpost or question marks for content that I passed nearby.

367
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:26,699
And it pointed in the direction of player tagged locations.

368
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:39,146
The compass succeeded in helping players navigate the island,

369
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:42,287
and so we initially piled on and added more UI

370
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:44,328
to communicate other information to the player.

371
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:47,489
As seen in this video, we tried using the compass

372
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,270
to communicate AI in Counter State.

373
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,731
Yellow meant the Monkles had detected a threat,

374
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,153
and red meant you were detected.

375
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,009
As we made progress building the world and content of Tsushima, we started to notice some problems with the compass though.

376
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:21,421
During missions, players were constantly looking at the compass for direction and information instead of looking at the world.

377
00:22:23,032 --> 00:22:31,039
For example, in this video, a player ends up with too much information about the mission

378
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:36,383
and it ends up ruining the exploration and their presence exploring the war camp.

379
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:41,227
Specifically, they were able to look up at the compass and see exactly where the mission

380
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:42,028
objectives were.

381
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:47,121
They could know where they needed to go to find the falcons or know where they needed to go to

382
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:52,043
find the black powder caches. They just needed to look at the compass and walk forward in the

383
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:59,187
direction of the mission objectives. Similarly, the compass provided too much information and

384
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:05,190
could ruin presence during missions narratively focused as well. This ride along with Norio,

385
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:11,092
this conversation, the compass could distract players because they were looking to see where

386
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:12,013
they wanted to be going.

387
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:17,189
and they could also end up seeing information about nearby content like a roadblock.

388
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,453
Many players became distracted and weren't interested in following Norio because they

389
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:27,256
wanted to follow off to the other information or content that they found nearby.

390
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:33,820
During exploration, players would see visual landmarks and be drawn to them,

391
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:38,003
but would have no way of intentionally tagging those locations to pursue them.

392
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,601
Worse, those locations would become completely lost

393
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:45,762
when descending from a vista and navigating through a forest.

394
00:23:47,863 --> 00:23:51,385
So, we implemented a Breath of the Wild-like navigation system.

395
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:55,987
In addition to being a response to helping players keep track of distant landmarks,

396
00:23:56,587 --> 00:24:00,929
it also was meant to give players more intentionality in exploration.

397
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,391
Players can enter an orienteering mode by pressing the touchpad.

398
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:11,292
They could then aim their camera around the world and drop a pin they could later reference via the compass.

399
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:16,917
Orienteering mode also allowed players to discover and log new destinations.

400
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:24,663
Aiming at a landmark in the distance will allow the player to log that location as a place to explore now or archive for later.

401
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,931
This was meant to encourage players to reach vistas and survey the world.

402
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:35,873
It was also an insurance policy against losing track of a location

403
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:38,273
once the player descended into the thick forest

404
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:40,534
or dropped down the other side of a mountain.

405
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:46,456
Orientary mode also offered a really fast way to fast travel

406
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:47,896
to a previously visited location.

407
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:51,194
If the player had already visited Kenji's watchtower,

408
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:54,717
all they needed to do was aim their camera at the watchtower

409
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:57,119
and press triangle, and they could quickly

410
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,600
travel to that location.

411
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:03,384
Orienteering represented our first step

412
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:05,225
towards providing the player with tools

413
00:25:05,285 --> 00:25:07,027
to find their way in the round of the world

414
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:10,370
and discover content in a more intentional and immersive

415
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:10,690
manner.

416
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:14,633
Unfortunately, players still relied heavily on the compass

417
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:15,794
to navigate the world.

418
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:18,980
and didn't engage with orienteering as much as we'd hoped.

419
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:24,101
In order to further lean into a sense of exploration and discovery,

420
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:28,703
we tried another orienteering mode to completely remove the persistent compass

421
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:34,185
and required players to look at the world. Our goal was to simulate the experience of

422
00:25:34,345 --> 00:25:38,006
actual wayfinding with a map and compass when you don't have GPS.

423
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:45,106
We added a mini map, yikes, with unique icons positioned at key geographic landmarks in the world.

424
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:46,527
These were the mountain peaks.

425
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:52,551
And when you entered orienteering mode, those icons would render in the world if you had line of sight to them.

426
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:57,594
A compass was added to the map to imply what direction the player was looking,

427
00:25:58,054 --> 00:26:01,196
but there was no indication on the map that showed the player where they were.

428
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:05,459
Players had to triangulate their location using the mini map

429
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,240
with the world icons in the world for where they were.

430
00:26:08,732 --> 00:26:09,654
and where they want it to go.

431
00:26:09,674 --> 00:26:12,702
Here's an example of a player looking around,

432
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,790
using the mini-map and some icons in the world

433
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:17,595
to try and figure out where they are.

434
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,701
As you might imagine, engagement was low.

435
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:46,684
This was possibly exacerbated by a lack of training,

436
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:48,926
but more likely by confusing controls.

437
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:51,528
Players had a hard time understanding

438
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:54,271
the value of the functionality orienteering provided.

439
00:26:55,512 --> 00:26:57,934
At about this time, one of our creative directors

440
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,516
made the comment he really wished

441
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,217
there was something that could just

442
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:02,839
point the player in the direction of content,

443
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,181
like the sword in Shadow of the Colossus.

444
00:27:06,032 --> 00:27:09,074
All you had to do was press a button and you'd pull out your sword,

445
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:13,457
and then you could look around to where the light actually focused in the world.

446
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:17,860
The concept team went to work and came up with several ideas

447
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,641
with adventure as the goal in mind.

448
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:25,385
One example was ghostly animal apparitions meant to represent Kami.

449
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:29,328
They'd appear and lead the player in the direction of content before vanishing.

450
00:27:31,745 --> 00:27:37,269
Another was god rays that could point through the forest and point out content opportunities.

451
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,352
And then there was the suggestion for the wind,

452
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:44,734
which we had made such a significant part of our visual identity.

453
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:50,919
The idea for the wind was inspired by a sequence in Kurosawa's Ujimbo,

454
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:53,401
where a wandering samurai is unsure where to go.

455
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:59,966
The samurai approaches a crossroads, bends down, and picks up a stick and throws it in the air.

456
00:28:00,822 --> 00:28:06,666
When it lands, the samurai uses this as a sign of fate and walks down the path in this fixed direction.

457
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:14,351
We were very moved by this idea and it ultimately led to this opening shot from our E3 debut.

458
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:26,319
Our initial tests came after our E3 debut and use a date debug menu to set the wind to blow towards the closest location of your choosing.

459
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:31,773
It could be an onsen, it could be a mission start, a roadblock, a collectible, anything.

460
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:36,540
When the target was set, wind gusts would blow particles in the direction of the target,

461
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,565
and the foliage and grass in the world would bend and bow in the direction the wind was

462
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:40,925
blowing.

463
00:28:41,626 --> 00:28:42,267
It looked like this.

464
00:28:57,457 --> 00:29:01,619
We asked members of our team to see if they could follow the wind towards various locations.

465
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:07,761
And while there were hiccups, it worked well enough out of the box to consider making the wind an actual player tool.

466
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:15,985
The initial wind test, coupled with the warm reception at E3 to our reduced HUD, led us to set a new goal for exploration.

467
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:23,548
Reduce reliance on UI and double down on our hope of encouraging exploration through looking at the world.

468
00:29:24,568 --> 00:29:25,889
To do this, we introduced...

469
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:27,485
The Windicator.

470
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:30,728
So what is the Windicator?

471
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:33,510
Well, besides being our internal development name

472
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,172
for the guiding wind, it was a full-blown compass replacement.

473
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:40,475
At this point, we completely sunset our compass

474
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:41,675
and never returned.

475
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:44,918
To replace the compass, the wind blows

476
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,299
in the direction of the player's current tracked target.

477
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,522
The tracked target could be a mission or a tagged location

478
00:29:51,562 --> 00:29:54,485
like a player pin or a previously visited destination.

479
00:29:56,217 --> 00:29:57,698
The question RT wanted to know was,

480
00:29:57,818 --> 00:29:59,099
how do I set the WINS target?

481
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,540
The answer was, there are two ways,

482
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,502
and they could use existing interfaces

483
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:06,583
the player interact with it already all the time.

484
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:10,446
The first was the world map where players would look around

485
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:13,908
and explore for undiscovered content nearby

486
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:15,709
and locations that they wanted to go.

487
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,131
The second was our journal,

488
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,952
which listed all of the different missions

489
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:22,373
the player discovered so far.

490
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,601
Once the player had chosen a target,

491
00:30:27,282 --> 00:30:29,983
a HUD indicator let the player know the target had changed

492
00:30:30,123 --> 00:30:31,864
and what the wind was now targeting.

493
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:35,645
What did the wind indicator mean for missions?

494
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,346
Well, first, the wind can either track

495
00:30:38,427 --> 00:30:39,707
a mission or something else.

496
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:42,008
It can't do both at the same time.

497
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,590
Second, if you were following a mission,

498
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,771
the current mission objective became the target

499
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:48,771
tracked by the wind.

500
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:51,252
And finally, as the mission progresses,

501
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:54,153
the wind would auto-update to target the current objective.

502
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,655
Our initial attempt replacing the compass

503
00:30:58,895 --> 00:31:00,256
wasn't an immediate success.

504
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:03,437
Some players were excited about the new change,

505
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:04,818
the possibility for the future,

506
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,738
but other players complained

507
00:31:06,758 --> 00:31:08,459
they had a hard time following the wind.

508
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:10,340
They were getting lost in missions

509
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,421
and just wanted the comfort of the compass.

510
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:15,822
We realized there were three areas we needed to address.

511
00:31:16,663 --> 00:31:17,943
First, visibility.

512
00:31:18,424 --> 00:31:21,325
We needed to make the wind legible in all situations.

513
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:23,686
Second, navigation.

514
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:28,125
needed to make it easier to follow the wind through and around obstacles in the world.

515
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:33,627
And three, mission integration. We had to ensure all missions followed the new single

516
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:38,548
target wind model and all mission objectives were supported with appropriate wind feedback.

517
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:44,410
So, related to visibility, we probed for more information and we found that there

518
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,531
were a few situations that notably stood out. First one,

519
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:53,596
Riding your horse fast through the forest. It was hard to make out the wind particles from the biome

520
00:31:54,036 --> 00:32:02,202
particles of the area, especially running at fast speeds. Second, bad weather or inclement states

521
00:32:02,262 --> 00:32:08,306
like heavy rain, snow, or fog. Same sort of problem. The windicators particle effects

522
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:13,429
were hard to distinguish from the rain and other effects that were associated with the biome.

523
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:18,905
So we made some changes to address the feedback in a few ways.

524
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:23,468
The first was we amped up the strength of the wind on the world

525
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:26,749
so that when the wind blew, the foliage and the trees

526
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:28,951
would all bend in more significant ways

527
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:31,372
to help point in the direction the player was to go.

528
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:35,394
The second, we increased the particle visibility

529
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:37,535
and we increased the identity of the wind particles.

530
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:40,177
We added streamers to distinguish the wind

531
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,978
from other ambient particles in the world.

532
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:44,810
And third, we added a gust button.

533
00:32:45,451 --> 00:32:49,114
This way the player could trigger a gust of wind whenever they want it to help clear the way.

534
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:50,696
Here's what it looked like.

535
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:12,156
The wind generally wants the player to travel in a straight line towards their target.

536
00:33:12,697 --> 00:33:15,919
And while it's fun to do a little navigation around an obstacle,

537
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,160
it's frustrating when you can't follow the wind in the direction it's blowing.

538
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:23,843
It could be a river you can't cross with your horse, or a mountain you can't climb.

539
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:28,966
But if the player hits a cliff or a wall and has to go more than 10 seconds in either direction

540
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:33,469
to find a point to ascend or cross, the world begins to feel very closed off.

541
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,530
So, what did we do?

542
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:40,729
Well, at first, the particles needed to become terrain aware.

543
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,870
They needed to be funneled through paths and up and over

544
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,752
cliffs to give players a better sense of micro-navigation

545
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:49,833
that player needed to do and make.

546
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:54,175
So we also needed to add climbing

547
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:55,476
paths in the open world.

548
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:58,697
This was a response to not being able to follow

549
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,858
the wind in the direction that it was pointing.

550
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,417
Mission integration with the Windicator was a big challenge.

551
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:09,719
We had built several missions with the assumption of a compass

552
00:34:09,779 --> 00:34:13,141
that were just not congruent with the new model the Windicator demanded.

553
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:16,823
We had to review every mission and every objective kind

554
00:34:16,863 --> 00:34:18,964
to determine how to improve the user experience.

555
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:22,166
First up, multiple objectives.

556
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:25,027
We didn't have an interface to select an objective,

557
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:28,209
and the wind can only have one location tracked at a time.

558
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:33,257
So we made the decision only one objective at a time for a mission,

559
00:34:33,617 --> 00:34:36,459
and those missions with multiple objectives had to be reworked.

560
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,182
Mission starts. We actually had some missions that would auto start

561
00:34:42,643 --> 00:34:47,266
by entering a volume when you are nearby. With the windicator, this meant that a new

562
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:51,108
location would be auto-tracked, and that was confusing when players

563
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:53,510
hadn't chosen the location for the wind to blow.

564
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:58,253
So we made a new decision that no mission can start by entering a volume.

565
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,895
All missions needed to have an interact to start.

566
00:35:02,956 --> 00:35:06,559
Lots of our missions had objectives for talking to an NPC.

567
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:09,321
And as part of tracking this location,

568
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:12,964
the wind would continue to blow at the NPC until you interacted with him or her.

569
00:35:14,525 --> 00:35:17,547
This started to feel very disruptive and unnecessary.

570
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:21,660
So we made a decision that the wind needed to deactivate

571
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,480
when you were close to the NPC

572
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,341
and reactivate when walking away.

573
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,502
We had several mission objectives like this

574
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,322
about entering and leaving areas nearby

575
00:35:33,782 --> 00:35:37,023
some sort of volume, tracking footsteps

576
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:40,724
or entering a search area or combat encounter nearby.

577
00:35:40,744 --> 00:35:43,725
We had many of these and many more similar issues

578
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:45,905
to talk to NPC objectives.

579
00:35:46,662 --> 00:35:50,305
And so we made the decision that the wind needed to deactivate

580
00:35:50,405 --> 00:35:53,027
when entering one of these areas and reactivate

581
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,588
when exiting one of these areas.

582
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,372
As we sanded off rough edges, the Windicator

583
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,674
helped strip away more and more UI

584
00:36:02,134 --> 00:36:03,955
and grew to celebrate the beauty of our world.

585
00:36:04,936 --> 00:36:06,918
It was becoming a soulful part of our game,

586
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:09,980
and we decided to re-record several Golden Path cutscenes

587
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,021
to better integrate the feature into the story.

588
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:18,597
It turns out the actual Mongol invasion of Japan in 1274 is where the term kamikaze or divine wind

589
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:23,520
originated. The belief is that the wind storms that occurred during the invasion were what pushed

590
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:28,662
the Mongols back and made them retreat. To honor this important moment we thought it would be a

591
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:33,885
great lyrical opportunity for the divine winds that helped save Japan to also help Jin on his

592
00:36:33,945 --> 00:36:40,028
journey. So we rebranded the windigator as the guiding wind through a close personal connection

593
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:40,428
to Jin.

594
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:55,382
How do I see?

595
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:33,865
The guiding wind helped players to naturally path to their target by observing the world around them.

596
00:37:34,346 --> 00:37:38,531
No UI element pulled their attention away, preventing them from missing cues of the world.

597
00:37:39,312 --> 00:37:43,717
Unfortunately, the question marks that appeared on the compass for undiscovered content were gone.

598
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:48,523
We needed new ways to help players discover the content they were now missing.

599
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:53,087
We broke down undiscovered locations into two categories.

600
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:57,110
The first was big locations, locations defined by volumes

601
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,292
like this roadblock or this war camp.

602
00:37:59,912 --> 00:38:01,734
They had visual elements that were large enough

603
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:04,096
to draw players from afar and allowed players

604
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:06,378
to discover their content relatively easily.

605
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:09,540
These types of content notably ended up

606
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:10,821
all being Mongol themed.

607
00:38:12,163 --> 00:38:15,824
We also had small locations like a haiku or bamboo game

608
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:17,744
or on-center mission starts.

609
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:20,245
And these had recognizable visual elements too,

610
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:23,125
as we discussed, but it could be hard to see

611
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:26,106
if you were in a forest or on the other side of a cliff.

612
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,027
And we decided that players needed some extra help

613
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,127
finding these locations.

614
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:33,127
We didn't want though, to make the smaller locations

615
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:35,588
too much easier to find because we wanted the player

616
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:37,568
to retain the feeling of finding a secret.

617
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:43,164
So we asked ourselves, what in-world method can we use to help players find these smaller

618
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:48,910
hidden locations? The island helping Jin fight back the Mongols was a strong developing theme.

619
00:38:49,651 --> 00:38:52,153
The people of the island were helping Jin make his gear stronger.

620
00:38:52,173 --> 00:38:58,260
The wind helped Jin find his way. What else could exist in the world that could help Jin

621
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,101
discover content?

622
00:39:01,147 --> 00:39:05,089
At this time, we were spawning deer systemically in the world near lots of our content.

623
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:09,932
Our cultural research informed us that deer were regarded as a sacred animal in Japan.

624
00:39:10,612 --> 00:39:12,954
Their presence was helping us build an immersive world,

625
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:15,275
but we didn't want to reward the player for killing them.

626
00:39:17,216 --> 00:39:21,219
Following NPCs was something we were doing all across the game with Jyn's allies and missions.

627
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,742
So we decided to try turning hunting on its head and see if animals could lead the player to content.

628
00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:30,364
And so, our first lassie was actually a deer.

629
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:34,959
We learned pretty quickly, though, that deer can't climb cliffs,

630
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:38,201
and so their ability to successfully lead players to content was limited.

631
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:42,443
Luckily, we were also working on AI for another animal NPC

632
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:44,704
that could navigate cliffs because it could fly.

633
00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:49,847
It turned out we were also working on bird AI for the mongrel eagle

634
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,848
that could help villains detect you faster.

635
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:55,289
And we decided to see if we could repurpose that behavior

636
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:58,211
to be an aid for the player rather than something to be avoided.

637
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:05,906
Pretty quickly, we discovered that following a bird worked across cliffs, rivers, and lakes.

638
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:11,411
Actually, not only did it work, but it was fun to try to chase a bird through a forest

639
00:40:11,872 --> 00:40:15,275
and across obstacles like the lakes that the deer couldn't traverse.

640
00:40:17,777 --> 00:40:21,221
So how does it work? The golden bird will...

641
00:40:22,778 --> 00:40:28,560
Within 150 meters of a piece of content that you haven't discovered, the golden bird will spawn systemically off-screen.

642
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:36,282
The bird calls out to grab your player's attention and then flies off-screen, and tries to fly continue on towards its location.

643
00:40:37,622 --> 00:40:47,925
This turns a piece of content that could otherwise be a needle in a haystack, for example, being blocked by the blanket of a forest, and makes the content radiate out like a magnet pulling you toward it.

644
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:52,199
This is a map of Tsushima and all of the content

645
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:54,199
that the guide bird will actually lead you to.

646
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:57,800
You can see how the dots actually represent the diameter

647
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,561
in which the bird will draw your attention

648
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:02,182
and bring you closer towards content.

649
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:04,722
It really helped us make a lot of our content

650
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,123
much, much more discoverable.

651
00:41:08,484 --> 00:41:12,165
The guide bird was a success because it was a slot machine.

652
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:14,005
It could lead you to missions.

653
00:41:14,898 --> 00:41:18,060
It could lead you to many content and it could lead you to cosmetics.

654
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:23,545
You never knew what you were going to find, but you could be sure it would not lead you to a death trap.

655
00:41:24,305 --> 00:41:28,328
And because it was systemic, the guide bird could pretty much be added anywhere.

656
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:34,933
There were pitfalls, though. Unfortunately, there were several when building the guide bird.

657
00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:39,677
Content needed to be marked up with metadata that indicated where the bird would lead you.

658
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,200
some content was initially missed.

659
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:44,542
And this required an extensive audit,

660
00:41:44,942 --> 00:41:46,743
working with the content and QA team

661
00:41:46,763 --> 00:41:48,084
to ensure everything was covered.

662
00:41:49,525 --> 00:41:51,726
We also had to make it so the bird didn't show up

663
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:52,987
during missions and cut scenes.

664
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:55,489
It was distracting to have the bird appear

665
00:41:55,669 --> 00:41:59,411
during a walk and talk with Norio or Masako.

666
00:42:00,072 --> 00:42:01,373
It was negatively impacting

667
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:02,794
the player's focus on the mission.

668
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,555
We added reject volumes to these missions.

669
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:09,078
These became so pervasive that the bird never appeared.

670
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:12,997
and this required another audit to make sure that these were scoped

671
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:14,917
and correctly the right size.

672
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:22,039
Another guide animal we used to help players find hidden secrets was a fox.

673
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:26,020
This animal started out just as an ambient NPC,

674
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,640
but based on the learnings from the golden bird,

675
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:33,222
we decided to invest further in the theme of animals helping the player.

676
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:40,659
When you find a fox, you follow it via short chase to an Inari shrine.

677
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:46,460
Unlike the golden bird, all fox follows are bespoke and authored to lead the player to a hidden location.

678
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,521
This is part of why they're always found at specific starting points.

679
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,142
The goal is to give the player the feeling of finding a hidden secret.

680
00:42:56,202 --> 00:43:01,263
Fox follows are optional, though, as the player can find the Inari shrine without following the fox.

681
00:43:02,382 --> 00:43:04,623
This is perfectly acceptable because in the end,

682
00:43:04,864 --> 00:43:07,865
we are most interested in the player getting the endorphin hit

683
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:09,486
for finding a secret.

684
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:24,735
Following a fox offered a range of extrinsic rewards

685
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:26,916
to keep players invested over the course of the game.

686
00:43:27,596 --> 00:43:30,158
Preying at the shrine unlocks new charm slots for Jyn.

687
00:43:30,843 --> 00:43:35,407
You'll get your first for free, but afterwards the cadence for unlocking additional charms requires

688
00:43:35,427 --> 00:43:40,972
an increasing number of shrines honored. After all four slots are unlocked, Foxfellows continue

689
00:43:40,992 --> 00:43:45,676
to reward new charms that increase in power the more shrines you honored. And of course,

690
00:43:45,837 --> 00:43:49,140
following a fox also had a chance, ending in the much beloved moment of

691
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,942
getting to pet the fox and take your picture.

692
00:43:55,289 --> 00:43:58,912
Since these were hand-authored, we tried to make them as charming and engaging as we could,

693
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:04,458
whether it was animations from the fox to beckon you forward, or leading you down a

694
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:06,000
path that required platforming.

695
00:44:06,941 --> 00:44:09,664
We wanted these sequences to be short and not too difficult.

696
00:44:10,144 --> 00:44:14,409
However, they were more enjoyable when there were moments where you thought you'd lost

697
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:16,291
the fox and then had to find him again.

698
00:44:17,462 --> 00:44:19,104
We didn't want you to lose him too often,

699
00:44:19,604 --> 00:44:23,047
so we added AI behavior so the fox would double back on the path

700
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,409
and recover the player if he got too far behind.

701
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:27,751
There were pitfalls.

702
00:44:28,591 --> 00:44:31,013
Unfortunately, we had too many of these,

703
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:34,316
and they were too frequent and didn't have enough content variety.

704
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:36,798
We had around 50 of them, it turned out.

705
00:44:37,578 --> 00:44:40,681
Players engaged with these just enough to earn their four charm slots

706
00:44:40,821 --> 00:44:42,963
and then didn't always continue much after.

707
00:44:45,512 --> 00:44:49,675
Our lost animal aid was found not by the virtue of stumbling upon it in the world,

708
00:44:50,096 --> 00:44:52,638
but instead by wearing the Traveler's armor attire.

709
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:56,161
The Traveler's attire is one of many armors in Ghost,

710
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:59,323
and its perks are all targeted at helping with exploration.

711
00:45:01,005 --> 00:45:03,707
The really fun and interesting perk that this armor provides

712
00:45:04,088 --> 00:45:05,829
is it is effectively a metal detector,

713
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:09,312
and will spawn a helpful firefly when you are near certain collectibles.

714
00:45:10,852 --> 00:45:17,856
The Firefly leads the player gently by pulsing its light in concert with a slight fuzzing sound and a rumble on the controller.

715
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:24,820
The Firefly always stays near the player, but tries to position itself between the player and the collectible.

716
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:30,283
As the player gets closer to the collectible, the pulsing of the Firefly becomes more frequent.

717
00:45:32,044 --> 00:45:36,687
We tried simpler models before this with just the controller vibrating and no in-game aid.

718
00:45:37,507 --> 00:45:42,189
It worked okay, however, it didn't do a good job of providing directionality to the collectible,

719
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,992
or supporting the theme of the world or the island helping guide you.

720
00:45:46,972 --> 00:45:52,075
When we added the firefly, stumbling on collectibles became much easier and much more fun to do.

721
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:58,939
With the guiding winds as a means to find your way through the world and a set of guide animals

722
00:45:58,979 --> 00:46:03,982
to help you discover content nearby, we are left with one final natural exploration technique in

723
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:06,684
Koso-Tsushima, seeding new opportunities.

724
00:46:08,587 --> 00:46:11,148
As a wandering samurai in a Mongol-occupied world,

725
00:46:11,408 --> 00:46:13,829
how else can the player learn about new opportunities?

726
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,310
As the player travels across Tsushima,

727
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:20,111
Jin encounters many peasants and refugees attempting

728
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:21,612
to survive the Mongol invasion.

729
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,313
We want the player to feel these NPCs have their own stories

730
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,114
and knowledge of the world around them

731
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:28,934
to help enrich the hostility of the world.

732
00:46:29,815 --> 00:46:31,635
These are stories the player could help address

733
00:46:32,015 --> 00:46:34,496
and knowledge that can help aid the player on his journey.

734
00:46:35,256 --> 00:46:37,137
We call these NPCs Criers.

735
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,979
Experientially, these NPCs deepen the relationship of Jyn with the people of Tsushima.

736
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,700
We want the player to feel the peasants of Tsushima help you because you are helping them.

737
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,261
Mechanically, we use these NPCs to give player information we call a rumor

738
00:46:54,722 --> 00:46:57,682
about content at a new location the player hasn't explored yet.

739
00:47:00,563 --> 00:47:03,844
Are you hunting for Shigenori's Heavenly Strike as well, my lord?

740
00:47:04,224 --> 00:47:07,505
Hmm. That technique is only one of myth.

741
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,623
The musician Yamato insists the myth is real.

742
00:47:10,643 --> 00:47:14,988
I'm not surprised. People often speak of his stories with excitement.

743
00:47:15,688 --> 00:47:24,918
I heard the tale near Komatsu Forge. If it's as powerful as the story claims, let's hope you never face the technique in battle.

744
00:47:36,736 --> 00:47:39,938
These NPCs are found across Tsushima dynamically

745
00:47:40,138 --> 00:47:42,740
when traveling the open world at small points of interest,

746
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,343
like this house, or at hostage encounter rescue situations.

747
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,825
Ambulantly, they're found when visiting

748
00:47:48,885 --> 00:47:51,086
a hub like a town or refugee camp

749
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:52,948
or a liberated Mongol location.

750
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:56,971
Each NPC provides information related to the context

751
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:57,911
that they are encountered.

752
00:47:58,652 --> 00:48:00,994
Specifically, for example, a hostage

753
00:48:01,354 --> 00:48:02,975
rescued on the side of the road will

754
00:48:03,015 --> 00:48:05,437
provide info about a Mongol-occupied location

755
00:48:05,477 --> 00:48:05,797
nearby.

756
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:12,272
A refugee or a traveler will provide access to the anthology of stories all across Tsushima.

757
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:16,876
In addition to rumoring a specific content location,

758
00:48:17,036 --> 00:48:21,940
criers also provide helpful hints for content opportunities and visual cues to look for.

759
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:30,928
A monk or a priestess will help the player find information about Shinto shrines or Inari shrines.

760
00:48:32,177 --> 00:48:35,880
And similarly, the Traveller will tell players information to look out for

761
00:48:36,341 --> 00:48:38,563
that will lead them to Bamboo, Haiku,

762
00:48:39,164 --> 00:48:41,906
or even tell you initially to follow the Golden Bird.

763
00:48:44,249 --> 00:48:47,772
Various factors ensure a player is neither constantly bombarded by Cryos

764
00:48:47,832 --> 00:48:49,854
or constantly running into the same NPC

765
00:48:50,014 --> 00:48:51,556
offering to tell you about his lost brother.

766
00:48:52,036 --> 00:48:54,719
Here's a look at a couple of the budgets we use to control this.

767
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:56,622
Content distance.

768
00:48:56,962 --> 00:48:58,962
Generally, we don't want to rumor a content that

769
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:00,282
is far away from the crier.

770
00:49:00,863 --> 00:49:03,483
We want to prioritize things that are closest to you.

771
00:49:03,603 --> 00:49:05,523
For example, a crier outside of a Zamo

772
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:09,124
should tell you about a war camp in a Zamo, not up in Kashine.

773
00:49:11,184 --> 00:49:12,785
Next is content limits.

774
00:49:13,105 --> 00:49:15,465
We control the amount of a particular type of content

775
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,845
that can be rumored at any time.

776
00:49:17,286 --> 00:49:18,926
In this way, the player doesn't end up

777
00:49:18,966 --> 00:49:21,646
with a map full of icons that lead to analysis paralysis.

778
00:49:22,066 --> 00:49:22,586
For example.

779
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:25,636
In Region, we limit in Northern Utsuhara,

780
00:49:25,856 --> 00:49:29,997
the player to only be able to have two rumors for Tales of Tsushima at one time.

781
00:49:31,817 --> 00:49:36,178
And this way you don't get too many Tales of Tsushima to pursue without,

782
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,519
before you are told about another one.

783
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,699
We also use Crier Zones.

784
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:45,620
These help us control how Criers appear in ambient spaces,

785
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,180
how many NPCs in an area can be a Crier,

786
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,781
or how far away one Crier must be from another.

787
00:49:51,972 --> 00:49:52,852
And we have cool-downs.

788
00:49:53,092 --> 00:49:54,653
And these help us control frequency,

789
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:56,673
like how long it's been since the player has

790
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:59,754
encountered any crier, and how long it's

791
00:49:59,774 --> 00:50:02,935
been since a specific NPC has been a crier in a town, which

792
00:50:02,995 --> 00:50:05,255
helps with variation when turning to towns.

793
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:06,856
Things we learned.

794
00:50:07,136 --> 00:50:08,796
Criers were initially all one voice.

795
00:50:09,056 --> 00:50:10,376
Anyone could talk about anything.

796
00:50:10,656 --> 00:50:13,317
We developed roles to help players provide more context.

797
00:50:14,057 --> 00:50:17,338
Criers made it so moving around content or mission starts

798
00:50:17,398 --> 00:50:19,278
was also more flexible for player discovery.

799
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:26,869
So we discussed how in Ghost we approached building a world to invite exploration through

800
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:32,854
environmental design, stumble upon content, and rewarding exploration. And we reviewed how Ghost

801
00:50:32,894 --> 00:50:37,958
sought to create a more immersive and natural exploration experience via in-world aids to help

802
00:50:37,998 --> 00:50:44,083
with wayfinding, discovering content, and seeding new opportunities. I hope you found some nugget of

803
00:50:44,123 --> 00:50:46,085
inspiration to talk to apply to your games.

804
00:50:47,014 --> 00:50:49,475
If you enjoyed the talk and are interested to learn more

805
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:51,276
about the development of Ghost, I

806
00:50:51,336 --> 00:50:54,258
recommend these two talks from members of my team.

807
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,699
Last, if any of these challenges and approaches

808
00:50:57,759 --> 00:50:59,340
sound like something you'd be interested in,

809
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,721
come check out our website.

810
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:02,541
We're hiring across a number of areas

811
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:03,642
and would love to hear from you.

812
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,863
Thanks again to everyone for attending,

813
00:51:06,143 --> 00:51:07,064
and have a great GDC.

814
00:51:07,084 --> 00:51:07,144
GDC.
