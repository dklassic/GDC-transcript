1
00:00:05,815 --> 00:00:11,941
Okay, so I think I'm going to get started. It is 11.20. We still have some people joining us.

2
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:18,788
I'd like to ask that if you have noise-making devices, and I'm pretty confident that all of

3
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:26,335
you do, if you could mute them, that would be ideal. Just because otherwise I might lose my

4
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,978
train of thought and that would be a bummer.

5
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:37,319
My name is Janet Ebsen. I am the community manager for Congregate.com.

6
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:43,570
Here because of a really strange and interesting life.

7
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,051
I started out as a social worker.

8
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:52,174
I did, I worked with adolescents with severe emotional and behavioral disturbances.

9
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:56,597
And then after a while I felt a little bit burned out about that.

10
00:00:57,237 --> 00:01:00,979
Significantly because I hated talking on the telephone, which I've later discovered is

11
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,362
common in our world, but at the time people thought it was a little flaky, so I moved

12
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:10,124
into nonprofit management and other things and ended up at Congregate a few years ago.

13
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:16,273
And it's really unexpected to me, all the ways in which my various sort of wayfinding

14
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:22,803
jobs have all sort of coalesced to make this, to prepare me for what I do now, which I love.

15
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,942
So, in addition to that, there's something you need to know about me, and that's that I'm a storyteller.

16
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:36,544
If you ask me a question, I will probably respond with a story, and the story has a purpose.

17
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:44,187
I come from sturdy peasant stock, and one of the values that I got from them is telling stories.

18
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:50,549
It's a way that we remember the people who came before us. It's a way that we learn from their experiences.

19
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,162
And it's a way that we process and understand the world around us.

20
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:58,464
So today, I'm going to be telling you some stories.

21
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:02,286
I'm telling you those stories for reasons.

22
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:06,749
I'm hoping that, well, I'm confident that in a week or a month,

23
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,090
you won't remember my outline.

24
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,292
But I'm hoping that when you need them,

25
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:13,133
my stories will come back to you,

26
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:16,315
and they will teach you what you need to know at that time.

27
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:18,256
So let's get started.

28
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:22,345
It would be good if I could advance.

29
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:23,446
There we go.

30
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:26,047
So my first story is about this lady.

31
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:31,271
She is the CEO of Congregate, where I work.

32
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:36,135
More to the point, for this story, she's an aunt and she's a knitter.

33
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:41,979
Emily's niece, Molly, is now seven.

34
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:44,140
The picture's a little old, but it's such a cute picture.

35
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:49,044
Molly asked Emily to make her a skirt, a knitted skirt.

36
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:53,508
And those of you who have done any knitting know that this didn't happen overnight.

37
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:56,249
But eventually, sure enough, there was a knitted skirt.

38
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,070
But the problem was that it was a little big.

39
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,430
It didn't quite fit.

40
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:06,972
Molly slimmed through the hips, as many very young children are, and it just wasn't quite

41
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:07,432
staying up.

42
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:09,753
So Emily had a problem.

43
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:12,394
And she didn't have a blueprint.

44
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:13,294
She didn't have a pattern.

45
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:19,396
What she did have was a crochet hook, an idea, and a willingness to try possible solutions.

46
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:28,239
So she figured out how to knit belt loops, and she added a black ribbon belt to the skirt.

47
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,543
And so the net result was that this skirt is dramatically cuter than it would have been

48
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,244
without the belt.

49
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:39,126
As soon as I saw this picture on Facebook, I went, oh, my God, that's it.

50
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:43,829
That's the beautiful thing that can come out of a crisis.

51
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:52,617
So what I'm hoping to tell you all about is ways in which you can find your communities

52
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:56,781
are in crisis, things are going wrong, and you're not going to know what to do.

53
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:03,246
But figure out what you can do, think creatively, move forward, and hopefully you're going to

54
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:07,209
end up with something that's better than it would have been if you had never had the crisis

55
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,630
at all.

56
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:11,753
So a little bit about Congregate.

57
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:14,536
Eric, where are you?

58
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,612
I chose this screenshot before I knew Eric was going to be here.

59
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:21,593
That's his game, Crusaders of the Lost Isles.

60
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:25,694
But anyway, we have over 100,000 games.

61
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:27,134
It's a gaming platform.

62
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:31,236
Any developer can upload their game to our site.

63
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:38,738
They get, in exchange for that, they can have player feedback, and they get a portion of

64
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,319
the advertising revenue that's earned by their game page.

65
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:49,490
If they have purchases in their game, they can integrate our virtual goods API and earn

66
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,491
some additional money that way.

67
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:55,414
We usually have about 300 to 400 virtual goods games on the site at any one time.

68
00:04:55,434 --> 00:04:59,657
A couple hundred forums, lots of different kinds of chat rooms.

69
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:00,958
There's a lot going on.

70
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:10,099
Within a month or so of my becoming community manager, Kongregate had one of the biggest

71
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,060
community crises in our history.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,900
So that was great timing.

73
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:19,902
In the process of trying to manage that crisis, we made a lot of mistakes.

74
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:25,203
Quite a few of those mistakes made things a lot worse instead of better.

75
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:31,285
And so when we did our postmortem at the end of about two weeks, here was how it started.

76
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:38,637
And the lady who wrote that is sitting here too.

77
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:45,425
But the point is that not everything we did made things worse.

78
00:05:45,806 --> 00:05:49,769
And so we paid attention to what made things worse and we talked with each other and we

79
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:52,491
kept doing more of the things that didn't make it worse.

80
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:58,335
And so it was expensive and it took a lot of time, it took a lot of work over those

81
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:04,420
couple weeks, but by the end of it we had actually figured out the basis of how we handle

82
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,162
all our community crises from now on.

83
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:07,882
Ever since then.

84
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:11,985
The things that we learned in that crisis have been what we do.

85
00:06:13,946 --> 00:06:18,989
And we also made a lot of really great relationships with players, and a lot of those folks are

86
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:20,190
still playing on our site.

87
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:24,573
I get messages from them sometimes, hey, can you take a look at this game?

88
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:25,694
It's giving me some trouble.

89
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:28,175
I really appreciate that thing you did four years ago.

90
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:29,956
I'm like, sure, I'll take a look.

91
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:30,557
That's great.

92
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:37,201
So I never would have thought it at the time, but in retrospect, I do believe that.

93
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:41,804
The effort and the financial costs were entirely worthwhile.

94
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:44,365
We absolutely got...

95
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:49,288
It was worth the cost, is what I'm saying.

96
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:54,490
And since then, I have had front row seats as many different developers have had many

97
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,591
different kinds of crises with their communities.

98
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:04,966
On a day-to-day basis on Kongregate, the developers and their community managers handle the crises

99
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:05,486
that come up.

100
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:10,728
But for something to escalate up to the point where it comes to my attention usually means

101
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:14,290
that everything is really hitting the fan and nobody has any idea what to do.

102
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,613
But the thing is that all community crises fundamentally come down to one issue, and

103
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:22,673
that's loss of trust.

104
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,304
For some reason, in some way, players are disappointed.

105
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:36,217
I had a lot of fun Googling disappointed cute animals for this slide.

106
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:40,397
Something did not go as expected.

107
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:42,878
They could be there was a bug in the game.

108
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:46,201
It could be that you didn't meet a launch date.

109
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:50,884
Maybe it was that they went looking for some support and couldn't find any.

110
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:53,926
It could also be that they had unrealistic expectations.

111
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:58,529
But for whatever reason, they don't trust you to make things right.

112
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,833
So to resolve your crisis, you need to rebuild trust and a confidence in you and how you're

113
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:06,474
going to handle problems in the future.

114
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:08,176
And this is possible.

115
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:15,621
And more to the point, it's also possible that after you've done that, your community

116
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,104
will know you better, they'll trust you more, and you'll have a better rapport than you

117
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,345
would have otherwise.

118
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:29,992
So there is exactly one tool that all of us bring to every situation that we're in, and

119
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:30,593
it's ourselves.

120
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:33,215
In social work, this is called use of self.

121
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:34,296
The understanding that...

122
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:42,108
The persona that we present will have an effect on whatever situation we find ourselves

123
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:42,268
in.

124
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:46,332
And so this means that you're a tool.

125
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:49,796
And I have pretty much the best job ever.

126
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:54,060
No, but persona, you are a tool.

127
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:58,264
And how people see you is what determines how they respond to you.

128
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:03,738
You'll be most effective in both preventing and managing crises if you're able to convey

129
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,360
that you are intelligent, principled, and fair.

130
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,862
When I'm interacting with frustrated players, I'm sympathetic, but I'm also competent and

131
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:13,443
in charge.

132
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:19,025
My underlying message is I care about your happiness and I am here to fix this.

133
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:26,700
Competent, principled, and fair is not at all the same thing as I know exactly what

134
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,842
we are going to do and we'll have this done by EOD.

135
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:33,425
Sometimes you'll know from the beginning what you're going to do.

136
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:38,049
Other times you're going to sort of have to dive in there with your metaphorical crochet

137
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:40,371
hook and figure out how to make some bell loops.

138
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:47,216
But the most important tool you'll have at your disposal is not a crochet hook, but yourself.

139
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:51,674
Like any tool, you need to know what you can and cannot do.

140
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:54,435
This Swiss Army knife has a lot of great features.

141
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:58,017
But if you wanted to fry an egg, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

142
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:02,720
Although I have spent some time thinking about how I would make a frying pan using those

143
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,161
tools, but that's beside the point.

144
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:10,924
Similarly, you need to be able to accurately assess what you can and cannot bring to community

145
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,365
crises.

146
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:16,768
Don't try to project a strength you don't have or it will damage your credibility because

147
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:17,728
they're going to see through you.

148
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:21,748
I am not the most tech savvy person who works at Congregate.

149
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:25,230
In fact, I might be the least tech savvy person who works at Congregate.

150
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,952
So when I dive into a crisis, there's a lot of, okay, so tell me what that means.

151
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:38,454
But because I don't pretend to be anything other than who I am, players find that disarming

152
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:40,975
instead of accusation worthy.

153
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:47,159
So, owning who you are is going to be a great strength to you in the long run.

154
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,543
Sometimes not easy, but it really is worth that journey.

155
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:59,829
Now, jumping back to the first story, when I was talking about the skirt that Emily made,

156
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:05,594
I feel the need to point out that she already knew how to knit when she started that skirt,

157
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:06,034
didn't she?

158
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:10,117
She had the core competencies that she needed to finish that project.

159
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:16,641
And I'm sorry to say that not every community manager I meet is great at interacting with

160
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:17,061
players.

161
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:22,627
I'm sure that you all are amazing, but for the sake of thoroughness, I feel like I just

162
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:24,689
need to touch on a couple of basics.

163
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:32,443
One of the things that Congregate does is that we choose and train members of our community

164
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:34,124
to be volunteer chat moderators.

165
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:40,446
And when we train those people, we don't start out by telling them how the banning and silencing

166
00:11:40,486 --> 00:11:40,987
tools work.

167
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:42,767
We don't start with punishment at all.

168
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:49,170
What we do is we start with teaching them the tools that they need to manage the community,

169
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:55,173
the chat room, and particular conversations without needing to resort to punitive measures.

170
00:11:56,694 --> 00:11:58,675
And I believe that community management is the same way.

171
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:04,279
That if you develop a certain kind of relationship with people, they are going to be more likely

172
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,803
to go in the direction that you are trying to herd them even though they are fundamentally

173
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,804
cats.

174
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:13,286
So here is the big secret.

175
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,310
If people like and respect you, they will trust you and they will do what you want.

176
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:25,664
It seems really obvious, doesn't it? And yet it's very common for people to overlook

177
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:31,587
that, I would say. So this may come as a surprise, but Internet

178
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:36,890
folks are not a big fan of authority figures. We are.

179
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:48,785
We all go through a life phase called individuation, typically when we're adolescents, but not

180
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:52,788
always, where we separate from our parents.

181
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:56,311
We start to question the things that they're telling us.

182
00:12:57,051 --> 00:13:00,474
And we begin to challenge why they have authority at all.

183
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:01,014
Right?

184
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:04,617
Like, why do I have to listen to you?

185
00:13:04,697 --> 00:13:05,918
Let's explore that.

186
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,782
I think a lot of players sort of present as though they are stuck in that phase.

187
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:15,905
Some of them actually are still adolescents, and so that's life appropriate.

188
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:21,549
But regardless, I think there's a culture on the Internet that says respect needs to

189
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:21,969
be earned.

190
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:23,810
It's not just granted to you automatically.

191
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:30,495
So in the face of this skepticism, how are you going to go about earning respect and

192
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:30,855
trust?

193
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:35,618
So the first thing is to be lenient.

194
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,782
If you address only the most important things, people are more likely to listen.

195
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:45,749
Say you have two problems. On this hand you have people who are posting in your forum

196
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,132
in text speak and it's annoying some of your players. Over here you have people who are

197
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:55,913
telling other people to kill themselves. Now I hope that you're going to recognize that

198
00:13:55,933 --> 00:14:00,835
this is a much more important problem. And so if you don't yammer about this, but focus

199
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:05,277
on this, people are going to pay attention, right? And so you want to appear reasonable

200
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:08,418
to most people and you want to focus on the things that actually matter.

201
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:18,406
I'm seeing a couple of people laugh. I love this slide. When I was redoing our moderator

202
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:25,014
training a few years back, I Googled images fairness, and this is what I got. Be fair

203
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:29,199
like the fairness frog, because the fairness frog is totally a thing. We've all heard of

204
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:30,161
the fairness frog.

205
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:33,765
And the randomness of that really appealed to me.

206
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,567
In fact, some of our moderators got together and bought me a frog squishable and sent it

207
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:42,588
to me.

208
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:44,149
So be fair, like the fairness frog.

209
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:51,191
But seriously, players will detect if you're biased, if you tend to be more lenient with

210
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:52,411
people who are your friends.

211
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,170
If you tend to be harsher to people who just annoy the piss out of you, they'll notice

212
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:05,398
and they will go, mm, mm-hmm, this person is not really all that, because they're biased.

213
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:09,126
The other thing that goes along with that is that you need to always be thinking about

214
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:11,347
what's best for the community as a whole.

215
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:13,008
You can't please every individual.

216
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:19,711
Somebody's going to be pissed, but reasonable people will be able to look at your decisions

217
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:25,234
and go, okay, so and so is annoyed, but she's clearly thinking about what's best for everybody.

218
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:26,975
I'm going to give her a pass.

219
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,358
So be lenient, or sorry, be nice, rather, but not a pushover.

220
00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:35,659
So if you're nice to people.

221
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,021
They will be more likely to be nice to you.

222
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:47,246
And also, if you are nice and calm, it makes it pretty much impossible to troll you.

223
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:49,688
I could tell you stories, but then I'd run over.

224
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,494
The other thing to keep in mind is that people will live up or down to your expectations.

225
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:02,000
This sounds like something that is just sort of happy-clappy community manager nonsense,

226
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,121
but it's like a real thing.

227
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:08,027
Like, there's psychological research about how people subtly communicate expectations

228
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,190
to each other and how people will...

229
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:16,916
tried either to elevate themselves or debase themselves to meet those expectations.

230
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:21,699
So if you treat people like they're punk kids, they'll probably act like punk kids.

231
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:27,202
But if you treat them like they're human beings who are capable of coolness, they'll try.

232
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:30,605
Like even if they are punk kids and they don't really know what that looks like, they're

233
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,165
going to try.

234
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,261
So, the last thing is to be transparent.

235
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:43,006
As an authority figure, players are going to want to know what the limits of your authority

236
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:44,247
are and how you use it.

237
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:51,352
And if you're willing to talk to them, frankly, about what you do and why, they'll know that

238
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:56,596
you are operating within the bounds of, if not law, then a structure, right?

239
00:16:56,676 --> 00:17:00,099
They're not going to get banned from the game just because you had a fight with your significant

240
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,841
other or because it's raining and you hate the rain.

241
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,994
That they're not subject to whims, that there's a structure for the authority and that's going

242
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:11,115
to be reassuring to them.

243
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:15,018
So finally, remember the silent majority.

244
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:22,023
If you seem fair and reasonable, people will believe in you for the most part, even though

245
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:23,424
some noisy complainers might not.

246
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:28,888
So having covered the basics, let's talk a little bit about how to

247
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:35,044
Manage a crisis. Let's say you're flung into a crisis, what do you do?

248
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:45,887
So the first thing is to try to understand the issues thoroughly. When you first become

249
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:51,208
aware of that people, everybody's upset and the forums are on fire, you won't know precisely

250
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:56,270
why that is. And you'll get bits and pieces of the story, but you need to make sure that

251
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,190
you have asked enough questions until you understand the whole story.

252
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:08,358
For instance, problem is the game is down. Okay, that's a problem. But sometimes it's

253
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:13,541
really that the game is down and we're missing an event. Sometimes it's that the game is

254
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:17,423
down and we wrote to support and told them about it and they said, oh, no, the game is

255
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,064
just fine.

256
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:23,637
So in the second two scenarios, you have an additional problem that you need to think

257
00:18:23,697 --> 00:18:27,301
about before this whole thing is going to be wrapped up.

258
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:32,927
Just getting the game back online won't really solve it if people are still going to be mad

259
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,970
about the time they missed in the event or mad that support blew them off.

260
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:39,173
So make sure you understand the whole problem.

261
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:44,851
Remember to apologize or express regret.

262
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:51,316
This is something that's really easy to forget because of course we're all thinking, you

263
00:18:51,356 --> 00:18:53,017
know that I didn't do this on purpose.

264
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:58,722
But players won't necessarily take that for granted.

265
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:03,946
They're human and human beings want to have their distress acknowledged by other humans.

266
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:10,135
And expressing regret or empathy is a way that we do that for each other.

267
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:15,397
So for instance, if somebody's grandmother dies, you say, I'm really sorry to hear that.

268
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:19,858
Now you're not saying, you're right, I killed your grandmother and I'm super sorry for doing

269
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:20,098
that.

270
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:24,060
No, you're saying I'm sorry that you're experiencing regret and loss and pain.

271
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:30,620
So the same goes for communities. These sorts of statements that are up here will let people

272
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,461
know that they have been heard and that you sympathize. And, of course, if you had a part

273
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:41,042
in creating the problem or making it worse, you should take it a step farther and actually

274
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:48,764
apologize for that as well. So this is another one of those things that

275
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:53,525
seems really obvious and yet in the moment it's going to be easy to forget. Explain

276
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:54,665
your next steps.

277
00:19:56,305 --> 00:20:00,429
Remember, you're in a situation where people are not feeling very trusting of you.

278
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,991
They have concerns about whether or not you're going to do a good job.

279
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:09,537
So the best way to start getting them back on track is, or getting trust rebuilt, I should

280
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:12,720
say, is to tell them what you're going to do.

281
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,963
Otherwise they're going to be like, oh, so she's going to go down and kick the servers,

282
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:17,224
right?

283
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:23,900
No, but I can call the people who can, you know, reboot the whatever it is.

284
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,740
See, that's my tech knowledge right there.

285
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:33,142
So make sure that their expectations are ones that you can actually meet.

286
00:20:34,422 --> 00:20:37,862
And then, this is also important, do it.

287
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:41,243
Don't just say it and then be like, yeah, well, I'll get to it.

288
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:42,283
Do it.

289
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:45,544
And report back.

290
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:52,869
Don't just because you said you'll do something and you know that you're a person of integrity,

291
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:58,690
so of course you've done it, but the players are in a situation where they're not feeling

292
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,291
very trusting.

293
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:03,332
And so they're not going to go like, oh, well, she said she would do it, so I guess she did.

294
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:06,235
Now, they're going to be like, well, who knows?

295
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:09,058
So just go back, hey, I did that thing.

296
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:09,839
Is it better?

297
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:11,100
How's everybody feeling?

298
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:18,706
And so you want to keep iterating that until people are reporting that they feel better,

299
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:20,688
that they think the situation is improved.

300
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,951
Not everybody's going to be happy.

301
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:30,597
But if most people feel like you have done everything you can, then that's what you can do.

302
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,502
A last note that I had originally left out of my outline, but my manager pointed out

303
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:42,503
to me that it was important, because I took it for granted.

304
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:43,883
See this is how crises go.

305
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:46,004
These things are so obvious that we take them for granted.

306
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:47,764
Do better next time.

307
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:54,807
The first time you make a mistake or your team makes a mistake, your community will

308
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:57,348
forgive you, assuming you, you know, make it right.

309
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,966
Long about the fifth time you make the same mistake.

310
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,169
It won't matter what you say or what kind of compensation you give.

311
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:06,530
They're not going to trust you again.

312
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:11,574
So I had that slide about the postmortem.

313
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:15,677
Be sure to have one of those and have it be an actual meeting, not just a couple of conversations

314
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:16,278
in the hallway.

315
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:17,519
Take notes.

316
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:23,884
Come up with a plan for how you're going to change your flow in the future so that these

317
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:24,765
things don't happen again.

318
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:33,228
So this is not the most beautiful slide in my presentation.

319
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:36,011
But anyway, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

320
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:37,312
It's better than a pound of cure.

321
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:40,855
So I'm gonna talk a little bit now about some pitfalls.

322
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:43,837
I've talked about how to handle the crises

323
00:22:43,877 --> 00:22:44,898
that you find yourself in,

324
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:48,862
but it's even better if you can steer your community

325
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:51,444
between the pitfalls so that you don't end up

326
00:22:51,524 --> 00:22:53,286
in a hole in the first place, right?

327
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,428
And these two are based in...

328
00:22:57,604 --> 00:22:59,425
Some people that I've seen end up in holes.

329
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:04,126
I'll tell you a bit about how they handled them, but also hopefully give you some pointers

330
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:06,806
on how to avoid them in the future.

331
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:13,028
So first I'd like to talk about the moderate path, which ties back to some of the things

332
00:23:14,488 --> 00:23:17,609
that I was touching on earlier with fairness and lenience.

333
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:22,715
So a couple years ago now, I got pulled into a situation in a game forum.

334
00:23:23,355 --> 00:23:28,958
A user who I will call Bob, not his real name, as far as I know, had played the game for

335
00:23:29,018 --> 00:23:30,819
quite a while, and then he quit.

336
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,043
But despite having quit, he returned every day to be disruptive.

337
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:42,326
He would insult the other players, he would talk trash about the game, and he particularly

338
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:46,028
liked to insult and bait the community manager, who I'll call Amy.

339
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:53,298
And as I read through the forum post that Bob had made, I began to notice some things.

340
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:59,062
So to begin with, he was a player who had spent a fair amount of money in the game and

341
00:23:59,122 --> 00:24:00,583
had some trouble getting support.

342
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:06,006
This guy was a bit of a hothead, and so he grouched about his bad experience in the forums.

343
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:09,909
So far, all pretty understandable and normal.

344
00:24:12,736 --> 00:24:17,539
Well, here's where things went awry. Instead of expressing concern about Bob's bad experiences,

345
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,523
Amy just removed his posts. Bob responded with angry criticism and she got angry in

346
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:26,725
return and they got locked in this power struggle, right?

347
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:33,209
Now Bob was behaving badly and Amy, despite her best intentions, was just feeding that

348
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:39,533
troll every day. She'd hide his posts, she'd talk about how terrible he was. She was personalizing

349
00:24:39,593 --> 00:24:40,073
away too much.

350
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,803
She didn't mean to get into this situation.

351
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:45,564
I know she didn't.

352
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:50,109
But she was in an unfortunate situation where she had overreacted initially and then not

353
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:51,271
really been able to backpedal.

354
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:58,140
So the way to avoid that is to allow negative feedback within reason.

355
00:24:59,256 --> 00:25:03,960
So the things underneath the heart are the things that I would allow and encourage on

356
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,440
our site.

357
00:25:05,141 --> 00:25:12,006
The things underneath the other, the circle slash, are the things that I would hide and

358
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:17,530
depending on how routinely the person had been posting stuff like that, I might take

359
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:21,634
a little bit of action on their account to be like, hey, I meant it when I said stop

360
00:25:21,674 --> 00:25:21,954
saying that.

361
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:22,174
Thanks.

362
00:25:22,194 --> 00:25:22,254
Bye.

363
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:22,494
Bye.

364
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,297
None of those are actual posts.

365
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:30,679
Those are actually examples that I made up because I have an amazing job.

366
00:25:35,662 --> 00:25:35,902
Okay.

367
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:44,413
So back to Bob and Amy. In one of Bob's forum posts, he had asked why this particular game

368
00:25:44,453 --> 00:25:50,577
was still on Kongregate, despite its many flaws, which he described colorfully. Underneath

369
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:55,701
the snarky comments, there was a legitimate question about Kongregate's policy and approach.

370
00:25:56,322 --> 00:26:00,725
Why do we let games stay on the site? What are our boundaries? And so on and so forth.

371
00:26:01,265 --> 00:26:04,368
So that question was my opening, because that's right in my wheelhouse.

372
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:07,331
So I chimed in and I'm tricky rodent.

373
00:26:07,852 --> 00:26:09,454
And I answered his question seriously.

374
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:14,201
He asked some follow-up questions and so did a couple of other players and I answered those

375
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:15,202
seriously as well.

376
00:26:15,863 --> 00:26:20,609
But I gave him, along with the information, a sense of myself as unruffled and competent.

377
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:28,967
He at some point made a passing comment that he says, I don't really give a lot of flowers

378
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:30,529
with my posts, but I'm not lying.

379
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:31,891
I'm not making stuff up.

380
00:26:32,412 --> 00:26:33,133
I said, that's okay.

381
00:26:33,153 --> 00:26:34,434
I don't expect a lot of flowers.

382
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,256
And I could tell that there was real stuff here.

383
00:26:36,777 --> 00:26:39,641
So this was apparently quite disarming to him.

384
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:40,922
So

385
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,163
This is one of my favorite forum posts of all time.

386
00:26:45,424 --> 00:26:49,770
He goes through a good bit of effort trying to get himself to say something nice, and

387
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,695
he finally manages it, and then says he has to go lie down because it was so much work.

388
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,113
Now, one of the other players responded before I could, and this was something that made

389
00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:09,697
me even more happy, because suddenly they see him in a different way than they have

390
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:10,278
seen him before.

391
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:12,239
Until now, they all hated his guts.

392
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,884
And they're like, oh, you can be funny, and even kind of nice and reasonable.

393
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:21,675
And to which of course he was, oh, you can't prove it.

394
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:27,218
But from then on, things really changed for him and for that forum.

395
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:32,861
And he and I had a little sort of private side conversations, and he agreed to leave

396
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,162
the forum alone and go off and play his own game.

397
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,264
And in fact, he is still on our site.

398
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:41,985
And he's still playing an assortment of games.

399
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:45,907
He occasionally has a kind of a feisty forum post, but nothing like it was before.

400
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:53,456
So it is possible to sort of win people over and have them become more productive members

401
00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:55,777
of your community instead of destructive ones.

402
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:04,240
And the thing that I want to highlight, too, is that handling negative feedback calmly

403
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,321
and without defensiveness makes everyone respect you more.

404
00:28:08,994 --> 00:28:13,857
If someone is trying to upset you, the solution is to get as unupset as you can.

405
00:28:14,838 --> 00:28:17,260
It makes you in charge of the situation and not them.

406
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:23,364
Beyond that, if someone has negative feedback, consider what they have to say.

407
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,306
Even if they're being a jerk, they might have some good insights.

408
00:28:28,127 --> 00:28:32,730
One of the most important lessons I ever learned about moderation was back when I was a volunteer

409
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,430
chat moderator.

410
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:35,351
We had a truly awful user.

411
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,297
And he made a point to me one day and I went, oh.

412
00:28:40,682 --> 00:28:41,605
And what he said.

413
00:28:42,507 --> 00:28:48,231
It basically formed the entire basis of a bunch of the stuff I've talked to you about

414
00:28:48,932 --> 00:28:51,834
and was this huge gift to my future professional career.

415
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:58,259
But it came in this poop and insult covered wrapper that if I had thrown it away, I would

416
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:04,523
never have realized that there was really a kernel of really good information there.

417
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:05,964
So I'm glad I didn't do that.

418
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:07,305
And I encourage you to do the same.

419
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:10,708
Sometimes even jerks have good points.

420
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:19,527
And so and similarly, like, of course you're going to feel defensive, right?

421
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:21,990
Like I know that we can't

422
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,292
hear people say terrible things about us and not feel a smidgen of defensiveness.

423
00:29:27,812 --> 00:29:28,833
Well, okay, most of us can't.

424
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:31,954
But you don't have to let on that you're feeling that way, right?

425
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:37,136
So just sort of move that emotion into a separate place and be like, oh, okay, I'm sorry to

426
00:29:37,156 --> 00:29:38,097
hear you feel that way.

427
00:29:38,137 --> 00:29:39,077
Let's talk about that.

428
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:43,339
And suddenly the situation is going to diffuse.

429
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,140
Now

430
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,022
So this is the moderate path, right, which means that it's possible to err on one side

431
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:54,123
and it's possible to err on the other side as well.

432
00:29:55,144 --> 00:30:01,287
So you want to listen to players, but it's also possible to listen too much or to be

433
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,647
too responsive when you listen.

434
00:30:03,187 --> 00:30:04,728
It's less common, but it still happens.

435
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:08,727
In my experience, it's usually when a game dev is just starting out.

436
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,469
Maybe their team is very small.

437
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,872
So every time they make a change or a tweak,

438
00:30:14,193 --> 00:30:15,634
then they go and they listen in the forums.

439
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:16,635
What do you guys think?

440
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:17,376
Do you love it?

441
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:20,179
Oh, you didn't love it?

442
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:22,020
Oh, what could I do that would make you love it?

443
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:26,665
And so sometimes then the developers will go and make...

444
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:30,191
Big changes to the game based on the feedback they got.

445
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:32,652
Which seems amazing, right?

446
00:30:32,692 --> 00:30:39,898
It seems egalitarian and it seems very collaborative and all these really things that feel really

447
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:40,218
good.

448
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:44,121
But there is a downside to this.

449
00:30:46,282 --> 00:30:53,848
Which is that sooner or later, players are going to develop a sense of entitlement.

450
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:56,310
They're going to feel entitled to that level of attention.

451
00:30:57,364 --> 00:31:00,726
So, then the question becomes what happens when the developer is a success?

452
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:06,470
And when they inevitably, as they must do, start to make a new game and start shifting

453
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,691
their attention somewhere else?

454
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:13,115
What happens, in my experience, is that the players can get really toxic and they can

455
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:16,557
get really angry and embittered by the loss of attention.

456
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:20,741
This next slide is one I forgot to remove.

457
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:21,041
So, boop.

458
00:31:24,353 --> 00:31:29,597
So the modern path is listen to what players have to say but don't always act.

459
00:31:31,118 --> 00:31:36,001
Allow disagreement and criticism but require that it be constructive.

460
00:31:37,722 --> 00:31:42,285
So you want to address concerns but try to avoid taking them personally.

461
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:46,528
And you're going to want to diffuse emotion by remaining calm.

462
00:31:50,105 --> 00:31:54,408
So Alison Huffman is right here and she did not know this was going to be one of my slides.

463
00:31:55,529 --> 00:32:02,673
Now, when Alison was, and she's taking a picture to send to her mom, that makes me happy.

464
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:08,397
So when Alison was growing up, her mom would always say, honey, you know, different people

465
00:32:08,457 --> 00:32:08,937
are different.

466
00:32:09,018 --> 00:32:10,719
And she was finally like, mom, I got it.

467
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,799
Different people are different.

468
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,942
But then you go out into the world and you meet people who are way different.

469
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:17,143
Like way different.

470
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:17,963
And you're like, whoa.

471
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:21,930
Different people are really, really different.

472
00:32:23,571 --> 00:32:24,231
And it's true.

473
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:26,032
Different people are really different.

474
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,413
And gaming is global.

475
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:35,455
And that means that we are or will be managing global multicultural communities.

476
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:42,658
As part of that, we'll need to manage purchases and related issues for folks all over the

477
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:42,878
world.

478
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:48,818
I was surprised a few years back to learn that different cultures have very different

479
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:53,140
norms about things like business and consumer protection.

480
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:57,703
Players are a part of a global community, but they're going to approach purchasing and

481
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:58,703
expectations differently.

482
00:32:59,974 --> 00:33:03,956
Through the culture in which they grew up, right?

483
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:08,918
They're going to expect what they believe to be true about all purchases, of course.

484
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:11,319
Except it's not true worldwide.

485
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:15,941
And different expectations lead to broken trust, right?

486
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:20,423
Because one side is going to be acting in a way that they think is totally normal and reasonable and expected.

487
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:22,063
Of course, this is just how you act.

488
00:33:23,024 --> 00:33:24,925
And then another side is going to be horrified.

489
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,039
They've said they've wanted to do this and then the first person who wrote it is going

490
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:29,539
to go, what?

491
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,741
What's so horrifying about that?

492
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:40,707
So I am not an expert on cultural differences, but I wanted to share a couple of observations

493
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:47,471
and if this is something that seems really meaningful to you, you can carry on on your

494
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:48,051
own obviously.

495
00:33:49,793 --> 00:33:50,353
Here's what I've seen.

496
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:54,456
Governors in the EU are accustomed to strong consumer protection laws.

497
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:59,437
They expect a lot of transparency and they take it for granted that there will be strong

498
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:04,182
consequences and in particular strong external consequences from some kind of authority figure

499
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:08,647
if a game doesn't handle things in a way that they think is appropriate.

500
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:16,515
In my experience, Southeast Asian and particularly Chinese culture is almost opposite.

501
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:24,164
As I understand it, folks from that culture, both businesses and consumers, walk into a

502
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:30,467
transaction with the expectation that they are both there to maximize their benefit from

503
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,908
that particular transaction.

504
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:38,111
That's not my culture, but there's a sort of a brisk efficiency to that that I have

505
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:39,251
to say I kind of admire.

506
00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:42,593
Americans are more or less in the middle.

507
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:48,672
We're accustomed to some consumer protections, but not as many as folks in the EU.

508
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:57,736
We expect merchants and customers to be self-interested, but we also have a belief that self-interest

509
00:34:57,756 --> 00:35:04,140
can include the development of a long-term relationship that's going to be mutually beneficial.

510
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:12,244
And we feel sort of insulted when someone else doesn't have that same relationship goal

511
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:12,644
in mind.

512
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:21,764
So if the root issue of a crisis is cultural, realizing right away that the issue is cultural

513
00:35:22,244 --> 00:35:26,986
means that we can identify that all parties are acting in good faith and begin to rebuild

514
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:31,987
trust and come up with some new sort of mutual expectations about what we think is reasonable.

515
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:44,091
So now the next way I have seen communities fall into holes of conflict and crisis.

516
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:48,449
is when they have problems with their support.

517
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:57,296
So support really isn't optional.

518
00:35:57,596 --> 00:36:00,698
Remember what I was...

519
00:36:00,878 --> 00:36:04,301
So crises are caused by loss of trust, but I have noticed something, which is that

520
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:09,104
the real crisis often starts when support is

521
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:16,890
The vast majority of our players are reasonable people.

522
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:23,233
Yes, there are some who think that your game is worse than Hitler, the worst in human history,

523
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:24,133
and so on and so forth.

524
00:36:24,654 --> 00:36:28,735
But they are noisy but not really all that numerous underneath it all.

525
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:35,418
Most players are actually regular folks who know that the world is flawed, that all code

526
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:35,999
has bugs.

527
00:36:36,939 --> 00:36:44,781
That sooner or later every game, if it's deep enough and long-lasting enough, is going to have glitches or unintentional loopholes to it.

528
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:47,742
So they don't expect your product to be perfect.

529
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:55,904
What they do expect is that when they experience a problem and reach out to customer support, they'll get prompt, competent, and helpful responses.

530
00:36:56,824 --> 00:37:02,145
If they have a problem but can't get the support they need, that is when you start to lose trust.

531
00:37:03,725 --> 00:37:05,046
It seems like it should be easy.

532
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:12,976
But it's not. Running customer support is hard. You need people who can understand poorly

533
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:22,182
written complaints. Somebody I know who works support is laughing hard. You need to understand

534
00:37:22,222 --> 00:37:26,225
technical issues. You need to know the game backwards and forwards. So it's not easy to

535
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:30,929
assemble a team of people who are good at this. But it's really, really important.

536
00:37:34,777 --> 00:37:39,139
You may have a really small team and you may feel like we're too small to offer customer

537
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:39,539
support.

538
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:40,820
Nope.

539
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,480
Nope.

540
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:41,940
Nope.

541
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:44,821
Every game has to have support.

542
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:54,465
Players talk to each other and if one person tries to get support and fails, they'll tell

543
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:59,167
the others, hey, this game is fun and all, but don't spend any money in it because they

544
00:37:59,187 --> 00:38:00,548
won't help you if you have a problem.

545
00:38:01,386 --> 00:38:05,412
So you don't want that. I'd encourage you to put a button in your game that spawns a

546
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:09,679
light box, at least give them an e‑mail address where they can send in their problems.

547
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,685
And then after they've sent in those problems, somebody has to answer them.

548
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:19,968
You need to, it doesn't have to be a super in-depth response.

549
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:24,692
A lot of people will write in, I love your game, here are 25 suggestions to make it even

550
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:25,332
more awesome.

551
00:38:25,873 --> 00:38:27,694
You don't have to respond to every single one of them.

552
00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:29,736
You can just go, hey, thank you so much.

553
00:38:29,816 --> 00:38:31,657
I'm so glad that you love the game.

554
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:33,138
Takes just a minute.

555
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,981
If somebody has a bug, try to reproduce it.

556
00:38:37,742 --> 00:38:41,185
Most especially if somebody has a problem with purchasing, you're going to want to try

557
00:38:41,205 --> 00:38:42,666
and address that and address it promptly.

558
00:38:45,402 --> 00:38:47,603
As I said, I know that in small teams it's so difficult.

559
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:53,887
You're trying to balance bug fixing, new content, all kinds of things, but this really is important.

560
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:56,849
Choose someone to answer support tickets.

561
00:38:57,728 --> 00:39:03,050
Put it in their job description. Set an internal expectation. Maybe you'll answer within two,

562
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:11,312
three business days. Please less than a week. But if you realize really deep down that this

563
00:39:11,373 --> 00:39:15,654
is important, you'll find a way to make it important.

564
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:24,556
Another problem that happens is sometimes games have sudden and explosive success.

565
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:29,238
I remember a few years back I was working with a team I'll call Apple Tree Studios.

566
00:39:30,218 --> 00:39:32,559
Their game had an explosive success.

567
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:38,360
And to say that their support system was overwhelmed would be like saying the Pacific Ocean was

568
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,220
a little bit damp.

569
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:42,241
I mean, they were just swamped for months.

570
00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:47,343
Obviously there's no way of knowing how much money they left on the table when they�

571
00:39:48,163 --> 00:39:49,183
with their support issues.

572
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:52,924
But I would guess based on how profitable the game overall was that it was probably

573
00:39:52,984 --> 00:39:53,785
millions of dollars.

574
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:59,825
In retrospect, I bet they wished that they had chosen a ticketing system ahead of time

575
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:05,671
and one that could scale from small to large in a very rapid and easy way.

576
00:40:06,352 --> 00:40:10,576
And I bet that they wished that they had had an engineer spend a week or two integrating

577
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:16,381
the support system with the game so that the game would pass through basic player information.

578
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:17,843
What's your name?

579
00:40:18,464 --> 00:40:19,605
What server are you on?

580
00:40:20,656 --> 00:40:26,422
A little bit of information about the player and it would have made their customer service

581
00:40:26,442 --> 00:40:33,589
so much more efficient and just so much more effective, really, from the beginning.

582
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:36,371
And they would have been so much more prepared for success.

583
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:41,877
So you also need to have a plan for VIPs.

584
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:44,639
If you're in an industry as

585
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:50,740
The free-to-play gaming world is where the vast majority of your revenue comes from a

586
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,161
relatively small number of people.

587
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:56,865
You need to make sure that those people get top-notch support every time.

588
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:03,790
Now, I have heard of some games where they purposely don't allow the customer service

589
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,192
reps to know anything about a player's spending history.

590
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,154
And I really admire that.

591
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:13,137
I think that speaks a lot of volumes about their desire to make sure everybody has a

592
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:14,178
top-quality experience.

593
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:18,264
At the same time, I'm a pragmatist.

594
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:26,047
Unless you're at this wonderful point where you are confident that you can give everybody

595
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:28,168
top-notch service every time.

596
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,282
It's worth your while to figure out a way to winnow out the VIPs and give them a little

597
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:34,023
something extra.

598
00:41:35,283 --> 00:41:38,645
One thing Congregate has done is to identify a particular staffer.

599
00:41:39,465 --> 00:41:41,606
His name is ‑‑ he just started looking around.

600
00:41:41,926 --> 00:41:42,707
His name is Nikhil.

601
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:43,627
He's right there.

602
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:47,749
He's our go‑to person for VIP support and their frustrations.

603
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:52,191
So if a VIP writes in to support, then Nikhil takes it and responds to them directly.

604
00:41:53,112 --> 00:41:54,853
The next time they have a problem, they respond.

605
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:59,654
They usually contact him directly because he's their guy at Congregate.

606
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:05,155
And bear in mind, our support is excellent, but the personal touch of having somebody

607
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:08,495
that you know and you can just go to is really valuable.

608
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:18,577
Another thing that I've seen done is I worked with one company where their VIP support approach

609
00:42:18,677 --> 00:42:22,158
was that they refused to use canned messages.

610
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:28,895
Which I thought was just really, for their VIPs specifically, which I thought was just

611
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:31,455
so interesting and it took me a while to see the beauty of it.

612
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:36,317
But I mean at first I was like, oh, well, I guess if two VIPs write in with the exact

613
00:42:36,357 --> 00:42:38,478
same problem, they won't get the exact same answer.

614
00:42:38,898 --> 00:42:39,558
Which is nice.

615
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:44,299
I mean, they'll, you know, if two VIPs were to compare their answers and see that they

616
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,220
weren't the same, they'd be like, oh, well, that's classy.

617
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,361
But it's more than that.

618
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:50,901
And what it is, is that...

619
00:42:52,428 --> 00:42:57,631
In having to write out an individual response for each email, what you have to do is think

620
00:42:57,711 --> 00:43:02,193
really carefully and thoroughly about what that person specifically has written to you.

621
00:43:02,654 --> 00:43:06,636
You stop scanning for keywords and going like, oh, okay, well, they had this problem, boop,

622
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:08,097
I'll send them this message next.

623
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:11,559
You have to pay attention to the whole thing that they've written and make sure that you've

624
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:12,199
addressed it all.

625
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,722
And that means that you're thinking harder and more carefully about what they're actually

626
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:17,302
saying to you.

627
00:43:17,742 --> 00:43:19,203
And that's how you get better support.

628
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:21,607
Okay.

629
00:43:27,432 --> 00:43:30,315
So another thing that you need to think about

630
00:43:31,256 --> 00:43:31,676
with

631
00:43:32,837 --> 00:43:40,944
support is holidays, planning for holidays. Everybody wants to go on holiday. Of course you do. We're people. We like holidays.

632
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:44,267
The thing is that holidays are also a time when your

633
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:51,928
Players have taken time off from work and they want to spend time and money playing

634
00:43:51,968 --> 00:43:52,388
your game.

635
00:43:53,149 --> 00:43:59,732
So make sure that you have a way to find out if, for example, your game goes down.

636
00:44:00,552 --> 00:44:06,095
This happened actually to a game that we work with over the Christmas week, a couple years

637
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:07,236
sometime recently.

638
00:44:09,637 --> 00:44:11,698
The game went down completely, gray screen.

639
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:13,919
We had a big promotion planned.

640
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,600
We couldn't reach anybody.

641
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,000
Nobody could play the game.

642
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,241
We couldn't reach them.

643
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:24,242
So we had to pull the promotion, and it was quite a few days before we managed to get

644
00:44:24,282 --> 00:44:25,203
in touch with anybody there.

645
00:44:25,323 --> 00:44:29,984
And of course, then they got the game back up, but by then the promotion window was over,

646
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:35,706
the players had been locked out for, you know, several days, and it was financially not a

647
00:44:35,726 --> 00:44:36,366
good time for them.

648
00:44:36,686 --> 00:44:40,667
So make sure that there is somebody around on holidays.

649
00:44:42,384 --> 00:44:45,566
The way Congregate does it, that's our contact us form, isn't it lovely?

650
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:52,931
The way Congregate does it is that we are not 24 hours, but we are seven days a week.

651
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:58,594
We close on Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Day, Easter, and July 4th.

652
00:44:59,415 --> 00:45:02,717
We work half days on Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, and Mother's Day.

653
00:45:03,738 --> 00:45:06,940
Every other day of the year, someone is there to answer your questions and help you.

654
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,722
Now I know that for many of you, that schedule would be excessive.

655
00:45:12,107 --> 00:45:16,268
But you should be without coverage for an entire week at a time, and you should always

656
00:45:16,308 --> 00:45:19,189
have a way to be notified if the game goes offline completely.

657
00:45:23,571 --> 00:45:27,392
Occasionally, you'll run into support issues that seem simply preposterous.

658
00:45:29,613 --> 00:45:32,133
Nikhil, I'm about to tell a story that you are very familiar with.

659
00:45:32,914 --> 00:45:38,055
Imagine that in your game, the best gear is the black diamond armor, and almost nobody

660
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:41,277
gets an entire set of black diamond armor.

661
00:45:42,752 --> 00:45:46,455
Now imagine that somebody writes in to you and says that they had an entire set of black

662
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:55,342
diamond armor and it suddenly vanished. And you're thinking, lol, no. I wasn't born yesterday,

663
00:45:55,402 --> 00:46:01,207
my friend. But now imagine, and this is based on a real story, that the player in question

664
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:01,988
has spent $90,000 in your game.

665
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:10,145
And you go, oh shit, of course he had a full set of black diamond armor.

666
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:14,326
So the moral of the story is that you should investigate.

667
00:46:14,886 --> 00:46:17,686
Our instincts are worth listening to, but they're not the whole story.

668
00:46:17,966 --> 00:46:20,167
And some players are going to be outliers.

669
00:46:21,007 --> 00:46:27,288
So make sure you check that something is or is not possible, because if someone has spent

670
00:46:27,328 --> 00:46:31,268
that much money, you don't want to send them an email that goes, ha, ha, ha, sure, buddy,

671
00:46:31,308 --> 00:46:34,649
you have big fun with that, because that's going to end real badly.

672
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:51,270
So, a lot of the things that I've been talking about, they sound really easy to do.

673
00:46:51,771 --> 00:46:56,535
All this sort of putting yourself out there in the middle of a crisis, knowing who you

674
00:46:56,555 --> 00:47:02,199
are, being willing to talk honestly with players about what they're experiencing, being willing

675
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,801
to see your faults and apologize for them.

676
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,222
And that sounds...

677
00:47:07,103 --> 00:47:08,584
Really easy and it's not.

678
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:14,007
There are going to be times when you're doing this that you are going to feel really defeated

679
00:47:14,027 --> 00:47:18,008
and you're going to feel really exposed and it is going to suck.

680
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,810
And that's the nature of what we do.

681
00:47:23,771 --> 00:47:27,793
The people sometimes see the bricks underneath the facade.

682
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:35,416
But the more you fall, the more you'll learn how to get through it and take care of yourself

683
00:47:35,556 --> 00:47:36,357
and get back up again.

684
00:47:38,137 --> 00:47:44,120
There was a time last spring where I was in a situation where it appeared that we were

685
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,962
facing a fraud problem.

686
00:47:46,722 --> 00:47:52,646
I reacted too quickly, learned something new about myself that day, in part because someone

687
00:47:52,866 --> 00:47:56,048
near me was reacting strongly and I allowed that to affect me.

688
00:47:56,668 --> 00:48:02,092
I didn't have all the facts and I made a decision that in retrospect was clearly wrong.

689
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:04,734
And I was mortified.

690
00:48:05,692 --> 00:48:10,915
And the worst thing about it, the single thing that was hardest was not that I had failed,

691
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:12,276
but that I had failed publicly.

692
00:48:13,136 --> 00:48:17,438
That every person I worked with had seen this mistake that I had made.

693
00:48:19,279 --> 00:48:22,881
And so I just sort of hunkered down with my laptop and tried to figure out how to get

694
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:23,361
through this.

695
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:27,223
And Emily, remember Emily from the first slide?

696
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:29,605
She reached out to me and she said, you know what?

697
00:48:29,805 --> 00:48:30,545
I make mistakes.

698
00:48:31,498 --> 00:48:34,900
And that's part of being the CEO, is that when you make a mistake, your mistake is always

699
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:35,440
public.

700
00:48:36,801 --> 00:48:39,042
And it is always expensive.

701
00:48:42,023 --> 00:48:45,745
And that's the reality of leadership, is that when you're leading people, you're exposed.

702
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:48,346
And it's not easy.

703
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:52,288
But it's worthwhile.

704
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:57,330
When you do run into a situation where you're feeling exposed.

705
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:03,875
The thing is to learn from it and to learn from it in a way that is as public and as

706
00:49:03,955 --> 00:49:09,517
honest as the way you made the mistake because that will inspire the people around you to

707
00:49:09,637 --> 00:49:18,222
also learn and grow in a very public way and it will only increase their respect for you.

708
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:34,335
John Kennedy, when he was running for office, gave a series of speeches in which he claimed

709
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:41,340
that the Chinese character for crisis was a combination of the characters for opportunity

710
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:41,900
and danger.

711
00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:44,822
And according to Professor Google, that's wrong.

712
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,325
Some sites say it's completely wrong.

713
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:50,226
Some say it's only kind of wrong.

714
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:51,107
But the point is, it's wrong.

715
00:49:52,908 --> 00:49:55,270
But it says something to me that...

716
00:49:56,861 --> 00:50:01,442
50 years later, this is still like a widely held, sort of commonly accepted belief in

717
00:50:01,482 --> 00:50:03,142
our culture.

718
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:12,565
And I think that's because it touches something that we all intuitively know, that when we're

719
00:50:12,585 --> 00:50:17,006
starting a crisis, that means that the status quo is no longer stable.

720
00:50:17,186 --> 00:50:23,347
That means that movement is happening, and in that movement is an opportunity for positive

721
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:23,747
change.

722
00:50:25,017 --> 00:50:28,080
It's also an opportunity for negative change, but let's not worry about that too much right

723
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:28,280
now.

724
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:35,667
The point is, once you've got the rock rolling, then you're steering it, but often the hardest

725
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:37,029
thing is to get the rock rolling.

726
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:43,255
And so once you're in that crisis, try to remember that there are going to be opportunities

727
00:50:43,315 --> 00:50:46,798
here because you're moving, and it's not the same.

728
00:50:50,268 --> 00:50:55,532
So the human need to connect with others is ancient and it's profound.

729
00:50:56,893 --> 00:50:59,155
And yet we live in interesting times.

730
00:51:00,616 --> 00:51:02,538
Technology is transforming the world around us.

731
00:51:03,178 --> 00:51:07,862
We haven't gone to Mars yet, but our world is being transformed.

732
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:11,845
And I believe that we here in this room are pioneers.

733
00:51:12,978 --> 00:51:18,061
We are thinking about and working towards ways for people to connect with each other

734
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:23,303
in a new world, in a world that nobody has ever seen or experienced or thought about

735
00:51:23,343 --> 00:51:23,684
before.

736
00:51:24,524 --> 00:51:28,146
We're trying to figure out how to bring humanity to our future.

737
00:51:28,846 --> 00:51:32,828
And that goal is big and it is beautiful and it's greater than we are.

738
00:51:34,108 --> 00:51:38,811
And in order for all of that to happen, you are going to have to be the best, wisest,

739
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:41,972
kindest, most competent person you can be.

740
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,361
And the next month you're going to have to be even better than that.

741
00:51:47,741 --> 00:51:51,563
And I don't know about you, but I can't think of anything else that I would rather do for

742
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:51,883
a living.

743
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:53,803
So that's all I have.

744
00:51:53,863 --> 00:51:54,524
Are there questions?

745
00:51:58,205 --> 00:52:04,307
Thank you. 1
