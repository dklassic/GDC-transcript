1
00:00:05,442 --> 00:00:06,462
Hello everybody, thanks for coming.

2
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:10,764
I know there's a lot of exciting things happening right now

3
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:13,484
outside of this talk and even outside of GDC,

4
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:15,285
so thanks for coming and hanging out.

5
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:16,885
Talk about fighting games for an hour.

6
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:19,286
This is kind of a dense talk,

7
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:20,446
so I'm gonna move a little bit quickly.

8
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:22,907
I'm going to start,

9
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:24,847
oop, my music is still going, sorry.

10
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:28,448
Yeah, so this talk is called 0929,

11
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:32,129
A Decade of Approachability in Fighting Games.

12
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,289
Real quick, kind of about myself,

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:34,910
I...

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,291
I've always been a casual Smash Brothers, Street Fighter player.

15
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:41,153
My first job, kind of adjacent to the gaming industry,

16
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:42,213
was at Major League Gaming.

17
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:46,995
After that, I got involved with a project called Sports Friends.

18
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,916
Worked on a game called Barabari Ball.

19
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:55,359
More recently, I've been working at the Mighty Iron Galaxy.

20
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:58,860
Kind of got hired on there to work on Killer Instinct.

21
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,801
There's my two favorite characters on the bottom.

22
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:03,662
Aganos and Cinder were really fun to work on.

23
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:06,840
Yeah, so we worked on seasons two and three of Killer Instinct.

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,761
A couple notes about terms.

25
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:12,181
I am using the terms approachability

26
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:13,482
and accessibility interchangeably.

27
00:01:13,502 --> 00:01:16,563
I know like colloquially we talk about accessibility

28
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,843
in fighting games in terms of like,

29
00:01:18,183 --> 00:01:19,484
oh, make them easier to play and so on.

30
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:22,784
I wanted to avoid suggesting this talk was about designing

31
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:24,085
for disabilities, which is important,

32
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,485
but that's not what we're talking about today.

33
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:28,886
Although if you are interested, there was some great work done

34
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:30,327
on the audio side of Killer Instinct,

35
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:31,167
and you can read about that.

36
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:33,027
I also recommend gameaccessibilityguidelines.com.

37
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:36,941
A few other notes.

38
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:39,383
I have like a big tense for fighting games.

39
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:42,124
So in my mind, like Street Fighter, Soul Calibur,

40
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:44,245
Smash Brothers, even like Nidhogg and Dive Kick,

41
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:45,806
they all have like enough in common that we can kind

42
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:46,987
of talk about them in the same breath.

43
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,348
I'm also kind of in the unusual position

44
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,709
of talking mostly about games I haven't worked on.

45
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,011
So, you know, if you see something you worked on here,

46
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:57,893
and maybe I say something critical of it today,

47
00:01:57,913 --> 00:01:59,834
know that, you know, this is coming from a place of love

48
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:01,915
and respect, and like I spend a lot of time thinking

49
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,436
about these games and, you know,

50
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,296
thinking about how to make them better.

51
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,928
So I want to start by talking about a period of time

52
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,151
that's generally roughly between like 1999 and 2009.

53
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:14,272
If you read a lot about fighting games

54
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:16,094
or talk to a lot of people who play a lot of fighting games,

55
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:19,036
you can maybe hear this term like the Dark Ages, right?

56
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:20,116
So this is like the period of time

57
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:22,818
between roughly the final version of Street Fighter 3

58
00:02:22,898 --> 00:02:25,100
and like the console release of Street Fighter 4 in the US.

59
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:27,842
It's a total misnomer.

60
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,124
There's actually a ton of interesting games released

61
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:30,984
during this period of time.

62
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:33,638
It's really more of a Street Fighter Dark Age,

63
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,580
but since Capcom was and kind of is still

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,061
like a symbolic genre leader,

65
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,943
the story that often gets told is that Street Fighter 3

66
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:44,365
was like a very demanding game with like a new mechanics,

67
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:46,126
like the difficult parry system and so on.

68
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:47,807
And it was inaccessible,

69
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:49,749
so it kind of didn't retain the massive

70
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,190
Street Fighter 2 audience that Capcom expected and desired.

71
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:54,031
And around that time,

72
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,033
fighters kind of like fell out of mainstream consciousness.

73
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:59,472
until 2009, Street Fighter 4 came along,

74
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:02,093
and that felt and still feels kind of significant,

75
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:03,413
like kind of the closing of one door

76
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:05,474
and the opening of another, like the beginning of a new era.

77
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:08,856
So if we call that time between Street Fighter 3 and 4

78
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:11,897
the Dark Age, I want to suggest that the time after it,

79
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:13,778
we call the Expansion Age.

80
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:16,439
So Street Fighter 4 is a perfect example of.

81
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:21,245
like how this was kind of kicked off right this is a game that had more approachable mechanics and

82
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:26,228
kind of online play for the first time and colorful colorful 3d graphics uh and you know highlighting

83
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:30,811
the original cast so this is all to me seems like a deliberate attempt at kind of appealing to a

84
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:35,634
larger audience like a broader audience uh not just people who had been playing and continued

85
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:39,556
to play fighting games but um people may be nostalgic for street fighter 2 or people who

86
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:43,259
maybe never played street fighter but just know like iconic characters like chun li and guile and

87
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:43,559
so on

88
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,952
So yeah, so this expansion age, that's like the period of time we're in now, and we've been in for a while.

89
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:55,354
The defining characteristic to me of this time is developers kind of putting priority on making their games easier to play,

90
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:58,055
easier to understand, more accessible, more approachable.

91
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,676
And you know, we see this through how developers communicate with players.

92
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:06,578
If you've read any interview with with almost any fighting game studio, you'll often hear things like,

93
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:08,558
oh, the game is as deep as ever, but it's easier to play.

94
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,601
Regardless though, this doesn't really seem

95
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:13,622
to have been as successful as many people might have hoped.

96
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:15,024
It's still common to even see players

97
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:16,004
talk about being intimidated.

98
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,266
Even players that play a lot of games,

99
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:19,848
players that consider themselves hardcore gamers.

100
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:21,929
It kind of reminds me, growing up,

101
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,890
something that a lot of people,

102
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,291
that you know, music fans would say,

103
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:26,774
oh I listen to everything, but not country and rap, right?

104
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:27,774
It's almost like fighting games

105
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:28,695
are kind of the country and rap.

106
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:30,717
It's maybe even worse, because there are people

107
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:32,298
who want to play these games and want to get into them,

108
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:33,399
but just can't figure out how.

109
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:36,241
Before we talk about why that is,

110
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:36,882
I want to kind of,

111
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,861
make something that's, make the case kind of against this process, like a case, a critique

112
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:45,503
maybe of the expansion age, which I think is a little unusual, especially from a developer,

113
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:47,584
but I think it's worth articulating.

114
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:53,426
I think the first thing is there's kind of like a romance of about difficult art, right?

115
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:58,968
There's a, in fighting specifically that kind of manifests itself in a fear of like diminishing

116
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:01,769
or like removing the value of skill, like feats of skill.

117
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,751
Tom Cannon, one of the founders of Evo, calls this the drama of humans under pressure.

118
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:09,226
And I can relate to this, like as a player and as a spectator,

119
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:12,428
I think part of what is so great about fighting games is how they're so expressive

120
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:15,650
and like allow for so much variety and reward skill.

121
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,073
Like they're games that don't come to you in the way that a lot of games now do.

122
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:21,354
And I don't think that's like invalidating.

123
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:22,155
I don't think that's bad.

124
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,256
I think difficult art is great.

125
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:25,537
I think composers like Schoenberg and Ornette Coleman and, you know,

126
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:29,240
performers like Lightning Bolt or Sonny Shyrock are all examples of kind of art

127
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,643
that you need to, you kind of need to work a little bit to appreciate it, right?

128
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:33,423
I don't think that's bad.

129
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:40,971
There's also a fear of kind of becoming too e-sports, which to me means a little too mainstream or like too dry and too commercial.

130
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:42,832
And I can relate to this also.

131
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:45,934
Like, I think there's this desire to emulate professional sports.

132
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:46,734
That's a little off-putting.

133
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:56,879
For one thing, like there's this emphasis on organizing around spectatorship versus participation, which just is a little less interesting to me personally.

134
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:00,542
Then there's the question, like, do we even know how to do this?

135
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:03,543
Like, so as a developer, I don't know that we actually know how

136
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,824
to make these games more accessible.

137
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,565
And there's a sense in which kind of tackling a problem

138
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:09,446
that you don't understand yet is like experimental surgery.

139
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:10,746
Like, it's unpredictable and weird.

140
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:15,228
My friend and collaborator, Richard Terrell, has a great example of this process

141
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:18,710
where he kind of likens it to attempting to like kind of squeeze a balloon in your hands.

142
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,271
And when you try to do that, like, you know, the air escapes between your fingers,

143
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,892
and then you kind of patch that up, and then it just moves and escapes somewhere else.

144
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:24,712
It's like not solvable.

145
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,141
And I think we'll see a running theme of this talk

146
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:28,703
is going to be unintended consequences

147
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:29,763
and weird side effects.

148
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:32,746
And then finally, well, maybe they're already accessible,

149
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:35,969
and people just don't like them, which we'll come back to.

150
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:38,931
There's also a case for accessibility, of course.

151
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:42,734
Most prominently, it's possible that design of fighting games

152
00:06:42,754 --> 00:06:44,896
has just become overcomplicated and confusing over time.

153
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:48,299
Many modern fighting games are the result

154
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,681
of a very long tradition of building on existing work

155
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:53,123
and kind of piling on prior knowledge that

156
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:55,945
kind of makes it difficult for players and developers

157
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:57,846
who are steeped in this stuff to kind of understand

158
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:00,708
how complicated it is, how it looks to a newcomer.

159
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,411
There's also the fact that games are expensive.

160
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:06,212
If you make a fighting game and you

161
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:07,232
want to make another game afterward,

162
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,313
that game has to make money, right?

163
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:12,176
You have to recoup, especially as games become more online

164
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:13,597
and more games of a service model

165
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:14,678
kind of become more expected.

166
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:15,938
This just gets harder and harder.

167
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,584
Then there's the fact that games kind of are a little bit unique to me in that they kind

168
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,366
of need to be activated by their players in a sense.

169
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:28,471
There's a sense in which when more people play a game, they kind of reveal all the weird,

170
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,375
cool, fun aspects of it that are, you know, they're there in the code as like potentialities,

171
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:35,959
but you kind of need people to care about them and play them and kind of put pressure

172
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:36,580
on them to kind of...

173
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:40,125
help discover the cool truths about the games, right?

174
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:42,006
Like, seeing people do crazy things

175
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:44,827
like this tool-assisted combo is kind of just inspiring

176
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,128
and awesome because there's a value in that,

177
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:48,009
to me, just in and of itself.

178
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,112
And then finally, developers love fighting games.

179
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,073
Like, we do this stuff because we care about it

180
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:55,634
and we find something valuable in it.

181
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:57,575
And we actually do want to share them with the world,

182
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:01,457
so more access, more people is good just for that.

183
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:04,119
You want to see more of the stuff that you like.

184
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:08,307
So if it's not clear, I land on the for side

185
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,248
of this argument, but I think the concerns

186
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:12,088
on the against side are pretty serious.

187
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,729
And if this talk has a thesis, it's that I think

188
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:17,230
this is a more difficult, or at least a different process

189
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,190
than most people appreciate.

190
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,851
This talk is gonna try to help understand

191
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:23,772
what developers have tried, what works,

192
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:25,812
and what doesn't work.

193
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:28,453
And then at the end, I'm gonna try to offer some thoughts

194
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:30,113
about maybe what the next 10 years could look like.

195
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:33,683
We're going to talk about design, rules and features

196
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:35,704
in a game, and then input, specifically,

197
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,745
the stuff between the player and the characters.

198
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:39,787
So design.

199
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:43,009
There's a lot of stress around fighting games about how

200
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:45,710
to learn how to play or the right way to play, right?

201
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:49,713
So I want to start by asking, is there actually just something

202
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:51,194
inherently inaccessible about the design

203
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:52,194
or the nature of fighting games?

204
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:54,496
In other words, are these questions and stresses

205
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,697
actually really more intense than in other games?

206
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:58,518
And maybe they are.

207
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:00,426
Fighting games are head-to-head.

208
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:03,807
They're zero-sum, meaning if I'm going to lose, you win.

209
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:06,407
Actually, in Killer Instinct, there

210
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:08,088
was a brief period of time where there

211
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:10,268
was a bug where the people playing online,

212
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:11,528
their inputs would go out of sync.

213
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:12,768
So both players could win.

214
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:14,889
Killer Instinct was briefly the perfect fighting game.

215
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,210
But usually, it is zero-sum.

216
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,510
So when you do lose, there's no one to blame,

217
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,430
which can be stressful, obviously.

218
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,051
In order to improve, you have to interact with strangers,

219
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:27,031
which is even more stressful.

220
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:30,727
And then you also need to kind of examine your own behavior,

221
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:32,548
which is maybe supremely stressful.

222
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:36,370
But that's all true of all the most popular

223
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,351
enduring 1v1 games.

224
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:38,111
None of that is unique.

225
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:40,612
But fighting games do kind of have on top of this

226
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:43,314
what I consider a pretty unique set of features.

227
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:45,890
For the one thing, obviously, they're real-time.

228
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,772
So this is an action game where execution and strategy

229
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:48,452
are both important.

230
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:50,954
There's no randomness, generally.

231
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:53,877
We know that randomness kind of has the effects of softening

232
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,398
the effects of skill.

233
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:57,059
It kind of brings players closer together

234
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:57,980
at disparate skill levels.

235
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,442
And so fighting games don't have very much of this.

236
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:02,764
And maybe as a result, they're more stark and a little bit

237
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:05,006
tougher than a lot of people are used to.

238
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:07,888
Fighting games also have perfect information, meaning

239
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:10,310
there's nothing that one player has access to

240
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,191
that another player doesn't.

241
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:12,331
I can see everything on screen.

242
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,092
There's not really anything.

243
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:14,817
that you're hiding from me.

244
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:16,759
For pedantic people in the audience,

245
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:18,241
I'm gonna fix this a little bit.

246
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,082
Yes, there are characters like Game and Watch and Peach

247
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:21,083
that have random properties.

248
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:24,126
And you can think of charged characters like Guile

249
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:25,988
as having hidden information.

250
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:27,430
If you can't see what I'm doing with my stick,

251
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,492
maybe I'm charging, maybe I'm not.

252
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:58,058
So if we look again at like our top games, none of them really have this combination of properties right chess go all these classic games are not real time hearthstone magic also not real time and then they are on top of that heavily random with tons of hidden information clash royale is real time, but it's kind of random and there's a little bit of information and then weirdly to me Starcraft 2 is actually the closest we get it is real time. It's not random, but you know because they're separate screens and because there's fog of war. There is a lot of hidden information.

253
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:01,157
So I don't think this means the design of fighters

254
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:02,537
is inherently flawed or limited.

255
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:05,159
But maybe they cut a little closer to the bone

256
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:06,520
than a lot of other games.

257
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,122
So unless you're especially gifted,

258
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:10,482
you're going to lose a lot before you

259
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,383
become decent at these games.

260
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:13,604
And when you do lose, it can hurt quite a bit.

261
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:15,466
I think maybe this is the biggest impediment

262
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:17,807
towards mainstream embrace of these games now.

263
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,888
But at the same time, maybe the biggest gift

264
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:23,931
for these games to have and the reason why there's so much what

265
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,973
seems to me to be unique passion energy around people

266
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:27,753
who do play these games.

267
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:34,581
I know me personally, I kind of think of fighting games as a reality check, as opposed to a

268
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:35,282
power fantasy.

269
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:39,785
So many games now are about empowering the player and making them feel like something

270
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:42,927
maybe they're not, whereas fighting games will very quickly show you exactly what you

271
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:44,468
are and where you sit.

272
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:49,492
There was a couple other things I was going to say here, but Patrick Miller actually just

273
00:11:49,532 --> 00:11:53,635
wrote a great article about what he gets out of these games, and I just suggest people

274
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,817
will read that instead because he's much more articulate than I am.

275
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,332
So first thing I want to talk about is training modes,

276
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:01,033
trial, story.

277
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,673
These are generally single-player activities

278
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:04,414
intended to help people learn how to play.

279
00:12:07,015 --> 00:12:08,636
So training modes, for example, in theory,

280
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:09,896
these are like a safe space for players

281
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,277
to experiment and train, not have

282
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,958
to worry about what other people are thinking or doing.

283
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:13,838
And they're very, very good now.

284
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:15,899
We have replays, and save states, and AI settings,

285
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,000
and recording, and lag settings, and all sorts

286
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,660
of great features.

287
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,021
There's a couple issues, like learning

288
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,402
how to use a good training mode is actually

289
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:24,463
more involved than learning many other single-player games

290
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:24,923
entirely.

291
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,891
They're also entirely self-directed,

292
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,833
so there's no real motivation to use something like this

293
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,375
unless you already care about getting good at the game.

294
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:31,636
And they're also not very effective

295
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:33,758
unless you know how, why, when to train, and so on.

296
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,901
There's also an interesting unexpected side effect

297
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:40,244
of these modes in that in a game that has a good training mode,

298
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:42,226
the people who want to get good and know how to get good

299
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:44,308
can get good very, very quickly, which

300
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:47,631
can kind of separate the skills of the player base

301
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:48,632
in a surprising way, I think.

302
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:50,978
You know, we also have trials.

303
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,559
So these are more directed.

304
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,061
Classic examples, Street Fighter IV has combo challenges

305
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:56,661
for each character.

306
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:59,523
Dragon Ball FighterZ has a series of kind of tutorials

307
00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:02,364
about mechanics on the extreme side of things.

308
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:03,825
Under Night In-Birth has this amazing,

309
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:05,806
massive interactive manual.

310
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,209
Then we have more interactive tutorials.

311
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,170
So Guilty Gear Xrd and Skullgirls did an excellent job

312
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:14,391
in this.

313
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:17,053
These kind of go beyond just telling you how the game works

314
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:18,473
and kind of start.

315
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,220
teaching you concepts.

316
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,361
So in this Skullgirls example, the player

317
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,762
needs to block a series of attacks from the computer.

318
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:26,683
And then when they block it successfully three times,

319
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:27,744
they can move on to the next lesson.

320
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:30,665
So this is cool because it's like it's actually

321
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:31,566
just teaching concepts, right?

322
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:33,067
It's kind of repeating and confirming knowledge

323
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:34,127
and can be very effective.

324
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:37,609
And then on the story mode, like single player side of things,

325
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:40,591
we have a lot of single player non-competitive modes.

326
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:42,712
Typically, these are kind of perfunctory,

327
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:45,493
like a series of fights against AI.

328
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:47,374
Traditionally, you go through the whole mode,

329
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,655
and at the end, you get a bit of dialogue or a bit of story.

330
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:51,736
Modern games have taken this to an extreme.

331
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,438
Obviously, Injustice series has lavish cut scenes

332
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,699
and amazing voice acting between each battle.

333
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,120
We've seen a lot of focus on kind of character customization,

334
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,342
character creation, lots of things for players

335
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:04,803
to unlock and purchase, kind of be creative with.

336
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:09,013
So there's a bit of a pragmatic problem here

337
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:10,974
in just that these are all costly to develop and maintain.

338
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:14,417
So it's easy to understand why like Mortal Kombat

339
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,898
or Injustice cut scenes are expensive,

340
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,780
but even just a training tutorial,

341
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,341
interactive tutorial mode,

342
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,343
they're not trivial features, right?

343
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:24,945
They take effort from the design team

344
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:27,447
and they also take sustained kind of repeated effort

345
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:29,448
because these are games that change, they get patched

346
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:31,630
and you can either leave it alone

347
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,631
and maybe teach people obsolete or bad information

348
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:34,972
or go back and actually touch it up.

349
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:41,993
Then you kind of have to question if these modes are actually effective at teaching or

350
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,274
even attracting people in the first place.

351
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:47,138
It's possible that it barely matters because most people don't actually do them.

352
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:50,301
You can kind of see a very similar curve in a lot of other games.

353
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:53,544
This is the dojo mode and killer instinct and people drop off very quickly.

354
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:59,549
It's also possible that, you know, games that kind of put pressure like in their, you know,

355
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:00,970
in their menus and in their feature set.

356
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,670
If they communicate to you that you need to research and study

357
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,330
to play this game, it's possible that this is actually

358
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,191
worse than doing nothing.

359
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:08,231
And it's intimidating.

360
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:10,111
If you look at some of the biggest fighters right now,

361
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:12,572
Smash Brothers, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Street Fighter V,

362
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:13,892
these aren't simple games at all.

363
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,013
But they kind of put less emphasis on learning.

364
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,233
They don't tell you that you need

365
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:20,114
to train, which maybe makes them more appealing.

366
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:21,154
A lot of people don't like school.

367
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:24,175
I know anecdotally, I've seen people fall into a training

368
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,576
trap where they maybe feel like they can't play online

369
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:28,437
or can't play with their friends until they get through the combo

370
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:29,257
mode for their character.

371
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:30,517
And sometimes that can be very difficult.

372
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:34,471
on the Killer Instinct Dojo, one thing I really liked that we did was

373
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:39,374
actually encourage people to go away and stop using the Dojo after four lessons. You go play some matches and come back.

374
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:44,197
There's also, you know, a ton of resources for learning outside of the game now.

375
00:15:44,217 --> 00:15:48,479
You don't need games to teach you necessarily because you can go to YouTube with a lot of very talented people, spend a lot of

376
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,721
time making information easy to digest.

377
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:55,756
Then as far as story modes go, I think there's a lot of room to disagree about how kind of

378
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:58,698
important and expected these kinds of features are, but it's not clear to me that they're

379
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:03,040
like actually appealing to people who don't already care about these games necessarily.

380
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,662
I don't know if they solve an accessibility problem beyond does this game have enough

381
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:09,343
bullet points on the side of the box to like seem like a good purchase, right?

382
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,061
Like I said, these are typically just a series of fights against AI, which is repetitive.

383
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,223
A common way people have been obscuring this recently is by putting players on a map so

384
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:21,285
they can kind of self-direct and move around and kind of feel like they have more agency

385
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:21,965
over what's happening.

386
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:26,368
But, you know, then it becomes harder to kind of create a difficulty curve that makes sense

387
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,229
or teach players because, you know, they can go where they want.

388
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:32,651
Encounters become either way too easy or way too difficult.

389
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:35,613
There's also a trend towards adding modifiers and RPG

390
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,814
mechanics to add variety to fight it, to the fights,

391
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:40,255
and maybe allow grinding to help players that are struggling.

392
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:43,817
Personally, this is always frustrating to me

393
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:45,137
because I end up spending a lot of time in menus

394
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:45,698
in this kind of game.

395
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:48,619
And when I pick up a Smash Brothers or a Marvelous Capcom,

396
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,741
I don't expect to be navigating menus for most of my time.

397
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:56,058
So as a design challenge, I think

398
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:57,339
there's something really alluring about the idea

399
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:58,860
of the great single-player fighting game

400
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,342
that maybe will ambiently teach people how the games work

401
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:02,863
by having them have fun while they're doing it.

402
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:04,965
I am still a little skeptical.

403
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:06,927
Unless you're working on a project

404
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:08,949
that already has a massive built-in fan base,

405
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:10,910
like a Smash Brothers brawl or Injustice,

406
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,193
if your solution to a design problem like this

407
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:16,135
is just make another game and put it in your game,

408
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:18,017
I think it's a difficult path.

409
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,218
That's a very expensive pursuit.

410
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:23,035
Next up is kind of pacing mechanics.

411
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,615
So this is kind of like mechanics and rules

412
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,896
that attempt to influence or color the flow of a game.

413
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:28,717
The thinking here is generally,

414
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:29,798
well, what do players hate?

415
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:31,599
They hate getting steamrolled and losing badly.

416
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:32,619
And what do players love?

417
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:33,360
They love tension.

418
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,260
They love close matches and kind of upsets.

419
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,602
Obviously, competitors would not prefer

420
00:17:37,662 --> 00:17:38,422
close matches and upsets.

421
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:39,202
They'd prefer just to win.

422
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:41,563
But generally, players and spectators

423
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,245
actually do prefer uncertainty in their games, right?

424
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:46,366
None of these mechanics are especially new,

425
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:47,426
but they're kind of more ubiquitous.

426
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:50,843
Non-linear health bars, kind of deceptive health bars

427
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,923
is a classic example.

428
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,884
In Marvel vs. Capcom 3, for example,

429
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:56,124
the health bar kind of extends beyond the X there.

430
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:58,025
So there's hidden health that you can't actually see.

431
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,146
BlazBlue, Street Fighter V do something kind of similar,

432
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:04,147
where once your health is below a certain percentage,

433
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:05,527
all incoming damage is reduced.

434
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:07,568
This is kind of cool.

435
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,328
It kind of obscures the true game state

436
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:11,789
so that it appears that the players are closer to losing

437
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:13,930
than they actually are, which maybe

438
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,770
if you don't know what's happening,

439
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,730
it kind of creates tension.

440
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,510
So that's kind of cool.

441
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,950
There's also comeback mechanics.

442
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,171
Classic example of Marvel's Capcom 3's X-Factor.

443
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:22,752
Also, Dragon Ball FighterZ has sparking.

444
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,932
These are kind of mechanics that become more powerful

445
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,073
the longer you wait to use them.

446
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,414
Tekken 7 has something similar with Rage Art.

447
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:30,995
It's like a super move that becomes available

448
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:31,755
when you're low on health.

449
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:33,816
Killer Instinct.

450
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:36,556
Instinct mode, again, a meter that fills as you take damage.

451
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:39,758
And then once it's full, you can activate it and briefly

452
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:41,578
get access to new, exciting mechanics.

453
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:47,903
So yeah, so this is something I've been thinking about a lot recently, even just outside of the context of fighting games.

454
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:54,449
I think when done well, like these kinds of like rules on top of the game can give a game like a heartbeat or a pulse, like an arc that's really nice.

455
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,334
If done poorly though, it can be very predictable or, you know, even worse exploitable.

456
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:03,299
If it feels like a lot of gameplay kind of revolves around this mechanic, it's probably too impactful.

457
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,221
Like I think it's easy for these things to become a little too important.

458
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,040
And then, of course, there's an obvious cost

459
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,741
to just piling on meters and mechanics and extra rules

460
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:13,201
that are outside the basic gameplay.

461
00:19:13,722 --> 00:19:15,422
For a lot of people, just the punches and kicks are enough.

462
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:18,403
It's easy to see why this might be

463
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:19,583
overcomplicated for some people.

464
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:23,104
So then finally, we have rewards.

465
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:25,345
So we live in a time where it feels like we are.

466
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:28,713
Most games are bending over backwards to reward players

467
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:29,393
for playing, right?

468
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,754
That's very much the time that we're in right now.

469
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:33,534
And a lot of fighting games are doing this as well.

470
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:35,615
There's a lot of mechanics kind of borrowed from mobile games.

471
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:37,756
You see in Street Fighter V, Killer Instinct,

472
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,436
you get a daily login bonus when you play the game.

473
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:42,977
You have in-game missions that you can use to win currency.

474
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:45,918
Here's me playing Final Fantasy Dissidia,

475
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:47,459
getting rewarded for jumping three times

476
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,740
and using a special move 10 times in Killer Instinct.

477
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,800
We also have unlocks.

478
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:54,341
So there's aesthetic unlocks, like the gacha.

479
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,342
There's a gacha game in Guilty Gear

480
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,823
where you can unlock costumes, and colors, and avatars,

481
00:19:59,843 --> 00:20:00,243
and so on.

482
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:02,663
Then we have more mechanical unlocks.

483
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:04,064
So famously, Smash Brothers has you

484
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:05,884
unlock 70-some different characters.

485
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:09,225
And ARMS, for example, has you unlock ARMS

486
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:10,465
that you attach to your fighters to try

487
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:11,325
to change their properties.

488
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:14,906
Obviously, it's probably more exciting to unlock King Day

489
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:17,687
Today than color for a character you might not even use.

490
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,618
But there's a cost.

491
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,078
You delay the player having access to the full game.

492
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:23,699
You make your tournament organizers miserable.

493
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:25,559
That's definitely a balance there.

494
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,100
And then there's the most meaningful rewards.

495
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,961
So Cache and Clout, a lot of developers

496
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:33,482
have been organizing their own tours, their own tournaments.

497
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:34,822
And obviously, most people will never

498
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:35,822
get to stand on that stage.

499
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:38,123
But the idea that you could, or the idea

500
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:39,503
that it's rewarded to be that good

501
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:41,224
is definitely appealing to a certain type of player.

502
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,512
So I think if you believe complexity is a barrier to accessibility, these are not solutions

503
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:48,453
to the accessibility problem.

504
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,736
They may aid retention, but I think as these kind of mechanics become more and more ubiquitous,

505
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:57,338
and I think we're at that point now, basically, I think they probably will start to become

506
00:20:57,378 --> 00:20:58,179
a lot less effective.

507
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,623
And, you know, there's kind of an air of pandering, and maybe it makes it feel like your game

508
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:09,166
isn't confident, like has a lack of confidence that's compelling on its own when you overdo

509
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:09,346
this.

510
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:10,827
Like, you can shower rewards on players.

511
00:21:11,513 --> 00:21:12,593
And it can actually be quite risky.

512
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:14,094
This is a little outside of the scope of this talk,

513
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:15,455
but there's been a lot of talk at GDC

514
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,116
in the past of extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation.

515
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:21,558
And long story short, there's a lot

516
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,979
of research suggesting that when rewards are

517
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:27,040
contingent and expected, meaning you know how and when you'll

518
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,301
get them, they can actually damage players' motivation

519
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:30,161
pretty severely.

520
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:32,499
So next up is input.

521
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,241
This is notoriously the most intimidating aspect

522
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:35,781
of the genre.

523
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:37,983
The idea that execution is a barrier to entry,

524
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:40,184
that you might need to, if you can't throw a fireball,

525
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:41,545
you might need to practice before you can do that,

526
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:42,966
is a tough sell to a lot of people.

527
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,229
It's possible these games just ask for too much precision,

528
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:46,989
too much dexterity.

529
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,511
This is also not a new concern.

530
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:51,332
Like the original Street Fighter cabinets,

531
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,633
you can see on the right there, they

532
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:54,574
experimented with the six-button layout we know,

533
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:56,536
and also this kind of weird pressure-sensitive thing

534
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:59,137
where you kind of hit the button really hard to get a heavy kick

535
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:00,518
tap it to get a light kick.

536
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:04,221
A lot of mechanics that we consider mainstays of the genre

537
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,502
now, like cancels and input buffer windows and so on,

538
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:07,963
these all come out of early attempts

539
00:22:08,003 --> 00:22:10,604
at making the games easier to play, moves more reliable.

540
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,125
So this is definitely not a new thing.

541
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:15,646
We also have hardware and cost as a barrier to entry.

542
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:18,088
What kind of controller should you use?

543
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,508
That can be a big question, especially

544
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:20,289
in a game like Smash Bros.

545
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:21,089
You have a lot of options.

546
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:22,450
Do I need a stick?

547
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,770
What kind of stick do I need?

548
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,592
Then we have experimental controllers and issues

549
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:27,592
around like, you know, like, you know,

550
00:22:28,272 --> 00:22:31,253
modding hardware and measuring latency and input lag.

551
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:35,455
There's a lot of overhead to playing these games

552
00:22:35,495 --> 00:22:36,035
the right way.

553
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:39,397
So it seems like an area where there's a lot that can

554
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:40,357
be done to help newcomers.

555
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:42,695
There's kind of two dominant approaches

556
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:45,398
that I've seen recently to helping players out that I

557
00:22:45,418 --> 00:22:46,218
think are new and interesting.

558
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,061
Assist modes are a first example.

559
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:51,823
These are just simply control options that if you turn it on,

560
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:55,267
they kind of simplify the input requirements for various moves.

561
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:57,068
There's a lot of examples of this in a lot of games.

562
00:22:57,989 --> 00:22:59,611
Guilty Gear, for example, stylish mode

563
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:01,692
will change the input system dramatically.

564
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:03,934
It's a dedicated special move button you get,

565
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:06,777
and simplified blocking and much more.

566
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,311
Then we have auto combos.

567
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:11,193
So these are like series of moves linked together

568
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:13,114
by a single button press that you press repeatedly.

569
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:15,817
So if a combo is a series of moves

570
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:17,999
that connect without the attacker having a chance

571
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:20,741
to react, this is literally an automatic combo.

572
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,122
You get a combo just by mashing.

573
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:27,207
So these are often reduced or non-optimal damage compared

574
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:28,548
to other combos in games.

575
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:29,709
And they often end in a super move

576
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:31,150
that uses a resource, a meter.

577
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,862
So yeah, so assist modes are like kind of generally

578
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,324
considered training wheels or like a crutch.

579
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:39,725
There's a lot of kind of stigma around these.

580
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:42,668
And it makes sense, like the idea of, you know,

581
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:43,970
on a bicycle using training wheels,

582
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,131
there's some stigma to that as well.

583
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:47,533
And as a result, like a lot of people avoid using them,

584
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:50,276
even people who actually should use them, you know,

585
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:52,919
and you can try to avoid this by naming them something nice,

586
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:54,340
like smart mode or stylish mode.

587
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,321
And I don't think it really helps.

588
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:56,362
I think people know what these are.

589
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,100
There's also, I call them perverse training wheels.

590
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,581
Like one reason is that they're very predictable, right?

591
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,322
You kind of limit your options so it's

592
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:05,882
easier for a more seasoned player

593
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,643
to kind of know what you're doing, which

594
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:09,543
kind of has the perverse effect of making you easier

595
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,004
to fight instead of the opposite, which

596
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:11,904
might be more desirable.

597
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:15,105
And you know, maybe they're even worse than training wheels.

598
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,606
Like they may make it easier to do stuff,

599
00:24:17,786 --> 00:24:19,826
like stuff that looks cool, but because it's kind of cordoned

600
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:20,747
off for the rest of the game, there's

601
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:23,407
no graceful way to kind of grow into understanding

602
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:24,628
the rest of the game.

603
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:28,357
I think looking at Tekken 7 is kind of an interesting example

604
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:28,577
of this.

605
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:31,798
They have both assist modes and auto combos, in a sense.

606
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:36,319
So yeah, the typical Tekken 7 input control is simple.

607
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,740
Each arm has a button.

608
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,500
Each leg has a button.

609
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,661
There is a assist mode where, if you hold down

610
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:45,302
a new input, the shoulder button, each of those

611
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:47,683
kind of gets remapped to a predetermined special move.

612
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:48,623
So this is fine.

613
00:24:48,643 --> 00:24:50,644
This is kind of just on top of the gameplay of Tekken 7.

614
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:51,784
I think it's harmless.

615
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,526
Then we have basic combos, which this is a toggle where you turn this on and it kind

616
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:59,507
of replaces two of the buttons with auto combos.

617
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:04,390
So you kind of lose access, obviously, to a lot of what your character is, a lot of

618
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,090
important options.

619
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,451
So this is, to me, is kind of perverse, right?

620
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:11,433
It kind of helps you do stuff, but like the stuff you're doing is not really playing the

621
00:25:11,813 --> 00:25:12,293
game.

622
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:16,776
It's like being able to do short combos or even specific special moves isn't really playing

623
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:17,096
Tekken.

624
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:17,396
It's like...

625
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,215
Maybe even worse, because suggesting that it is

626
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,377
might actually make learning how to play Tekken harder,

627
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:22,857
not easier.

628
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,141
One thing that I actually like about the combo assist

629
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:30,784
mode in Killer Instinct is that it doesn't lock off

630
00:25:30,804 --> 00:25:32,445
the normal ways to perform moves,

631
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:34,346
and actually you can kind of enable and disable

632
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:35,708
each component of it.

633
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:37,929
The combo system in KI is kind of baroque,

634
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,290
and I'm not really gonna get into it here,

635
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,452
but it is nice that you can kind of ease in

636
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:42,913
or out of this at any point.

637
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:49,115
Like assist modes, like the motivation behind implementing

638
00:25:49,135 --> 00:25:50,376
something like auto combos can sometimes

639
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,956
feel like it's less about actually helping people

640
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:55,358
to understand or play the game, and more about wanting players

641
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:57,439
to kind of see cool stuff happen often and early.

642
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,220
So a common criticism that these systems kind of encourage

643
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,341
and reward mashing, kind of like the mindless pressing

644
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:02,741
of buttons.

645
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:05,242
And in some cases, I think this is true.

646
00:26:05,282 --> 00:26:06,783
Like Marvel's Capcom 3, King of Fighters 14

647
00:26:07,203 --> 00:26:08,743
have auto combos that are kind of just

648
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:10,424
a series of almost identical normal attacks.

649
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:11,245
If one hits, they all hit.

650
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:13,405
If one is blocked, they'll all kind of be blocked easily.

651
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:14,366
There's not a lot going on there.

652
00:26:15,895 --> 00:26:17,115
But there's a couple nice examples, I think.

653
00:26:17,156 --> 00:26:19,336
If we take a closer look at Linne in Under Night In-Birth,

654
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:21,177
you can see her first two hits are blocked.

655
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:22,758
The third hit gets through somehow.

656
00:26:23,358 --> 00:26:24,419
That's because, no, that is a low,

657
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,599
so there's a very basic mix-up, right?

658
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:27,380
The defender would need to crouch block.

659
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,781
This is an AI, so it's not doing anything.

660
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:32,102
But you can kind of see how there's a little bit more

661
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:34,623
going on here than just kind of mindless mashing.

662
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:37,564
Another example is in Beerus in Dragon Ball FighterZ.

663
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:42,017
His auto combo kind of has a built-in gap and like a built-in left-right mix-up

664
00:26:42,037 --> 00:26:43,958
You can see again his first two hits are blocked

665
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:47,599
He kind of skates underneath Frieza because this is a traditional 2d fighting game

666
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:50,000
You know, you need to hold away to block incoming attacks

667
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,141
But now he's on the other side so the the defender would have to change the direction they're blocking

668
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:57,923
So this kind of this is nice like they're not optional, right? These are a part of the game

669
00:26:57,943 --> 00:26:59,503
They're not something you turn on or off. You can't

670
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:02,045
decide that you're opting out of this

671
00:27:02,065 --> 00:27:03,325
because you're embarrassed by it or whatever.

672
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:05,546
They're also integrated into the game context.

673
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:08,707
They're made up of cancels and they use hit stun

674
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,307
and they kind of have mix-ups and gaps and so on.

675
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:12,668
They almost kind of become like a character balance tool

676
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,629
at low level play and maybe a teaching tool.

677
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:18,570
If you are just someone who's mashing

678
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,011
or you're playing against someone who's mashing,

679
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:21,651
you'll see kind of important concepts like this

680
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:23,392
over and over again just because they're built into

681
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:24,452
to your toolkit.

682
00:27:24,472 --> 00:27:26,193
You'll start to understand, oh, why did I get hit there?

683
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:27,033
Why do I always get hit?

684
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:30,980
by that move and maybe you'll discover it's because you need to block certain moves below.

685
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:37,462
So next is the idea that fewer buttons is more friendly, like less intimidating.

686
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:40,303
A lot of new games have relatively simple controls.

687
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:44,124
Of course, the number of buttons that a game uses doesn't actually really tell you much

688
00:27:44,144 --> 00:27:44,944
how a game is played.

689
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,525
There's longer games with fewer than six attack buttons.

690
00:27:47,605 --> 00:27:49,986
For example, Virtua Fighter 5.

691
00:27:51,314 --> 00:27:52,114
has very few buttons, right?

692
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:53,535
It's a three-button game, but it has a reputation

693
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:54,435
for being difficult to play.

694
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:57,256
And that's because they're used in complicated series

695
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:59,096
and they're kind of require memorization,

696
00:27:59,116 --> 00:28:00,837
like the functionality of these moves is unclear.

697
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:03,178
And I don't want to overstate this.

698
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:04,378
I think everyone in this room could learn

699
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:05,978
to play Virtua Fighter 5 with a little effort.

700
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:09,399
But just from a kind of casual perspective,

701
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,040
it's easy to understand why you might look at this

702
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,361
and be more intimidated than looking at something

703
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:15,701
like Street Fighter 5, which, yeah,

704
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:17,802
it has twice as many buttons, but it has way less

705
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:20,523
kind of moves and rules, right?

706
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:38,515
Um, this is it looks like the Chicago train system. That's the CTA. It is actually persona for arena. Um, this is an interesting example because it kind of just demonstrates how complicated this all is. Like, there's a ton of combinations in this game, despite only having four buttons and a lot of contextual inputs, kind of overlapping inputs like.

707
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,512
ABC is an input and also ACD is an input,

708
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:43,553
which looks kind of miserable,

709
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:45,433
especially considering most people play this game on a pad.

710
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:48,695
But you know, actually, when you play on a pad,

711
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:50,176
those are mapped to, I think,

712
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:51,357
the shoulder buttons and the trigger buttons.

713
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,817
So maybe it makes more sense to think about this

714
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:55,038
as a six button game, it's unclear.

715
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,200
So I think number buttons is an incomplete metric.

716
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,541
It's really more of the beginning of a conversation,

717
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:01,242
not the end of one.

718
00:29:02,002 --> 00:29:03,163
You need to consider how they're used,

719
00:29:03,483 --> 00:29:05,584
how a combination of inputs and sequences,

720
00:29:05,624 --> 00:29:06,644
special move commands and so on,

721
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:06,985
they kind of.

722
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:09,386
You need to take that all into account.

723
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:10,186
The number of buttons can actually

724
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,187
just obscure the real demands of a game's mechanics.

725
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:15,888
We also know learning a game is not as simple as just

726
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,688
memorizing what a button does and pressing it

727
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:18,688
at the right time.

728
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,909
There's a lot more going on there as well.

729
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,170
So if that's all true, I think it's

730
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,130
good to know when you actually should add more inputs.

731
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,811
Trust that the ease of use for mid-level players

732
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:32,272
should actually take priority over this questionable idea

733
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:33,632
that less is always more.

734
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:35,012
Guilty gear.

735
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:46,140
Great example, they added the dust button on the sequel to the original guilty or added this. It was formerly a combined inputs with a slash and heavy slash. I believe this isn't just an accessibility issue. I know in this case like.

736
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:58,993
This was a way to resolve certain like option selects kind of complexities that are like maybe undesirable and difficult to resolve when you have kind of combined inputs like that, but I think it's interesting for our purposes because it kind of.

737
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:01,580
calls out the functionality of the dust button to the player.

738
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,783
It's like, this is so important that it deserves its own button.

739
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:04,744
And it is important.

740
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:06,405
It's a big part of how Guilty Gear combos are built.

741
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:11,350
Smash Brothers Ultimate also did something great

742
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,212
with one of the aspects that was my least favorite part

743
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:13,832
of the game.

744
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:16,695
Tilts in Smash Brothers are a button combination

745
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:19,098
where instead of smashing the stick and pressing attack,

746
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:21,800
you gently nudge it halfway between neutral

747
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,301
and the direction.

748
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:25,810
A lot of people don't even know that these are moves

749
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,091
because they're kind of hard to discover

750
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,112
and they're small and fast,

751
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:29,532
and in the heat of battle it's really hard,

752
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:31,853
at least for me personally, to do these when I want to

753
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:34,755
and not mess them up 30% of the time or whatever.

754
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:36,916
In Smash Bros. Ultimate, they allowed you

755
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,037
to map the tilts to the right stick.

756
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:43,118
And this is great, this adds a whole new stick

757
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:46,440
for players maybe, but the game is genuinely easier

758
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,381
to play with this, so I think it's a win overall.

759
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,083
And then finally for input, there's this idea

760
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:52,423
that like...

761
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,090
A lot of the fun and depth in these games

762
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,870
comes from the way that the characters are different.

763
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,551
But what if they were less different?

764
00:30:59,911 --> 00:31:01,591
Smash Brothers, again, is a classic example of this.

765
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:02,832
You don't have to learn different inputs

766
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:03,492
for every character.

767
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:05,032
Everyone, once you kind of internalize the fact

768
00:31:05,052 --> 00:31:06,432
that there's a special button, an attack button,

769
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:07,933
you combine those directions, you

770
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:11,033
can kind of pick up most characters pretty easily.

771
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,734
More traditional fighters have been doing this as well.

772
00:31:14,534 --> 00:31:17,214
A lot of the tougher special move inputs,

773
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:19,255
like 360s, half circles, even dragon punches,

774
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,975
are kind of starting to fade away in a lot of games.

775
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,156
Pocket Rumble has done some interesting stuff

776
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:27,597
with diagonal inputs and diagonal inputs with holds.

777
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:31,278
Rising Thunder and the upcoming Granblue Fantasy Versus

778
00:31:31,818 --> 00:31:33,479
put special moves on individual buttons.

779
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,120
While it's on the screen, I just want to highlight,

780
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,001
Rising Thunder is actually an eight-button game.

781
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,662
But it's probably, as far as traditional fighters go,

782
00:31:41,722 --> 00:31:42,722
easier to play than almost anything

783
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:44,103
we've talked about so far.

784
00:31:44,543 --> 00:31:48,024
Every button has a very deliberate, distinct purpose.

785
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:49,024
And there's not a lot of overlap,

786
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:50,505
not a lot of combinations.

787
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:54,455
There's also kind of a trend towards what I'm calling

788
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:55,535
dedicated functionality.

789
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:57,236
We mentioned Phantom Strike Rise of Thunder.

790
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:58,417
They put specials on buttons.

791
00:31:58,457 --> 00:32:01,439
But if we look at an abridged history of the Marvel vs. Capcom

792
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:03,280
series, I think it shows something interesting as well.

793
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,661
So all three of these games use six buttons.

794
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:09,063
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 started introducing two assist buttons

795
00:32:09,123 --> 00:32:11,445
and made the medium attacks a little bit more

796
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:12,525
difficult to do as a result.

797
00:32:13,146 --> 00:32:14,366
And then Marvel vs. Capcom 3 kind of

798
00:32:14,386 --> 00:32:16,087
continued this, added a launcher button,

799
00:32:16,107 --> 00:32:17,849
which just like we were talking about with Guilty Gear,

800
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,610
it's a great way to highlight that this is.

801
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,851
something important, something to pay attention to.

802
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:25,393
It kind of reveals it at the cost of another normal attack

803
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:25,653
button.

804
00:32:25,673 --> 00:32:27,413
But there's so much else going on in these games

805
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:31,155
that I think that worked out fine for them.

806
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:34,276
Then finally, what if we did the same thing with combos?

807
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:37,298
So what if most characters could kind of string together

808
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:38,938
moves with the same inputs?

809
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:40,519
We see this in.

810
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,262
A lot of older games also, so X-Men, Children of the Atom,

811
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:44,822
and Darkstalkers kind of introduced this concept

812
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:45,683
as a magic series.

813
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,823
But a lot of more modern games are even more freeform.

814
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:49,124
Street Fighter, Cross Tech, and you

815
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:52,305
can go from any button to a higher strength button.

816
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:53,905
Dragon Ball FighterZ is very similar.

817
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:56,586
You can kind of end it with ki attacks or supers.

818
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:59,247
On Rainbirth, you can press pretty much any button

819
00:32:59,387 --> 00:33:00,708
in any order as long as you don't repeat,

820
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:02,248
and you can mix in kind of crouching

821
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:03,349
to get even more variety there.

822
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:04,029
So.

823
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:07,096
These aren't the only combos available in these games,

824
00:33:07,516 --> 00:33:07,797
obviously.

825
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:10,179
They're just combos that are available to most characters.

826
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,600
And they're usually very easy to perform.

827
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,341
So they have generous buffer windows and so on.

828
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:17,485
It's also interesting to note that Dragon Ball Fighters

829
00:33:17,585 --> 00:33:20,427
and Undernight have auto combos in addition to this.

830
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:23,990
So you can start integrating magic series

831
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,732
into your auto combo or vice versa.

832
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:27,753
You can also mix in special moves.

833
00:33:27,813 --> 00:33:30,896
It's a very open-ended system that

834
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:32,537
creates a lot of ways for players

835
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:32,898
to kind of.

836
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:35,887
optimize their combos at their own speed, right?

837
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:39,710
And so I think this can be really effective.

838
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,412
I think the best thing about these trends

839
00:33:41,512 --> 00:33:43,874
is that they make it easier to try different characters.

840
00:33:43,914 --> 00:33:46,336
They reduce the overhead of figuring out how to do stuff.

841
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:51,644
I think that's like a real underappreciated difficulty in appreciating these games for new players

842
00:33:52,084 --> 00:33:54,745
Especially in a game that might have you know

843
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:59,947
20 40 60 characters finding and like learning a character that you like especially if you maybe you don't even know what you like yet

844
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,888
Can be really daunting and this may be one of the most powerful aspects of Smash Brothers success

845
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:08,369
I'm kind of calling this like knowledge portability and yeah, I really like it

846
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:11,931
I think it's a great way for low level players to kind of graduate to mid-level players

847
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:14,963
Flip side of this for me personally

848
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:17,083
is something like the Mortal Kombat series, where commands

849
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:18,904
can almost feel arbitrary and inconsistent.

850
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:21,345
They don't teach me really.

851
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,726
And it almost feels like the game is difficult to learn

852
00:34:24,186 --> 00:34:24,886
for no reason.

853
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:27,427
Or it's like the part of the game that I dislike most,

854
00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:30,148
this kind of memorization, just takes longer than maybe it

855
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:30,949
could.

856
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,510
And yes, so again, buttons can kind

857
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,771
of signpost important mechanics, as we talked about dust button

858
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:37,491
and launcher button.

859
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:40,392
It's just a great way to tell players that this part

860
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,213
of your game is important.

861
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:45,535
And then finally, just the idea that exceptions are OK,

862
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:46,215
I think is important.

863
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:48,296
So even if you have this broad outline,

864
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,136
like a skeleton of a rule set for your game,

865
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:51,817
if it's not always true, that's fine.

866
00:34:51,837 --> 00:34:53,578
Some of my favorite characters in Dragon Ball Fighter

867
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:56,579
that I play as don't obey their Magic series rule.

868
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:57,959
And that's OK.

869
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:58,979
Maybe if that's your first character,

870
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,740
that's a little bit of a steeper learning curve

871
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,340
than it could have been.

872
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:04,161
But just having that kind of rule

873
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:06,782
that you can kind of point to, I think,

874
00:35:06,802 --> 00:35:08,343
can be really helpful regardless.

875
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:18,793
So to conclude input, I think we can kind of like look at two kind of opposing motivations or ways of thinking about action game design in the expansion age.

876
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:27,097
And I think there's a lot of truth to both. The first is kind of trying to strip away the other stuff to like get to the strategy or mind games.

877
00:35:27,117 --> 00:35:30,778
Right. And the other is that maybe players just want to see awesome things happen when they push buttons.

878
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,162
You know, I think there's truth there. Right. Like this is great trailer moments.

879
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:39,382
These are like fatalities and.

880
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:45,205
You know flashy super moves and environmental effects and destruction like this stuff is all really cool

881
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:50,730
Spectacle is awesome and like a lot a large part of kind of the day-to-day work

882
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:55,393
I think I'm making a game like this is actually making the stuff that the players doing feel really impactful and kind of feel good

883
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,576
Right and cool. I think it's a little more complicated

884
00:35:58,596 --> 00:36:03,820
Obviously, I think seeing awesome stuff happen as a motivation for why players play games I think is

885
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:06,803
kind of patronizing and like oversimplified, obviously.

886
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:08,384
Like things like this are cool.

887
00:36:08,424 --> 00:36:09,705
They're really cool the first time you see them.

888
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:11,546
They're pretty cool the 12th time you see them.

889
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:13,767
They're not that cool like the 120th time you see them.

890
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:16,649
And I think, you know, if we look at tennis, right,

891
00:36:16,669 --> 00:36:18,310
like imagine tennis with cut scenes.

892
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,891
Like that's not obviously a better game to me.

893
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:20,872
That's probably a worse game.

894
00:36:21,673 --> 00:36:22,333
And it's ridiculous.

895
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:23,954
And it's obviously ridiculous because we know

896
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:26,416
that sports kind of thrive on like more organic spectacle.

897
00:36:27,507 --> 00:36:28,187
I'm not even gonna play this video,

898
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:29,067
because it's so ubiquitous,

899
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,967
but the official Evo Moment 37

900
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:34,088
probably did more to attract people to fighting games

901
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,648
than any individual cut scene did,

902
00:36:35,688 --> 00:36:37,368
because you watch this and you can see,

903
00:36:37,888 --> 00:36:39,249
you see the people, you see how they react,

904
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:41,289
you know the players, and you know the stakes,

905
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:42,549
you can kind of see the health bar.

906
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:45,950
The rules of the game kind of create the drama,

907
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,810
and that's why these games are cool.

908
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,511
Spectacle's awesome, but genuine tension

909
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,891
is maybe more awesome.

910
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:55,231
I mean, it is more awesome.

911
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,632
It's not maybe more awesome.

912
00:36:58,138 --> 00:37:00,080
So then there's the idea of the real, there's like a real game, right?

913
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,544
Like if we could only get rid of all this unnecessary, redundant execution,

914
00:37:03,584 --> 00:37:07,048
all this hard, unpleasant stuff, this learning, maybe there's like an idealized

915
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:09,490
version of Street Fighter where it's just like two minds at battle.

916
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:12,794
And if we can just take that and get it out of this hard stuff,

917
00:37:13,254 --> 00:37:15,657
the masses will finally understand like what we love about these games.

918
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:18,558
We see this really explicitly in a lot of messaging

919
00:37:18,578 --> 00:37:20,779
from developers, phrases like, we

920
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:22,620
want to get you to the fun decision-making part

921
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,661
as quickly as possible, or we want the game

922
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,702
to be out knowing what to do or when to do something,

923
00:37:26,982 --> 00:37:29,823
rather than how you do it, ignoring the fact that doing

924
00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:32,204
something at a specific when is not necessarily a trivial how.

925
00:37:34,225 --> 00:37:37,347
We see a lot of games trying increasingly

926
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:39,588
radical and dramatic attempts at paring back their controls.

927
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:43,946
BlazBlue, Crosstag, TookAwayWalk, which actually worked out much better than I expected.

928
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:48,449
But, you know, we also see games like S&K Heroines, Fantasy Strike, Upcoming Metal Revolution

929
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:51,851
removing the crouch input, allegedly because it's unnecessary.

930
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:56,314
But, you know, crouching, like, isn't really an input I have to deal with.

931
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:58,015
Like, it's part of a stick or it's part of a d-pad.

932
00:37:58,035 --> 00:38:01,917
Like, just from a raw kind of quantity of inputs perspective,

933
00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:03,938
it doesn't really simplify much from that perspective.

934
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:06,956
And also I'm not convinced it's actually unnecessary.

935
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:09,337
Despite the fact that there's unexpected consequences,

936
00:38:09,397 --> 00:38:11,077
like in Fantasy Strike, for example,

937
00:38:11,097 --> 00:38:13,478
you can't crouch block, so you can't guard in place.

938
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:16,359
You need to be walking back if you're trying to guard,

939
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:18,320
which I'm perfectly willing to accept

940
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,981
that may be competitively viable in a balanced.

941
00:38:22,276 --> 00:38:26,139
well, competitive game, but games themselves are kind of unnecessary.

942
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,042
They're not really all about function. They're not really all about results.

943
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:32,605
They're not really all about outcomes. There's a sense in which I think removing

944
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:35,708
something that's so fundamental kind of changes the experience, right?

945
00:38:35,728 --> 00:38:39,331
It's just different. There's a cost and flow and engagement and familiarity.

946
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,574
I'm definitely not arguing against making these games more playable.

947
00:38:42,714 --> 00:38:47,078
I think anyone who knows me knows I'm not someone who fetishizes execution at all, but...

948
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:50,404
I just want to push back a little bit against this idea

949
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:51,945
that there's a real game and that someone

950
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:52,906
gets to decide what it is.

951
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:56,068
I think another way to think about this,

952
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,090
like about what gets lost maybe when we reduce or remove

953
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,572
execution too much, Magic Re-Gathering, for example.

954
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,534
Would Magic be a better game if you

955
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,075
didn't have to remember what cards were in your deck?

956
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:07,257
Like if you had a spreadsheet and you could check them off

957
00:39:07,277 --> 00:39:09,018
when you draw them so you know exactly what's coming

958
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:09,979
and how many lands are left?

959
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:11,260
Like we could do that.

960
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,601
We can make Magic easier to play.

961
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:14,162
Who's to say that it's not fair that I have to,

962
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,083
that it's fair that I should have to memorize that stuff?

963
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:17,884
Memorizing stuff is hard.

964
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:20,125
But people don't play Magic like that.

965
00:39:20,165 --> 00:39:20,845
Magic is what it is.

966
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,987
The tension, the stresses, and the pressures are there.

967
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:26,989
Clash Royale, should that game show me

968
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:28,510
what cards my opponent could be playing

969
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,891
and what their current energy is?

970
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:32,632
I can derive that stuff if I pay attention and think about it.

971
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:35,634
But expending that mental energy is part of what the game is.

972
00:39:35,654 --> 00:39:37,615
That's the cost of playing that game.

973
00:39:38,816 --> 00:39:40,937
And removing it isn't obviously better, to me at least.

974
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,671
Finally, I just want to make the case for responsive real-time games.

975
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:48,953
There's a certain joy in motion control just for their own sake.

976
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,234
When I used to play a lot of Smash Brothers, I would close my eyes

977
00:39:51,274 --> 00:39:53,975
and see the way the characters moved when I tried to sleep.

978
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,396
And that's because those arcs are beautiful.

979
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,757
There's just something cool about that.

980
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:57,977
This is what dance is.

981
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:00,999
Anyone who's played an instrument or a rhythm game

982
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:03,740
knows that there's just certain kinds of combos and actions

983
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,042
that just feel good to do on your hands.

984
00:40:06,262 --> 00:40:07,802
And there's some other ones that just don't.

985
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:10,864
There's an aesthetic quality to this stuff that's really important.

986
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:14,354
then you know there's Divekick, right?

987
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:15,775
So it's hard to imagine a simpler game

988
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:17,016
that we recognize as a fighting game,

989
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:19,837
and in a lot of ways Divekick is supremely approachable.

990
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:21,979
But it's also true that playing someone

991
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,601
who's better at Divekick feels maybe less accessible

992
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:26,621
than many other games.

993
00:40:26,942 --> 00:40:29,083
When you strip down things so thoroughly,

994
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:33,345
it almost becomes more likely that fewer options

995
00:40:33,405 --> 00:40:34,826
leads to more oppressive gameplay,

996
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:36,527
like gameplay that's more dominated by skill,

997
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:38,889
less room for the kind of messy uncertainty

998
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:40,890
that we kind of get for free in real-time games

999
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,390
that are fast.

1000
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,824
Another way to think about this is being able to hold

1001
00:40:45,864 --> 00:40:48,586
the whole game in your head, or hold it in your hands,

1002
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:50,126
not being able to do that, I think is actually good.

1003
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,008
That's not bad, that's kind of what's great about these.

1004
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:55,470
We're kind of wrestling with something that's much bigger

1005
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,150
than any of us, that none of us can ever master.

1006
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:59,732
That's actually something to be valued, I think,

1007
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:00,733
not tried to eliminate it.

1008
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:05,956
Yeah, so this has been a look at several trends

1009
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:08,117
we've seen develop over the course of the expansion era.

1010
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:12,880
If the question is, are these games easier to play,

1011
00:41:13,686 --> 00:41:15,707
I think the answer in most cases is yes, absolutely.

1012
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,547
But I think there's also this other question lurking

1013
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:21,548
behind all of this, this whole pursuit for increased access

1014
00:41:21,588 --> 00:41:26,549
and increased ease of use is maybe as much about getting

1015
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:30,170
more people to play these games and maybe more bluntly,

1016
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,951
how to make more money off these games.

1017
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:34,912
So in the beginning of the talk, I

1018
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:36,432
mentioned how Street Fighter III kind of preceded

1019
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:38,953
the Dark Ages because it was difficult to play and punishing.

1020
00:41:40,035 --> 00:41:57,410
You know, maybe that's true. There's another version of that story, though, that might be more true. And that's that story goes in the US at that time. Kind of arcades were declining and consoles were rising and is change in context. Right. This may be had as much to do with Capcom strategy at that time as anything else. And just like the context changed kind of.

1021
00:41:59,693 --> 00:42:01,975
In 1999, the context of the expansion era

1022
00:42:02,015 --> 00:42:05,097
has had its own unique set of pressures on developers.

1023
00:42:05,117 --> 00:42:07,799
We've had the rise of online gaming, the rise of e-sports,

1024
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:08,980
and streaming.

1025
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,061
This all means that there's a lot more money

1026
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:13,743
and there's a lot more players in competitive gaming

1027
00:42:13,763 --> 00:42:14,543
now than there used to be.

1028
00:42:14,563 --> 00:42:15,324
It's a lot more visible.

1029
00:42:16,384 --> 00:42:18,306
At the same time, fighting games have fewer players

1030
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:19,086
than a lot of other genres.

1031
00:42:19,146 --> 00:42:20,607
It can kind of feel like a niche sometimes.

1032
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:24,430
Audience for games like League of Legends or Fortnite.

1033
00:42:25,307 --> 00:42:27,748
just kind of makes it feel like there's a big piece of pie

1034
00:42:27,768 --> 00:42:28,929
that fighting games don't get to eat,

1035
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:29,989
like we're missing out on something.

1036
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,791
So I think what developers a lot of the time are chasing

1037
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,112
is not really just accessibility,

1038
00:42:35,112 --> 00:42:36,153
or maybe not accessibility at all,

1039
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,434
but just this kind of broad mainstream appeal.

1040
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:41,996
So one path for the next 10 years is this.

1041
00:42:42,156 --> 00:42:43,677
We just close the book on the expansion age,

1042
00:42:43,757 --> 00:42:44,758
and we start thinking about appeal

1043
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:46,078
as much as we do accessibility.

1044
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:48,420
We can take what we know and love about these games

1045
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,740
and kind of experiment with new ways

1046
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,662
of making them appealing to more different players.

1047
00:42:53,165 --> 00:42:56,506
I think it's very common to see developers more concerned that their game is easy to play

1048
00:42:57,327 --> 00:43:01,908
than concerned about who might want to play it or why they might want to play it in the first place.

1049
00:43:01,928 --> 00:43:02,769
And I think this is backwards.

1050
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:06,690
You give people a reason to want to see and play your game, I think

1051
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,772
you know, ideally you can trust that it's appealing enough to actually have them come to you and kind of put in that effort.

1052
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:14,697
So I don't really know what this is going to look like.

1053
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,439
I don't know what the experimental age will look like.

1054
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,823
But it might include further attempts at bringing form and function together,

1055
00:43:20,863 --> 00:43:23,306
like making these games a little less abstract and more effective at

1056
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:24,687
communicating the rules and their behavior.

1057
00:43:25,848 --> 00:43:28,371
It might include more attempts at kind of increasing access,

1058
00:43:28,411 --> 00:43:30,973
not just in terms of making sure people are able to play, but

1059
00:43:31,013 --> 00:43:32,054
making more people feel welcome.

1060
00:43:32,435 --> 00:43:34,477
Kind of reducing the stigma of being new and bad.

1061
00:43:35,077 --> 00:43:37,700
We know that no one wants to play a game if they feel like they're not welcome.

1062
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:40,405
It can include working with players, right?

1063
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:43,588
So initiatives like the XO Academy, a training program

1064
00:43:43,608 --> 00:43:46,250
that supports women competitors, started by longtime player

1065
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,070
and commentator Persia.

1066
00:43:49,072 --> 00:43:51,034
It can also include just kind of rediscovering

1067
00:43:51,054 --> 00:43:54,196
the value of strange, unique settings, characters, concepts,

1068
00:43:54,997 --> 00:43:56,158
kind of the value of creating work

1069
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:58,059
that is just unfamiliar and new.

1070
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:02,763
Or continuing to explore new goals and win conditions

1071
00:44:02,803 --> 00:44:04,144
beyond simply reducing the player's health.

1072
00:44:05,997 --> 00:44:07,998
So to me, what the experimental age looks like

1073
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,239
is devoting resources to features that are interesting,

1074
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:13,801
new, or effective, while avoiding repeating mistakes

1075
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,382
or leaning on ill-supported or unsupported truisms.

1076
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,703
This absolutely is also not a call

1077
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,144
for leaving traditional fighting games behind.

1078
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:22,845
There's nothing wrong with developing games

1079
00:44:22,865 --> 00:44:24,366
for an existing audience or a niche audience,

1080
00:44:24,606 --> 00:44:26,267
and there's especially nothing wrong with making things

1081
00:44:26,287 --> 00:44:28,028
just because you like them and want to play them.

1082
00:44:28,668 --> 00:44:30,689
But I don't think our attempts

1083
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,370
at kind of expanding our audience can be effective

1084
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,910
unless they're a little bit more clear-eyed

1085
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:34,711
and a little bit deliberate.

1086
00:44:35,434 --> 00:44:37,235
The expansion era produced a lot of excellent work

1087
00:44:37,335 --> 00:44:38,555
and made a lot of important progress.

1088
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:41,297
But if our real goal is to kind of broaden the audience

1089
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:43,438
and find new players, it's kind of a narrow perspective

1090
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,598
on its own, it's incomplete,

1091
00:44:44,698 --> 00:44:46,219
and it might not be even the most important one.

1092
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,620
So thank you very much.

1093
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:59,406
So we're getting kicked out of here exactly at three,

1094
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:01,567
So we're getting kicked out of here exactly at three,

1095
00:45:01,627 --> 00:45:03,188
but I guess we have time for a couple questions.

1096
00:45:05,238 --> 00:45:05,959
if anyone has any.

1097
00:45:09,281 --> 00:45:10,402
Yeah, thanks for the talk.

1098
00:45:11,002 --> 00:45:13,704
So you had mentioned that this experimental age potentially

1099
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,545
coming up is involve a lot of risk-taking

1100
00:45:16,165 --> 00:45:17,266
and I feel like fighting games

1101
00:45:17,946 --> 00:45:21,649
as a genre more often than others value a lot of tradition,

1102
00:45:21,689 --> 00:45:23,970
you know, adding a new mechanic or new feature to a fighting

1103
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,791
game tends to bring a lot of backlash with it.

1104
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:27,132
But on top of that.

1105
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:31,658
games, you know, the higher fidelity we're reaching as we're developing new titles,

1106
00:45:31,698 --> 00:45:34,121
the more expensive they're getting and adding these experimental features are,

1107
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:36,483
you know, it's like you said, a risk.

1108
00:45:36,523 --> 00:45:39,547
Do you see the Titans, like, you know, Street Fires and the Tekken's

1109
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:41,849
taking these types of risks or just going with the same formula

1110
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:43,871
and not like now they have a working formula?

1111
00:45:44,712 --> 00:45:45,293
Yeah, I mean, I'm.

1112
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,656
probably not the one to answer that question.

1113
00:45:47,696 --> 00:45:49,917
But games like Street Fighter and Tekken,

1114
00:45:49,937 --> 00:45:50,817
they're kind of in a tough spot, right?

1115
00:45:50,837 --> 00:45:52,478
Because they have a built-in fan base

1116
00:45:52,498 --> 00:45:54,279
that if you do make those kind of changes,

1117
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:56,561
they'll understandably be upset.

1118
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:58,682
And I don't, you know, but they're also in a great position

1119
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:00,323
where they get to make more of these games, right?

1120
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:03,585
So I think I wouldn't be, you know,

1121
00:46:03,605 --> 00:46:05,466
I'd be pretty surprised if the next Street Fighter game

1122
00:46:05,486 --> 00:46:06,586
played like Smash Brothers or something.

1123
00:46:06,686 --> 00:46:09,088
But I think there's definitely room for both,

1124
00:46:09,148 --> 00:46:11,469
you know, traditional stuff and kind of more attempts

1125
00:46:12,149 --> 00:46:13,770
at more experimental work.

1126
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:14,711
All right, thanks.

1127
00:46:17,082 --> 00:46:17,142
Hi.

1128
00:46:17,162 --> 00:46:18,623
Hello.

1129
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:18,903
Yeah.

1130
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:24,886
So, I think that, you know, the root of sort of this problem is that important mechanics

1131
00:46:24,926 --> 00:46:27,308
that affect whether or not you win are difficult, right?

1132
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:32,170
I mean, that's, this talk, and I think from what I've seen, most attempts have been to

1133
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:36,432
try and reduce the difficulty rather than alter the importance.

1134
00:46:37,473 --> 00:46:39,094
Do you think there's any room for, like...

1135
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,511
you know, okay, like combos, right?

1136
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:43,273
Okay, you need combos, you're gonna get beat up

1137
00:46:43,373 --> 00:46:44,694
if someone can do them and you can't.

1138
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:46,875
Do you think there's room and can you think of any example?

1139
00:46:46,915 --> 00:46:48,356
Do you know of any examples of people shifting

1140
00:46:48,376 --> 00:46:49,517
the significance of the mechanics

1141
00:46:49,597 --> 00:46:55,261
rather than their difficulty, if that makes sense?

1142
00:46:56,001 --> 00:46:57,362
That's an interesting question.

1143
00:46:57,382 --> 00:46:57,502
I mean.

1144
00:46:58,695 --> 00:47:02,059
I think there's long been games that aren't just about combos, right?

1145
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,905
Like games like Samurai Shodown are much more high damage and not about really memorizing specific inputs.

1146
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:15,612
And then you have games like KI which have a pretty unique combo system that, you know, it's got its own challenges,

1147
00:47:15,693 --> 00:47:18,475
but it's definitely very different than a lot of other games.

1148
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,361
I mean, I think Smash Brothers is a good example of that,

1149
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:25,262
right, like games that have a very different win condition

1150
00:47:25,322 --> 00:47:28,383
is maybe the most fruitful thing to explore in my opinion,

1151
00:47:29,143 --> 00:47:30,784
just because it totally changes the focus

1152
00:47:30,824 --> 00:47:33,425
of what players are looking at and what you even need

1153
00:47:33,805 --> 00:47:34,605
to make a game like that work.

1154
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,626
So, yeah, I hope so.

1155
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:38,227
I hope we see more interesting things like that.

1156
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:38,747
Thank you.

1157
00:47:38,787 --> 00:47:43,789
Hi, you spoke about the difficulty graph

1158
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:46,910
between trying to get new players into the game

1159
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:50,572
and how RNG has helped doing that in other genres.

1160
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:55,462
In fighting games, how much are fighting games looking towards that?

1161
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:57,083
Or are they shifting towards that?

1162
00:47:57,163 --> 00:47:59,384
Or have you seen such things happen in fighting games

1163
00:47:59,424 --> 00:48:03,345
where they add RNGs to basic attacks or stuff like that?

1164
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:05,306
Yeah, not really.

1165
00:48:05,486 --> 00:48:07,867
I mean, Smash Brothers is a classic example of this as well, right?

1166
00:48:07,907 --> 00:48:10,948
Like, that game, you can put on crazy items and crazy levels

1167
00:48:11,028 --> 00:48:11,728
and anything happens.

1168
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:14,029
And I mean, I think it works really well for them in some cases.

1169
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:15,149
Yeah.

1170
00:48:19,758 --> 00:48:21,599
I'm struggling to think of other recent examples.

1171
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:23,559
I'm sure there are some, but nothing is springing to mind.

1172
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,540
I don't know, timing-based, like you're just at the right time,

1173
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,200
then you match.

1174
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,301
Otherwise, it's an RNG based on your punch power or something.

1175
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:32,621
Yeah.

1176
00:48:33,421 --> 00:48:36,782
I mean, I don't think we've seen the great kind of way

1177
00:48:36,802 --> 00:48:38,702
to add randomness to a more traditional fighting game yet.

1178
00:48:38,822 --> 00:48:40,362
I'd be very interested to see what that looks like.

1179
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:45,103
I think SNK Heroines has random item drops or something.

1180
00:48:45,463 --> 00:48:47,184
Honestly, I'm not totally sure how that game works,

1181
00:48:47,244 --> 00:48:48,684
but you may see a little bit of it there.

1182
00:48:49,377 --> 00:48:50,518
Okay, sounds good, thank you.

1183
00:48:50,898 --> 00:48:51,098
Thanks.

1184
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:54,000
How do you see the resurgence of the arcade?

1185
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,623
Because I know it's like where I'm from, North Carolina,

1186
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,044
I can just drive within like an hour

1187
00:48:58,084 --> 00:48:59,505
and be at four or five different arcades

1188
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:00,486
and they keep on popping up.

1189
00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:03,068
How do you see arcades impacting the future

1190
00:49:03,088 --> 00:49:04,469
of fighting games in the future

1191
00:49:04,649 --> 00:49:06,451
as they tend to be a social game?

1192
00:49:08,272 --> 00:49:09,333
Well, you know, as part of Sports Friends,

1193
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:11,955
actually like our big kind of motivating factor behind that

1194
00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:13,857
was kind of to kind of emphasize

1195
00:49:13,877 --> 00:49:16,719
how great it is to play local multiplayer games together,

1196
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:18,501
right, like playing something in person with,

1197
00:49:19,038 --> 00:49:23,140
with someone else is way more exciting for a variety of reasons, maybe more stressful

1198
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:23,340
too.

1199
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,421
I think like we still, you know, Killer Queen is like another interesting example, right?

1200
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:32,022
This is like a game that's kind of taken over a lot of arcades and kind of really is like

1201
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:33,323
spread pretty far around the country.

1202
00:49:33,343 --> 00:49:35,263
So I mean, I think there's definitely like an opportunity.

1203
00:49:37,264 --> 00:49:40,144
I think again, like Killer Queen is a really unique case because it requires so many players,

1204
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:42,045
like almost like a built-in spectacle for it to work.

1205
00:49:42,085 --> 00:49:44,566
So I think there's a lot that could be done there.

1206
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:45,266
I don't know if we've.

1207
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:50,990
Yeah, beyond that, I don't know if we've seen the great local fighting game yet either,

1208
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:53,276
but that's something I personally would really look forward to.

1209
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:01,854
Hey, I wanted to ask about non-fighting game franchises crossing over to fighting games.

1210
00:50:02,194 --> 00:50:04,756
How much of a factor do you think that would be for the future?

1211
00:50:05,057 --> 00:50:07,899
Because I got into fighting games because of Persona 4 Arena,

1212
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:10,641
and then by extension Under Night In-Birth, and then Blaze Blue.

1213
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:13,043
And I played Soul Calibur because 2B was in it,

1214
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:17,707
but do you see that being like a very important thing for like sustainability of fighting games?

1215
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:21,470
Oh yeah, definitely. I mean I have a whole section of the talk that I cut about that,

1216
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,432
but like I think we're already there, right? Like you...

1217
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:26,561
Basically, it's very difficult to find a fighting game that

1218
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:27,882
has no guest characters in it right now.

1219
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:32,225
So yeah, I mean, I think that's kind of been

1220
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:35,428
something we've kind of seen in the last five, six years

1221
00:50:35,928 --> 00:50:37,049
kind of become almost ubiquitous.

1222
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:37,810
I think it's great.

1223
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,092
I mean, one of the great things about fighting games

1224
00:50:40,132 --> 00:50:41,212
is they're so character focused.

1225
00:50:41,232 --> 00:50:43,294
And you kind of are looking at beautiful animations

1226
00:50:43,334 --> 00:50:44,655
for most of the time you're playing the game.

1227
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:46,817
So it's an obvious fit if you want

1228
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:48,478
to see Persona characters in a whole new light.

1229
00:50:48,858 --> 00:50:50,580
Maybe there'll be a Fire Emblem fighting game sometime.

1230
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,200
That would be kind of cool.

1231
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:51,941
Yeah, I'm down for that.

1232
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:55,149
That's a good point.

1233
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:56,790
Patrick says it's called Smash.

1234
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:57,930
Stand corrected.

1235
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:01,831
Hey.

1236
00:51:03,552 --> 00:51:03,952
Hello.

1237
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:05,132
Sorry, it's hard to see.

1238
00:51:07,613 --> 00:51:10,474
Even though games have been getting more and more

1239
00:51:10,674 --> 00:51:17,456
tutorials, I feel that people's most learning material is still

1240
00:51:18,056 --> 00:51:19,437
acquired outside the game.

1241
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:24,158
You see a possibility of a trend of the.

1242
00:51:24,808 --> 00:51:31,853
the games themselves providing players the tools to create and share tutorials for other players?

1243
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:38,958
We've seen some games that have kind of like in-game examples of ways to like share replays

1244
00:51:38,998 --> 00:51:43,962
and kind of like talk to people about them, but I mean it's just so expensive. Like to do this

1245
00:51:43,982 --> 00:51:50,007
stuff well it's really adding a lot to your development cost and that you know is of

1246
00:51:50,127 --> 00:51:51,568
questionable value in terms of...

1247
00:51:52,435 --> 00:51:53,977
making the game actually attractive to people.

1248
00:51:54,597 --> 00:51:58,600
So I wonder, I mean, there's an interesting company now

1249
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,483
that's doing like Overwatch video analysis, right?

1250
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:03,444
So you send them your gameplay and it has some tools

1251
00:52:03,464 --> 00:52:05,085
that'll like point out things you could be doing better.

1252
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:07,367
And then you'll have people will kind of analyze it

1253
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:08,488
and kind of report back and say,

1254
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:09,469
here's the stuff you should focus on.

1255
00:52:10,637 --> 00:52:12,158
I'd love to see something like that.

1256
00:52:12,178 --> 00:52:14,461
A lot of people suggest a clippy for fighting games.

1257
00:52:14,741 --> 00:52:16,743
I've heard many developers say that something like that

1258
00:52:16,763 --> 00:52:17,524
would be really interesting.

1259
00:52:17,624 --> 00:52:19,366
I mean, personally I think something like that is,

1260
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,307
you know, clippy doesn't really work,

1261
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:22,289
so I don't know if a fighting game version of that

1262
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:23,350
would work, but I'd love to see it.

1263
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:27,094
Yeah, I just think it's tough to justify sometimes,

1264
00:52:27,194 --> 00:52:30,537
but that is definitely something I'd love to

1265
00:52:30,677 --> 00:52:31,618
kind of see developed further.

1266
00:52:31,638 --> 00:52:32,820
All right, thank you.

1267
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:37,317
Hey, you talked a bit about how arcade games,

1268
00:52:37,678 --> 00:52:39,139
arcade fighting games has always been a big thing

1269
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:42,302
and how losing to someone that you're sitting next to

1270
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:43,923
is very different to losing to someone on the internet.

1271
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:46,145
Do you think that online fighting games,

1272
00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:48,107
do you feel like that's changed the way people go

1273
00:52:48,507 --> 00:52:50,109
about designing fighting games?

1274
00:52:50,149 --> 00:52:52,411
Maybe it should have when it hasn't, things like that.

1275
00:52:53,312 --> 00:52:54,773
In terms of just how their sportsmanship

1276
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:55,313
kind of comes into play?

1277
00:52:59,408 --> 00:53:01,289
Yeah, I mean there's another slide that got cut.

1278
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:03,070
Like there's a kind of interesting thing I think that

1279
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:05,492
Killer Instinct and I believe Marvel vs. Capcom 3

1280
00:53:05,772 --> 00:53:06,652
borrowed from League of Legends,

1281
00:53:06,672 --> 00:53:07,933
which is just like if you have a player

1282
00:53:07,953 --> 00:53:10,435
that's rage quitting a lot or maybe that gets reported,

1283
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:12,736
they go into this like jail now

1284
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,957
where they're only able to match make against other players

1285
00:53:14,977 --> 00:53:17,499
that are also kind of in that punishment zone,

1286
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:19,020
which is kind of interesting.

1287
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,741
I don't know, I mean a solution that kind of makes your,

1288
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:22,041
like a lot of these games struggle

1289
00:53:22,081 --> 00:53:22,842
with having enough players

1290
00:53:22,862 --> 00:53:24,283
that you can even like get a good connection

1291
00:53:24,323 --> 00:53:25,723
against someone that's like roughly your skill level

1292
00:53:25,743 --> 00:53:26,264
in the first place.

1293
00:53:26,624 --> 00:53:27,685
So kind of like segmenting that.

1294
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:33,072
even further is tricky, but yeah, we've seen a little bit.

1295
00:53:33,112 --> 00:53:35,413
I mean, you're always in the context of like an Xbox Live

1296
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:37,054
or a PS4 where someone can just kind of send you

1297
00:53:37,074 --> 00:53:39,695
a nasty message anyway, so unless you disable that,

1298
00:53:39,735 --> 00:53:43,216
which I guess I recommend, then it's hard to say

1299
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:44,317
how effective it can really be.

1300
00:53:44,337 --> 00:53:45,577
All right, thanks.

1301
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:48,692
Cool, thank you for a great talk.

1302
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,594
I know a lot of the examples you went through

1303
00:53:50,614 --> 00:53:52,175
and showed were console fighting games.

1304
00:53:52,215 --> 00:53:53,136
I was curious if you had any thoughts

1305
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:54,597
on a lot of mobile fighting games,

1306
00:53:54,657 --> 00:53:56,999
especially major IPs that have brought their games to mobile

1307
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:58,661
and touch inputs and things like that

1308
00:53:58,721 --> 00:54:01,063
in terms of more accessible ways for people to go through

1309
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:03,084
and get into fighting games as a whole.

1310
00:54:03,224 --> 00:54:03,785
I don't really.

1311
00:54:04,245 --> 00:54:06,987
That's kind of an area where the kind of

1312
00:54:07,388 --> 00:54:08,829
input reduction stuff kind of gets.

1313
00:54:09,568 --> 00:54:12,010
so far that I kind of just as a player just lose interest.

1314
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:14,512
Like I don't really want to play an action game on my phone,

1315
00:54:14,673 --> 00:54:17,715
much less a very simplified fighting game.

1316
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,358
So it's just, yeah, I guess I don't have much to say,

1317
00:54:20,378 --> 00:54:21,939
because I don't know too much about them.

1318
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:22,419
Thank you.

1319
00:54:23,721 --> 00:54:25,402
Hey, this is a great talk.

1320
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:27,244
We as a genre and an industry really

1321
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,586
need to kind of band together to kind of figure this stuff out.

1322
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:30,847
So I really appreciate this talk.

1323
00:54:32,128 --> 00:54:34,810
My question is, so for Injustice 2 post-launch,

1324
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:40,719
Kind of redid the whole tutorial and sorry which which game for injustice to

1325
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:45,544
So for post launch for the game of the year edition ultimate edition, whatever we called it right like a year after launch

1326
00:54:46,906 --> 00:54:53,153
We redid everything and made it all like a la carte and let it make it be a lot less linear and trying to give

1327
00:54:53,273 --> 00:54:54,795
players what they want and kind of

1328
00:54:55,506 --> 00:54:59,669
break down that barrier a bit where players would be leaving the game to go to YouTube

1329
00:54:59,709 --> 00:55:03,071
to learn a little bit and just trying to make it a bit more accessible.

1330
00:55:04,031 --> 00:55:08,514
One thing that we really wanted to do was create all those tutorials within the context

1331
00:55:08,574 --> 00:55:09,134
of the game.

1332
00:55:09,795 --> 00:55:15,899
So something our designers were less interested in was the kind of Guilty Gear style of like,

1333
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:21,362
here's these balloons popping out and you, you know, low, medium, high, that kind of

1334
00:55:21,382 --> 00:55:21,522
stuff.

1335
00:55:22,084 --> 00:55:23,924
I was just kind of curious on what your thoughts are

1336
00:55:23,984 --> 00:55:27,165
with teaching within context versus these kind of

1337
00:55:27,225 --> 00:55:32,446
mini game more fun-ish style of tutorials.

1338
00:55:32,466 --> 00:55:33,286
Yeah, when you say in the game,

1339
00:55:33,326 --> 00:55:34,586
you mean as part of the story mode,

1340
00:55:34,606 --> 00:55:35,687
like you kind of build it?

1341
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:37,927
Well, no, I mean our tutorials aren't

1342
00:55:38,347 --> 00:55:39,707
in the story mode itself.

1343
00:55:39,747 --> 00:55:41,928
I just more mean within the context of the fight.

1344
00:55:41,948 --> 00:55:44,488
We're not adding these extra fun mini games

1345
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:46,829
to help teach you what a mixup is versus,

1346
00:55:47,649 --> 00:55:49,469
no, here's a character that is blocking high,

1347
00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:51,250
like hit them low versus.

1348
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,270
the more mini game aspect.

1349
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:53,851
Right.

1350
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:56,032
Do you think the mini games help?

1351
00:55:56,332 --> 00:55:59,493
Are they better?

1352
00:56:00,674 --> 00:56:03,335
I think they're probably better if you're actually genuinely

1353
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:07,697
trying to learn, because you can repeat them and do them over.

1354
00:56:07,757 --> 00:56:09,758
And the Skullgirls example I like a lot,

1355
00:56:09,778 --> 00:56:12,780
because you're not going to get past that until you internalize

1356
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,221
what you need to know to block that properly.

1357
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:17,462
So I think from that perspective, maybe they're more effective.

1358
00:56:18,623 --> 00:56:18,843
But.

1359
00:56:20,093 --> 00:56:21,815
I mean, given that so few people use it,

1360
00:56:21,835 --> 00:56:24,777
then it makes me wonder, you know,

1361
00:56:24,797 --> 00:56:26,419
maybe it almost doesn't matter, right?

1362
00:56:26,439 --> 00:56:27,900
The answer you need is the one that gets people

1363
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:28,901
to actually engage with it.

1364
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:30,903
So I'd be interested to know if you,

1365
00:56:31,023 --> 00:56:33,266
do you have any metrics about how it went?

1366
00:56:34,026 --> 00:56:36,309
I mean, I'm sure our BI team does.

1367
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:38,791
Maybe you should give a talk next year.

1368
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:39,752
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1369
00:56:42,804 --> 00:56:47,848
Yeah, I don't know. It's just an interesting thing to be dealing with the context of like,

1370
00:56:48,128 --> 00:56:53,373
hey, you're in a fight. This is the more strategy component of it. It's not as simple and black and

1371
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:59,859
white as like, do these things. You need to be in the context of the situation. And yeah, like I

1372
00:56:59,879 --> 00:57:04,203
said, our designers were a little bit less interested in the more mini game-ish aspect

1373
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:08,847
to keep you grounded and teach you the actual situation that we're trying to put you in.

1374
00:57:09,514 --> 00:57:14,378
Yeah, I was actually just talking to my friend and co-worker Isaac Torres about this similar issue.

1375
00:57:14,438 --> 00:57:20,204
I think there's a lot of room for using what little we know about cognitive psychology to help people,

1376
00:57:21,565 --> 00:57:24,328
you know, help build these things in a way that actually reflects how people learn.

1377
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:27,202
a lot of the problems, you go through these modes,

1378
00:57:27,242 --> 00:57:28,902
and okay, here's like 60 bits of information

1379
00:57:28,922 --> 00:57:31,323
that I kind of just swallow in an hour,

1380
00:57:31,544 --> 00:57:33,304
and then I play the game and I've forgotten it already,

1381
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:34,605
so what do I do, go back and do it again?

1382
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:37,106
It kind of sucks, there's probably a better way.

1383
00:57:37,526 --> 00:57:38,646
Yeah, and there's also, I guess,

1384
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:39,967
a little bit of the added extra layer

1385
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:42,848
of like creating these mini games is more assets,

1386
00:57:42,908 --> 00:57:45,149
it's more resources, it's more costly,

1387
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:48,070
and it's certainly something I think we could have overcome

1388
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:49,971
if our designers had chosen to go that route,

1389
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:54,253
but it's also really hard to develop a tutorial for,

1390
00:57:54,668 --> 00:57:56,409
a game that's not complete yet, too.

1391
00:57:56,949 --> 00:57:58,209
That's a really good point.

1392
00:57:58,449 --> 00:57:59,990
We have to always do this at the end.

1393
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:00,630
Yeah.

1394
00:58:01,551 --> 00:58:02,011
Thanks for the talk.

1395
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:02,251
Thank you.

1396
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:04,872
Three more questions?

1397
00:58:05,692 --> 00:58:06,033
What was that?

1398
00:58:06,913 --> 00:58:07,633
Three more questions.

1399
00:58:09,374 --> 00:58:12,515
So you talked about the obvious issue of great complexity

1400
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,537
and a whole lot of decision depth being

1401
00:58:15,737 --> 00:58:16,937
unapproachable to newcomers.

1402
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,818
But Divekick has the opposite problem,

1403
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:20,679
where the decision space is small enough

1404
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:24,200
that an expert can retain and think ahead much

1405
00:58:24,563 --> 00:58:29,167
more easily, do you think there's a happy medium on that, or that the solution has to be orthogonal

1406
00:58:29,287 --> 00:58:39,395
to that decision complexity? That's a good question. I think there's probably a happy medium,

1407
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:43,198
I mean it's probably, but you know it's all aesthetic also, like there's games I like because

1408
00:58:43,238 --> 00:58:46,521
they make sense to me, and there's games that like I just don't play, you know they may be

1409
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:49,963
great games, but they're just not for me, so it's like hard, there's no like objective answer, so I

1410
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,946
kind of don't even want to try thinking about it.

1411
00:58:53,885 --> 00:58:56,889
Something I think about a lot that I had to cut, unfortunately, because this talk went

1412
00:58:57,089 --> 00:59:02,376
a little long, was this kind of property of having a real-time game creates uncertainty

1413
00:59:02,856 --> 00:59:03,997
in that it's so fast, right?

1414
00:59:04,018 --> 00:59:05,700
I'm pressing light punch, you're pressing light kick.

1415
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:09,965
I can't react to your light kick because it moves so quickly that it's not random, but

1416
00:59:09,985 --> 00:59:13,409
it kind of has a lot of the same stuff that randomness gets us, which is meaning, like...

1417
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:20,433
It's yeah, it's uncertainty, right which is yeah, there's a there's there's no we can point to exactly why you're like it came out

1418
00:59:20,773 --> 00:59:22,273
But I don't know that it was gonna come out

1419
00:59:22,353 --> 00:59:27,035
So we kind of get just by virtue of being like a complicated real-time game. We get a lot of that messiness

1420
00:59:27,555 --> 00:59:30,436
That's what I was trying to get out with like the dive kick example. Like it has a little bit less of that

1421
00:59:31,116 --> 00:59:35,198
And so that's why maybe playing that game against someone who's very good might be like more punishing, right?

1422
00:59:35,498 --> 00:59:37,658
It's just something to like be aware of as we like strip things away

1423
00:59:37,678 --> 00:59:40,619
So I get to this idealized point where it's like all mental

1424
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:46,529
there's maybe an unexpected consequence, which is that we lose the mess.

1425
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:48,151
And the mess does a job.

1426
00:59:48,171 --> 00:59:49,253
Thank you.

1427
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:52,757
Thanks for the talk, it was excellent.

1428
00:59:53,237 --> 00:59:53,818
Thank you.

1429
00:59:54,138 --> 00:59:59,525
When it comes to fighting games, I'm always particularly interested in how they kind of tax the human brain.

1430
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:02,028
And a lot of the stuff, you just mentioned it, right?

1431
01:00:02,964 --> 01:00:05,406
we know as experienced fighting game players,

1432
01:00:06,027 --> 01:00:08,429
we get to understand the limitations of our brain

1433
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:10,050
by trying to do things and failing,

1434
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,952
and then eventually realizing that this thing is actually

1435
01:00:13,032 --> 01:00:14,774
not possible to do on reaction.

1436
01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:16,395
It has to be a read, et cetera, et cetera.

1437
01:00:16,836 --> 01:00:19,358
And I'm wondering, have you encountered other activities,

1438
01:00:19,438 --> 01:00:21,339
like not fighting games, where you

1439
01:00:21,379 --> 01:00:26,343
see similar kinds of mental limitations,

1440
01:00:26,383 --> 01:00:27,945
essentially, that the players have

1441
01:00:27,985 --> 01:00:29,066
to learn how to negotiate?

1442
01:00:29,086 --> 01:00:31,187
That's interesting.

1443
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:31,548
I mean.

1444
01:00:32,488 --> 01:00:36,729
I'm not much of a chess player, but I imagine playing chess on a clock is probably similar,

1445
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:36,989
right?

1446
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:44,070
Like, you don't have time to calculate everything, so you kind of have to find shortcuts.

1447
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:47,751
I don't know.

1448
01:00:47,771 --> 01:00:49,331
Giving a talk can kind of be like that.

1449
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:53,512
It would be easy to write an email and kind of respond to everything really thoughtfully,

1450
01:00:53,532 --> 01:00:58,353
but in the heat of the moment, you need to really kind of think on your feet, which is

1451
01:00:58,393 --> 01:00:58,953
obviously hard.

1452
01:01:00,413 --> 01:01:00,693
I think...

1453
01:01:00,713 --> 01:01:01,813
Sorry?

1454
01:01:01,853 --> 01:01:02,033
Sorry?

1455
01:01:05,972 --> 01:01:08,833
Yeah, I think, I mean, that just made me think of like,

1456
01:01:09,213 --> 01:01:10,734
oh shoot, I guess we're over time, but real quick,

1457
01:01:10,794 --> 01:01:13,675
it makes me think of, you know,

1458
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,056
we kind of like valorize depth, right,

1459
01:01:15,076 --> 01:01:15,796
and there's a lot of players like,

1460
01:01:15,816 --> 01:01:17,117
this game is great because it's very deep,

1461
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:18,357
but then it's like at the same time,

1462
01:01:18,397 --> 01:01:19,638
when you're actually engaging with it,

1463
01:01:19,678 --> 01:01:21,038
like so much of what playing these games well

1464
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:22,639
is like finding shortcuts and workarounds,

1465
01:01:22,699 --> 01:01:23,980
like I don't want to do the hard thing,

1466
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,541
like even if the hard thing gets me 10% more value,

1467
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:29,002
like I'm not gonna do it because I might screw up,

1468
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,323
and also like I don't really like doing things

1469
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:31,783
that are hard when I'm playing a game.

1470
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,159
So you kind of find your comfort zone,

1471
01:01:34,179 --> 01:01:36,480
whether it's mental or physical, I think.

1472
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,520
It's kind of an interesting counterpoint to the idea

1473
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,481
that these games are good because they're deep, which

1474
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:42,962
is also true, but it's not the whole story.

1475
01:01:45,022 --> 01:01:45,442
Was that three?

1476
01:01:45,462 --> 01:01:46,483
One more?

1477
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:47,183
I'll just talk after.

1478
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:47,743
Is that cool?

1479
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:48,683
Talk to you after?

1480
01:01:49,004 --> 01:01:49,344
Oh, yeah, sure.

1481
01:01:49,724 --> 01:01:50,644
OK, yeah, thanks so much, everybody.
