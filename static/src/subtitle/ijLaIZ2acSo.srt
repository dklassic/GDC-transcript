00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:10,591
I am Karen Stevens, and I am the Accessibility Lead for EA Sports.

2
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:13,609
Now, this talk is called I Can't Hear You

3
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:16,250
because I literally can't hear you.

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,471
I am actually deaf.

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,133
I lost my hearing in my 20s,

6
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:22,074
which is why I still can speak so clearly.

7
00:00:22,915 --> 00:00:24,076
And I lip read.

8
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:26,557
So during Q and A, I'll have someone stand next to me

9
00:00:26,637 --> 00:00:27,958
and repeat the questions to me

10
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:29,399
so I can lip read them easily.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,701
So don't hesitate to ask questions.

12
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,761
There's two microphones here.

13
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:34,622
I'll direct you when we get to that point.

14
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,865
It's simply a procedural issue.

15
00:00:39,357 --> 00:00:40,477
So statistics.

16
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:43,339
Disabilities are really common.

17
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:45,300
There is actually over a billion people

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,641
in the world with disabilities.

19
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:49,182
These numbers are from the American Center

20
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:51,484
of Disease Control, that one in five

21
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:52,924
have at least one disability.

22
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,206
By the time they're 18 plus and considered an adult,

23
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:57,107
it's one in four.

24
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,729
And by mid-70s is one in two.

25
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:02,330
And after that point, the odds are in favor

26
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,391
of you being disabled.

27
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:06,233
So based on current life expectancy,

28
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,035
the majority of people in this room

29
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:10,917
will have at least one permanent life-limiting disability

30
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:11,817
before they die.

31
00:01:13,258 --> 00:01:15,420
So right now, according to Wired Magazine,

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,861
this amounts to over 30 million US gamers.

33
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:25,732
Also, there are over 40 million people in the U.S. that have some degree of hearing

34
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:27,954
loss that was life-limiting.

35
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:33,739
And not only that, but many people prefer to have subtitles on, especially if they're

36
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:37,562
in a noisy environment or they have to be in an environment where they must be quiet

37
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:38,703
like they're sleeping children.

38
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:42,166
It's very common for people to want things like that.

39
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:47,329
And one other thing to keep in mind is that deafness is a spectrum.

40
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,889
I have some residual hearing.

41
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:52,130
I can hear something.

42
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,211
I'm not going to say it's clear and it's very quiet.

43
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,431
That's why I wear hearing aids.

44
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:58,252
And hearing aids are not a fix-all.

45
00:01:58,372 --> 00:02:02,453
So what I hear is mechanical sounding and is kind of garbled.

46
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:05,335
And there are certain tones that I just can't hear.

47
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:08,797
So, in fact, that's how I figured out I had hearing loss,

48
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,239
is that I was writing a program that had a tone

49
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,161
from low to high, and it was supposed to be one tone,

50
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,001
and I heard two.

51
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:18,302
And I spent hours trying to figure out

52
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:20,324
why on earth does my code have two tones?

53
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:22,165
And I finally, in exasperation,

54
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:23,706
asked somebody who was walking by,

55
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:25,126
how many tones do you hear?

56
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:26,127
One.

57
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:29,389
Oh, okay, it's me.

58
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:30,570
That's good to know.

59
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:32,085
and that was in grad school.

60
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:36,411
So it's a progressive issue, but I've gotten by.

61
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:39,055
And actually, it's given me a lot of insight

62
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:43,001
as to how somebody would design a game that

63
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:44,343
would be more deaf-friendly.

64
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:49,412
So audio channels are a really important aspect of this.

65
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,414
An audio channel would be something like crowd volume

66
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:54,395
in Madden, for example.

67
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:56,856
You've got cheering crowds that make lots of noise.

68
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,897
Well, I don't need that cheering crowd,

69
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:03,138
so I would turn it off because that means other sounds

70
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:05,039
that might be more relevant, I can hear.

71
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,680
Anytime somebody gives me audio channels,

72
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,761
I tend to turn off all background music

73
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,383
so I can maybe be able to somewhat distinguish voices.

74
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:14,163
If there are subtitles and things,

75
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:15,584
I will definitely be turning them on.

76
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:20,884
So speaking of subtitles, let's talk about subtitles and captions.

77
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:26,293
There is more to designing games for people with hearing issues than this, but this is

78
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:28,897
one of the more common ones, so let's cover that first.

79
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:31,636
Font best practices.

80
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:34,637
Font is the biggest issue right now

81
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:39,078
when it comes to different types of difficulties

82
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:40,739
in trying to read subtitles.

83
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:42,619
They need to be big.

84
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,860
Bigger is better.

85
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,901
Also, the type of font you pick matters.

86
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:52,923
Sans serif fonts is a really good idea because there's less embellishments, so those with

87
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:56,224
issues like dyslexia have a better chance of being able to read it.

88
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,745
That's also why italics is a bad idea.

89
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:01,726
It's better to use bold or enlarged text.

90
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:07,068
If you have to use underlines, that's okay, but that's not as good as bold or enlarged,

91
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:10,329
because underline can actually cause some confusion for some people.

92
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,850
But any of those is better than italics.

93
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,554
For example, in terms of fonts with Arial, Helbiga, and Verdana.

94
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:20,776
Verdana is actually what this presentation is written in,

95
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:24,900
because I try to follow these type of guidelines whenever I can.

96
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:29,164
So another thing to keep in mind is color.

97
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:32,647
One in 12 men and one in 200 women are colorblind.

98
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,150
It's on the X chromosome, that's why women are less likely to be colorblind.

99
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,392
So there is a grain of truth to saying that women can see color better than men.

100
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:47,456
But just keep that in mind that using color as a distinguishing factor can cause issues.

101
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:52,503
Now, it doesn't necessarily mean that your default font has to do all this.

102
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:53,303
It's recommended.

103
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:58,625
But let's say you decide to use something that's relatively small, maybe kind of

104
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,406
thin in all caps, because it fits your world.

105
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:04,017
Okay, I understand that, but at the same point in time,

106
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:06,178
it's great when your game has options,

107
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,540
so then you can use mixed caps, bold,

108
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,062
something easier to see, and it's an option,

109
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:13,884
so you still get your original feel,

110
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,305
but people can have a chance to see it

111
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:18,087
if they can't use that original option.

112
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,008
Now, bigger than this is even better,

113
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,370
but this is still a major difference between these two,

114
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,292
and I recommend this.

115
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,533
Some people have an easier time reading all caps.

116
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,190
Some people have an easier time reading mixed case,

117
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,851
and it's best to support both if you can.

118
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,991
So font best practices.

119
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:40,352
I recommend approximately 3% of the screen height.

120
00:05:41,353 --> 00:05:46,214
For 1080p, that's technically 32 pixels tall, 4 pixels wide.

121
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:49,394
And that matches the 16-bit era, more or less.

122
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:52,155
That's about the size of 16-bit fonts were.

123
00:05:54,082 --> 00:05:59,244
Now the absolute minimum I will ever recommend is 28 pixels tall, 3 pixels wide.

124
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:04,505
That 3 pixels wide is super important because it means you probably have at least 1 pixel

125
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:08,007
that is totally the color you want without any sort of dithering.

126
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:09,047
And that's important.

127
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:11,955
I recommend bigger than that.

128
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:15,176
So 3% is a good ballpark.

129
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:17,556
Now if you're thinking, that's huge.

130
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:19,977
The TV industry recommends 8%,

131
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:25,538
which in the case of a 1080p screen is 86 pixels tall.

132
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:28,538
So really, 32 isn't that much.

133
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:31,219
We're still well under the TV industry.

134
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,940
If you can get up to the 86 plus pixels tall,

135
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,700
that's even better.

136
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,680
That means you'll have a larger audience,

137
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,500
people who can see.

138
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:42,086
And when it comes to things like mobile,

139
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:44,888
consider using this font size for the system,

140
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:45,808
the system font size,

141
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:47,909
as you can actually find out what that is

142
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:48,810
and you can match that.

143
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,812
It matters less if the text is paginated

144
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:54,413
in a smooth matter as you attend.

145
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,534
It matters more if people can see it.

146
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,154
If people can't see it,

147
00:06:58,215 --> 00:06:59,875
the text might as well not be there.

148
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:03,377
And that's a situation we have in a lot of games right now,

149
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,578
both in UI and in subtitles.

150
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:08,863
So, resizable text.

151
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:10,288
I love this option.

152
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:17,154
It's useful because people who may not want the super large text can then make it smaller

153
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:22,716
and have it take up less room, but those who need it can make it bigger, and that's great.

154
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:27,977
I usually make it as big as I possibly can because it's easier on my eyes.

155
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:33,619
I don't have perfect vision, obviously, because I'm wearing glasses, but so it's easier for

156
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:38,681
me to have larger images versus smaller, and I love it when it gives me the option.

157
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,599
Also, backgrounds.

158
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,179
Backgrounds are super helpful.

159
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,400
No matter what your text needs contrast.

160
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,641
I recommend either a few pixel thick border,

161
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:53,302
not counting those three to four pixels for the actual text.

162
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:54,722
This is an addition.

163
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:57,483
So you have an outline around the words.

164
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,923
So if you have like white text on a white background,

165
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:00,984
you can see something.

166
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:03,184
Because I cannot tell you how many games

167
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:05,725
where I know there's supposed to be a subtitle there,

168
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:06,945
but most of it I can't see.

169
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:09,306
So this prevents that.

170
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:12,928
Also, what's really useful is when you have a block,

171
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,629
a solid block behind the image.

172
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,450
And I actually prefer that whenever possible.

173
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,271
It's even better when that block is translucent

174
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,512
and I can configure how dark or light it is.

175
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:24,613
I usually personally prefer around 70%,

176
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:26,794
but that's my own personal preference.

177
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:29,075
Some people will like it super dark,

178
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:30,516
some people will like it super light.

179
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,117
It's wonderful when you have that option.

180
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,775
So direct versus background speech.

181
00:08:40,577 --> 00:08:43,260
What I mean by this, and why I put these in words,

182
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,783
is that a lot of times when you have NPCs in the world

183
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:49,346
and you walk by them, you can't hear what they're saying.

184
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:52,989
Or when I say hear, I mean see, because they're not subtitled.

185
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:53,870
And that's a problem.

186
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,793
So when I'm playing a game, I may not know what's going on.

187
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,720
that is, you need some way to indicate

188
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,001
that someone is talking.

189
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:06,223
So here's an example from Lego Marvel Super Heroes

190
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,885
where I'm literally playing as Star-Lord

191
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:11,886
flying around the world and I see

192
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:15,228
that there's some frozen guy in a cave.

193
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:18,269
Literally up until this point I didn't know he was there

194
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:20,851
and I found him and I would not have found him very easily

195
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:22,172
or maybe even looked for it

196
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:24,893
if I had actually not seen that text

197
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:26,334
and that's how important it is.

198
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,821
Now, here is literally the guy who I saved,

199
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,823
and he's the one with the speech bubble above his head,

200
00:09:32,243 --> 00:09:34,165
and that's wonderful because I know he's the one

201
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,267
who's talking because he's the one with the speech bubble.

202
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,009
And that's important because he doesn't have a name.

203
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,032
Many times, NPCs don't have names,

204
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:44,834
and that's okay as long as you know who's talking.

205
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,515
Now, I would prefer that the words are not above his head,

206
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:51,097
because that can make it harder to read,

207
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:53,701
but having a little speech bubble above his head

208
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:56,845
so I know that the words are coming from him is wonderful.

209
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:57,747
I love this.

210
00:09:58,803 --> 00:10:00,544
It's even better when the character's named,

211
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:03,127
when you have a speech bubble and you see their name.

212
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:07,330
So here's an example where Stanley is lost.

213
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:09,653
Every single level on this game

214
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:11,514
has Stanley somewhere in it.

215
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:15,338
So here I can see where he is

216
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:16,819
because I see his little speech bubble

217
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,440
and I know he's the one talking.

218
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:25,994
Layout, avoid placing text on top of things that are important.

219
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:30,037
Also avoid placing things that are important on top of the text.

220
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:31,117
Both matter.

221
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:34,579
I want to be able to read everything on the screen.

222
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,182
If you hide either or, it's a problem.

223
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:40,924
So keep in mind when you're placing your subtitles

224
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:42,745
where everything else is on the screen.

225
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:45,526
And make sure that's communicated among your team

226
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:46,967
because it's relatively common

227
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:49,109
where one person is placing things on the screen

228
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:50,590
and the other person is doing the subtitles.

229
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,572
And then later they get together and integrate their stuff

230
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,912
and realize that they're on top of each other.

231
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,614
So communication is really important

232
00:10:57,634 --> 00:10:59,836
because usually when this happens, it is an accident.

233
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:04,017
It's important to try to keep the text in the same location.

234
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:06,159
It can be confusing when it keeps moving around.

235
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:10,563
An exception to this is when you're doing things like cinema scenes and the area

236
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,984
that you don't want to cover changes.

237
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:13,686
In that case, yes, move it.

238
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:18,911
It's better to not cover up things that are important than to not move it.

239
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:21,173
Like not covering up things is like the most important thing.

240
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:24,190
Keep things within a safe area.

241
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,573
This is the same issue you have with UI and anything else.

242
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:29,535
5% margins are industry standard.

243
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:31,637
I recommend to at least do that.

244
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,640
Content matching.

245
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:39,124
So each subtitle should be a single sentence

246
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:40,145
whenever possible.

247
00:11:40,445 --> 00:11:43,628
Everything has exceptions, like literally everything.

248
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:49,201
So if your text would become too fast timing

249
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:52,564
or the sentence is super long, go ahead

250
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:53,746
and split it up as needed.

251
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:58,311
I recommend matching subtitles to scene onsets.

252
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:02,315
Don't put the subtitles in early unless you absolutely have to.

253
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:04,838
There's always exceptions to everything.

254
00:12:05,038 --> 00:12:05,899
So these are guidelines.

255
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:10,146
If the people's lips are still moving, keep the subtitle up.

256
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:12,028
There's no reason to remove it.

257
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:14,089
It gets confusing if you do, because then people

258
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:15,950
are thinking, am I missing a new phrase?

259
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:18,912
Because people who cannot hear will not know.

260
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,555
And avoid giving away reveals too early.

261
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:24,655
So this is an example of when to break things up.

262
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:25,975
So if it's a punchline of a joke,

263
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,656
don't give the punchline before everyone else.

264
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,237
Can you hear it?

265
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:31,517
Let me put it this way.

266
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:32,797
When I'm in movie theaters, I tend

267
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:34,458
to be laughing when other people aren't,

268
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,558
because I've already seen what the punchline is,

269
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:39,959
and everyone's like, why are you randomly laughing?

270
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,839
Because I know what's going to happen in the next scene.

271
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,200
So yes, try to avoid that.

272
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,267
So speed, timing, line count.

273
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,447
Again, these are all ballparks.

274
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:56,269
160 to 180 words a minute is recommended.

275
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,589
It's a recommendation.

276
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,350
So you can kind of use that to figure out

277
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,610
what your number of lines should be.

278
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:07,691
Two is ideal, but you can vary as needed.

279
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,572
Four and more I really don't recommend

280
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,772
because at that point you literally have a wall of text.

281
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,213
But one to three lines is okay.

282
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:16,773
Two is ideal.

283
00:13:17,793 --> 00:13:20,094
To text your matroverbal words whenever possible.

284
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,155
Sometimes that won't be possible.

285
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,496
Sometimes you'll have somebody who's speaking super, super

286
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,697
fast with really long, complicated words,

287
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,537
and you may have to paraphrase a little bit.

288
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:33,459
Try to avoid that, but it is understandable.

289
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,800
And in the television industry, they do do that.

290
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,480
So it's OK.

291
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,941
It's just something to avoid.

292
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:42,554
Now you're probably wondering, OK,

293
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:44,016
so I have all this stuff going on,

294
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,538
and I have all those different texts,

295
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:48,442
and I may have multiple people talking at once.

296
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:50,725
Maybe I have multiple places where sound is coming from.

297
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:52,427
How am I supposed to do that all?

298
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:54,370
I recommend channels.

299
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:58,833
So similar to audio channels, you can have subtitle channels.

300
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:02,074
So if you have like a different type,

301
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:05,436
like maybe you've got a speaker over there,

302
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:09,598
like literal speaker, that has audio coming out of it,

303
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:10,978
maybe that's one channel.

304
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:13,659
Maybe your crowd cheering is one channel.

305
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,880
Maybe the main character talking is one channel.

306
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,621
So you can turn on and off as you need it,

307
00:14:19,082 --> 00:14:21,343
which may also help change the words per minute.

308
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,283
So it may be, let's say you're scrolling,

309
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:24,524
you have scrolling text at the bottom,

310
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:27,447
If you have too many inputs coming in, it might go too fast.

311
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:32,814
But some people may want that because they want to hear everything that's going on.

312
00:14:33,294 --> 00:14:35,517
However, other people may have trouble keeping up.

313
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:40,003
And if you give them channels to be able to turn things off, it can really, really help.

314
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:43,888
One game that does this already is We Happy Few.

315
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,621
And here, at the very bottom of the screen, it's kind of faint,

316
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:52,066
is the audio that's coming from the speaker that's

317
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,668
in the center of the camera.

318
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:56,451
And the text you see above that point

319
00:14:57,112 --> 00:15:00,536
is the audio that's coming from the person talking to himself.

320
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:04,758
So here you can turn on and off either of those two sources,

321
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:06,439
and they actually have different spots on the screen

322
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,941
where they get those sources, and that's great.

323
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:12,925
There's also different levels of audio you can have

324
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,927
for the talking to themselves, that's great too,

325
00:15:16,027 --> 00:15:18,129
because then if it's too fast and it's hard to follow,

326
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:21,532
you can turn off some of the subtitling,

327
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,954
but not all of it, and that's wonderful.

328
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,004
So there is a difference between captions and subtitles.

329
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:30,446
They're often used interchangeably,

330
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:32,069
but they aren't exactly the same.

331
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:38,037
Essentially, subtitles cover speech,

332
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:40,501
and captions cover sound, including speech.

333
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:44,458
Portal, still alive, is an example of a game

334
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:45,559
that supports both.

335
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,599
And it's really important to realize

336
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,060
how important captions are.

337
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,420
So when you're watching a movie and you're

338
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,640
saying you have subtitles, that means that you just

339
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,941
have the words people are saying.

340
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:00,581
If you actually have captioning, I

341
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:03,582
know what type of tone of voice people use,

342
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:06,602
or if there is some other important sound going

343
00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:07,342
on in the background.

344
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:10,563
And that's extremely valuable information.

345
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:16,263
So sound effect captioning best practices.

346
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:19,704
There should always be an indication

347
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:25,586
that this is specifically a sound and not words.

348
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,327
Brackets are ideal, and brackets are

349
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:30,588
the standard used in the television and movie industry.

350
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:34,990
Again, I avoid not relying on color.

351
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,291
It's OK to use different color, but due to colorblind issues

352
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,552
and whatnot, I recommend not relying on it.

353
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:46,663
Also, if you do use color, I recommend making it configurable so people can pick what colors

354
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:47,244
work for them.

355
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,887
There are many different types of color blindness out there.

356
00:16:50,947 --> 00:16:54,511
It's a spectrum, much like hearing loss and every other type of issue.

357
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,453
Almost every issue people can have is a spectrum.

358
00:16:57,374 --> 00:17:00,076
So I recommend making it configurable.

359
00:17:00,777 --> 00:17:02,178
Describe sounds, not actions.

360
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,782
You do not want to describe, I threw something at the wall and you hear a sound as it bounces off.

361
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:13,906
That is way too many words and it's not very helpful to follow. If you simply say ball

362
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:22,551
bounces and you know there's a bounce sound, that's great. Short subject verb format is super important.

363
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,745
So here's an example of literally energy ball launch,

364
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:29,745
energy ball bounce.

365
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,845
It tells me what type of ball launched and bounced

366
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,426
and it's in brackets so I know for sure

367
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:37,967
that it is a caption of a sound.

368
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:42,208
And honestly, I probably could not play this game very well

369
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:43,808
if I didn't know about this

370
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,388
because I'd be walking through the world going,

371
00:17:45,408 --> 00:17:46,569
what am I supposed to do?

372
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:48,769
And I see the text, energy ball bounces.

373
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:50,770
I'm like, there's an energy ball, where is it?

374
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,330
If I did not know that,

375
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,370
lot of times they're not in easy sight.

376
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,549
You have to rely on audio to know they're there.

377
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,971
I probably would not have been able to play this game,

378
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,354
but I could because captioning was allowed.

379
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:05,299
Music.

380
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,661
You can use captioning for music too.

381
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:16,809
I can tell you that things like the TV series Monk has brackets that say upbeat tempo when you start watching that series and captions turned on.

382
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:22,091
That's great. It lets you set the tone and mood and you have some idea what's going on.

383
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,492
And that's the most important thing.

384
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:27,613
If there are words, they should be subtitled.

385
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:33,775
It's important to try to give as much information to somebody who needs it as possible.

386
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:39,177
So an example is this, and we happy few,

387
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:41,719
when you turn on captioning for things,

388
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:44,601
you can see that this person is whistling a tune

389
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:45,882
and it tells you the name of the tune.

390
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:48,224
Now I may not know what that tune is,

391
00:18:48,324 --> 00:18:49,605
but I can go online and look it up

392
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:52,007
because it's a song that exists in the world,

393
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:54,449
and then I can find out exactly what that tune is

394
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,410
if I really want to.

395
00:18:56,391 --> 00:18:57,952
It's more information than just whistles.

396
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:01,818
So it's really great when they tell me what the whistling is.

397
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:03,819
Now, if they said whistling upbeat tempo,

398
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,501
that actually would probably be a little bit better.

399
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:08,223
I would prefer it to know upbeat tempo

400
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,704
and then maybe the name of the song,

401
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:12,126
but even then I could probably figure it out

402
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,228
if I wanted to go online and really research the song,

403
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:16,730
which honestly, believe it or not, sometimes I do.

404
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,393
So going from there.

405
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:26,712
Cues, there is more to designing games for people

406
00:19:26,812 --> 00:19:30,316
with audio issues than just subtitles and captions.

407
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:34,020
They are super important, but it's not the end all.

408
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:40,347
Example, having visual imagery for audio events

409
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,169
is super, super helpful.

410
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:46,136
For we happy few, if you're in sneak mode,

411
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:48,578
you can see everybody's footsteps.

412
00:19:49,078 --> 00:19:50,099
They make sound, too.

413
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,861
But honestly, I would have no idea

414
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:55,784
how to tell where somebody was without this.

415
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:59,006
Any game that has, like, let's say you step on

416
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:02,108
a creaky floor, if you see it makes a sound,

417
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,550
you make a little, like, poof of dust or something,

418
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:06,292
it lets me know that something occurred.

419
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:07,673
It gives me a visual indication.

420
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:11,485
The more important the event, the sound event is,

421
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,387
the more important it is to have a visual indication.

422
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:17,269
If you're expecting somebody to be able to play your game

423
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:19,231
where you're using sound cues,

424
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,414
visual indication is super, super important.

425
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:28,461
Also, when you're doing this, keep in mind that playing with your game with the volume

426
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:32,924
turned off may not be enough, because you know what those cues are supposed to be.

427
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:39,007
So I recommend, if you can, having people with different types of hearing issues play

428
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:39,368
your game.

429
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:45,951
Or if you can't do that, have people playtest your game who have never seen it before, who

430
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,473
have only played it with the game muted.

431
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:51,777
It's not perfect, but it means that they're at least not

432
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,020
biased in terms of they know what the sound already is.

433
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:58,527
Directional indicators.

434
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:01,331
This is super, super helpful.

435
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:05,456
Having some sort of indication on the screen that says,

436
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:07,896
there's a sound in this direction,

437
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,817
or you're being shot from that direction,

438
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:10,618
or things like that.

439
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,339
It's really common in games,

440
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:16,961
but it is super, super helpful for people who can't hear,

441
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:19,783
because a lot of times they have some sort of stereo audio

442
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:21,444
that lets you know if it's left or right or whatever.

443
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:24,126
I have no ability to do that.

444
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:26,667
I only can hear really out of my left ear,

445
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:27,828
and that ear is pretty bad.

446
00:21:28,148 --> 00:21:29,449
This ear's almost completely gone.

447
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,090
I have no directional sound.

448
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,332
So when a game is relying on directional sound,

449
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:35,773
I am lost.

450
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:39,413
And the way I get around that is if you have something

451
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:42,315
like this on the screen, that tells me what direction

452
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:43,436
the sound is coming from.

453
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:48,980
Now, in the same vein, you can have something like a radar

454
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,641
that tells you where things are.

455
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:52,262
So in this list, I made this full screen

456
00:21:52,302 --> 00:21:53,343
so you have some chance of seeing,

457
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:54,283
because the radar is pretty small.

458
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:56,565
But I can tell there's an enemy in front of me

459
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,966
and there's an ally behind me.

460
00:21:58,826 --> 00:22:00,608
And it helps me know where my team is,

461
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:03,490
it helps me know where I am, it helps everybody.

462
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:05,927
But without that, I would have no idea.

463
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:07,409
I can't hear people behind me.

464
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,331
So when I'm playing a game with other people,

465
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,953
like I play games with other people

466
00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:12,354
who know that I can't hear very well,

467
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:13,095
but they're like,

468
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:15,197
didn't you hear that guy sneaking up behind you?

469
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:16,959
I'm like, uh, no.

470
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,905
So this helps even the playing ground

471
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:24,888
so everyone can have an enjoyable experience.

472
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:29,195
Another thing that's helpful is environmental sounds.

473
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:31,877
So this is Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

474
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,799
When an undead creature is creeping up on you

475
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,741
and getting close, it sucks all the color out of the world,

476
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:39,302
or the majority of the color out of the world,

477
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:40,824
to give it a creepy vibe.

478
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:42,305
That's awesome.

479
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:43,806
It gives me a whole sense of immersion,

480
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:46,468
even though I can't really tell that that audio is there.

481
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:49,911
So that's really cool.

482
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:51,272
I wish more games did this.

483
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:56,195
And keep in mind, cues may not just be audio.

484
00:22:56,695 --> 00:22:58,596
They can be controller vibrations too.

485
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:01,158
So for Diablo III, for example,

486
00:23:01,818 --> 00:23:03,579
if I'm playing, especially single player,

487
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,661
there is this creature called a nemesis

488
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:08,762
that can spawn in that's like super powerful

489
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:09,983
compared to standard creatures.

490
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:12,864
And there is a vibration pattern to the controller

491
00:23:12,904 --> 00:23:14,245
that warns you it's coming.

492
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,327
There's also supposedly, and I say supposedly

493
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:18,507
because I've literally never heard it,

494
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:22,110
a horn that happens at the same time.

495
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,291
People are like, oh, can't you hear that horn?

496
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:25,832
No, but I can feel the controller.

497
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:28,413
Another important thing to realize is that

498
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:30,895
I actually play all games completely muted,

499
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:34,117
which may seem counterintuitive, however,

500
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:36,238
I'm trying to listen to party chat,

501
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,300
and if I have any sort of background noise,

502
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,022
if I'm playing a multiplayer game with party chat,

503
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,660
I am not going to know what's going on, what people are saying.

504
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,562
So I have to mute the games if I want to be in an Xbox party and have a prayer of understanding

505
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:50,863
people.

506
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:55,185
So, yeah, those are all super important things.

507
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,527
Last thing, really important thing, settings.

508
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:03,710
If you can't, I cannot find those settings, they might as well not be there.

509
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,392
It's important to make all accessibility settings accessible.

510
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,222
You should be able to find them in an easy location.

511
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:15,023
It's OK if they're in multiple menus.

512
00:24:15,463 --> 00:24:17,244
So let's take Madden, for example.

513
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:20,025
Madden has an accessibility menu that

514
00:24:20,065 --> 00:24:23,106
has things like volume control channels in it,

515
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:26,668
or menu narration, things like that, or long shot subtitles.

516
00:24:27,188 --> 00:24:32,550
I can tell you that a good chunk of the controls on the screen are on other screens.

517
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,231
Like volume control has its own menu.

518
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:39,273
But they're also here so people who are looking for that sort of thing can find it easily.

519
00:24:39,393 --> 00:24:40,793
And they're in multiple locations.

520
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,695
It's absolutely fine to have it in multiple locations.

521
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,195
It's a problem if people can't find it.

522
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,981
They should also be available when you're entering the game.

523
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:53,385
So if you see the little person standing there in the bottom corner, that's accessibility settings.

524
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:57,288
And if you were to move your cursor over it, it actually shows what it is.

525
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:03,513
It's also important that they're in pause menu so you can get to it easily and you don't have to back out of the entire game.

526
00:25:05,475 --> 00:25:07,617
So, thank you for your time.

527
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,981
And I hope you got some use out of that.

528
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:13,763
And if you have any questions, please ask.

529
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:17,304
I'm available on email, Twitter.

530
00:25:17,944 --> 00:25:20,866
And also I encourage if you have bugs in EA games

531
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:24,487
that are accessibility related, go to ea.com slash able.

532
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:26,268
There's a bug forum there.

533
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:29,029
It's also a shortcut of slash able slash bugs.

534
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:36,000
It's, if you put things in there, I actually have a team that I'm working with that are going

535
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,482
through and helping disperse that information among teams.

536
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:42,766
And we're trying to give accessibility a higher priority because we know that that means

537
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:44,287
that people can't play the game.

538
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:46,849
And we want to make games people can play.

539
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:52,674
So, and that's also why I have the Twitter account and the email.

540
00:25:52,774 --> 00:25:54,335
We're trying to get all the information we can.

541
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,483
just so we can make games people can play.

542
00:25:56,523 --> 00:25:57,903
Because nobody is sitting around going,

543
00:25:58,444 --> 00:26:00,345
oh, I want to make games that no one can use.

544
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:02,306
Or like, we could just exclude a whole section.

545
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:03,247
No, it's accidental.

546
00:26:03,787 --> 00:26:05,068
So awareness is key.

547
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:09,430
And I really hope that you can bring that information back.

548
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:13,833
For resources in general, I recommend 4.5 to 1 contrast

549
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:15,814
ratio or higher between text and backgrounds.

550
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,216
you can find that information on contrast-ratio.com

551
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:20,717
and actually test colors.

552
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:24,059
And in general, gameaccessibilityguidelines.com

553
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,600
is really helpful for just any type of issue.

554
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:30,222
Now, I'd like to take questions, and I'll need somebody

555
00:26:30,242 --> 00:26:31,503
to come next to me to do that.

556
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:34,885
I'd be happy to actually answer questions on any issue,

557
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:36,986
because my job as an accessibility lead

558
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:39,047
actually covers all types of disabilities.

559
00:26:39,527 --> 00:26:40,808
I prefer focusing on audio.

560
00:26:40,928 --> 00:26:44,229
But if you want to meet me in the wrap-up room in 204 after,

561
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:45,810
I'm happy to talk about any issue.

562
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:46,815
Thanks.

563
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:56,275
So, if you can come up to the microphones on either side, if you have a question, that

564
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:56,776
would be helpful.

565
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:05,922
Hi.

566
00:27:06,402 --> 00:27:12,524
My question is, is there like a standard or preferable position

567
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:15,706
for subtitle or caption text?

568
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:17,827
OK, I think I got that.

569
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:22,489
The question was, is there a standard for subtitles and text, right?

570
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,230
Like the position, like whether it's the top of the screen or the bottom.

571
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,011
Television industry, yes.

572
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:28,811
Game industry, no.

573
00:27:30,504 --> 00:27:32,085
You can find information if you like.

574
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:36,287
Search for BBC has subtitles.

575
00:27:36,307 --> 00:27:39,649
They have like 200 and some odd pages guide

576
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:41,570
on how to do subtitles and captioning.

577
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,291
So if you want extremely extensive information,

578
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:47,433
look for the BBC Subtitle and Captioning Guide online.

579
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:49,514
You'll find hundreds of pages of information.

580
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:50,975
Thank you.

581
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:55,669
Hi, thank you for the talk.

582
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,592
I was wondering, have you ever seen

583
00:27:59,752 --> 00:28:03,694
a good example of a sound puzzle in a game that

584
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:04,935
works for deaf people?

585
00:28:05,715 --> 00:28:06,276
OK, I heard you.

586
00:28:07,156 --> 00:28:08,817
Have you heard of a great example for subtitle what?

587
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:10,138
A sound puzzle.

588
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:12,342
A sound puzzle game.

589
00:28:13,863 --> 00:28:16,083
No, I have actually not seen a sound puzzle game that's

590
00:28:16,183 --> 00:28:18,704
really good at giving information.

591
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:19,724
I generally can't play those.

592
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,785
Games that are like music games, though, like rock band,

593
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:27,465
for example, and all that, I can play,

594
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:30,606
because it gives me enough feedback where I can sort of

595
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,026
match what's going on.

596
00:28:32,806 --> 00:28:34,347
I'm not going to say I'm the best singer in the world.

597
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:35,527
Thank God I can't hear myself.

598
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:36,487
But.

599
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:39,268
you know, I can still play those games,

600
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:41,290
but anything that requires me to actually hear

601
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,331
what the exact note is and match it, I can't do.

602
00:28:45,532 --> 00:28:45,672
Yep.

603
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:47,213
Hi.

604
00:28:48,183 --> 00:28:55,205
Do you know of any external resources to send builds to to rate for accessibility or provide guidelines?

605
00:28:56,185 --> 00:29:00,026
Okay, I think the question was do I know of any place where you can

606
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:05,288
Have external people test your thing based on the game accessibility guidelines

607
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:07,988
I believe if you go to

608
00:29:08,488 --> 00:29:13,830
Able gamers actually, it's I think it's yeah search online for able gamers. They have a

609
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,051
Group of people they've gotten together that does just that

610
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,991
So yeah, search for AbleGamers Charity.

611
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:22,793
They have the ability, you can hire people through them.

612
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:23,454
Thank you.

613
00:29:26,936 --> 00:29:27,096
Hi.

614
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:31,378
One of the challenges my accessibility team has

615
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,141
is drawing a fine line between not spoiling gameplay

616
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:37,802
or narrative content while also

617
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:44,618
providing tells for things that may be time dependent or a boss attack that is

618
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:48,421
Needing to be telegraphed in that way give any advice on

619
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:52,325
You know good decision-making practices where we try to find that line

620
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,556
Ah, the bot, yeah, okay.

621
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:09,218
So you're asking how to basically avoid punchlines,

622
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,241
more or less, in terms of like,

623
00:30:11,821 --> 00:30:13,343
it could be an action like a boss attack.

624
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:15,545
Correct, without spoiling content.

625
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:18,008
Without spoiling the content.

626
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:20,511
That's when you do, we'll work with timing,

627
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:22,072
that's what I was explaining earlier,

628
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:23,213
that like if you're doing a joke,

629
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:24,755
you don't wanna give away the punchline.

630
00:30:25,176 --> 00:30:29,860
So if you could do the boss attack sound, you definitely want to say you hear this sound,

631
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,061
like the boss attack sound.

632
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:35,385
So if people can actually hear it, it's okay to make a visual representation of it.

633
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:42,352
Or maybe when you have the boss roaring, there's actually a visual distortion on the screen

634
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:45,975
or something, because it's just such intense, or it makes the controller vibrate.

635
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:47,136
That's an option too.

636
00:30:47,156 --> 00:30:48,858
It doesn't have to actually be words.

637
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:50,338
Thank you.

638
00:30:51,178 --> 00:30:53,559
My accessibility team has also done a lot of user research

639
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,299
on We Happy Few, which we helped publish.

640
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:59,180
So on behalf of them, thank you for the kind words.

641
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:00,381
That means a lot to them.

642
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,741
I didn't fully catch that, so ask him in a minute.

643
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,642
But I love the fact you have an accessibility team.

644
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:05,702
Yeah.

645
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:07,343
What did you say?

646
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:16,137
I got it. Okay, so we are out of time.

647
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:19,562
That's just fine. I will be next door in 204.

648
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:22,286
You're welcome to ask me whatever you'd like about any type of issue.

649
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:23,347
Thank you.
