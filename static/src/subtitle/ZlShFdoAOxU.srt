00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:02,784
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:05,146
All right, mind your step,

3
00:00:05,426 --> 00:00:07,268
avoiding three common pitfalls in AI development.

4
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:10,851
This is a talk for beginners, as they've said,

5
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:12,253
for people who start out.

6
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:15,395
My name is Jan Muller, I work for Insomniac Games

7
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:16,296
as a senior engineer.

8
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:19,519
These are some of the games that we shipped

9
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:20,981
in the last five years while I was working there.

10
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:24,304
The last game I worked on is Sunset Overdrive for Xbox One.

11
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:27,017
Excellent game, if you haven't played it, you should check it out.

12
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:29,618
We have a bunch of games coming out, actually.

13
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:31,578
Ratchet & Clank is coming out for PS4.

14
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,019
Looks amazing, you should buy it next month.

15
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,701
Some of the deepest in development, and for Oculus Rift, we're working on The Edge of

16
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,021
Nowhere.

17
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:43,283
But I'm not going to talk about any of these, or kind of about all of these.

18
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:45,543
Most of my examples will be from Sunset Overdrive.

19
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:47,244
Alright.

20
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:48,764
Mind your step.

21
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:52,696
is about high level AI design ideas.

22
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,137
It is for beginners, it is for all experience levels,

23
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,178
for programmers and designers.

24
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,299
There's no programming in here, there is no pseudocode.

25
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,960
It is divided into three parts.

26
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:05,161
The first part is called,

27
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:07,943
your AI does not excel in the abstract and generic.

28
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:11,004
The second part, the buddy AI is not your friend.

29
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:12,705
And the last part,

30
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,586
escalation is the mother of all challenge.

31
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:21,779
But overall, this talk is really about memorable experiences and how to make AI that's memorable

32
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,460
and that carries your game. And there's only one number in this whole talk that I would

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,282
like you to take away, which is 50%. 50% is how much more memorable your AI should be

34
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:36,583
if you do all this versus not doing all these things I'm talking about.

35
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:44,325
All right, first part. Your AI does not excel in the abstract and generic or how to create

36
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:45,125
memorable behavior.

37
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:54,161
So the idea is, you start out on a new game, you work on a new agent, and you're asked

38
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:58,583
to make something unique and something memorable because the AI has to carry the game, bring

39
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:00,064
in the players, engage them.

40
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:02,545
And you might have some existing code.

41
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:07,388
You might have a database, we have a shared code library in some of your games, with behaviors,

42
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:10,869
behavior trees, all the base code that you can reuse for other projects.

43
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,671
And you might want to mix and match those behaviors to create something new.

44
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:20,085
And the pitfall here is simply to fail to create something unique from abstract systems.

45
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:22,366
And I will explain that ongoing.

46
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:24,046
So this is an example.

47
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:27,287
It might look very different in your game, and it's also just prerequisites.

48
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:30,827
I will go through this pretty quickly because we will get to the interesting part later

49
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:30,988
on.

50
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:37,649
Let's say you have some collection of components or just mechanisms in your system.

51
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:38,849
Maybe it's just design documents.

52
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:42,950
You have some movement components, some awareness, some combat components.

53
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,451
And it might look like something like this.

54
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:47,932
So you have some walking, some flying, and some swimming.

55
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:51,753
You have line-of-sight awareness, omni-awareness, and audio awareness.

56
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,814
And you have ranged combat, melee combat, and area-of-effect attacks.

57
00:02:56,774 --> 00:02:58,215
And then you can combine these, right?

58
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:04,577
You can say, okay, I want to create a bot that is flying, that has line-of-sight awareness,

59
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,577
and has an area-of-effect attack.

60
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:08,998
And that might be something like a dragon.

61
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:10,078
Right?

62
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:12,519
Flies over you, sees the player, shoots fire.

63
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,471
Or you go ahead and you create something like, oh, it's walking, it hears you, it listens

64
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,592
to your footsteps, and then melee attacks you.

65
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,472
That might be something like a clicker from The Last of Us.

66
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:27,673
So out of these components, you can create all kinds of different bots and all kinds

67
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:28,873
of different behaviors, and that's great.

68
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:31,634
That's super efficient, that's how programmers should think, right?

69
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:32,554
You reuse what's there.

70
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:37,395
The issue is, none of this deals at all with how the player experiences your AI.

71
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:42,176
You have no idea whether you made two bots that are actually different for the player,

72
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:43,436
or just different on paper.

73
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,116
So to look at it a little closer,

74
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:47,437
you have to put on your designer hat,

75
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:49,818
and you have to look at mechanics.

76
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,420
How does the player actually interact with your AI?

77
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,621
And that might be looking something like this.

78
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:01,086
you think about the player, you think about, okay, the player has to catch up, flank, or run away,

79
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:07,430
the player has to take cover, or move really fast, or strafe to break line of sight, or break awareness of the AI,

80
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:11,093
or the player has to run and gun, or get close up, or snipe from a distance,

81
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:14,455
and now you can combine the mechanics from the player's perspective and say,

82
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:19,399
okay, I want to create an AI that you have to flank, then you have to take cover and snipe from the side,

83
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,182
and that might be an enemy that's really strong at the front, or really strong in close range.

84
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:29,181
Or you say, okay, I want to catch up with the AI, be really fast and run and gun it down.

85
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:33,912
That might be an AI that is harder and harder over time and that you have to take out fast.

86
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,032
This helps you, this helps you to really understand what the player is doing, right?

87
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:43,996
Whether the experience is unique for the player and whether one AI plays differently than

88
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,797
another AI already in planning phase.

89
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:46,918
But is it memorable?

90
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:48,579
And what does it mean to be memorable?

91
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,881
Do you need a category of memorable mechanics?

92
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:53,342
And what would be in here?

93
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:57,405
Would it be like literally memories that you put in here and the player generates those

94
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:57,745
somehow?

95
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:00,047
So to answer these questions.

96
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,286
I have to go a little bit into neuroscience.

97
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:08,589
When you read about memory and how memories are created and how memories are getting stronger,

98
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,852
you will find that cat pictures are really memorable and that you should have them in

99
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:14,692
all your presentations.

100
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,913
And I assume this worked.

101
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:20,235
I assume this picture is more memorable than the last 20 slides.

102
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,913
Because either you love cats and this is cute and you think this is a good idea, or you

103
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:29,375
think this is stupid and I shouldn't have done this, and you hate cats or are allergic

104
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:29,775
or something.

105
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:33,277
Either way, you probably have an emotional reaction to the cat picture.

106
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:40,021
Because when you do read into the neuroscience, you will hear the term emotional arousal a

107
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:40,281
lot.

108
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:47,453
It's a very general purpose term. It basically just means anything that is off your neutral zone,

109
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:51,656
anything that gets you out of your comfort zone, positively or negatively.

110
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:57,701
The father of the research in this, Professor James McGaugh, he's actually a California local,

111
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:02,105
and he started studying this decades ago.

112
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:04,667
Memory and Emotion is one of the books that you can read up on this.

113
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:10,570
And basically what he did is he took two groups, one of them were looking at kitchen sink objects

114
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:17,034
and the other group was looking at emotional arousing things like dangerous animals or

115
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:20,535
crashes, mutilated bodies, stuff like that.

116
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:24,337
And then he asked afterwards, how many of these pictures do you recall?

117
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:26,418
Do you actually remember what you saw?

118
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,579
And the result was something like this.

119
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:31,949
Neutral objects and arousing objects.

120
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,410
The arousing objects were a little bit more memorable, about 20%.

121
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,311
Not 50, about 20%.

122
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:42,353
So he said, yeah, there is a connection between emotional arousing things and memory.

123
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:46,354
And he also said stress hormones can strengthen that memory.

124
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:51,716
Which just means, like, this picture is memorable, but this might be more memorable, especially

125
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:53,576
if you actually encountered nature.

126
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:56,737
It's also the reason why I will remember this talk more than you.

127
00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:58,778
And I will talk about it later some more.

128
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:03,091
So, thinking about all this, what does it mean for gameplay?

129
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:07,435
When you think about emotion in games, you will probably come up with a bunch of cut-scenes.

130
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:11,939
You will come up with moments that had, like, set-piece moments where someone was dying

131
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,701
that you were fond of.

132
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,624
You will not find a lot of gameplay, but maybe some.

133
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,267
And I will bring some examples of how we do emotions in gameplay.

134
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:26,268
These are goals. These are the red, green, and blue, the simple emotions.

135
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:30,049
Positive emotions, synergy is the emotion of working together,

136
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,930
and aversion is a negative emotion.

137
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,350
And by goals I mean

138
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,831
the player might not like what you do. He might disagree.

139
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:41,725
So you might want to try to do something likeable and cute and the player thinks it's stupid.

140
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:47,188
Or you might do something that's supposed to be aggressive and nasty and the player

141
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:47,908
thinks it's really cool.

142
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:52,071
But at least you get some kind of emotional reaction which, as we learned, is better than

143
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:52,611
no reaction.

144
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:54,752
So affection.

145
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:56,453
Positive emotions.

146
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:59,775
What you want to do is you want to create some bonding moments, right?

147
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,776
You want to have lovable behavior.

148
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:08,223
Sounds funny, but one of my first memories of games that I still have in my mind

149
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:09,404
it's not quite true

150
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:11,105
one of the first memories of this

151
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,088
was twelve years ago in Half-Life 2

152
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:17,091
you met Dog, the big mechanic robot

153
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:19,352
and he looked kind of scary

154
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:21,154
and the first thing you did with him

155
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:22,856
is you played Fetch

156
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,200
You were shooting a metal ball and he fetched it, caught it, and brought it back to you.

157
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,421
And you learned the mechanics and you learned to fall in love with that companion AI.

158
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:38,763
And we basically, in Sunset Overdrive, the last game I worked on, we basically just stole

159
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:39,203
that idea.

160
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:44,664
We had a dog robot that actually looked like a dog, and when you met him, you learned to

161
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:45,324
love him.

162
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:47,245
I will show a video of that.

163
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:51,106
And there's no audio.

164
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:51,986
Why is there no audio?

165
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,913
Yeah, you like playing fetch?

166
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:56,833
You want me to throw this thing for you?

167
00:08:57,753 --> 00:08:58,053
Bark!

168
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:01,794
Hmm, how can I make this fun for me too?

169
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:03,815
How about...

170
00:09:09,936 --> 00:09:11,577
Hell yeah!

171
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:14,297
Hey Sam, I got this stupid dog excited.

172
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:15,578
Now how do I reboot it?

173
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:18,058
Not the best news to break to you,

174
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:20,719
but Margaret has to do that here.

175
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:23,203
All right, so what do we do there?

176
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,145
Well, there's obviously the plain things,

177
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:27,606
like it's friendly looking, right?

178
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:29,027
It looks like Hello Kitty or something.

179
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:32,110
But there's a lot of behavior about this dog

180
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,111
that tries to make it look friendly to the player.

181
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:36,133
It wags its ears, it wags its tail,

182
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:38,675
it does a little happy dance whenever you interact with it.

183
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:40,336
It actually looks for attention.

184
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:42,117
It barks at the player and looks at the player

185
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:43,739
and tries to get your attention when you look away.

186
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,201
All these things are trying to get the player

187
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:48,542
to fall in love with the AI and play with it.

188
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:53,411
The second example is synergy. It's one of my favorite things actually in games.

189
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:57,395
It's the feeling of collaboration and working together and codependence.

190
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:01,459
It doesn't happen very often, but when it works, it's great. It's probably the best thing there.

191
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,381
My favorite example of that is Journey.

192
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:09,466
In Journey, you find a lot of floating creatures that you interact with, that you rescue,

193
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:13,710
and then they play with you and they energize you and bring you forward.

194
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,831
And I will show a quick video of that too.

195
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:22,548
rescuing the dolphins or carpet creatures.

196
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:25,491
And they will call out to you and you can answer.

197
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:28,695
They will encircle you and when you call back,

198
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:31,117
they actually pick you up and help you out.

199
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,600
And that is energy, working together with AI.

200
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:43,096
Alright, the last one, just as an example, aversion, negative emotions.

201
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:45,579
You will mostly find it in bosses, right?

202
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:50,164
When you think about negative emotions in gameplay, it's almost always the main villain.

203
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:54,969
Probably just because that's where we invest our time, right?

204
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:58,473
We don't have a lot of time to work on emotions with your foot soldier.

205
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:05,348
Aversion, dislike, betrayal, negative emotions, taunting often plays a big part in it.

206
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:11,852
My favorite example from other games is Wesker, who in Resident Evil, he's a friendly NPC

207
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:16,956
originally in the first one, and he turns on you, he becomes evil, and this becomes

208
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,057
part of his behavior.

209
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:19,858
He does evil things.

210
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:25,022
As you will see in the video, he's teleporting away from your bullets and he's sucker punching

211
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:27,704
you and he's generally sucky to play against.

212
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:39,840
evil dude, teleports, and sucker punches.

213
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:46,263
Alright, in Sunset Overdrive, we had Fizzy.

214
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:49,985
Fizzy is our permanent aware AI

215
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,606
that's kind of taunting you throughout the game,

216
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,546
and you have to fight her multiple times.

217
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:56,128
And she's trying to taunt you

218
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,489
both outside and inside gameplay.

219
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:00,090
And here's an example of that quickly.

220
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,201
Hey, it's me, Fizzy!

221
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:08,463
Trespassing and destruction of property is a serious crime!

222
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:10,964
Get ready to die, half-wolt!

223
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:14,025
A giant glyph is attacking me!

224
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:17,547
This girl's marketing is getting really aggressive!

225
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:21,969
Hey, you know what sounds like fun?

226
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,109
If you stop moving for a second!

227
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,411
Right, Fizzy says basically, please stop moving so I can kill you.

228
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,060
All right, so to recap the first part,

229
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:35,242
creating memory experiences, memory behavior,

230
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:37,543
is about the interaction of the player first, right?

231
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,004
Like you have to look out at unique interaction.

232
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:41,565
And then it's about emotion.

233
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:44,006
You find some emotional connection to the AI,

234
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:45,326
whether it's positive or negative,

235
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,108
and that will strengthen your experience.

236
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:52,211
At the end of the day, you oftentimes have to create some kind of one-off behavior,

237
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:55,695
something that only happens once just to build this emotional connection.

238
00:12:56,315 --> 00:13:01,581
For example, in our case of the dog, the whole dog park is one large set of

239
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:05,865
interactions that only exist for this purpose and that are not being reused afterwards.

240
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:08,910
So Pitfall Avoidance, first part is over.

241
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:11,454
We can create memorable behavior.

242
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:13,216
We know that we need some kind of emotion.

243
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:15,460
And we know that it has something to do with

244
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:18,624
strengthening the emotion after the effect.

245
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,548
The next chapter will be specifically about body AI.

246
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:26,734
And I put this in here because buddy AI, a lot of the things that I just said apply to

247
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:32,460
buddy AI, but buddy AI has very different challenges than your average enemy or friendly

248
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:32,700
AI.

249
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:38,145
The chapter is called the buddy AI is not your friend, or how to design the buddy AI

250
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,066
around the needs of the game.

251
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:43,412
By buddy I mean a lot of different things here.

252
00:13:45,093 --> 00:13:50,174
I mean all kinds of friendly AIs that play with the player and are part of the game.

253
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:54,616
Some people call it companions, some people call it team AI, all of those, all of these

254
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:55,336
guys are meant.

255
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:56,076
Right?

256
00:13:56,136 --> 00:14:00,237
I mean something like Elizabeth, I mean something like the RoboDoc I just introduced, I mean

257
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:01,978
teammates and squadmates, all of them.

258
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,860
So the scenario is this.

259
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,100
You're working on Buddy AI.

260
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,741
And you know Buddy AI has special needs.

261
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,602
It's really hard to get people to agree

262
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,722
on what is good Buddy AI.

263
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:15,363
And you might think, I want to model the AI

264
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:16,563
after what the player wants.

265
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:18,524
And it sounds like a good idea.

266
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:20,825
The pitfall, I will say right ahead,

267
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:21,885
yes, pitfall of the game,

268
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:24,966
is to build up player entitlement.

269
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:26,827
And to explain what I mean by that,

270
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,127
I will first give you some examples,

271
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:28,947
then spell it out for you.

272
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:31,528
All right, so first example.

273
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:33,408
the buddy AI can revive you.

274
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:34,908
You are working on some team shooter,

275
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:36,929
and the player goes down,

276
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:39,250
and there's two or three AI teammates,

277
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,570
and they can come and revive you.

278
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:41,970
Why wouldn't they?

279
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:43,911
But you have no economy,

280
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:45,871
you have no health packs,

281
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:48,112
or instant death, or timeout.

282
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:50,112
And then you get into a real problem,

283
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:52,233
because technically you can never die.

284
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:54,154
The AI can always come and revive you, right?

285
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:57,874
And even if the AI fails for obvious reasons,

286
00:14:57,915 --> 00:14:58,735
like getting shot,

287
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:00,555
the player will not accept that.

288
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:04,718
I had that problem actually in Fuse, where we had exactly this issue, where it went so

289
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:09,762
far as the AI would come over, would bend down to try to revive you, get shot in the

290
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:12,063
head, and the player would still say the AI failed.

291
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:12,804
The AI sucks.

292
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:15,025
Another example.

293
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:21,130
Buddy AI supports combat, fighting with you is part of the setups, and there is no tracking

294
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,951
of the player progress.

295
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:27,854
Nothing that checks how many people the player shot or whether he pushed forward the combat.

296
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:33,535
And then you get YouTube videos of Call of Duty Black Ops that play themselves and the

297
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:34,435
player just watches.

298
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:38,176
And you can argue that's what this game is supposed to do.

299
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:41,677
It's not about challenge, it's about feeling in the middle, you don't actually have to

300
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:41,998
play.

301
00:15:42,798 --> 00:15:47,179
But at the very least you're not matching the player expectation here, which is I'm

302
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,120
the hero, I'm the most important person in this game.

303
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,521
The third example, this is really contentious.

304
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:57,122
Every time I talk about this, there is 50-50 people who agree and completely disagree with

305
00:15:57,142 --> 00:15:57,282
this.

306
00:15:57,982 --> 00:15:59,262
The buddy AI gives you ammunition.

307
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,323
There is no rules on how much.

308
00:16:02,523 --> 00:16:06,004
You just press a button, you get ammunition, and you get really used to that.

309
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:10,025
And then if it's missing, you get really annoyed, or at least I get really annoyed.

310
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:12,265
That is my one problem with Elizabeth.

311
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:17,327
She is amazing, and I will talk about how amazing she is later, but this is my one issue.

312
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:19,867
I get annoyed with her when she wasn't there or when she wasn't working.

313
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:27,311
And the fact that half the people agree and half the people don't agree with this just proves my point that you never know what people expect.

314
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:37,457
So player entitlement is about spoiling the player. It's about giving the player what he wants until he either doesn't care anymore or he's really upset when it's missing.

315
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:44,941
And it's also about different expectations. Everybody wants something else from Buddy AI and you can't really guess what it's going to be.

316
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:49,663
For some people this is sushi and it's amazing and for other people it's raw fish and they don't want it.

317
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:53,780
So, you might want to go about it differently.

318
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:54,841
At least I do.

319
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:59,607
I'm trying to, when I go for body height these days, I'm trying to model it around the needs

320
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,067
of the game.

321
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:01,689
And that sounds very obvious, right?

322
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,012
It sounds like, oh sure, we all try to make the game better.

323
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:05,774
That's the goal.

324
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:09,698
But what does it mean, and what is really helping the game?

325
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,975
For me, there's three categories. These are my categories.

326
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:19,364
You might agree, you might have different names, you might mix and match them, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.

327
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,267
But these are my three categories.

328
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,771
The teacher, the VIP and the soldier.

329
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:27,518
The teacher explains the world, right?

330
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,219
He is there to give you the background, the plot, the story,

331
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:32,880
explains to you why you're there.

332
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,702
The teacher is leading the way, showing you around,

333
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:39,782
leading you by the hand, showing you a door,

334
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:41,303
showing you a loot crate.

335
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,284
Maybe it's a dog that finds some equipment

336
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:44,924
for you in the world.

337
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:47,305
But the teacher does not fight normally.

338
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:49,966
The teacher is an academic, doesn't care about combat.

339
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:55,389
And that's really where Elisabeth is good. That is why I like her. Not the other thing, not the giving me gifts.

340
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:57,410
That is where she's the best at, I think.

341
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:00,612
The second category is the VIP.

342
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:04,174
VIP is the purpose of the game, the purpose of the mission.

343
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:06,555
It's really why you're there and why you're playing this.

344
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,616
The VIP cannot die.

345
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:14,740
Meaning, either the VIP is immortal, or if the VIP dies, you're lost.

346
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,566
And that's usually where you find codependence, where like you save the VIP and eventually the VIP will do something for you.

347
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:26,349
My favorite example for this is Ellie from The Last of Us.

348
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:33,656
Without spoiling anything, she is the reason you make you play this game and more important than anything else.

349
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:36,211
The last category is the soldier.

350
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:41,633
The soldier is everybody who fights, everybody who supports combat, either just helping the

351
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:45,254
player or just being fluff, being background, making the combat larger.

352
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:51,776
And most importantly, and that's really important for me, the soldier can die and it shouldn't

353
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:52,056
matter.

354
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:57,778
Like, if the AI does something wrong, if the AI goes down, it shouldn't at all influence

355
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:58,098
your game.

356
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:01,200
Any team shooter has soldiers like this, right?

357
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,621
Like Halo or Call of Duty.

358
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:04,862
Things in the background that don't really matter for the player.

359
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:07,904
So you can mix and match those.

360
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:12,386
But if you, for example, create a VIP AI that is also a soldier,

361
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:17,690
you basically just create an escort mission where it depends on the AI whether your game progresses or not.

362
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,023
So, what happens if you don't work for the player's needs, right?

363
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:25,725
Why should the player care about all this?

364
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:27,827
Well, for all the reasons I explained before.

365
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:30,389
The player should care for an emotional connection.

366
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:31,930
He should care because he likes the AI.

367
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,412
He should care for story and character reasons.

368
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:38,336
And lastly, he should care because you play together with the AI.

369
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:41,539
The AI saves you, you save her, works together.

370
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,461
Alright, to recap this part.

371
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,941
Prevent player entitlement. Be very careful about your assumptions about what the player wants

372
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:55,642
and that you think you know what actually makes the player happy, because everybody has a different expectation here.

373
00:19:56,122 --> 00:20:00,124
Design around the needs of the game. If you can, think really hard about what your game is missing.

374
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:03,945
Is it missing some story explanation? Is it missing someone who leads it by the hand?

375
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:07,706
Is it missing a purpose? Like, why am I doing all this? Why am I fighting?

376
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:09,307
Fill that need.

377
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:12,608
And finally, motivate through story and emotion.

378
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:16,006
Think about how you can get an emotional connection

379
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:17,386
and motivate through that.

380
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:19,047
Pitfall avoided.

381
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,148
We know we need some emotion.

382
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:24,449
We know that the buddy AI can spoil the player

383
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,550
and we have to be careful about it.

384
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,471
We can make good friendly AI,

385
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:30,052
but we haven't talked at all about enemy AI.

386
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:32,653
So the last chapter is solely about enemy AI

387
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:33,413
and it's wrapping it up.

388
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:35,494
The last chapter is called

389
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:37,895
Escalation is the Mother of All Challenge.

390
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:41,136
Or, Why Repetition is Better Than Its Reputation.

391
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:49,950
So, to repeat myself, we're talking about memorable experiences, right?

392
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,092
We're talking about how to make the game memorable for the player.

393
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,173
And you might wonder, what does it have to do with challenge?

394
00:20:57,492 --> 00:21:01,115
Well, you remember the study I was talking about before,

395
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:05,959
of Professor McGaw, who was taking group A and group B,

396
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,802
and group A was looking at kitchen sink items,

397
00:21:10,022 --> 00:21:14,005
and group B was looking at emotional arousing objects?

398
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:17,688
Well, he did some more work on this,

399
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:20,010
and one of the sentences you might remember is,

400
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,731
stress hormones can strengthen memory.

401
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:25,868
So what he did there is the so-called ice water trial.

402
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:28,249
He basically took the two groups,

403
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:29,309
and he split them up again.

404
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:35,411
And one half of them would just get a bucket of warm water

405
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,212
and were asked to hold their hand in it.

406
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:41,153
And the other one was given a bucket of ice water

407
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:43,854
and asked to hold their hand in the ice water

408
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:45,254
until it really hurt,

409
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:48,355
until they couldn't hold it anymore in there.

410
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:50,536
Basically he was torturing them, right?

411
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,832
So the result was this.

412
00:21:54,633 --> 00:22:00,422
As soon as you mixed emotion with stress, with pain, your memory would jump up.

413
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:04,388
50 plus percent better recollection of what just happened.

414
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:11,019
And the interesting thing to note here too in this chart is on the right side are the neutral items, on the left side the arousing items.

415
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,084
So on the right side you can actually see that stress, when induced on the neutral items, reduced your memory.

416
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:24,368
It really only works together when you mix the two, stress and emotional interesting items.

417
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:26,589
that makes memory strong.

418
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,174
So, to talk about challenge here,

419
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,359
let's say the goal is we have some combat set up

420
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,865
and you're asked to make it harder or make it longer,

421
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:39,569
it's too short, it's too easy, fix that.

422
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:45,776
And your approach might be to repeat an existing behavior, an existing mechanic, three, four,

423
00:22:45,836 --> 00:22:46,356
five times.

424
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,117
And it totally makes sense.

425
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:49,157
That is the right approach.

426
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:52,338
Because repetition is really good for your game.

427
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:58,020
Here's a quote from Ziggy Ziggler, the father of all motivational speakers.

428
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,362
Repetition is the mother of learning, the father of action, which makes it the architect

429
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:05,122
of accomplishment.

430
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:07,383
And this really speaks for action games.

431
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:08,263
That's what we do, right?

432
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,324
That's what it's all about.

433
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:11,185
We want the player to learn.

434
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:16,589
We want the player to repeat the behavior, get better at it, get skill over time, and

435
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:19,931
then overcome the game, beat the game, feel accomplished.

436
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:24,954
And also for developers, this is really important because we can reuse our work.

437
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:30,238
We can have the player fight the same AI 50 times instead of making 50 different AIs.

438
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:31,959
So repetition is good.

439
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:37,031
The problem is, you can very quickly cheapen the experience for the player.

440
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:39,874
If you do the same thing over and over, the player will get bored, right?

441
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:43,096
He will feel too skillful for what you throw at him.

442
00:23:44,217 --> 00:23:46,319
He will think that you didn't come up with anything better.

443
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,044
So the approach that people take oftentimes, that I took in the past, was to say, okay,

444
00:23:52,184 --> 00:23:53,605
we add some weak spots.

445
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:54,486
We add some turrets.

446
00:23:54,526 --> 00:23:58,629
You have a giant monster and it has five turrets on it, and you have to first destroy the turrets.

447
00:23:58,709 --> 00:23:59,770
And the turrets shoot little rockets.

448
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,531
That is a really bad idea.

449
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:03,588
And here's why.

450
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:06,272
Destroying weak spots, especially if it's weapons,

451
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,815
is kind of like cutting off the heads of a hydra.

452
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:14,895
Hydra is obviously the giant serpent with seven or ten heads of the old Greek mythology

453
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:18,338
and it was fighting all the Greek heroes and you would cut off some heads and you would

454
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:23,582
cut off some more heads and cut off some more and now the combat is boring and sucks because

455
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:26,244
there is no heads left and it's just like a snake, right?

456
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:28,626
And the Greeks knew that, they were smart in that.

457
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:31,608
They knew they needed a real challenge for their heroes.

458
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:32,689
So they said no, no, no.

459
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:35,057
the heads grow back, or even better,

460
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:37,518
every time you cut off a head, there's two heads coming out.

461
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:39,499
And that's really how you get challenge.

462
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:41,480
You really make the player think about it,

463
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,901
and if you do something wrong, it's going to get harder.

464
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,203
So instead of thinking about just adding weak spots

465
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:49,644
or just doing the same thing over and over,

466
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:52,885
add heads, make it harder every time

467
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:54,066
you progress through the combat.

468
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:57,407
Make it harder with each step, and increase the challenge.

469
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:59,208
Because the player learned something, the player got better,

470
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:01,069
so your challenge has to become greater.

471
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,985
Alright, so think of this as escalating the combat.

472
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:08,147
Like think of your enemy like a wounded animal.

473
00:25:08,827 --> 00:25:14,712
Think of it like what would happen if the enemy was scared, it was in a corner, it was

474
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,753
more defensive or more aggressive.

475
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:22,197
Add attacks, don't show everything at the beginning, actually hold it back and during

476
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:25,039
the progress of the battle bring out your extra stuff.

477
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,727
Scale combat intensity. This is really easy for programmers. Just put in some sliders.

478
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:36,910
Put in a slider of how much damage output you do per second, or how fast you react to

479
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:42,072
the player, or how quickly you mix things up. And as the combat progresses, you just

480
00:25:42,112 --> 00:25:48,655
scale it up. In other words, build escalation in your enemy AI behavior. Turn this little

481
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:54,938
puppy into this angry dog over time. Some examples for this from Sunset Overdrive.

482
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:56,468
There's the Hercar.

483
00:25:56,908 --> 00:25:58,089
Hercar is this large thing in the middle.

484
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,170
He has a giant claw.

485
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,932
He's dangerous when you get close to him.

486
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:02,654
He has really strong melee attacks.

487
00:26:03,214 --> 00:26:06,217
But if you wait for too long, he will collect smaller enemies.

488
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:11,462
If you don't take him down, he will collect them, they jump on his back, and he will start

489
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:13,123
throwing enemies at you, literally.

490
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:15,385
So you want to be fast about him.

491
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:16,186
You don't want to ignore him.

492
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:17,447
He becomes dangerous.

493
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:21,712
Or another example is pretty much any boss in Sunset Overdrive.

494
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:23,935
They all are set up in phases.

495
00:26:24,676 --> 00:26:29,042
They start out slow, they start out sluggish, and become more aggressive over time.

496
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:30,444
This is the Norton Dragon.

497
00:26:31,385 --> 00:26:35,170
It's basically a giant penis-shaped creature that flies through a city.

498
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:39,971
And you're supposed to follow him and jump on his back and hit his head.

499
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:42,472
And every time you do that, he becomes more aggressive.

500
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:44,794
He will start throwing spikes on his back.

501
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:46,595
He will start shooting fire.

502
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:50,697
He will set the city ablaze and try to stop you from catching up with him, right?

503
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:54,259
So build escalation in your bosses.

504
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,501
To recap, repetition is the mother of all learning.

505
00:26:58,522 --> 00:27:00,823
Escalation is the mother of all challenge.

506
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:06,210
Pitfall avoided, we know we need to create some emotional connection, we know we have

507
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:11,052
to be very careful about body AI and assumptions with body AI, and we know that if you add

508
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:17,134
stress, if you add pain, if you try to torture the player, well not trying, but if you add

509
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:21,496
some stress level to the player, you will get a better response, you will get more memorization

510
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,136
of what's going on.

511
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:28,198
Thank you for listening, please give me feedback after, there's like two minutes left for questions.

512
00:27:37,393 --> 00:27:41,158
As you mentioned, we do have three minutes left for questions.

513
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:45,625
Please use the microphones in the aisles so that it shows up on the video.

514
00:27:45,645 --> 00:27:48,769
Anybody have any questions for Jan?

515
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,210
Well, I will kill time for a moment.

516
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:53,171
He touched on a lot of interesting things,

517
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:54,952
and Jan and I actually have to have a beer after this

518
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:55,532
to talk about it.

519
00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:58,734
A lot of neuroscience, a lot of psychology,

520
00:27:58,754 --> 00:28:01,195
and that's very important, it goes into AI.

521
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:03,396
As a matter of fact, I don't know if Brian's in here,

522
00:28:03,436 --> 00:28:06,638
but Brian Schwab and I did a lecture here in 2012

523
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,799
on psychology and AI.

524
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,860
And so it touches on not the same stuff,

525
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,542
but very similar things about how we can engage the player.

526
00:28:16,282 --> 00:28:18,583
through what they sit down at the computer

527
00:28:18,603 --> 00:28:21,363
or at the console with, is that they're built-in hooks

528
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:22,364
of psychology.

529
00:28:22,404 --> 00:28:25,064
And so the things that he was talking about here,

530
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:28,645
about being cognizant of as a designer, for that matter,

531
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:31,426
or an AI programmer, you might want to pick that up.

532
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,446
It's for free on the GDC Vault back in 2012.

533
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:37,267
Just look for Psychology in AI, or my name,

534
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:38,607
or Brian Schwab's name, and you'll find it.

535
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:40,068
But it's also very similar.

536
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:42,128
And that's really an important thing for us

537
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:43,829
to be aware of as game programmers,

538
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:44,669
because that's all we're doing,

539
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:46,149
is dealing with people's psychologies.

540
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:48,810
So, I don't see anybody coming up for questions.

541
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,971
You can just, if you want.

542
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:52,631
Otherwise, we'll go ahead and cut it off here.

543
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:54,352
Oh, go ahead and step up to the mic, please.

544
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:57,593
Go ahead, yeah.

545
00:28:57,853 --> 00:28:58,033
Hey.

546
00:28:58,273 --> 00:28:59,153
Great talk, by the way, man.

547
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:00,314
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

548
00:29:00,354 --> 00:29:03,395
So you said the soldier's death is always relevant.

549
00:29:03,815 --> 00:29:04,315
Not always.

550
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:06,296
I prefer it to be irrelevant.

551
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:07,496
You prefer it to be irrelevant.

552
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:08,236
Okay, that makes sense.

553
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:10,997
I was just like, in my mind,

554
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:13,158
is that because you want to ensure

555
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:15,759
that the death is something that the player can prevent?

556
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:17,813
to allow it to be fair.

557
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:20,562
If the player really needs prevent the death,

558
00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:22,223
then you're basically making a VIP, right?

559
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:23,503
Like you're making someone who's important

560
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:24,803
for your existence or for the game.

561
00:29:25,604 --> 00:29:27,064
The soldier is really more the,

562
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:28,625
you have large scale combat,

563
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:31,185
you have 50 AI fighting other 50 enemies.

564
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:32,786
That's the soldier, right?

565
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:34,086
Like it's the fluff in the background.

566
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,067
It's not so much about someone the player cares about.

567
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:39,328
If you have a squad, like a teammate,

568
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:41,148
that if he dies, the game is over,

569
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:42,949
you create a VIP and you want to have

570
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:44,169
some kind of collaboration.

571
00:29:44,189 --> 00:29:46,530
You want to have that, oh, I save your butt,

572
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,230
you save my butt behavior.

573
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:49,160
Okay, thank you.

574
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:56,185
Hey, how you doing?

575
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:57,366
Also, great talk, man.

576
00:29:57,386 --> 00:30:00,228
I just want to be, something I just want to clear up.

577
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:02,790
The soldier AI that you were talking about,

578
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:05,573
it's not the same as the buddy AI, correct?

579
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:08,455
You can argue that a soldier is also a buddy,

580
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:09,175
in a way, right?

581
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:10,837
But it's a buddy that is not,

582
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:12,458
usually not emotionally connected to you.

583
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:14,620
It's more like, oh, I'm going out in the field

584
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,381
with my 50 squad mates.

585
00:30:17,634 --> 00:30:22,518
I might care that they die, but it doesn't matter for my experience if they do, necessarily.

586
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:24,059
It just adds to my experience.

587
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,362
Okay, I guess, like, you know, I'm still thinking, like, um, like, you know, a difference between,

588
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:35,008
like, um, the Marines in Halo that would occasionally join you, like, in my mind, that's a soldier.

589
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:35,568
Yeah.

590
00:30:35,608 --> 00:30:39,051
And, as a matter of fact, too, like, a garrison would be like a buddy.

591
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:40,512
Would that be a fair comparison?

592
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:41,153
Yes, yes.

593
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:41,913
That's exactly what I mean.

594
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:42,474
Thank you.

595
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,939
Okay. We're going to go ahead and have to wrap it up. But good

596
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:53,087
stuff here from Jan Muller. Agree? Let's hear it.
