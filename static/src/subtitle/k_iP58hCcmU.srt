00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:14,831
Good morning, everyone. My name is Brian Francis. I'm GDC's Community Manager and a contributing editor at gamasutra.com.

2
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:18,713
If you need to refer to me in the third person, I use the pronouns he, him.

3
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:24,736
Today, for our second day of live speedruns, we're going to be running Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair

4
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:28,498
with game developer Chris Sutherland and runner Dave Stereo.

5
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:31,480
Chris and Dave, would you like to introduce yourselves?

6
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:38,209
Sure, I'm Chris Sutherland. I'm a director at Playtonic Games and I'm responsible for some of

7
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:43,531
the character movement work as a software engineer as well in Yooka-Laylee and The Impossible Lair.

8
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:50,235
And I'm Dave Stereo. I am a live streamer. I stream primarily on Twitch.

9
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:55,757
Speedrunning is the main gig. I do everything from platformers to long-form RPGs,

10
00:00:57,477 --> 00:00:59,719
Pretty much any genre of game that interests me,

11
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:05,164
and it is a privilege and a pleasure to be working with Playtonic once again and GDC.

12
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:07,706
Right on. Thank you both.

13
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:12,189
For the folks at home, I'd like to briefly explain why we're hosting Speedruns at GDC.

14
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,711
As I mentioned for those of you who were watching yesterday,

15
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:17,994
speedrunning is a fascinating and thriving part of the game community

16
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:20,636
that feels closely connected to the art of game development.

17
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:31,941
Runners become intimately familiar with the game's mechanical oddities, rewriting the experiences in the name of completing games faster and faster, unearthing secrets that sometimes surprise even the developers who worked on those titles.

18
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:41,485
If you saw yesterday's run, which I think is archived in Swapcart and you can go back and watch, you can see just how much you can surprise a developer, especially when

19
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:44,407
They did not necessarily work on the programming or level design.

20
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:46,489
Of the games we've picked this week,

21
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:48,971
Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair is a game that

22
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,893
hews closest to some of the original versions of speedrunning.

23
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:58,359
You may recall that as recently as the 90s or the early 2000s,

24
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,881
game developers who made platformers would include rewards

25
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:03,764
for players who could beat their game under a certain time.

26
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:05,665
I'm thinking of Metroid Fusion,

27
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:09,228
but there's probably other games that I didn't even play that did that.

28
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,910
That's a practice that's evolved and spread into a number of other games.

29
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,151
Chris Sutherland has been working on these platformers for a long time,

30
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:21,532
and we're excited to see his thoughts on what Dave Sturio does to his game today,

31
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:27,154
which is to say I am here because I can't wait to see the look of horror on his face.

32
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:31,316
With that out of the way, let's get started.

33
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:33,036
Dave, please take it away.

34
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:36,798
All right. So I'm going to start in three, two, one.

35
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:42,836
I'd say, yeah, you can let me in the impossible layer within speed running.

36
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:47,321
There are different categories that you can do within each game.

37
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:52,607
We are going to be doing the 24 B's category.

38
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:54,148
So pretty much in this game.

39
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:59,192
The main goal is to save all the bees and then go to the impossible layer, which is

40
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:01,633
the first and the last level of the game, actually.

41
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:06,916
It's kind of intended that you sort of fail the impossible layer first time around and

42
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:12,159
then return to it later, because each bee you save allows you to take a hit of damage

43
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:13,299
within the impossible layer.

44
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:23,067
It is actually possible to beat this impossible layer with 0 B's, which would be the traditional what you would call the Any% category.

45
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:30,833
But the community sort of said that that category wasn't really the most accessible to form a...

46
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:35,996
A speedrunning community on. I mean like there are people that do the the zero B category,

47
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:39,978
but we kind of wanted a more accessible entry point into speedrunning this game.

48
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:48,723
So 24 B's tasks you to find uh half the amount of B's because there are 48 to find and you can

49
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:57,147
either get them by completing chapters or you can um there are ones in the overworld because there's

50
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:59,648
individual levels in this game as well as an overworld.

51
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:06,559
Right on. Chris, I'm going to have a question for you in just a second about what Dave just explained.

52
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,644
I'm going to go to the chat real quick and just give a shout out to folks like Takagura, who's saying good evening from Tokyo.

53
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,546
Dave has some fans here like Matt Hatchet and...

54
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:32,177
A9a, ZN2, I'm also sorry there is a leaf blower behind me, and I can also see that folks like Kyle, LeClair, Michelle, and Sean have all taken notice of my co-workers up here lying on the cat hammock.

55
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:38,599
They will not be commenting on this run. If they do, you will hear them loudly. One of them really does like to share her opinions.

56
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,781
Chris, before we start pulling other questions from chat, would you mind breaking down the bees system for us?

57
00:04:47,182 --> 00:04:50,963
And what was sort of the original intent of the system that Dave is here to exploit?

58
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:58,867
So the idea here is that if you play through the whole game you'd get all 48 Bs and

59
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:02,248
what we wanted to do was really have it so that

60
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:08,322
A player could, as they progress through the game from start where they got zero Bs to where they

61
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:15,046
got 48, there's effectively for each B they get there's a it makes it slightly easier to tackle

62
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:21,711
the impossible layer so there's almost like well linear or roughly linear that it becomes more and

63
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:28,735
more easy the more and more Bs you get. So that's what we wanted to do and that's the idea behind

64
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:31,076
the impossible layer so when you go into the impossible layer

65
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:35,982
The second time, not as in here, you'll have a shield with the number of bees you collected,

66
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:41,609
and every time you take a hit, like Dave's done here, you would lose a bee,

67
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,975
and that would allow you to continue. So you effectively have 48 hits if you had all bees.

68
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:47,776
to get through the lair.

69
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:50,617
So we wanted to have a system where, from the start,

70
00:05:50,657 --> 00:05:53,298
you could play through it and complete the whole game, like Dave said,

71
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:56,719
but also, players, as they progress through the game,

72
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,300
it becomes an easier and easier challenge,

73
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,742
so they can opt to try out the impossible lair at any point throughout the game.

74
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:06,323
That's interesting. That's a pretty big difference

75
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:09,605
from the first Yooka-Laylee game, which was a big hit on Kickstarter.

76
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:12,286
This is also kind of a different genre for Yooka-Laylee,

77
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:15,567
because the first game was sort of a love letter to the...

78
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:20,292
The Banjo-Kazooie games from your studios, you know, former Rare employees.

79
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:22,678
But this one is very different.

80
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:24,803
Yeah, that's right.

81
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:25,384
Yeah, we... so...

82
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:33,431
We'd, among ourselves, had worked on Donkey Kong Country back in the day, and so we wanted to kind

83
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:39,975
of take a step back and say, well, if we'd carried on building games that were 2D platformers, what

84
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:45,738
would we have built? And one of the changes we wanted to make was not just having the 2D levels,

85
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:51,382
but expanding things like what you can used to think of as the map world. And so what we see

86
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:56,325
in Impossible Lair is the map world is effectively a 3D game in itself.

87
00:06:56,845 --> 00:07:02,867
And so you have a kind of 3D exploration or a top-down exploration zone,

88
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:05,668
2.5D looking down, camera looking down.

89
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:10,090
And then from there you go into each of the 2D levels,

90
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,791
play one of those and come out again.

91
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:14,232
So that's kind of one of the ways we wanted to make,

92
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,613
kind of put a spin on it, make it a bit different.

93
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,114
And there's a number of other things we did as well.

94
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:32,234
Right on, going to chat, speaking of all that, Dave Sabada would like to just say that this game was a joy to play through and that they loved how the overworld was designed and they loved the impossible air design.

95
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:37,056
Matt Hatchett weighs in with, this game has a great soundtrack, which I can hear right now, it is great.

96
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:44,859
That's right. Music by Dave Wise and Grant Kirkhope and our own two in-house sound designers.

97
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:49,780
Chat, just a reminder, if you've got questions for Chris or Dave, we will take them. If you're

98
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,861
a developer who wants to know more about how speedrunners do their thing, throw them in.

99
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:59,742
If you're a runner or just a person who wants to know about working on games like Yooka-Laylee

100
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:04,783
and the Impossible Lair, throw them in. We will ask them. All right, Dave, you've got your first

101
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:05,383
B, it looks like.

102
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:12,730
Yeah, so like each in order to complete the level, you need to break a bee free from the capsule.

103
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,316
So around halfway through that level, I actually grabbed a snail shell that you can shoot out of Vyuka's mouth.

104
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:23,502
And I was actually able to snipe it from, you know, pretty far away to end the level early.

105
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:24,524
Yeah.

106
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,126
Yeah, so that's bee number one.

107
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:34,689
Like I said, you can get bees from either completing levels or solving overworld puzzles or skipping overworld puzzles.

108
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:39,250
And I'm going to be grabbing all of the overworld bees that are available.

109
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,931
And we're actually going to be doing some very unintended well intended.

110
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:47,251
All right. Yeah, this is all unintended.

111
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:51,832
Or actually, I think the height of these fence posts are deliberate

112
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:55,993
so that you can kind of kind of sneak around.

113
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:56,353
Oh no.

114
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:59,074
Also, I'm doing some unintended things here where I...

115
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:00,755
And this, what's this?

116
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,195
See, this is like not expected at all.

117
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:06,756
Yeah, so you can ground pound on certain slopes,

118
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,997
which allows you to get a roll up top.

119
00:09:09,697 --> 00:09:13,658
And right now we went from the Chapter 2 area to the Chapter 17 area,

120
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:17,259
but except we're going to kind of go out of here,

121
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,179
and we're going to go to the Chapter 10 area.

122
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,120
And this is because there are things called paywalls,

123
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:23,981
and...

124
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:31,044
I actually gotta make sure that I don't fall out of bounds here or accidentally hit the water when I don't want to.

125
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:40,919
So, there's five coins in each level that allow you to get these paywalls that allow you to open up different areas of the world map.

126
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:44,108
I need to do something pretty precise here.

127
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:47,630
Fall into another body of water so I can swim underground.

128
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,352
But this is so that we can skip all of the paywalls.

129
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:55,114
This is this giant skip that I'm doing so I don't have to collect any coins in any levels

130
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:59,157
and I don't have to watch any cutscenes pertaining to opening the paywalls.

131
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:05,421
In this 24 Vs run, there used to be one paywall that we needed to open to get into this desert area,

132
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:07,922
but now we no longer have to do that.

133
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:08,843
Also.

134
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:17,338
I can mess this up to where I start infinitely flying up into the sky of the game and you

135
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:18,659
will infinitely fly forever.

136
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:26,066
So I need to make sure that I can start this ascension where because I need to reach some

137
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:27,628
loading zones that are above me right now.

138
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:32,593
So let's you'll start to see the camera panning up in a little bit.

139
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:35,296
Right now.

140
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:40,213
Yeah, right now, and then if I can get into this loading zone...

141
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:43,614
There we go! Alright, good. I didn't fly away infinitely.

142
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:44,814
So now we're in...

143
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:48,875
It's a trigger, a loading trigger, just where that door is by rising up into it.

144
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:50,515
Yeah!

145
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:53,956
And now we're gonna skip this whole, uh...

146
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:56,256
...see-saw puzzle area...

147
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:01,297
...by getting enough height on this guy...

148
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:04,817
and then just kind of getting up there.

149
00:11:04,837 --> 00:11:08,260
So you're not expected to be able to jump over there.

150
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,984
You're supposed to go around the long way, but this works, I guess.

151
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:21,775
And this level actually has a pretty insane skip where we're going to sort of utilize the speed

152
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:27,196
that ropes give you that allows us to get so much speed that we can clip out of the boundaries of

153
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:33,198
the level. And we believe that it is framerate dependent, so I'm actually going to be enabling

154
00:11:33,298 --> 00:11:40,719
v-sync to sort of modify the framerate that a lot makes this trick a lot easier. And that's

155
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:42,120
going to be right here on this rope.

156
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:49,145
We're going to intersect it right at the top when it's swinging.

157
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:53,087
And if I can time a jump, I will fly

158
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:55,789
to the right side of the screen.

159
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:58,731
This trick is pretty precise, pretty difficult.

160
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,772
And the speed that you get from the rope is variable.

161
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:04,294
So I'm going to have to adjust on the fly.

162
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:07,976
This might take me a few tries, but it's worth it when we get it.

163
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:12,639
Well, we while we get the while we get this try going, I mean, for Chris.

164
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:13,960
Oh, there we go.

165
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:17,116
Yeah, it kind of took an unintentional death, but...

166
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,460
I gotcha. Dave, thanks for the insights.

167
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,901
We're going to come back to you in a bit for more.

168
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:26,722
I can talk about that particular exploit there.

169
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:30,623
I mean, this is basically an hour of being beaten up

170
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,763
for all the things we got wrong.

171
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,564
But that one in particular is my fault.

172
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:37,545
See, that's an interesting one, because as a developer,

173
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:41,126
what I did there was the ropes, and you move up and down them.

174
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:45,007
They don't actually check for the solid collision at the top.

175
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:47,087
There's just a point where it says you got to the top of the rope.

176
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:51,989
But of course, if you're a designer, you place the rope maybe slightly inside something.

177
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:56,070
And I think we, you know, we had the ability to set how far you can go up the rope.

178
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,632
There is obviously a weak point in some ropes if they're placed not quite right, then you

179
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:05,433
can, when you jump off the rope, which you go with a bit of speed, you can jump, end

180
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:10,775
up inside a solid collider, which then the physics system will then imbue you with some

181
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:15,137
enormous extra speed on top of the speed you've got to try and force you out because you're

182
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:18,759
Quite far in it. And I think that's what's throwing Dave out.

183
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,742
And so, yeah, it's obviously those things combined,

184
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:28,746
which will then fire Dave off at some super speed and then across to the other side of the map.

185
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:35,311
This is actually the hardest trick in the game and kind of throwing me for a loop here,

186
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:38,073
but we're going to get it. And like I said, it's totally worth it when we actually get this.

187
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:45,617
Yeah, this is interesting. This is something I hadn't really paid attention to because I'm mostly used to watching GDQ speedruns where you know, you sort of notice, like, oh, this trick's hard.

188
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:48,560
Oh, we got it in one go because they're really like trying their best for the run.

189
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:54,846
But not that you're not trying your best, but as I was watching our Skyrim run yesterday, I was like, oh, wow.

190
00:13:54,886 --> 00:14:01,632
Like, it's interesting that because you've shaved time off elsewhere by, you know, doing so many skips, like these become the time consuming activities.

191
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:09,439
We are going to, while you work on that Dave, we are going to go to chat so that you can focus on this while Chris and I discuss things.

192
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:19,845
Dave Sabato would like to know, blending the 3D map world gameplay with the 2D levels was really cool. Any plans or ideas around further exploring that concept?

193
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:27,853
Um, nothing specific that we're announcing yet, but yeah, I mean we liked it as well. We liked the

194
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:31,994
fact that there's those two sets of things. It meant actually that there was a bit more work

195
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:37,416
than we originally thought. So here, Dave's managed to do this now. Yeah, what he's done is he's

196
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:40,497
he's projected himself outside of the map.

197
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:48,609
and into an area where there was some water. And what he's using here is another exploit, again

198
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:54,353
related to the way we program these some of these things. So rather than saying a volume of water

199
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:59,336
where we display it as like you might say there's a box around and say this is a volume of water,

200
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:04,920
the way we do that is we mark up the the top and bottom of an area of water by saying this

201
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,863
is the entry point. And so if you to get into the water you have to pass through the entry point.

202
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:17,774
And so if you somehow bypass the entry and exit point whilst you're still underwater,

203
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:22,917
you can appear to the game like you're still underwater, which means you can effectively

204
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:26,299
swim in the air. And that's what Dave's been doing there as an exploit.

205
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,548
Um, next question for Chris while Dave just rampages.

206
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:32,670
Sorry, I don't know if I answered the last word question, but uh...

207
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,431
No, no, no, it was a, it was sort of a yes or no.

208
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:39,534
Um, question for Chris, what kind of QA testing goes uh into game dev, uh, games like this?

209
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:43,156
Um, do you look, intentionally look for breaks that speedrunners were employing,

210
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:45,858
or do you intentionally put them as easter eggs for speedrunners to find?

211
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:52,427
That's a great question because you might look at this and think that we didn't have a QA team,

212
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:58,650
but in actual fact what happens is there was a lot of QA on this and a lot of the things that,

213
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,852
maybe not all, but some of the things you'll see today as exploits, we might have seen those come

214
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:07,313
in in a bug, but we kind of take a view on them that

215
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:14,578
If it's something that, for the normal player, isn't going to encounter and it isn't going to spoil the game if it's not going to wipe their save,

216
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:24,205
if it's something that's quite unusual, it's quite hard to get, and yet it gets them some excitement and makes the game more interesting in a way.

217
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:28,828
Then we'll leave that in, because we know that speedrunners will like to find it.

218
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:32,290
I know you're probably the same as me, if you find something in a game, you think,

219
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,292
yes, I got around the game because they weren't expecting me to do that.

220
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:38,033
And actually, that's a great thing to have.

221
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:40,435
So we do actually leave in a lot of these things,

222
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:44,377
and even when they're pointed out sometimes, it's tempting as a programmer.

223
00:16:45,978 --> 00:16:48,140
You know, you look at it and you think, I should fix that.

224
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,782
And we've had to say a few times, let's not fix that.

225
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:51,923
People have been keen to fix things.

226
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:53,684
And we've had to say, no, don't fix those.

227
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,566
In fact, I've been about to fix things.

228
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:59,709
And people in the team who are speedrunning fans have said to me,

229
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,950
please don't fix this.

230
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,772
This will spoil the speedrunning experience.

231
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:06,054
So we've actually held back deliberately.

232
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:13,197
Josh Good would like to know what type of level design influences did the team pull from?

233
00:17:13,257 --> 00:17:16,738
They've heard a lot of comparisons to Donkey Kong Country, Tropical Freeze,

234
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,980
brought up due to Impossible Lair's use of contextualizing platforms.

235
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:27,563
Yeah, so that was definitely an influence and we kind of looked at all the 3D platformers that

236
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:33,505
were out there at the time like Rayman and also back to games that we worked on in the past like

237
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,366
DKC and we tried to kind of...

238
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:41,769
pick the bits that we liked from those and say how would that influence our design of the game and

239
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,652
how would we approach, you know, the same problems that they set up, how would we

240
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:53,615
take an approach on that. So that was just one of the things we've done which we'll see later is

241
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:57,857
when you play each of the levels here it's actually got an alternate state.

242
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:00,982
There's a slight spoiler but it's a big one.

243
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:05,925
So you'll play through a level once and then you'll re-encounter it.

244
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:08,347
You'll be at some kind of transformation you'll make to that level

245
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:12,929
where you'll be able to place it underwater or maybe it's inverted in a different way.

246
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:14,330
And essentially it's a different level but...

247
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,370
From the player's perspective, it's had something different done to it.

248
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,313
So, yeah, so having that, again, that's another twist

249
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:28,436
on what the expected norm is on 2D platformers.

250
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:31,899
So you go back into a level and you see the familiar bits,

251
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:33,379
but it's all really quite a bit different.

252
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:34,580
It is like playing a new level.

253
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,263
So there's 20 base levels and they are all got alternate states.

254
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:40,863
It's fun, we talked about remixing earlier.

255
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:45,666
I think that may have been before the show, but the remix, like kind of the remix factor,

256
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:49,028
you know, you as devs remix your own work and then speedrunners are further remixing

257
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,549
your work for sort of the purpose of other people's entertainment.

258
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,671
That's right, it's very much like that.

259
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:58,273
We know, I look at the stuff that Dave's doing here and he's playing a lot of these levels

260
00:18:58,313 --> 00:19:00,995
completely out of sequence because that's...

261
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:04,217
It's a game that's both fast but also fun to watch.

262
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:09,099
And it is like somebody's taking your game and it's a bit like they've kind of put it on the decks

263
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,161
and they've given it a bit of a remix and they've kind of gone,

264
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:16,503
actually, the way you set it up, that wasn't as fun as doing it like this.

265
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:18,624
And, you know, it's almost like a meta game.

266
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:21,286
The Speed Ring is like a meta game on top of everything else.

267
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:26,028
I kind of almost think of it as like, you know, when you're in a city

268
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:29,790
and you know all the streets and lanes and the sidewalks and then...

269
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:35,688
All of a sudden, you know, there's an elite group of people who can get really up high on the top,

270
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:41,672
and these people who do parkour can navigate the city in a completely different way.

271
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:46,075
And that's what we're seeing here, is that Dave's now on a place where he probably didn't expect

272
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:53,600
anybody to go up and stand. And yeah, it's quite amazing the kind of things people are doing.

273
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,660
Dave, I know you're involved with GDQ. The next time you do GDQ, please make

274
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,661
shouting parkour, parkour, parkour, parkour, parkour, a donation tier for one of your runs.

275
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:04,941
You got it.

276
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:12,663
Dave, we do have a question from chat for you from Kyle LeClair. Are there any specific games

277
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:16,544
or genres that you feel are a bit difficult when it comes to speedrunning but you'd like to see

278
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:16,864
more of?

279
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,411
Oh, anything in particular that I would like to see that is difficult?

280
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:25,352
So like I kind of said this in the intro, but like I'm into so many different

281
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:28,453
genres of speedrunning, all for different reasons.

282
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:33,394
Like I love platformers because it's highly execution based.

283
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:38,295
And, you know, I guess not a whole lot of like randomness.

284
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:42,997
But I also speedrun long form RPGs, you know, like the 100 hour RPGs

285
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:44,197
that you can beat in a single sitting.

286
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:45,117
Mm hmm.

287
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:46,278
And it.

288
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:54,910
It requires different kinds of skills, and that's what I like about it.

289
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:58,276
But for genres that I feel like need more...

290
00:20:58,296 --> 00:20:58,477
Hmm...

291
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:11,183
I am actually not entirely sure because you find that speedrunning communities sort of pop up within

292
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:16,732
all genres. Like what I like to say is, you know, if anybody comes in chat and ever asks like,

293
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:18,134
hey, um

294
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,888
Is there a speedrun of this game?

295
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:23,729
My answer is like, well, can you beat it?

296
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,630
Because if you can beat it, there is a speedrun of it.

297
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,932
And one thing you really like to see is,

298
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:35,094
you know, devs like Playtonic, where like they will leave in things for,

299
00:21:35,414 --> 00:21:37,715
you know, they're like, hey, speedrunners might find this useful.

300
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:41,877
That is super appreciated because there are entire communities

301
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,438
that will form around these styles of play.

302
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,520
And yeah, it's just super appreciated.

303
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:52,503
Yeah, I do recall that when I did an interview with some devs,

304
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:54,924
like, I believe it was Ryan Clark.

305
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:59,465
I could be wrong. It was him or the Axiom Verge, Thomas Happ.

306
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:03,147
There was talk about how, you know, working with speedrunners helps them do

307
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:06,688
some bug testing, but also it led to them leaving in things

308
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:09,408
like in-game timers to help runners sort of do

309
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:12,629
run their timers and modify their timers based on the need in the game.

310
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:15,490
But that was sort of the extent of what I heard for like, oh, how can devs

311
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,711
help speedrunners? And the runners are just like, uh...

312
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:23,953
Bubbles Del Fuego had a great comment yesterday which is like, you know, it's sort of like you can't say what makes a game good for speedrunning.

313
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:26,394
It's like saying, how do you make a good movie? You just make a good movie.

314
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:28,815
Which I thought was helpful.

315
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:40,499
Real quick, Michael Gibbs in chat would like to know, Chris, how is your experience developing Yooka-Laylee different from that of Donkey Kong Country, but with modern development tools?

316
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:43,420
Oh yeah, that's a great question because...

317
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:49,632
I think one of the few things I noticed, one of them is we're building with an engine this time,

318
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:55,997
so we're using the Unity engine here, and one of the things we had was, whereas back in Donkey Kong

319
00:22:56,017 --> 00:23:02,722
Country era, you know, a lot of the work was done by the engineer who was decoding systems and

320
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:10,468
puzzles and enemies, whereas there was a limited amount of tooling for the designers, whereas now

321
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:12,010
a lot of the game is built from

322
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,512
designers, so we've got a design team who put together all these levels,

323
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:20,614
and we kind of built the component parts for them to do that.

324
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:24,216
So, you know, whereas a lot of it relied on, you know,

325
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:27,358
and the last phase of development was, used to be just solely on

326
00:23:28,478 --> 00:23:32,681
Engineers and everybody else could go home and we'd just be there trying to fix everything.

327
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:38,325
Now it's actually the design team who are actually fixing as much as the engineering team.

328
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:42,448
So they're going in and fixing bugs and changing things around,

329
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:46,391
or sometimes they'll move things around just to stop a bug from happening.

330
00:23:46,831 --> 00:23:51,734
But that's been great from putting so much pressure on the engineering team.

331
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:55,839
It's also meant that because they have hands-on time with development,

332
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:59,664
they can iterate with things so much quicker than having to go back and forth to an engineer and go,

333
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:02,187
how can you do this here? Can you do this? Can you change this?

334
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:04,689
And they can make those changes themselves now.

335
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,135
Dave, you're doing actually something interesting here that I wanted to highlight,

336
00:24:09,175 --> 00:24:12,218
which is that speedrunning isn't just, you know, breaking the game, it is also...

337
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:26,832
Knowing the timing of how some of these games work like platformers, having it down to a T so that you can sort of do what we're watching now, which is just, this would be beautiful ukulele gameplay, even if you weren't ground stomping onto ledges back in the overworld.

338
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:37,457
Um, how do you sort of feel as a runner about sort of like the two different kinds of techniques, you know, breaking it, you know, looking for those exploits and versus just practicing sort of these, these moments in order to optimize your run.

339
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:43,259
Yeah, so like, um, I kind of unintentionally duped there, but you know, we get to hear more of the awesome song.

340
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:50,446
Um, so, I, the one thing that I really like about Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Era's speedrun is, uh,

341
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:54,109
you know, like, like you said, there are the mixtures of, uh,

342
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,533
like the, the platforming elements where it's just pure movement and figuring out, like,

343
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:01,876
okay, how do you utilize the enemy placement and whatnot?

344
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:05,780
Like, cause all of the enemy placement is very deliberate to be able to, uh,

345
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:12,519
You know, to do some of these quick movements and I'm sorry.

346
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:13,660
What was the original question?

347
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,241
Like, how do I balance?

348
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:18,523
How do you feel about, like, you know, sort of the two skills you have to master,

349
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:22,446
you know, finding exploits and also mastering Twitch, these Twitch skills?

350
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:26,389
Oh, yeah. Like, you know, we sort of talked about this in the pre-show,

351
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:31,533
but like I love discovering what is capable within the software.

352
00:25:31,553 --> 00:25:34,835
Like it's almost like discovering like the new laws of the universe.

353
00:25:35,996 --> 00:25:36,276
So like.

354
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:41,204
Like, that was the thing that fascinated me with speedrunning at the beginning.

355
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:47,749
Wasn't so much the moment-to-moment platforming, but just like, discovering like, you know,

356
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:50,351
some of the crazy glitches that can be achieved within the software.

357
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:56,015
So it sort of stemmed from the love of that, and then when you get into the actual practice of

358
00:25:56,275 --> 00:26:00,178
speedrunning, you get kind of addicted to like the fluid movement and whatnot.

359
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:03,400
And yeah, so honestly, it's sort of like a 50-50.

360
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:13,480
But yeah, to me, that's what makes an awesome speed game is it is conceptually awesome,

361
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:20,385
whether it be with strategies or glitches, and then just mechanically it is fluid and

362
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:25,628
just feels good to play. Before I get back to questions from chat, Chris, I have a question

363
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:32,012
for you. Something I've noticed watching the parts of speedruns, especially in this game where

364
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:40,101
Players are doing things a little more conventionally, is that how often they will deliberately take damage from enemies,

365
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:47,107
which are supposed to be a punishment, they're supposed to slow down the flow of a run and work against the ways that you want players to navigate a space.

366
00:26:47,427 --> 00:26:53,372
But for runners, they're a way to cancel frames, they're a way to get past a certain point efficiently,

367
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:58,075
without having to wait for an enemy cycle to clear, an animation cycle, excuse me.

368
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:08,154
What are your thoughts about that, watching? I mean, like, I know it's sort of your own philosophy that any way players get through levels is good, but, um, I'm curious about your thoughts watching them sort of go against your design, your core design.

369
00:27:08,692 --> 00:27:08,912
rules.

370
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:38,436
and she's flying around and you've got an opportunity to try and catch her,

371
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:43,698
which is a feature we added to try and give some kind of panic in the player,

372
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:45,638
because you've then got to make a strategy choice.

373
00:27:45,658 --> 00:27:49,459
You've got to decide, do I carry on with Yuka and maybe find a bell

374
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,400
in which I can use to regain Lely,

375
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,521
or do I risk trying to chase after Lely and try and pick her back up again?

376
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:57,241
And so...

377
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,752
You can take a hit, lose Leli, and then carry on.

378
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:05,055
So you can go, in that sense, you can barge your way through something.

379
00:28:05,396 --> 00:28:10,039
If you're confident enough in what the next steps are, you can do something like that.

380
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,341
Can I also touch on that a little bit?

381
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:12,721
Sure.

382
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:13,662
Like the whole damage boosting?

383
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:18,626
But first, I actually wanted to ask, Chris, was this known about that you could do this here to

384
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:20,468
get up there like that?

385
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:26,999
I don't know that that was, but it looks like if we did, we would definitely have left that in.

386
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:34,146
But that's an interesting one, that's a side effect of what you've done there is there's a drawbridge that comes up there, but you've...

387
00:28:35,107 --> 00:28:42,511
As you're approaching, going over the drawbridge, you've turned around, fired the thing from your mouth onto the switch,

388
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:47,775
which has triggered the switch, and because the drawbridge is made from a physics object in the game,

389
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:52,358
then you're able to stand on the end of the drawbridge as it lifted up,

390
00:28:52,858 --> 00:29:00,603
and then by sitting on the top of that drawbridge, you're then able to jump up onto a place where it looks like you wouldn't be able to get to otherwise.

391
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:07,970
Yeah, so like I guess I should explain, uh, the there are secret exits in some of these levels,

392
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,332
and that's how you're supposed to get some of these overworld bees is find the secret exit

393
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:16,494
within a level, except we're actually not going to touch a single secret exit, unfortunately,

394
00:29:16,814 --> 00:29:21,096
but they are fun to find. But going back to what we were saying about damage boosting,

395
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:26,098
that's one thing I really like about the categories of this game is, uh,

396
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:31,588
You know, if you're doing 24 B's or 48 B's for, uh, Yooka-Laylee,

397
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:36,849
the impossible layer, uh, you have that many or that much opportunities

398
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:40,050
for damage boosting within the impossible layer to kind of just like,

399
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,211
you know, go past all the hazards and whatnot and not really care

400
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:45,231
because you have many hits to deal with.

401
00:29:45,891 --> 00:29:51,593
Um, I like 24 B's in particular because it becomes a big risk reward of, uh,

402
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,219
Like, do you want to go for damage boosts?

403
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,182
Or do you want to save bees for the end?

404
00:29:57,622 --> 00:30:01,365
Also, this is a very cool little glitch that we have here

405
00:30:01,405 --> 00:30:02,826
where we're gonna do another air swim.

406
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:05,868
Gonna get out of bounds and uh...

407
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:12,978
There are a lot of death barriers though, so I kind of need to swim out far here.

408
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:17,804
And I'm swimming in a very particular manner to avoid all of the death barriers.

409
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:23,651
I use these kind of lines on my left side to kind of gauge how far I am before I start

410
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:25,453
turning inwards towards the level.

411
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,012
But yeah, this one's really cool. I like this air swim.

412
00:30:29,573 --> 00:30:33,055
I mean, these must take a lot of trial and error to find,

413
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:35,877
because like you said, if you go to the wrong place,

414
00:30:36,357 --> 00:30:37,478
then you might just die.

415
00:30:38,758 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah, you need to like figure out how to navigate all around it.

416
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,822
And yeah, it's definitely trial and error to it.

417
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:47,284
And then like coming up with visual cues when you're like seemingly in the void.

418
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:47,384
Yeah.

419
00:30:50,275 --> 00:30:54,717
I will say, as an observer of this, I love how whenever Dave exits the level,

420
00:30:55,337 --> 00:31:00,579
A, I like suddenly get an appreciation for like Yooka's animation, his swimming animation,

421
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,641
like because there's nothing but his little shimmying body, and also some of the background

422
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:07,502
assets, you know, seeing how they're staged in a 2D game like this with this 3D.

423
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:11,510
I'm like, oh, that's so pretty, and like in a way I couldn't see before.

424
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,752
So that's just a peanut gallery comment for sure.

425
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:19,715
Chris, a question from Josh Good. Hey, Josh.

426
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:21,597
Loved having you in our run yesterday too.

427
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:26,020
Did the team's engineers end up creating any custom tools for art and design,

428
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,762
i.e. was there a custom pipeline for managing game models, textures, etc.?

429
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:39,016
I guess we rely a lot on the Unity engine but we built on top of that so from the designer side of

430
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:45,482
things they use a visual scripting tool which we use NodeCanvas for that but we also built

431
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:50,346
upon NodeCanvas so we did that in the first game we built upon it again in this one

432
00:31:50,746 --> 00:31:53,248
when we have our own custom nodes and

433
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:56,771
Basically, the things that they need to do a lot,

434
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,373
and often we'll go and build something custom for that.

435
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:03,636
So we have that running as well as standard code as well.

436
00:32:05,177 --> 00:32:07,379
That makes sense.

437
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,281
Kyle LeClair would like to say that they find it interesting

438
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:12,603
that a good chunk of early cheat codes were tools

439
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:15,225
used for playtesting purposes to help make things easier,

440
00:32:15,245 --> 00:32:16,266
and they were left in afterwards.

441
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:18,888
And now developers leave in bugs

442
00:32:19,348 --> 00:32:22,210
instead of making it more challenging for speedrunners to conquer.

443
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:27,598
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I mean, I think there's been yeah, there probably have been games where people have left in

444
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:31,040
Skip codes and all sorts of things by mistake. Yeah

445
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:35,003
Easily done probably from I don't know if you remember anything from rare

446
00:32:35,043 --> 00:32:39,806
I do recall that I think I think donkey kong country had some kind of I forget if it was only accessible through um

447
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:42,710
you know, game gear and those old cheat tools.

448
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:48,494
I seem to remember, maybe the first version, I think it was a very early NES game that

449
00:32:49,494 --> 00:32:54,877
Captain Skyhawk, I think, had a cheat code left in where you could maybe select the level.

450
00:32:55,518 --> 00:32:58,640
If I recall correctly, it may have only been the first version. Of course,

451
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,322
then you couldn't update things online, but there would be a subsequent ROM that came out.

452
00:33:02,822 --> 00:33:07,705
Yeah, I do recall, I recall at a certain point, because I grew up in the Game Boy era,

453
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:11,156
when those codes were, you know, it's like, Oh, we're going to give them to players.

454
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:13,457
Cause that's how you, once you beat the level or in the code, that's how you

455
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:17,178
can get back to that level if you die from the early game boy era and the

456
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,879
save states were implemented.

457
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,060
But yeah, I Kyle, I appreciate your comment, like linking, you know,

458
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,022
those two little weird oddities of, of, of game development history.

459
00:33:28,822 --> 00:33:30,763
Dave, would you be able to update us on where you're

460
00:33:30,783 --> 00:33:32,003
heading next and what we should expect?

461
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:38,162
Yeah, so you kind of see me constantly fast traveling back to chapters one and two.

462
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:42,665
This is because since we actually never use any of the traditional paywalls,

463
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:48,809
the areas of the world map don't open up on my map. So I actually only have fast travel for

464
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:53,251
chapters one and two throughout the game. So I constantly need to re-reference chapters one and

465
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:53,512
two. Um,

466
00:33:54,961 --> 00:34:03,384
But back in the Chapter 17 area, we talk to a frog that opens up the alternate version of Chapter 1, which I actually thought that was pretty cool.

467
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:07,826
So, like, you get introduced to alternate chapters, I believe, in Chapter 3.

468
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:18,230
And, um, just the fact that the first chapter's alternate version is unlocked towards, like, the later parts of the game,

469
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,971
I thought that was really cool, because you're kind of left wondering throughout the entire game, like,

470
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:26,237
I'm going to be doing a video on how to get this alternate chapter 1.

471
00:34:27,638 --> 00:34:30,499
And then you're just rewarded at the end of the game, or end-ish part.

472
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,501
But yeah, so we've... I believe we're at 13 Bs now.

473
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:37,342
This is going to be our 14th one that we're getting.

474
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,663
So we're about halfway there.

475
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:45,466
After that, I was just going to chip in.

476
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:49,188
I love that when we're calmly discussing the rules of these games,

477
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:50,608
we've been so...

478
00:34:51,328 --> 00:34:53,989
So normally saying, oh, we're going to gather some bees today.

479
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:55,790
Like it's a perfectly normal thing.

480
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,292
Oh, you know, we talked to a frog back there and he did this for us.

481
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:04,174
Yes, because talking to frog is something we all do in our everyday lives.

482
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:06,615
And if you if you are talking to frogs, I don't object.

483
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:08,716
Just, you know, maybe let the rest of us know.

484
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:09,717
I mean, what are their secrets?

485
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:10,957
Do they know things? Let's find out.

486
00:35:12,998 --> 00:35:14,079
Chris, do you have any?

487
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,940
This is just a question for me, you know, watching Dave

488
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,301
like sort of get through this part of the run.

489
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:28,457
As an engineer, are there any observations you've had about this process and some of the exploits we've seen about how they intersect with your work?

490
00:35:28,477 --> 00:35:34,860
Yeah, I mean, one of the things I see a lot is Dave using the ground pound jump.

491
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,503
So you can, when you do a buddy slam, we call it, which is like a ground pound move,

492
00:35:41,324 --> 00:35:44,726
when you hit the ground, you can trigger into the fast roll.

493
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:47,267
And we added that move in, but when...

494
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:54,203
What we didn't realize actually until a few weeks after we put it in, is that because when you're in a roll you can jump,

495
00:35:54,664 --> 00:35:58,026
then the consequence is you ground pound, you go into a very fast roll,

496
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:03,569
and you can also press jump at the same time, and then you'll actually have a very large and fast

497
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:08,732
forwards jump. And Dave uses that quite a lot. You'll see him ground pound, jump, and get like

498
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:14,436
there's a stair, he had a great boost of speed, and he can use that. Although we don't actually rely on that.

499
00:36:14,816 --> 00:36:19,680
being used I don't think in any of the areas of the game or hardly any. It's something that players

500
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,465
can, we left it in and because one of the things we thought oh this is really cool it just seemed

501
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:29,269
a shame to take it out and also it wouldn't make sense to take it out because because you can jump

502
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:35,394
from a roll and it wouldn't make sense to you to not be able to jump at that point so it felt like

503
00:36:35,414 --> 00:36:36,255
we had to leave that in.

504
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:48,324
Yeah, I think it's interesting that there's sort of an upper boundary for even though your movement system is capable, your traversal system is capable of such speeds, but the level design isn't built around it, versus if you compare to games like Celeste.

505
00:36:49,084 --> 00:37:02,029
I don't know much about Celeste speedruns, but I do know that just playing that game as a normal player was, oh my goodness, like, trying to achieve some of the physical skills needed to finish that game was, it was something else.

506
00:37:03,532 --> 00:37:08,034
Yeah, I love that you brought up Celeste because I am actually I have had I have like you know

507
00:37:08,214 --> 00:37:13,897
maybe 2000 hours like I I've speedrun Celeste a lot and that is another game where like

508
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:21,166
I just the casual play is so different than than the speedrun but yeah like it's designed the

509
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:27,651
entire way for you to play both ways. But for Yooka, the whole like it was really cool in like

510
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:31,833
the early days of speedrunning this game when it first came out because like you know we didn't

511
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:39,798
even know about the buddy slam jump roll or like you know using the buddy slam to get high speeds

512
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:41,760
and then then it was like

513
00:37:42,664 --> 00:37:53,347
So like if you buddy slam and you just continue to just normal roll and you don't chain jumps in with it, you will actually kind of default to a sort of slower speed.

514
00:37:53,367 --> 00:38:07,810
So like just just the act of like discovering the fact that you need to chain jumps with the the buddy slam roll and like just sort of how that that reroutes your muscle memory for the levels and whatnot.

515
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,251
It was a really cool process to to practice it and get down.

516
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:13,914
That makes sense.

517
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:14,835
That makes sense.

518
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:18,437
We're gonna dive, we're gonna scroll back through chat for a question from Matt Hatchet.

519
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:24,041
This may be a little bit outside your purview Chris, but, did Playtonic have any particular

520
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:25,702
inspiration for Capital B?

521
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:31,406
He gives Matt serious guru vibes, I assume that he's from Despicable Me.

522
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:36,862
So, um, that character's created by Steve Mayles, who also created Banjo-Kazooie.

523
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:41,027
So, um, he's got a pedigree of creating a great set of characters.

524
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:44,491
So, um, I don't know what was in Steve's mind when he created him.

525
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:50,474
and maybe you've been watching too much of that film but I think it was more that he wanted to

526
00:38:50,514 --> 00:38:57,982
create something that was intimidating and was obviously a bee and so I think you know that was

527
00:38:58,022 --> 00:39:03,649
his intent. There's also the sense that well from the last game Capital B was a kind of a large

528
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:11,433
It was a big boss in the sense that he's big, and he's a boss, but he's also a boss in terms of cooperation as well as a boss in terms of games.

529
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:13,855
So he had to fit all those ideas into one.

530
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:17,057
So yeah, that's how that came together.

531
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:20,058
But I don't know exactly where the source of his inspiration was.

532
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:26,002
Gotcha. I assume Illumination will not come calling about any particular link.

533
00:39:27,623 --> 00:39:29,524
Chris Joshgood is back with another question.

534
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:33,546
What was the weirdest or most intriguing bug that the team encountered during development?

535
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:35,385
Oh, um...

536
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:38,825
I think we're probably seeing some of them today.

537
00:39:40,826 --> 00:39:44,548
Some of these ones where you jump and you get propelled to the other side of the map

538
00:39:44,688 --> 00:39:50,050
and then you're suddenly underwater, those ones are pretty weird.

539
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:57,674
I think those ones, anything like that where there's physics involved, those can be strange

540
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:03,477
ones. If there's genuine bugs, they're often the ones that are trickiest to work out because

541
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:05,978
there's some weird physics interaction as there's two...

542
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:10,304
Objects that have been placed too close together and you get stuck between them or something

543
00:40:10,964 --> 00:40:14,487
Um, so yeah, those those are the kind of weirdest ones that I can remember

544
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:19,110
Um, uh for my part, uh, chris

545
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:24,374
I would like to ask kind of kind of a question with the engineer games engineering and aesthetics kind of lineup

546
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:29,258
Um, both ukulele games have this incredibly polished sort of very cute

547
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:34,341
Uh aesthetic, um that that goes hand in hand with you know, this very precise

548
00:40:35,784 --> 00:40:40,587
2D platforming, 3D for the last game, 2D for this one.

549
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:47,332
As an engineer, while the art team is working on these very pleasant and good-feeling animations and sound effects,

550
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:56,118
what is sort of your role in making the game feel, the interactions you have on the controller, sort of line up with this sensation?

551
00:40:56,338 --> 00:41:01,721
Because I know that's sort of a thing that crops up, especially when designing movement or jump reactions, etc.

552
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:06,453
Yeah there's a lot of things that go on in terms of, you know, I'm working with a team of people

553
00:41:06,493 --> 00:41:11,634
who is probably, so we've got an artist and a designer as well and we'll work together

554
00:41:11,654 --> 00:41:17,316
to determine what the correct visual is and sometimes we'll put something in and it will

555
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:22,717
look good but it won't play good. So you might have, you can, I mean the great example of this,

556
00:41:22,777 --> 00:41:28,618
common example of this is if you, when you jump it makes sense from a pure animation purpose that

557
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:32,479
you would say, oh well he'll squat down first then he'll jump but obviously from a

558
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:38,624
If player experience point of view, if your character had to wait before they took off,

559
00:41:38,984 --> 00:41:40,165
then that would be quite frustrating.

560
00:41:40,926 --> 00:41:42,707
It might look great because they'd be crouched down,

561
00:41:43,008 --> 00:41:45,269
but for this kind of game, it would be quite frustrating.

562
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:46,631
So you have to jump immediately,

563
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:48,372
which means you kind of have to do...

564
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:55,117
You might have to modify the animation to make it look like he is coming from a compressed

565
00:41:55,297 --> 00:41:58,978
position rather than actually he has been coming from a compressed position.

566
00:41:59,578 --> 00:42:03,599
So that's one example, but there's a lot of those kind of little things where you have

567
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:09,340
to tweak the way you do the animation because it's just better for the player.

568
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,921
And what's interesting is there might be another game where, you know, the crouching is a good

569
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:18,222
mechanic, you know, but it's just not a fast game where you're trying to aim where you're

570
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:18,902
jumping or something.

571
00:42:18,962 --> 00:42:19,082
But.

572
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:24,226
But that's where the animation and the gameplay might line up more, but not for this game.

573
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:30,993
Let me see here. Folks in chat, we are still taking your questions and comments.

574
00:42:31,053 --> 00:42:35,137
If you'd like to know more about breaking games, if you'd like to know more about making games,

575
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:38,901
we have two folks here who are excellent at each of those.

576
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:44,120
Let me see, what do I want to know more about?

577
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,529
Uh, Dave is there, or uh, not Dave, sorry, Chris, is there anything about our current

578
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,654
uh, state of the run that has you, uh...

579
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:54,068
Is there anything you're sort of going to be taking back to the office and going,

580
00:42:54,148 --> 00:42:56,569
oh my God, I didn't fully realize this, but after this run.

581
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,630
This level is interesting.

582
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,951
I mean, I love the music on this level.

583
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:01,033
It's one of my favorite pieces of music.

584
00:43:01,293 --> 00:43:04,856
But the thing about this level is it's actually really difficult.

585
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,417
Well, I guess that's through all of them.

586
00:43:06,657 --> 00:43:10,079
But this one in particular is because it throws at you

587
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:15,323
a lot of these little red minions or little minions characters, which are

588
00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:17,105
you can't really see them here.

589
00:43:17,145 --> 00:43:19,566
But when you play it normally, they're just.

590
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,691
It seems to be an endless number of them always coming towards you.

591
00:43:23,452 --> 00:43:25,373
But Dave's just going so fast, he's just...

592
00:43:25,993 --> 00:43:29,874
He's blitzing through and they're not even getting a chance to catch up.

593
00:43:30,315 --> 00:43:31,655
So you can hardly see any.

594
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:32,816
And there's one there actually.

595
00:43:33,216 --> 00:43:33,796
No, I got him!

596
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:36,857
So those ones, yeah.

597
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:40,259
And those characters you can't roll into, the reason they're challenging,

598
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:42,300
because they've got big chompy mouths.

599
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,722
You have to jump on them or hit them from the behind.

600
00:43:48,267 --> 00:43:53,668
And I just want to say it's kind of funny that, you know, this level is fairly difficult because

601
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:58,169
it pays homage to Donkey Kong Country 2 because it's called Wild Webwoods

602
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:02,970
and Webwoods in DKC2 is a notoriously difficult stage.

603
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:07,971
I also speed ran Donkey Kong Country 2 for a hot minute.

604
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:14,593
It's my favorite game in the trilogy and yeah, it's true to the Webwoods name.

605
00:44:16,914 --> 00:44:21,615
um dave uh michael gibbs would like to know uh what is the most challenging here dave's gonna do

606
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:27,637
something he's just i think he's trying to get that um there's a b that's in the overworld he's

607
00:44:27,657 --> 00:44:34,319
trying he's trying to get it by throwing a bomb across let's see it that which is normally you'd

608
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:38,900
have to get there via the secret exit i think but he's trying to just do it by throwing this bomb

609
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,501
across let's see if you can do it he's probably gonna be able to who am i kidding there we go

610
00:44:43,802 --> 00:44:45,882
that's semi-precise but we'll end up getting it

611
00:44:47,515 --> 00:45:00,929
Um, before I get back to Michael's question, I just want to say something I've been paying attention to this run is how each of the bees have like a slightly different art model and how they live. I think we saw lovely and lively be an, you know,

612
00:45:01,977 --> 00:45:05,780
variation on Leslie Anne, you know, one of the, that's from a name more common in the UK.

613
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,123
Yeah, so the names of the, so the bees that you collect, they're actually named,

614
00:45:10,603 --> 00:45:15,486
there's, of the 48, there's some of them are the dev team, and some of them are,

615
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:20,970
actually some of them we've ran in competition for people to become part of the game, and they

616
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:24,773
could become a bee, so I think there's a three or six, I can't remember the exact number.

617
00:45:25,153 --> 00:45:32,058
of people who follow us on Twitter and we were able to, they entered the competition and

618
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:41,185
they were able to get chosen to be in the game. So that was... As bees. As bees, yeah. Yeah. We're

619
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:44,608
gonna get back to Michael Gibbs question. Dave, what is the most challenging exploit in any game

620
00:45:44,628 --> 00:45:45,268
that you've performed?

621
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,631
Oh, what is the most challenge?

622
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:48,611
Oh, OK.

623
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:52,033
Uh, are we going to have to stop the run and go play a whole other game?

624
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:52,933
So you can demonstrate?

625
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:54,354
I'm going to have to like, think about that.

626
00:45:54,394 --> 00:45:58,775
But OK, so one of the things that I like to tell people about is like, OK,

627
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:03,277
it's a good game like Final Fantasy seven, a game where you think

628
00:46:03,878 --> 00:46:05,878
the fights you get into are random.

629
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,090
But like, what if I told you they weren't actually random?

630
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:16,272
And that is manipulated across the entire seven and a half hours of the run.

631
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:23,014
And it's based on perfect movement by walking or running, because you can walk or run steps,

632
00:46:23,154 --> 00:46:25,495
and it affects your danger value differently.

633
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:32,877
So like, needing to have perfect movement for seven and a half hours is...

634
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:37,202
Pretty challenging. Like, I love the game-long manipulations.

635
00:46:37,803 --> 00:46:41,247
Uh, those are pretty challenging and, uh, very satisfying to hold.

636
00:46:41,908 --> 00:46:49,717
Um, but, and that's just one aspect of it, where, like, we use it to so, like, to such an extent

637
00:46:50,118 --> 00:46:53,882
that it's kind of hard to explain. But, like, let's say you have...

638
00:46:54,662 --> 00:47:01,325
a fight that's supposed to initiate on a field, but if you were to initiate a quote-unquote

639
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:07,527
random encounter on the exact frame in which that that story fight happens, the game kind

640
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:14,969
of freaks out and cancels both fights out. So like if you force random encounters on exact frames

641
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:22,152
running at a 30 fps game, you can do other skips with it. Like just that level of precision with

642
00:47:23,052 --> 00:47:26,716
Certain glitches and skips is really... that's what I like.

643
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:30,920
It's also interesting because those are not, you talk about precision and all that,

644
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,845
and those are not games where movement precision is normally a skill that the developers are

645
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:40,350
trying to orient around, but you know, that's what speedrunning does, changes up the skills.

646
00:47:42,413 --> 00:47:44,635
Dave, follow up question on that before I go back to chat.

647
00:47:45,355 --> 00:47:49,117
Are there any particular, I know there's a lot of like RNG sort of exploits,

648
00:47:49,137 --> 00:47:51,618
you know, where you're sort of hoping that the game poops out the right number

649
00:47:52,398 --> 00:47:56,080
in order for you to get something done at a record time, otherwise you have to do a reset or try to

650
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,522
re-trigger the thing. Are there any of those that stand out to you in the games you run?

651
00:48:02,043 --> 00:48:05,104
Yeah, so particularly in like RPG speed runs,

652
00:48:06,662 --> 00:48:08,563
You know, that's that's the whole name of the game.

653
00:48:09,244 --> 00:48:14,107
I like to say that RNG is not the main decider.

654
00:48:14,627 --> 00:48:18,450
Like RNG kind of opens the door, but execution allows you to walk through it,

655
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:19,371
is what I like to say.

656
00:48:21,052 --> 00:48:24,535
So things like damage rolls or if there's like certain drops

657
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:27,877
that are certain percentages or like, oh, I need this.

658
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:32,694
person to target this character that I have and it's a one third chance.

659
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,955
I will say, though, in Yooka-Laylee, it is very nice because

660
00:48:37,535 --> 00:48:40,256
and I think Chris can kind of talk about this a little bit more, but like

661
00:48:40,997 --> 00:48:45,899
the actors and stuff, they sort of load in when you get closer to them.

662
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:48,139
So like it's a very consistent game

663
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,921
and all of the the movements are like the same and predictable.

664
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:57,043
And it's really nice for a platformer to have minimal RNG.

665
00:48:58,842 --> 00:49:11,319
Yeah that's right, so we tried to make it, I think we were talking earlier, so that when you play you can play through and there's a kind of certain smoothness and if you know the exact timing you can get through first time. In order to do that it means that

666
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:17,777
Those things have to be ready in that pattern when you encounter them and so like some of them

667
00:49:17,797 --> 00:49:21,579
will activate if there's a set of them that you need to get through in a particular sequence

668
00:49:21,979 --> 00:49:25,701
that set when the first one comes on screen that whole set will activate with those

669
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:29,663
um otherwise it's generally when they come on screen but if you

670
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:34,293
If you didn't do that, or you didn't have a whole level-based synchronicity,

671
00:49:34,673 --> 00:49:39,377
then it would be a kind of weird experience, because every time you play it, it would be

672
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:44,981
different, and so it wouldn't be consistent. And so we wanted it to be consistent, and feel like,

673
00:49:45,141 --> 00:49:49,765
oh, I can just one more go, and I can get that done. Otherwise, if it's random, you just feel

674
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:53,147
like you're not quite sure whether, you know, one time it was more difficult than another,

675
00:49:53,187 --> 00:49:55,970
it doesn't make sense. Gotcha.

676
00:49:56,871 --> 00:50:02,756
Tian Gerber would like to say in chat that they like the direction that Playtonic took

677
00:50:03,036 --> 00:50:04,898
in The Impossible Lair compared to the original game.

678
00:50:05,538 --> 00:50:08,100
They're a sucker for Donkey Kong Country type platformers.

679
00:50:08,821 --> 00:50:12,764
And they would like to ask if you're looking at any other genres or sub-genres for sequels

680
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:15,507
and spin-offs, but as far as I know you haven't announced anything yet.

681
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:20,391
So I'll tweak the question to be Chris, is there another genre of game from either your

682
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,995
past dev experience or a genre you particularly enjoy playing yourself?

683
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,741
that you'd love to play around in, hypothetically.

684
00:50:27,841 --> 00:50:30,823
We don't need to, you know, pretend that we're confirming anything here.

685
00:50:31,244 --> 00:50:33,966
Yeah, I mean, I suppose there's an...

686
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:37,710
I mean, I've always been a fan of platformer games anyway,

687
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:42,194
3D and 2D, so that's kind of always a draw for me.

688
00:50:42,274 --> 00:50:44,516
But I mean, I think there's no...

689
00:50:44,536 --> 00:50:47,378
I wouldn't say there's any particular area we'd not go into.

690
00:50:47,398 --> 00:50:51,762
I mean, we're not probably going to bring out a gritty shooter next.

691
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,443
I wouldn't have thought.

692
00:50:55,163 --> 00:50:55,684
Who knows?

693
00:50:56,704 --> 00:50:58,304
Cut to one year from now and I'll be saying

694
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:00,285
yes, gritty shooter

695
00:51:00,765 --> 00:51:02,645
is now released. Ukulele gritty shooter

696
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,666
is now grey-green graphics.

697
00:51:05,446 --> 00:51:06,546
Yeah, that's

698
00:51:07,286 --> 00:51:08,187
that could be next year.

699
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:09,947
No, I think

700
00:51:10,807 --> 00:51:12,568
I mean, I'm kind of happy

701
00:51:12,648 --> 00:51:14,548
on most games, so I think there isn't

702
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:16,489
anyone that we would, in general,

703
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,229
stay away from.

704
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:20,890
So, it could be anything really.

705
00:51:22,438 --> 00:51:26,540
In my, uh, I'll, I'll, I'll, uh, I'll help nudge the question along.

706
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,922
In my, in my, in my past experience, I've gotten to work on 4X strategy games.

707
00:51:31,003 --> 00:51:34,244
And, uh, you know, I would love to work on something in the RTS genre,

708
00:51:34,264 --> 00:51:37,166
maybe because I grew up on those games and some of the stories in those games.

709
00:51:38,086 --> 00:51:39,807
Uh, Dave, you're a speed runner.

710
00:51:39,827 --> 00:51:42,849
If there's any particular game genre you could like contribute to as like,

711
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:45,010
as like working on in some capacity, I don't know what other,

712
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,052
what you do outside of speed running, but, uh, I'm just curious what,

713
00:51:48,112 --> 00:51:50,453
what genre you'd love to work on.

714
00:51:50,473 --> 00:51:51,193
I would like.

715
00:51:52,478 --> 00:52:02,500
Something that's sort of like I've been sort of craving a game like this that molds like a rhythm game, you know, kind of like a guitar hero with maybe

716
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:10,982
Maybe like a a Zelda or a platformer. Um, kind of we're like we're like the battle system

717
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:16,503
I mean like not not sort of like Crypt of the Necrodancer style because I mean that is an amazing game that blends like

718
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:21,464
You know Zelda and uh, uh, like rhythm game aspects, but like I sort of want like

719
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:30,184
I guess maybe like a turn-based combat game that or a platformer that uses like sort of bursts of

720
00:52:31,265 --> 00:52:36,448
rhythm game challenges as its combat. That's sort of like an idea that I've had just like

721
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:45,755
bouncing around in my head. Like, I don't know. It's a good answer. Yeah.

722
00:52:46,462 --> 00:52:50,065
I love how Dave can talk and play this game at this speed.

723
00:52:51,766 --> 00:52:56,510
I can't even play this game at this speed, let alone talk at the same time.

724
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:00,073
That's the secret when I throw questions to Dave, is that I'm trying to see how

725
00:53:01,054 --> 00:53:03,836
much I can make him think and move his hands at the same time.

726
00:53:05,758 --> 00:53:09,001
So far, the answer is mostly pretty well.

727
00:53:11,247 --> 00:53:12,587
Um, let me see here.

728
00:53:13,408 --> 00:53:15,329
Uh, we've got about 20 minutes left in the session,

729
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:17,490
which means we must be coming near the end of the run-ish.

730
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:18,410
Uh...

731
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:23,732
Roger that. So Dave has thankfully confirmed that.

732
00:53:24,253 --> 00:53:26,054
Just a reminder for folks watching,

733
00:53:26,114 --> 00:53:27,954
if you have any more questions for Chris and Dave,

734
00:53:28,515 --> 00:53:30,135
feel free to ask them.

735
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:33,577
Uh, you know, I'd say for any developers in the crowd,

736
00:53:33,597 --> 00:53:35,418
if there's any particular problems you've had

737
00:53:35,438 --> 00:53:38,199
while working on your games and you're curious how Chris would solve them,

738
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,580
throw them at us. I'd love to ask those kinds of questions.

739
00:53:41,315 --> 00:53:44,435
Um, uh, Chris, I have, we can swing back.

740
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:48,416
QA is sort of the, the specter that hangs over, uh, the speed

741
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:51,917
running genres head, because unfortunately sometimes you'll, you'll watch you and go.

742
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:55,518
And I'm sorry to say, sometimes you'll just hear like, Oh, lazy devs are hot.

743
00:53:55,558 --> 00:53:56,258
QA missed that.

744
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:59,438
And even for like the best intentioned runners, you know, sometimes it just slips

745
00:53:59,558 --> 00:54:05,420
out and I've, I've heard it, but like, well, the truth is like, you know, A making

746
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,220
games is already hard.

747
00:54:06,763 --> 00:54:14,166
And B, you know, so many bugs that ship in games are known by the developers and fixes just didn't fit for one reason or another.

748
00:54:14,186 --> 00:54:16,007
Oh, I guess we're going up against Capital Lee.

749
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:20,268
Chris, what are sort of your, like, from a resource management standpoint,

750
00:54:22,269 --> 00:54:27,091
how, with the millions of bugs that can pop up because you are mishmashing code and art and animation together,

751
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:34,514
like, sort of how does Playtonic prioritize bug fixing and how does it sort of manage, you know, what could be like an unmanageable pass?

752
00:54:36,683 --> 00:54:44,286
Yeah, so I mean it is the case that games do ship with bugs that are known and the reason is often

753
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:51,769
that sometimes the impact on most users is quite small. If you think if you've got a load of bugs

754
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:58,352
and you don't generally end up fixing all of them, that's the actual reality. People might think

755
00:54:58,792 --> 00:55:01,074
If you're not a game developer, you may think otherwise and think,

756
00:55:01,314 --> 00:55:02,095
we'll just fix them all.

757
00:55:02,135 --> 00:55:05,678
But to fix them all, your game would be taking months and months longer.

758
00:55:05,698 --> 00:55:09,601
Well, in reality, you don't tend to fix things if they are very,

759
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,663
some of them very minor, obviously.

760
00:55:12,523 --> 00:55:16,807
Sometimes things were, even if they're more significant, if they're...

761
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:21,990
If you have to go to a particularly unusual area or somewhere, nobody will ever go.

762
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:27,493
And as long as it's not a game-breaking experience, then sometimes those are left in.

763
00:55:27,973 --> 00:55:32,055
And, you know, like we talked about before, if they're sometimes left, we'll leave them in

764
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:37,418
if it means the speedrunning community would benefit from them as well.

765
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:43,544
I was trying to make sure that the casual user doesn't encounter them and doesn't feel

766
00:55:43,584 --> 00:55:45,446
that the game is broken as a result.

767
00:55:45,506 --> 00:55:47,488
If that's the case, then we fix it.

768
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:53,094
Otherwise, if somebody feels good as a result of finding a bug, then there's an element

769
00:55:53,114 --> 00:55:54,976
of thinking, well, maybe we should leave this in.

770
00:55:56,563 --> 00:55:59,986
Roger that. I was actually going to follow that up on, because you've been in game development so long,

771
00:56:00,006 --> 00:56:04,429
you've sort of seen the cert requirements for consoles change in so many ways over the years.

772
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,833
And especially with another generation upon us, though, don't feel free to, that's not,

773
00:56:08,873 --> 00:56:11,515
I'm not prying for information about the next consoles if you know anything, but

774
00:56:13,356 --> 00:56:19,241
how have you watched, you know, what companies want out of developers change when it comes to cert?

775
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:23,384
Yeah, I think cert requirements from my perspective seem to have been

776
00:56:24,123 --> 00:56:28,387
kind of loosened off in the sense that maybe there's less and less rules. I think that's just

777
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:33,212
feedback from developers because over the years developers have said, hang on, I've got all these

778
00:56:33,252 --> 00:56:37,937
rules from this platform and all these rules from that platform and so what platform holders have

779
00:56:37,957 --> 00:56:38,958
tried to do is say well...

780
00:56:39,478 --> 00:56:43,199
We want you to develop on our platform. We're going to make it really easy. So we're trying to

781
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:47,560
be trying to minimize them down to the things that are really kind of showstoppery things,

782
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:52,701
things that are bad. And what you'll tend to find is, I don't know if anybody will actually tell

783
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:57,662
you this, but when you go into certification, you know, there might be a certain set of things that

784
00:56:57,702 --> 00:57:03,343
say you will fail on those. The reality is it's kind of like a scales. So sometimes you'll be

785
00:57:03,363 --> 00:57:08,124
able to pass as long as you can, there's certain rules that they will let you break.

786
00:57:09,365 --> 00:57:11,008
if the rest of the game is fine.

787
00:57:12,685 --> 00:57:16,006
That's not something that they may not officially say because it depends.

788
00:57:16,347 --> 00:57:21,788
They'll take a view like we do, which is what's the consumer, what's the effect on the consumer,

789
00:57:21,828 --> 00:57:26,530
and they think, well, actually, it'd be better to have this game now and have this minor little

790
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:30,551
thing, which is an issue, and they'll flag that up for you. And sometimes they'll say,

791
00:57:30,831 --> 00:57:35,332
well, this is an issue, but when you resubmit it, you're going to need to fix it.

792
00:57:35,572 --> 00:57:38,973
So if you have a patch or something, make sure this thing is fixed.

793
00:57:39,963 --> 00:57:53,451
That's really interesting to hear. When I used to work for a mobile game publisher, I sat next to the QA people and I heard, you know, who worked both on our games and a number of other games, and I heard some stories about working with different platforms that sort of line up with that, you know, about what was sort of allowed to go in.

794
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:59,854
But obviously, just like you, that's all got to be anonymized because we don't want to get anyone in trouble.

795
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:00,714
Exactly.

796
00:58:02,749 --> 00:58:09,291
I will say this, I appreciate that the various platform holders of all stripes have done

797
00:58:09,371 --> 00:58:17,854
more and more to use leniency as a way to help more developers ship more fascinating

798
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:18,194
games.

799
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:19,435
Definitely.

800
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:23,036
Not that I would look back at the older game eras and go, oh, like...

801
00:58:23,535 --> 00:58:26,299
They were too strict, like it should have been more accessible.

802
00:58:26,359 --> 00:58:29,103
Like, you know, like you can't just like I definitely can't judge for things

803
00:58:29,123 --> 00:58:31,166
when I was either just a child or not important yet.

804
00:58:31,787 --> 00:58:34,071
In that sense, there are other things you can look back at history

805
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:34,892
and judge people for.

806
00:58:34,952 --> 00:58:36,234
So let's be clear about that.

807
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:39,719
But that's not, you know, game bugs are sort of low priority on the.

808
00:58:40,281 --> 00:58:41,842
historical ethical scale.

809
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:44,803
Kyle LeClair would like to know,

810
00:58:45,363 --> 00:58:50,125
how long did it take you to craft the titular Impossible Lair?

811
00:58:50,406 --> 00:58:53,727
And how did you decide what sections and challenges to include?

812
00:58:54,287 --> 00:58:57,349
That is a great question because the Impossible Lair,

813
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:00,950
I explained the concept and the idea that it's something you can take on at any point.

814
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:03,251
And we wanted it to be, well it has to be...

815
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:09,648
relatively difficult because it's called impossible layer. So the challenge was how do we make it,

816
00:59:10,068 --> 00:59:14,229
how do we, how do you do that, how do you make something that is impossible yet it is possible

817
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:19,651
and that was something we didn't even know. I mean it was kind of right towards the end,

818
00:59:19,691 --> 00:59:22,011
we tried lots of different kind of ideas and

819
00:59:22,752 --> 00:59:32,360
and setups and in the end one of it was kind of looking at some of the harder areas that were in the game and some of the other levels that we decided to take out and we said, well maybe we can build something around those.

820
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:39,165
And so that's how it formed, but we wanted it to be something that felt like it was doable.

821
00:59:39,545 --> 00:59:45,370
And so it's really, it's not like any one section is impossible, is really, really difficult.

822
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:49,673
I mean, you know, exceptionally difficult, but there are, there's a lot of...

823
00:59:50,372 --> 00:59:55,374
difficult sections chained together so you have to know oh this I've got to do this jump and that

824
00:59:55,394 --> 00:59:59,676
jump and that jump so when you're um you know once you've done it hopefully or once you've got half

825
00:59:59,736 --> 01:00:03,498
part way through and you think oh I failed here hopefully you can think oh if I just did this

826
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:06,619
I'll get through next time or if I learn the timing.

827
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,821
Now just to go back on that point, one of the other things we did in the impossible

828
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:16,764
air section as well, and here is a bit like this, is we tinkered with some of the timings of some

829
01:00:16,784 --> 01:00:22,347
of the objects. So whereas normally in parts of the other levels you can go straight through

830
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:25,348
and it's kind of there's a hint to the player because you want the player to kind of

831
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:29,731
Do the thing that makes sense that there's sometimes a gap and this one's particularly difficult

832
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:32,712
It doesn't look difficult from where Dave's playing

833
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:38,215
There'll be platforms here and you're trying to go up and down these moving platforms and dodge things

834
01:00:38,556 --> 01:00:44,339
But we wanted to make it we actually the timings of some of these things is actually very challenging

835
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:49,862
Deliberately that this one here this platform that Dave's on if but when Dave jumps the platform will go down

836
01:00:50,302 --> 01:00:52,123
So what Dave's got to do is

837
01:00:52,864 --> 01:00:57,447
trying to not jump but at the same time you've got to avoid these spikes and sometimes you get caught

838
01:00:57,507 --> 01:01:03,651
because it's just very difficult to get past them. So there's lots of things to take into account.

839
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:07,313
But yeah some of the places where there are timings, I think there's some cases where you

840
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:12,237
think oh now is the time to jump obviously but if you jump in that obvious point you'll find

841
01:01:12,317 --> 01:01:16,640
that the way these things sequence and come back is then puts you in a really bad position.

842
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,222
Sometimes you actually have to go when is the wrong time.

843
01:01:21,174 --> 01:01:21,274
Um...

844
01:01:21,294 --> 01:01:21,334
Uh...

845
01:01:21,354 --> 01:01:24,296
I had a thought.

846
01:01:25,017 --> 01:01:25,777
I was going to...

847
01:01:26,918 --> 01:01:28,500
What did you say?

848
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,040
Oh, yeah!

849
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:29,621
Oh.

850
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:30,762
Go for it Dave, go for it.

851
01:01:31,402 --> 01:01:34,105
Oh, like so like, just a random question.

852
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:36,046
If you guys could answer this.

853
01:01:36,386 --> 01:01:39,289
How would one get into QA if they are interested?

854
01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:42,392
Oh, that's a good question for chat as well.

855
01:01:43,052 --> 01:01:45,454
If you have- chat if you want to weigh in for anyone else who's here.

856
01:01:45,774 --> 01:01:46,755
Chris what's your thoughts on that?

857
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:56,361
Yeah, I mean, I guess QA starts people, I mean, we have a, I guess we have one QA on full-time,

858
01:01:56,701 --> 01:02:02,704
but we often have QA teams who are contracted in or work with our publisher who's got a QA team.

859
01:02:02,744 --> 01:02:07,186
So it might be that you contact a publisher if they've got a QA team or maybe there's a,

860
01:02:07,526 --> 01:02:11,208
sometimes like I say, there's independent companies who are just

861
01:02:11,688 --> 01:02:14,970
a QA and you can kind of contact them and talk to them.

862
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,312
I guess it's a slight, you know, it's a...

863
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:22,615
People, I'm not... Nobody here would think this, but, you know, the general public,

864
01:02:22,635 --> 01:02:26,238
I would say, oh yeah, QA, that must be great, because all you do is play games.

865
01:02:26,258 --> 01:02:30,621
But of course, what they don't do, don't tell you, is they're playing the same game,

866
01:02:30,941 --> 01:02:33,964
the same level, every day, the same way, again and again and again.

867
01:02:34,344 --> 01:02:38,127
And so it becomes, you know, it can become not as fun as it sounds.

868
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,169
But at the same time, you get to play all the cool stuff.

869
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:43,892
and you see it sooner before it's done.

870
01:02:43,932 --> 01:02:46,615
And actually, sometimes you'll get things back from QA

871
01:02:46,655 --> 01:02:49,899
and they'll suggest things or ideas that you think,

872
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,841
oh, we hadn't thought of that, we should do that.

873
01:02:52,141 --> 01:02:55,345
So that's another good reason.

874
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,067
To augment Chris's answer,

875
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,629
so I haven't worked in QA myself.

876
01:02:58,729 --> 01:02:59,970
Like I said, I've worked alongside them,

877
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,473
but I've talked to some of my friends in QA or...

878
01:03:03,025 --> 01:03:05,307
or co-workers about that process.

879
01:03:06,528 --> 01:03:11,973
The first one is that so many of them, you know, want developers who don't want to use QA as a stepping stone to other parts of development,

880
01:03:11,993 --> 01:03:14,355
although there's nothing wrong with that, there's just a lot of people who say,

881
01:03:14,735 --> 01:03:18,358
oh, you want to be like an air designer, which is something I do as well.

882
01:03:18,819 --> 01:03:22,582
And then you get a lot of, oh, we'll just start in QA and work your way over,

883
01:03:22,622 --> 01:03:26,205
and then the QA people are like, but then we don't get people who want to be QA and...

884
01:03:26,745 --> 01:03:27,666
That's its own skill set.

885
01:03:28,706 --> 01:03:31,726
But augmenting that is that my uncle, who's a software developer,

886
01:03:31,746 --> 01:03:35,767
sort of once encouraged me to, you know,

887
01:03:35,847 --> 01:03:38,328
get training in something like Ruby on Rails, for instance,

888
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:43,809
and then go to job fairs to get QA jobs at other software companies,

889
01:03:43,849 --> 01:03:45,310
you know, like smaller software companies.

890
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:48,710
Because, obviously, when you think about game QA,

891
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:51,331
you might go, oh, well, you need to be good at games to do QA.

892
01:03:52,133 --> 01:04:12,561
And what I know from all my QA friends is, well, being good at games helps, but being able to do reliable testing, to organize a testing methodology that fits for your company, those are sort of skills that are top tier for especially entry level QA, you know, being able to prove that you're not just, you know, here to play games and that you're approaching it from a software development mindset.

893
01:04:13,751 --> 01:04:16,713
That's my understanding, externally.

894
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:20,336
Chris, if you want to yes-and anything I just said, feel free to.

895
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:22,358
No, that sounds... that's great advice, actually.

896
01:04:22,378 --> 01:04:25,580
Yeah, definitely. I'd say I'd agree with everything you just said.

897
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:30,384
Yeah, and I'll only augment Chris's point about QA contracting firms,

898
01:04:30,424 --> 01:04:34,046
which is that sometimes the way QA for games is hired is not,

899
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:35,668
you know, the traditional HR process for...

900
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:43,772
The rest of the development studio, whether it's outside contractors or temporary workforce places, like I worked for in Los Angeles.

901
01:04:44,072 --> 01:04:48,394
Oh, what's the Target CW is the firm that I briefly staffed for one point.

902
01:04:48,414 --> 01:04:53,435
I know they did some QA for other not just game companies, but other software companies in the L.A. area.

903
01:04:53,475 --> 01:05:06,020
So I hope that helps. My question was going to be, Chris, from a what was sort of your intent here was was when you when you started development on this game was the impossible layer, the idea that, you know, the player would start.

904
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:12,617
off in this very difficult scenario and then go through a traditional, um, you know, a DKC type

905
01:05:12,657 --> 01:05:17,863
adventure, was that always where design went? Or did you sort of go—or did design sort of, uh,

906
01:05:18,264 --> 01:05:21,688
start from somewhere else and you realized like, hey, orienting the game around like sort of in

907
01:05:22,112 --> 01:05:24,793
a known endgame, a final mountain you were trying to climb.

908
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:28,035
Was that sort of where, did that come later or early in the process?

909
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:31,517
It was relatively early on, the idea of the Impossible Lair came.

910
01:05:31,537 --> 01:05:35,599
But we knew we wanted to build a 2D platformer.

911
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:40,302
But we wanted to kind of think about what would be interesting and unique.

912
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:44,584
And so we came up with this idea that, well, what if you could just complete the game?

913
01:05:45,305 --> 01:05:47,687
Right at the start and what if it was

914
01:05:48,728 --> 01:05:52,732
And then that you take the idea of what if the game is impossible and you think well you can't be impossible

915
01:05:52,772 --> 01:05:59,198
But then if it's it seems impossible and then you know the idea of what if you take something it is seemingly impossible at first

916
01:05:59,258 --> 01:06:02,602
But then over the course of the game you make it more and more possible

917
01:06:04,123 --> 01:06:09,208
So that's kind of where that started to come from and that's how you're gonna kind of put together. Gotcha

918
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:13,013
I also just thought of something that may help you, Dave, or anyone else looking to get into QA.

919
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:18,278
I'm also aware that some game companies in different spaces bring on...

920
01:06:18,738 --> 01:06:20,399
It's kind of an interesting space.

921
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:23,442
What they do is they'll bring in playtesters from the play community

922
01:06:23,502 --> 01:06:29,347
who are at the upper end of what their game does in order to check for experiences or solutions.

923
01:06:29,367 --> 01:06:35,152
It's sort of like not full QA, because QA is obviously about testing much more specific things.

924
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:37,694
And this is sort of, hey, play the game normally and let us know what you know.

925
01:06:38,314 --> 01:06:40,214
But playtesting is a good...

926
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:42,835
From some developers I've spoken to,

927
01:06:43,176 --> 01:06:46,277
that kind of player-focused QA testing is where some of them got their start.

928
01:06:46,797 --> 01:06:49,358
Partly because of the relationships they built with developers in that process.

929
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:50,439
I just thought of that. Sorry.

930
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,721
I think, Dave, this is our last Encounter with Capital B, right?

931
01:06:57,602 --> 01:06:58,362
Correct, yep.

932
01:06:58,582 --> 01:07:01,883
And then after that, there's a sort of like escape sequence.

933
01:07:02,924 --> 01:07:04,745
And yeah, that's gonna do it.

934
01:07:05,258 --> 01:07:09,624
Oh, the classic, uh, I love the Metroid, you know, the classic, like, you beat the final boss, get out.

935
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:11,046
You know, I love that.

936
01:07:11,347 --> 01:07:13,971
Uh, Chris, um, how do you make those good, I guess?

937
01:07:13,991 --> 01:07:17,916
Like, how do you make like the, you know, they're kind of own for the player, like, congrats, you beat the hardest challenge,

938
01:07:18,477 --> 01:07:19,939
but now you'll die if you don't get out.

939
01:07:19,979 --> 01:07:21,802
Like, what's your thoughts on making those valuable?

940
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:32,332
Exactly, so this section here is particularly difficult because you've got conveyors as well which are disorientating because they're switched direction whenever the capital B lands.

941
01:07:32,372 --> 01:07:36,596
But once you get beyond this here, you get to a section which is the escape section.

942
01:07:36,616 --> 01:07:38,378
I think I know some people have watched this.

943
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,313
It was sad to see some people online when they said,

944
01:07:41,693 --> 01:07:46,500
oh I just got to the, um, you know, to get to this section and they think they,

945
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:50,166
there was, then they found out there was another section and they thought they'll

946
01:07:50,186 --> 01:07:55,354
never be able to get through another section. But the next section is actually quite a bit easier.

947
01:07:55,970 --> 01:08:00,991
But because it's placed at the end and because you know you had to get through the rest of it until

948
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:06,572
then your heart is racing when you're in the next section and so it's a bit like the I always think

949
01:08:06,613 --> 01:08:12,434
of it as the end of Halo or like you said the Metroid examples that you what you're facing is

950
01:08:12,474 --> 01:08:16,855
a lot of smaller challenges and they're a lot simpler but at the same time you know that there's

951
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:20,695
still a chance you could make a mistake and it's that fear of that mistake particularly because

952
01:08:20,715 --> 01:08:23,256
we've got a counter that's going to count down in the next section as well.

953
01:08:23,856 --> 01:08:31,650
It's everything's in there to try and make you slip up and try and just make that kind of you know that you're on edge and try and make that mistake.

954
01:08:33,012 --> 01:08:34,755
Right on the neck. Go for it Dave.

955
01:08:35,495 --> 01:08:39,017
I was just going to say, like, as you constantly see, like, all the hazards behind you,

956
01:08:39,477 --> 01:08:41,518
like the level collapses in behind you,

957
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:44,961
just all of these elements, the music, the timer,

958
01:08:44,981 --> 01:08:48,062
the fact that it's at the end of the end of the level,

959
01:08:48,102 --> 01:08:50,964
you might have like one B left or sometimes even zero B's.

960
01:08:52,485 --> 01:08:54,786
It's really good at creating tension.

961
01:08:57,687 --> 01:08:59,908
Yeah, this is oh yeah, this is I can already see it.

962
01:08:59,948 --> 01:09:02,409
One of my favorite one of these sequences, I think, is in the Ori

963
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:05,931
or the first Ori game from Moon Studios.

964
01:09:05,971 --> 01:09:09,093
I'm blanking. I'm getting well, I can't remember Ori and the Will of the Whisper

965
01:09:09,253 --> 01:09:11,414
or I can't remember the names right now. Water section.

966
01:09:12,555 --> 01:09:14,976
Yeah, like the last, you know, the end of that game has one of these two.

967
01:09:14,996 --> 01:09:17,638
That's because the score on that game is just so incredible.

968
01:09:17,678 --> 01:09:20,019
Like, God, I can't get over how beautiful that game is.

969
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,460
It makes this moment.

970
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,621
It's a really special take on this moment, actually, because, you know,

971
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:25,922
we just sort of talked about three different.

972
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:34,469
Side-scrolling games that use these, you know, Metroid has a science fiction angle it sort of gets to use like, you know, like you blew up the base and, uh, you know, it's exploding around you.

973
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:36,370
So that gets to be part of that moment.

974
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:44,395
Um, Ori, Ori has this kind of heartfelt story at the center of it, you know, about family and the monsters that threaten you, but how they're, you know, the monsters have pain too.

975
01:09:44,955 --> 01:09:54,321
Um, so the catharsis of these moments is really something, uh, um, and this is more of a, obviously a goofy example of that because Capital B is just running his weird corporation here in his weird factory.

976
01:09:54,841 --> 01:09:54,922
Um,

977
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,046
So it's a different take on it.

978
01:09:58,026 --> 01:09:59,247
What a good, yeah, Blind Forest.

979
01:09:59,307 --> 01:10:01,549
Oh my God, thank you, A9AZN2.

980
01:10:01,589 --> 01:10:02,509
I've only played Blind Forest.

981
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:03,690
I haven't played Will of the Wisps yet.

982
01:10:04,091 --> 01:10:06,732
But we'll get around to it at some point.

983
01:10:06,772 --> 01:10:08,353
Hey, we're all staying home.

984
01:10:08,634 --> 01:10:09,754
I should get around to it at some point.

985
01:10:09,995 --> 01:10:10,755
Well, Dave, congrats.

986
01:10:10,795 --> 01:10:11,976
It looks like you finished the run.

987
01:10:12,696 --> 01:10:13,497
Yeah, thank you.

988
01:10:14,235 --> 01:10:14,995
Thank you, thank you.

989
01:10:15,015 --> 01:10:15,396
Good job.

990
01:10:15,816 --> 01:10:20,060
I think that was about 55 minutes based on the show timer we have going back here, which

991
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,562
I don't know, I have no idea what the record is, but you know what?

992
01:10:22,982 --> 01:10:27,306
Beating this game in 55 minutes is something I can't do, so congrats to that.

993
01:10:28,287 --> 01:10:28,507
Well done.

994
01:10:28,527 --> 01:10:28,707
Excellent.

995
01:10:28,727 --> 01:10:29,367
Thank you, thank you.

996
01:10:29,748 --> 01:10:32,270
And hey, shout out to the devs, they're getting, you know, we're going to let the credits roll

997
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:34,232
here, I think, while we wrap up our conversation.

998
01:10:35,192 --> 01:10:39,316
With five minutes left, we're going to go ahead, oh, Matthew points out it's a fire

999
01:10:39,356 --> 01:10:40,777
escape at the end of Blind Forest.

1000
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,382
If you've got questions or comments, feel free to drop them in now.

1001
01:10:47,442 --> 01:10:50,344
I know we're a little bit ahead of you, but we really want to get,

1002
01:10:52,145 --> 01:10:55,527
you know, you're here at GDC, we want to help you learn things.

1003
01:10:55,607 --> 01:10:57,689
That's the core of what we're doing here.

1004
01:10:58,609 --> 01:11:03,292
Dave and Chris, do you have any questions or comments for each other before I go to chat?

1005
01:11:04,313 --> 01:11:07,755
I'm just amazed at Dave's skill at playing this game.

1006
01:11:09,276 --> 01:11:16,343
I'd like to thank him very much for all the just amazing techniques and exploits that

1007
01:11:16,383 --> 01:11:17,264
he's been able to do.

1008
01:11:17,865 --> 01:11:18,165
Very good.

1009
01:11:18,185 --> 01:11:19,046
Oh man, thank you, Dick.

1010
01:11:19,086 --> 01:11:19,706
I appreciate that.

1011
01:11:19,726 --> 01:11:24,251
You know, given, you know, we had a couple deaths here and there, but you know, it was

1012
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:25,772
all in good fun.

1013
01:11:25,812 --> 01:11:30,377
And you know, I got to extend the thanks to you and the rest of the Playtonic team for

1014
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,239
giving us something really special.

1015
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:36,003
This game kind of just came out of left field for me.

1016
01:11:36,123 --> 01:11:39,884
It's like I enjoyed the first ukulele and then Impossible Air comes out.

1017
01:11:40,404 --> 01:11:43,205
And I like instantly this game clicked with me.

1018
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:46,165
And I was like, all right, this this is something really special.

1019
01:11:46,725 --> 01:11:50,986
And yeah, you know, thanks for giving me something really fun

1020
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:51,947
to spend my time with.

1021
01:11:52,867 --> 01:11:56,588
I had questions. Hmm.

1022
01:11:58,941 --> 01:12:03,945
I mean, I guess my question would be how long did it take you to get through the impossible

1023
01:12:03,965 --> 01:12:06,367
layer the first time with Zero B's?

1024
01:12:06,427 --> 01:12:07,087
I know you've done that.

1025
01:12:07,788 --> 01:12:14,152
Yeah, that Zero B, oh God, the Zero B, that that took me

1026
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:17,315
at least 100, 200, maybe more.

1027
01:12:17,395 --> 01:12:19,316
And it was so funny, I remember

1028
01:12:19,516 --> 01:12:20,557
trying for about.

1029
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:31,727
Like an entire weekend just attempts doing only I wasn't even streaming.

1030
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:34,790
I was just doing off stream attempts because I wanted to get a GDQ submission.

1031
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:36,451
Actually, I couldn't do it.

1032
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:42,435
And then Monday rolled around and I hopped on stream and ran.

1033
01:12:42,455 --> 01:12:45,258
I was like, you know what, let's let's let's do a zero B attempt.

1034
01:12:45,318 --> 01:12:48,460
And it was the first one, the first attempt of the day I got it.

1035
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,782
And that was the first time that I did the the impossible later.

1036
01:12:51,843 --> 01:12:52,063
It was.

1037
01:12:53,304 --> 01:12:54,264
It is exhilarating.

1038
01:12:54,544 --> 01:12:59,045
And, you know, I get massive like Breath of the Wild vibes from this,

1039
01:12:59,085 --> 01:13:00,586
where like Zelda Breath of the Wild,

1040
01:13:00,986 --> 01:13:04,647
you can go to Hyrule Castle at the start of the game in your underwear

1041
01:13:04,807 --> 01:13:06,208
and just beat the game.

1042
01:13:06,368 --> 01:13:10,189
And like to have that, like that sort of like beat the game at any point

1043
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:15,611
in a 2D platformer and the way you were able to contextualize it narratively,

1044
01:13:16,051 --> 01:13:19,172
you know, with the bees and then also mechanically with the bee shield.

1045
01:13:19,652 --> 01:13:21,233
Hey, we got sub hour in the end game time.

1046
01:13:21,253 --> 01:13:21,933
That's pretty cool.

1047
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:29,460
Like, I don't know. This game is an achievement and I really like it. I really like it.

1048
01:13:30,065 --> 01:13:31,646
We do have a bunch of questions from chat coming in,

1049
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:33,047
but we only have 90 seconds left,

1050
01:13:33,067 --> 01:13:35,708
so I'm going to grab one final question before we get out of here.

1051
01:13:35,728 --> 01:13:37,629
But before we do that, I'm going to ask everyone,

1052
01:13:37,669 --> 01:13:41,271
please make sure you leave a writing for this session before you leave.

1053
01:13:41,912 --> 01:13:42,692
That helps us out a lot.

1054
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:44,713
If you have any specific notes about how this was run,

1055
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,495
let us know. We'll use it to improve the process.

1056
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:47,695
We also like getting feedback.

1057
01:13:48,956 --> 01:13:51,057
Dave and Chris, we're getting so many questions coming in.

1058
01:13:51,077 --> 01:13:53,519
I'm going to encourage folks to reach out to you afterwards

1059
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:54,659
to ask a lot of them,

1060
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,041
but I would like to know where should they reach out to you?

1061
01:13:57,061 --> 01:13:59,242
Where can they find you at? How should they contact you?

1062
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:04,951
I'm on Twitter as Chris underscore Thoth.

1063
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:05,731
You'll find me there.

1064
01:14:06,752 --> 01:14:07,392
Dave, yourself?

1065
01:14:07,872 --> 01:14:08,493
Yeah, likewise.

1066
01:14:08,513 --> 01:14:11,254
You can just find me on Twitter.com slash Dave Stereo.

1067
01:14:11,474 --> 01:14:13,415
I also stream daily on Twitch.

1068
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:19,698
Yeah, Twitter is generally the spot, or if you want to come into the Twitch channel,

1069
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:20,058
say hi.

1070
01:14:20,598 --> 01:14:20,918
Right on.

1071
01:14:21,738 --> 01:14:24,019
Chris, our final question of the day for the day is for you.

1072
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,281
How many dreams does Joe Jones crush with The Balance Sheet?

1073
01:14:30,494 --> 01:14:34,560
That sounds like from one of our dev team members. That's from Michelle and Zovino.

1074
01:14:36,603 --> 01:14:42,813
Don't know, I don't know, I don't know that, I don't know that. She might be friends with Joe.

1075
01:14:43,113 --> 01:14:46,498
Yeah, probably, yeah. How many dreams? Can you quantify the number of dreams?

1076
01:14:47,753 --> 01:14:48,073
Many.

1077
01:14:48,754 --> 01:14:49,095
Many.

1078
01:14:49,695 --> 01:14:51,297
All right, well folks, thank you so much for watching.

1079
01:14:51,337 --> 01:14:55,923
Thank you to folks, thank you to Matt Hatchett and all these other folks, Brendan Lutchen

1080
01:14:55,963 --> 01:14:57,025
asking questions at the last minute.

1081
01:14:57,065 --> 01:15:01,390
Like I said, if you have any more questions for these two, find them at the links we just

1082
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:01,670
gave.

1083
01:15:01,971 --> 01:15:03,513
And with that, goodbye everyone.

1084
01:15:04,314 --> 01:15:04,674
Thank you.

1085
01:15:04,694 --> 01:15:04,754
Bye.
