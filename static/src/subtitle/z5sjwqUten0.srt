1
00:00:05,808 --> 00:00:15,835
Has anyone here actually heard of Space Station 13?

2
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:16,375
Heck yeah.

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:16,455
Okay.

4
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:23,679
So, I'm a maintainer for Spacestation 13, more specifically the TG Station flavor of Spacestation 13.

5
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:29,646
We boast thousands of stars, forks, contributors, we get tens of thousands of commits,

6
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:32,689
making us one of the largest open source games on GitHub.

7
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,353
We get tens of community contributions per day in the form of pull requests.

8
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:39,935
meaning people bringing in their own features, bug fixes,

9
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:42,136
whatever else they have in mind.

10
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:45,037
Our code is 100% AGPL licensed open source,

11
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:47,078
but the influence of Spacestation 13

12
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:49,459
expands far past just this one repository.

13
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,759
In order to explain that, I'll need to go into the history of Space Station 13.

14
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,619
I'll talk about how our open source model works,

15
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:00,480
how we accept contributions, and how we interact with our player base.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,940
I'll talk about the benefits we get from doing our way of open source,

17
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,061
as well as some of the bads, but also how we live with them.

18
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:11,641
And I hope by the end of this talk, we will have a good understanding

19
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:14,162
about how open source games work at a large enough scale,

20
00:01:14,162 --> 00:01:18,903
and maybe give you some thoughts on open sourcing pieces of your own games.

21
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:19,703
So how did we get here?

22
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,312
Spacestation 13 originally was not even a game.

23
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:26,094
It was a tech demo built on an engine that, at the time,

24
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:28,595
was made up of primarily anime fighting games.

25
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:31,717
Eventually, they start building a game around that

26
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,079
and just adding whatever comes to their mind.

27
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,681
Peak concurrent users at this time was about 10.

28
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,263
The source code is shared between some forum users

29
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:41,584
until eventually it gets published under CC by SA.

30
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:44,526
Basically, the code is free to use,

31
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:46,107
but you have to upload your own changes to it.

32
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:51,698
Ever since then, several communities decided to take Spacestation 13's code into their own hands

33
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:52,878
and build their own versions of it.

34
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:54,799
There's hundreds of unique forks out there.

35
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,960
These are just the ones that I could fit on one slide,

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,982
and they don't even include every active server there is now.

37
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:04,704
The longer these forks stay in development, the more radically they differ from one another.

38
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:07,025
They're all driven by vastly different communities

39
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,746
with vastly different ideas about what makes a game fun.

40
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:13,287
So if you ask, what is Spacestation 13?

41
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:14,608
It depends who you ask.

42
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:19,818
If you ask a TG Station player, they might tell you it's a steadily paced sandbox game

43
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:23,519
with a focus on high action and unique complex mechanics.

44
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,581
However, if you ask a Goon Station player, the very original version, they might tell

45
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:33,242
you it's an arcade-style game with a heavy focus on individual player knowledge and stories.

46
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:37,594
If you ask a Baystation player from a community of Dwarf Fortress fans,

47
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,756
they might tell you it's a slow-paced game

48
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:42,820
with a heavy emphasis on roleplay between players.

49
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,922
And if you ask a TGMC player,

50
00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:47,706
they'll tell you it's a PvP team deathmatch game

51
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,668
because they took the code of Space Station 13

52
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,670
and flipped it completely on its head.

53
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,253
They're basically just using it as a game engine at this point.

54
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:56,518
And these aren't niche communities either.

55
00:02:56,518 --> 00:02:59,782
Spacestation 13's popularity comes not from any one version,

56
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:02,645
but in the hundreds of forks with huge communities,

57
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:05,349
building games that might only barely resemble one another.

58
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,830
And while our game engine beyond might not be open source,

59
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,552
there's countless projects that intend

60
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:12,333
to move us to a freer platform.

61
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,375
Projects like Open Dream work to recreate

62
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,278
the current game engine into an open source alternative,

63
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:19,060
allowing us to port our existing code.

64
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,243
While projects like Space Station 14 and Unity Station

65
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,666
are taking traction as full-fledged remakes

66
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,147
in other game engines.

67
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:27,989
Space Station 14 is championing

68
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,611
its own open source game engine.

69
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:32,797
But while we're on beyond, we make huge use

70
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,478
of open source tooling to replace

71
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:37,239
the engine-specific proprietary software.

72
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,960
We have a few open source map editors,

73
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,561
such as strong DMM, which are all vastly superior

74
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,442
to the built-in map editor.

75
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:46,664
We have aux tools, which reverse engineers the game engine

76
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:49,385
itself in order to let us do things that would otherwise not

77
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:50,706
be possible.

78
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:52,687
And we have support for external editors,

79
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:54,268
whereas the game engine would normally

80
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,709
have us use a basic text editor with colors.

81
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,430
But just being open source can mean a lot of things.

82
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,713
Maybe parts of your game are open source,

83
00:04:02,713 --> 00:04:04,155
and others are closed source.

84
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:07,418
Or maybe your code is open source, but only a subset of paid workers

85
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:08,400
can actually contribute.

86
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,203
There's a lot of different ways to do open source,

87
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:13,506
and so it's important to know the way that we do it.

88
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:16,717
On TG Station, we let anyone make pull requests,

89
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:18,358
and we have fairly loose guidelines

90
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,938
on what can actually be added.

91
00:04:19,938 --> 00:04:21,678
In practice, this means we frequently

92
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,859
get both fun niche stuff, like high fives or blowing kisses,

93
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:26,839
but we also get large content expansions,

94
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,980
such as new maps, planets, or game modes.

95
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,960
Due to our fairly lax restrictions

96
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,881
and our extremely high output of contributions,

97
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:37,222
Space Station 13 boasts a huge amount of content.

98
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:38,422
What you're looking at is our wiki.

99
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:41,042
All of those are separate, full-fledged guides

100
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,563
to every nook and cranny of the game.

101
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,116
And when I say extremely high output,

102
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,517
I mean at a rate that traditional game development

103
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:49,097
has trouble competing with.

104
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:51,318
We get hundreds of commits merged per week.

105
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:53,259
We do squash commits, so in practice,

106
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,679
that's hundreds of pull requests per week.

107
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,180
Remember, a pull request is a community contribution

108
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,561
like a bug fix or a new feature.

109
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:04,162
And we get this from over 100 unique contributors per month.

110
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:05,582
While contributors might come and go,

111
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:07,182
we're always getting fresh ones

112
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,583
ready to work on the next big thing.

113
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,585
Our team is still fairly small.

114
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:15,147
We have a little over 70 members in our organization.

115
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,429
Around 25 are considered maintainers

116
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:19,109
and are tasked with reviewing the code

117
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:20,770
and the design for pull requests,

118
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,472
as well as having the final decision on if they're merged.

119
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:25,253
We have about 40 issue managers

120
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:27,014
who are tasked with helping triage

121
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:29,295
and label our nearly 2,000 issues

122
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,996
as much as they'd like to see that number go down.

123
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,240
Despite hundreds of pull requests per week,

124
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,242
we managed to make a decision on most within seven days,

125
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,942
and we're always talking to contributors

126
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:41,063
about what types of changes we'd like to see

127
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:42,764
on both GitHub and Discord.

128
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:45,925
We regularly help new and old contributors

129
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:48,366
learn the proprietary language, our own code base,

130
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:49,666
as well as walking them through

131
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,347
our general game design process.

132
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:55,965
So sort of by necessity, in order to keep the game alive,

133
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:58,566
our open source model turns players into designers.

134
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,447
If someone has an idea on how to make the game better,

135
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:03,588
they can easily hop onto our support channels

136
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:05,568
and learn how to get their idea into the game.

137
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:07,829
Players are very active throughout the entire design

138
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,490
process, from ideation to production,

139
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,571
both in terms of those that originally came up

140
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,492
with the idea and those who want to help flesh it out

141
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:15,452
with their own perspectives.

142
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:17,433
In fact, even before the pull request is merged.

143
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,252
Our open source model provides content to players at an unmatchable rate.

144
00:06:22,252 --> 00:06:24,852
A day in which several bug fixes and quality of life improvements

145
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,493
are not added to the game is an abnormality.

146
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:30,853
And a month without some large part of the game being changed or added

147
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:31,753
is almost unheard of.

148
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:35,274
To the point where when we do instate things like feature freezes,

149
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:38,335
there's always a tiny bit of uproar.

150
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,655
The bits about community involvement are really important

151
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:43,296
and very unique to open source game development.

152
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:44,956
So I want to go deeper into that.

153
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,683
So in larger traditional game development,

154
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:51,245
you have dedicated members in fields like design, programming,

155
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:51,865
art, and so on.

156
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:53,046
Of course, the more indie you are,

157
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,387
the more of these roles are going

158
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:56,028
to be filled by the same people.

159
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:58,150
But my point here is that the developers are

160
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,791
separate from the players.

161
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,792
Developers play their games, of course.

162
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,113
But pure players and developers can

163
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:05,295
have vastly different ways to view the resulting game.

164
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:08,644
So for example, if we have a class shooter,

165
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,665
maybe as a designer, my focus is on things

166
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:13,707
like team compositions, win rates, pick rates.

167
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:15,948
But as a player, my focus might instead

168
00:07:15,948 --> 00:07:18,909
be more on what I actually choose to do.

169
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:20,850
My class, what I would have fun with

170
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,351
and what I find frustrating to play against.

171
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:25,072
In Spacestation 13, our development

172
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:27,493
is nearly entirely from this category.

173
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:29,053
And I'm not saying one style of thinking

174
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:30,654
is better or makes better games,

175
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:33,495
but I'm saying it creates a substantially different design

176
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,176
that I think is pretty interesting.

177
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:38,545
As said before, basically all of our pull requests

178
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,746
come from players.

179
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:42,648
While across maintainers we do have a broader vision

180
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:44,629
for where we want to see the game go,

181
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,870
we don't write much code ourselves compared to players,

182
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,171
much less features.

183
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,192
And we can't force anyone to work on anything

184
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:51,653
that they don't want to do.

185
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:53,754
Players know this, and they know that if there's anything

186
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:55,295
they want to see to the game,

187
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:57,717
usually the only thing stopping them is themselves.

188
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:01,303
So let's think back to the class shooter example.

189
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:03,003
In Spacestation 13, players are split up

190
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:05,385
into departments, which are split up into jobs,

191
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,805
similar-ish to classes.

192
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:09,547
As maintainers, we do have a rough idea

193
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:12,609
of how we want departments to interact on the macro scale,

194
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,570
but nobody knows how the micro interactions play out better

195
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,931
than the players themselves.

196
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:22,310
So as maintainers, we know that we want engineers to build things.

197
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,751
But some players know that they want to build couches.

198
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,112
So they send that as a pull request.

199
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:27,993
There's nothing harmful about it, so it goes in.

200
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:30,194
It might not have been something we thought of

201
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:32,715
or would have made the art for, but it's definitely not

202
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:33,896
something we're going to deny.

203
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:39,431
As maintainers, we know that we want people who are security officers to be responsible

204
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:41,615
for handling crew that commit crimes.

205
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:45,560
Some players think, why not let people choose to be a prisoner if they want to give security

206
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,261
something else to do?

207
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:49,486
It aligns with the way that we see the game, and so it gets in.

208
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:55,101
This style of thinking, of just adding what you think would be fun within reason,

209
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,043
is something that you'll only see from player-driven development.

210
00:08:58,043 --> 00:09:00,865
And open source can make it super easy and inviting.

211
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:04,467
People who enjoy a department, who play it for hundreds of hours,

212
00:09:04,467 --> 00:09:07,889
are invited to add content that they think other people in their department

213
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:08,610
will enjoy.

214
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,491
Maintainers still have the final call, of course.

215
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:13,273
We're not going to let security players give themselves

216
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:14,133
machine guns anytime soon.

217
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:18,356
But players are able to provide ideas from a super unique point of view.

218
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:24,521
This helps the game, either at large or job-specific or map-specific or whatever else, feel super vast.

219
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:27,904
There's always something to do, made by people who have fun doing what you do,

220
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:33,049
and new or experienced players are always giving you more to have fun with.

221
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:37,452
And even if you're a game developer who does listen to even the nichest of player suggestions,

222
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,695
your time is still limited. You can only add so much.

223
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:45,399
In open-source, player-driven game development, time often isn't being diverted at all.

224
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:48,183
A player who enjoys character customization,

225
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:50,745
adding the ability to customize glasses,

226
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:52,946
is someone who might not have contributed anything

227
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:54,187
at all otherwise.

228
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:55,728
The presence of these contributors

229
00:09:55,728 --> 00:10:03,874
is way more often than not a net positive for us.

230
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:06,776
So in order to show our processes at work,

231
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:08,857
let's walk through one good example.

232
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:09,578
Let's look at circuits.

233
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:11,751
Circuits look like this.

234
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:14,892
They're like Unreal blueprints, or like WireMod and Garry's Mod.

235
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:16,832
They're little contraptions to automate some work.

236
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:19,853
But most importantly, they're a feature built upon

237
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,313
by several separate contributors.

238
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:23,933
For context, they used to look like this.

239
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,034
And I kind of still don't know how you were actually

240
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:27,454
meant to use them.

241
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:30,415
That version of Circuits got merged in late 2017.

242
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:33,455
It was a collaboration between five separate contributors,

243
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:36,516
that being for design, sprites, code support,

244
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:37,236
or any mix of those.

245
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,432
But it has some problems.

246
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,274
One is that it's really easy to make circuits that just kill

247
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:44,134
people, and really fast.

248
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:48,117
Death in Space Station 13 can be impossible to come back from,

249
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:50,859
and you might be out of the game for upwards of a few hours.

250
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,422
Circuits can be saved and then sent to others,

251
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:56,203
meaning basically everyone who wanted to

252
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:59,946
could have one of these really powerful weapons every round.

253
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,827
And to top it all off, these weapon circuits

254
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,929
could then just be hidden away in your hand,

255
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,010
nearly impossible for other people to see,

256
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,691
until you used it and they died.

257
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:10,937
And also, you saw how they look.

258
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,979
Only a handful of people could actually make anything

259
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,360
with these because of how clunky they were.

260
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,722
So over the next year,

261
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,985
countless contributions are made for circuits.

262
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:21,187
Some add new features, some fix bugs,

263
00:11:21,187 --> 00:11:22,468
and others try to rebalance them

264
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:25,010
so that people weren't just using them to kill everyone.

265
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,272
But eventually, as these problems seemingly got worse,

266
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:28,894
not better, the decision was made

267
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:30,255
to scrap the feature entirely,

268
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:32,257
though with the hope of going back to it later,

269
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:33,538
with a little bit more thought.

270
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,652
So what went wrong?

271
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:37,814
Well, one of the downsides of our open source model

272
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:39,815
is that with lots of contributions coming in,

273
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:41,777
it's very hard for us to thoroughly investigate

274
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:43,579
the design of every feature that gets made.

275
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:46,922
Features getting made and not working out,

276
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:49,123
and then necessitating full removal is not uncommon.

277
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:52,564
We have lots of contributors, but we have very few chances

278
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:53,705
to onboard them.

279
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,285
While larger features like circuits

280
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:57,726
do get more attention from maintainers, more often than

281
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:59,387
not, stuff is just dropped on us.

282
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:01,948
And we now have to figure out how to deal with it.

283
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:04,509
Sometimes we'll ask for a design doc, but most of the time

284
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:06,530
we're just figuring out amongst ourselves

285
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,871
if it seems like a good idea.

286
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:11,658
Because of this, we struggle to keep a consistent model

287
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:14,259
in our head about how everything interacts with each other,

288
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:16,460
especially once this new proposed feature is added.

289
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,281
We don't have a clear roadmap or anything

290
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:21,123
due to our contributions being from motivated players

291
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:24,324
and not people paid to push the design of the game.

292
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,425
And even when we do notice problems,

293
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:29,047
huge pull requests like circuits often don't get denied.

294
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:30,467
People pour a lot of work

295
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,588
and not uncommonly money into these.

296
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:34,769
And on a human level, it just kind of feels bad

297
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:36,390
to be the one person responsible

298
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,711
for letting all of that go to waste.

299
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:41,397
We've done our best to resolve these problems over the years.

300
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:43,438
Maintainers are very easy to contact

301
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:44,839
if you're working on a feature.

302
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:47,261
And we are starting to amass a large amount of design

303
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:50,162
documents, though presently they're only really

304
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:52,524
for very large features, and they're not required.

305
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:55,046
This lets us discuss and iron out our thoughts more

306
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:56,887
into a better feature, but my goal

307
00:12:56,887 --> 00:13:00,089
is not to scare you off from open source game development,

308
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:01,390
because we did go back to circuits.

309
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,450
Here are these.

310
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,332
So circuits, we're going to get it right this time.

311
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:11,575
In early 2021, I wrote this crude design document on the second iteration of circuits.

312
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:17,180
It's rough. Our design doc process is as informal as it gets, but I wrote it.

313
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:22,203
It's based very much around the failings of the first iteration and clearly documents what won't be added.

314
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:26,286
But here's where open source gets interesting, because I made the document, but I didn't make the code.

315
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:33,251
Someone else saw the design doc posted and decided to write the 7000 lines of code it took to get it into the game.

316
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,553
This itself is not uncommon either.

317
00:13:35,553 --> 00:13:42,378
Not all players can or will code, but ideas getting passed around to other interested people happens all the time.

318
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:49,163
Remember, one of the best parts about our open source model is that players are working on the features while designers are the ones to approve them.

319
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:52,866
So from there, just like most features we make,

320
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,607
pull requests come in from tens of different contributors,

321
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,208
all adding new stuff, fixing bugs,

322
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,868
and changing what's already there.

323
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:00,269
We've gotten nearly 100 pull requests

324
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:03,010
for just this version of Circuit specifically.

325
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,811
And now that we have a design document, even a rough one,

326
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,511
maintainers know what features should and shouldn't be added,

327
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:10,352
helping us to protect them from removal again.

328
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:12,693
All in all, this feature is what it is today,

329
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:14,454
thanks to the work of maybe

330
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,994
about 100 motivated contributors.

331
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:19,760
So as you've seen, open source and open contribution

332
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,604
development helps us to amass a large amount of contributions.

333
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:25,325
But at a large enough scale, it comes

334
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,787
at the cost of it being fairly difficult to maintain

335
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:29,008
a consistent path for the game.

336
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:31,610
But it also carries the additional cost

337
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,012
of the work required to maintain those features,

338
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,733
such as code or balancing.

339
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,816
Along with requesting design documents for larger features,

340
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:41,938
we also have other ways to keep quality control.

341
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,354
One problem we get is that a lot of people are excited to make features for the game,

342
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:48,416
but not so keen on maintaining them.

343
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,560
Features having bugs being pushed to production isn't a new problem.

344
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,362
They need to get in eventually, after all.

345
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:56,645
But it's a worse problem the longer these bugs stick around,

346
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,188
especially since we're 100% volunteer work,

347
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:03,733
and not uncommonly, the only person who understands the code is the one who wrote it.

348
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:07,258
In worst case scenarios, this leads to features just getting outright removed.

349
00:15:07,258 --> 00:15:09,120
That's what you see in the screenshot right now.

350
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,884
Both of those had some fairly big problems to them that just nobody was fixing.

351
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:17,165
So our solution to this is PR balances.

352
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:17,766
And here's how it works.

353
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:21,449
The core of it is that every contributor has a score.

354
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:25,271
The score goes up for contributors that help maintain the code base,

355
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:29,094
and you spend your points on PRs that will require more maintenance,

356
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,395
such as adding new features.

357
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:32,885
So let's say that I'm a new contributor,

358
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:34,686
and I made this brand new feature.

359
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:36,367
Right now, I start at 0 points.

360
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,749
When my feature gets merged, I spend 10,

361
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:40,791
and now I'm at negative 10 points.

362
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,672
From there, if I make another feature,

363
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:44,654
maintainers will be notified of that.

364
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:46,675
It doesn't close the PR, and it doesn't

365
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:49,437
mean that it will get closed, but it acts as a warning to us.

366
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:53,069
Or if I instead submit a coder factor,

367
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:55,830
then I'll gain back that 10 points when it gets merged.

368
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,151
Now I can make features again without the warning.

369
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:59,971
The system works quite well.

370
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:01,992
We've reward positive changes like bug fixes,

371
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:04,553
quality of life improvements, improved accessibility,

372
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:06,614
et cetera, while still being able to gain

373
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:08,774
consistent features from those who we can trust

374
00:16:08,774 --> 00:16:09,395
to maintain them.

375
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:10,875
In fact, if you're interested,

376
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,536
I turned it into a GitHub Action.

377
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,476
It's a bit strange to set up,

378
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:16,177
but you can look at our repository to see how it works

379
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:17,818
or file an issue requesting documentation.

380
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:22,464
So one of the obvious downsides of open source

381
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:23,744
is your source is open.

382
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:25,665
The fact that anyone can read the code

383
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:27,666
and know every single bit of information there is

384
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,707
limits our design a fair bit.

385
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:31,708
Things like damage numbers, spawn chances, all of that

386
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,149
are easily searchable.

387
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,650
We recognize this in features we make,

388
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,371
such as this one, which lets you examine an item to see

389
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,633
how much damage it does, rather than just try it and see.

390
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:45,594
Because pull requests represent individual changes, it's also not terribly difficult

391
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:49,896
to keep up with them as a player who wants to be able to gain an advantage.

392
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:55,298
Some players will try to form strategies around changes before they're even merged.

393
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:59,300
And of course, we can't really do truly mysterious designs such as, say,

394
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,421
Destiny 2 raids being intentionally fairly esoteric at times with its puzzles.

395
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:06,843
You might be thinking we can just put the secret stuff somewhere else. In fact,

396
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:10,044
Goon Station does exactly that, and we have the basis for a system like that.

397
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:13,067
But because the rest of the code is open to contribution,

398
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,651
it's possible to cause bugs in the secret stuff that, at best,

399
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:20,175
only a small handful of people even have the ability to fix,

400
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:24,920
and at worst, won't show up in unit testing, since that only has the public source code.

401
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,325
But I'm not even really talking about the obvious stuff like this when I refer to mysterious design.

402
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,456
I'm also referring to the fact that if we send you a message saying you don't feel well,

403
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:40,023
a good chunk of players will in that moment literally just search that text in the source code

404
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,866
and find out exactly what's wrong with them.

405
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:45,811
But just because we have this limitation doesn't mean good doesn't come out of it.

406
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:50,504
So because players have access to every little detail about the game,

407
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,505
our wiki is really in-depth.

408
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,405
Pages have all the stats you'd want to know

409
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,165
if you're digging deep into the game.

410
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:59,746
What you're looking at is our page for chemical reactions.

411
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,247
All of what you see should be automatically generated

412
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,427
from the recipe code itself.

413
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:06,728
There's one downside that I think is intrinsic to open contribution

414
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:09,148
that you won't find in traditional game development, at least not

415
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:10,168
truly independent ones.

416
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:13,895
And I like to call it the every change has a username problem.

417
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:16,657
It's about how people react to controversial changes

418
00:18:16,657 --> 00:18:19,738
in our open contribution environment.

419
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:21,659
So for the sake of example, let's pretend

420
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,820
that Spacestation 13 isn't run in broad daylight,

421
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,901
but instead is a product of a game studio, a closed source product.

422
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:29,642
We're calling the studio Toolbox Games.

423
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:33,038
And the developers at Toolbox Games have a change they want to make.

424
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,220
They want to remove nanites.

425
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,961
They know that this is going to be really controversial.

426
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,702
A lot of people really like nanites.

427
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:42,144
And apart from them, removing a big piece of content from any game

428
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,965
doesn't often draw applause.

429
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:45,807
But they've gone through the rigmarole of ensuring

430
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:47,888
that there isn't any other choice.

431
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:50,730
This controversial change has to, unfortunately, get made.

432
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,251
Eventually this change gets announced, and people aren't happy.

433
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,712
I mean, we expected that.

434
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:57,392
But the important bit here is that while they're angry,

435
00:18:57,392 --> 00:19:01,294
their complaints are directed at toolbox games, or maybe even just

436
00:19:01,294 --> 00:19:02,014
Space Station 13.

437
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:05,015
The actual people, the humans behind the change,

438
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:08,016
don't have the hostilities directed at them personally.

439
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,616
They're directed at the game at large.

440
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:14,320
And sure, developers read forums and reddits and all types of social media religiously,

441
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,743
and it sucks seeing a lot of people really upset about the work that you know is going

442
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:21,565
to be good for the long term, even if everyone's mad about it now.

443
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:24,788
But this changes in the context of open pull requests.

444
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,930
Because in open pull requests, they show who made it.

445
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,873
They show the individual who felt motivated enough to make that controversial change.

446
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:34,844
meaning the abuse is a lot more directed.

447
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:38,066
And mind you, there can still be a lot of people behind the change,

448
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,849
but eventually someone has to open the pull request.

449
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:44,713
And idly reading players aren't going to know the full context behind a change

450
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:46,995
or even be expected to read the motivations behind them.

451
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:50,298
What you're seeing on the screen is all chat logs directly from the game.

452
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:52,259
And even though this change was made like a year ago,

453
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,682
I still get a ton of directed harassment over this.

454
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,243
I like the one on the bottom left.

455
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:57,744
That guy came up to me in the middle of the game,

456
00:19:57,744 --> 00:20:01,666
like role playing, and asked me why I removed nanites.

457
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,767
I don't think he's malicious at all.

458
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,308
I just thought it was funny.

459
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:06,809
But this can be a huge problem depending on your community.

460
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,631
It's especially a problem for us in specific,

461
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:10,372
where we make a big deal about separating

462
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:12,974
the concerns of the game servers from the concerns of the code

463
00:20:12,974 --> 00:20:13,654
base.

464
00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:16,416
So people like this don't often end up getting banned in game,

465
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,457
and we don't control the game subreddit or anything

466
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:19,158
like that.

467
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:21,699
But we do take this problem really seriously,

468
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:23,180
and we do take some steps to mitigate it.

469
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:26,454
Our lead maintainers, along with their usual duties

470
00:20:26,454 --> 00:20:28,656
of trying to manage a project at large,

471
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:31,458
also take the role of public relations.

472
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,340
They're often on the forefront,

473
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,522
advertising and defending controversial changes,

474
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:38,104
which means that a lot of the blame shifts to them

475
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,366
rather than the contributors.

476
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:42,529
This helps shield both ordinary contributors and maintainers

477
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:45,691
whose names are often forgotten in the hostile discourse.

478
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:53,841
We make huge use of GitHub moderation to block people who are just being toxic or otherwise provocative on pull requests.

479
00:20:53,841 --> 00:21:00,305
GitHub seems to take ban evasion pretty seriously, and we haven't had a problem of people doing it to try to disrupt the codebase.

480
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:05,869
This only affects GitHub, though. As I said before, our moderation of the codebase is separate from the game,

481
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:08,210
but we also don't control any third-party social media.

482
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,550
And I also thought I'd throw this one in here,

483
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,234
that being a maintainer can kind of suck sometimes.

484
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:15,957
If you're a part of any open source project,

485
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:18,500
make sure your maintainers get the appreciation they deserve

486
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,024
for the usually stressful and thankless work

487
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,545
that they put in.

488
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:25,385
So while open source game development has its flaws,

489
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,927
it still creates massively interesting design

490
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:31,410
by virtue of the fact that players play such an important role

491
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,371
in its future.

492
00:21:32,371 --> 00:21:34,853
Open source game development also is the best way

493
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:37,035
to support derivatives or mods.

494
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,436
I only briefly touched on them,

495
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:41,899
but all the different forks, just the fact that they exist,

496
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:43,300
help constantly push the bounds

497
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,242
on what we think Spacestation 13 can be.

498
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:49,594
And Space Station 13 is also only what it is today,

499
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:50,994
thanks to open source game development.

500
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:54,016
And I would be super excited to see this space develop outside

501
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:54,836
of our little corner.

502
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:56,317
That's that.

503
00:21:56,317 --> 00:22:05,621
There's a microphone there if there's any questions.

504
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:15,687
Hey, so I'd like to hear more about pretty much everything about assets.

505
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:19,110
So you mentioned they're all Creative Commons licensed as well.

506
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:24,673
Attracting non-code contributors is kind of the worst part of every open source project.

507
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:27,015
So about that, about what you're using for a library,

508
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,936
because all the open source asset libraries suck.

509
00:22:28,936 --> 00:22:31,118
Like everything about assets would be great.

510
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:32,459
A whole new talk.

511
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:37,562
So is your question in regards to how we get Spriters and such to contribute or just non-code in general?

512
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:40,155
All of it, sure. Whatever you guys talk about.

513
00:22:40,155 --> 00:22:49,540
So, for sound effects specifically, this is kind of the only part where we actually do use third-party assets.

514
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:57,224
We often use public domain free sounds, or we use things that are available with attribution, or sprites.

515
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:03,945
really hard. We can't use anything we see online. We have this, you know, 32 by 32 icons. We have

516
00:23:03,945 --> 00:23:09,666
this specific art style we're trying to maintain. The best I can say for that is we got really

517
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:17,328
lucky by having a ton of really talented people contributing art. The only method that I would

518
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:22,049
say is slightly interesting to open source specifically is that sometimes when writing

519
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:24,129
a feature, if you can't make sprites,

520
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,133
will kind of let you in if they're good enough.

521
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:32,340
And then eventually someone sees that and it ticks them off enough to replace it with a good sprite.

522
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:39,149
And also sometimes we have, like, bounties on making sprites that replace old ones.

523
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:40,551
What are you using for an asset library?

524
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:43,668
What do you mean by that?

525
00:23:43,668 --> 00:23:46,469
Where are you storing all that?

526
00:23:46,469 --> 00:23:49,830
Oh, this is kind of a game engine specific thing for us.

527
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,810
It's just like a clumped icons folder.

528
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,151
Like we don't get access to like, you know,

529
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:57,411
like texture unpacker or like third party tools.

530
00:23:57,411 --> 00:24:01,792
It's kind of just all built into our engine kind of okay-ly.

531
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,493
It sends the, like a resource file with all the sprites

532
00:24:05,493 --> 00:24:06,353
when you actually connect.

533
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:07,553
I don't know if that answers your question.

534
00:24:07,873 --> 00:24:13,698
No, that's cool. Yeah. We have an open source SIG meetup on Thursday, so hope to see you there.

535
00:24:13,698 --> 00:24:13,878
Cool.

536
00:24:21,423 --> 00:24:25,287
Hi, I had a question about secrets, as in, like, say,

537
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:29,170
maintaining the database, the logs, running servers,

538
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:29,770
and stuff like that.

539
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,553
One of my concerns with open source is that, I mean,

540
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:35,935
everybody can see everything about, say, my prod database

541
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:39,598
keys and all of this kind of security issues

542
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:42,321
that I find concerning.

543
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,862
How does the game handle that?

544
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:48,105
Are you asking about in terms of, like, stopping cheaters?

545
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:49,847
Or you're asking in terms of, like, storing passwords

546
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:50,207
and stuff?

547
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:59,077
basically who is running these servers, who is maintaining and paying for them, and when basically if people are debbing them, using on local environments,

548
00:24:59,077 --> 00:24:59,837
there's all sorts of just

549
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:07,101
they would have to see the nooks and crannies of this in a way that yes, it could lead to hacking, it could lead to all

550
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:14,885
sorts of problems with just all the shared servers, and who's maintaining this, how exactly does that ecosystem work if it's all open contributors?

551
00:25:15,777 --> 00:25:22,459
So in terms of the code base itself, we have configuration files that are not...

552
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:25,841
We have configuration files that are on the repository as templates,

553
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:30,603
but with different information on the actual servers, so passwords and stuff aren't stored.

554
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:38,467
In terms of who's running the servers, right now it's one guy who is just really really good at sysadmining and stuff

555
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:44,050
and has been pretty good about like stopping DDoS attacks, that kind of thing.

556
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:53,655
As for cheating, I'm assuming that is in regards to how it's a lot easier to find out exploits and things by reading source code.

557
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:59,713
Our answer for that is when we do see a new exploit,

558
00:25:59,713 --> 00:26:01,014
it happened this week actually,

559
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:03,256
of there was a server crashing bug

560
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:05,377
that was actually related to our code itself.

561
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:09,060
Because we have so many eyes on this code base

562
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,802
at any given point, the problem was identified

563
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:15,245
in like 15 seconds and a pull request was made

564
00:26:15,245 --> 00:26:16,025
in like a minute.

565
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:21,641
Of course, that doesn't extend to everything, and of course some cheats are kind of just like

566
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:25,043
problematic with the game engine itself, or like,

567
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:28,444
if you're a game that has a lot stronger control of the client than we do,

568
00:26:28,444 --> 00:26:31,685
then client-side cheats are kind of

569
00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:37,628
more or less unsolvable without like, you know, Vanguard and that type of overlapping stuff.

570
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:40,849
Finding exploits definitely happens, but

571
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,610
we're pretty good about fixing them. Does that help answer the question?
