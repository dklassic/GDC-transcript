00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:06,994
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:14,258
Hello and welcome to the level design and Hitman guiding players in a non-linear sandbox

3
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:14,518
game.

4
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:20,141
Today we're going to talk you through the journey that we had with our tutorial and

5
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:23,122
the guidance system that we implemented in the latest installment of Hitman.

6
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:26,905
And this doesn't work.

7
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:28,445
Excellent.

8
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:34,262
My name is Jakob and I'm a principal level designer at IO Interactive.

9
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:37,827
I've been there for 13 years, made a number of Hitman games,

10
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:40,069
Hitman Contract where I was a scripter,

11
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:42,232
Hitman Blood Money where I was a scripter,

12
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:43,773
and I also worked on a tutorial.

13
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:47,157
And then Kane & Lynch where I turned into level design

14
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:50,261
and became owner of the tutorial again.

15
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:57,544
And then we had Hitman Absolution, where I became the lead level designer and also did some work on the tutorial.

16
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:02,126
And then last, as principal level designer, I also designed the tutorial.

17
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:03,707
So that's what I'm going to talk about today.

18
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:07,851
Yes, and my name is Mette, and you can all hear me.

19
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:08,271
That's great.

20
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:10,753
I'm a level designer at IOO.

21
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:14,516
And while Jakob, he was making amazing titles,

22
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,018
I was going to school, like literally.

23
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,380
I started in ninth grade when Jakob started at IOO.

24
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,883
But since then, I've gone to the University of Aarhus,

25
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:27,285
where I studied interaction design, where I got my master's.

26
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,807
Then I went to DADU, where I was a game designer,

27
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:30,968
and I went to Academy of Art.

28
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:36,910
I produced a few tablet titles and I learned how to paint a little, and then after my thesis

29
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,871
I got my dream job at IOO where I designed the guide.

30
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:47,834
The agenda for today, first of all we would like to introduce Hitman of course, and then

31
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:54,036
the level Showstopper, which takes place in Paris, which is the big level that we launched

32
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:54,556
in March.

33
00:01:55,757 --> 00:02:04,564
Then we want to talk about the closed alpha report, which was quite a pillar in our development

34
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:05,285
of Hitman.

35
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:10,769
Then we want to talk about the mission, which is also going to function a little bit as

36
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:14,432
an agenda, where we talk about the tutorial and the guide.

37
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:17,275
And then hopefully we'll have time for questions.

38
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:25,032
Alright, so what is Hitman? For those of you who don't know, Hitman is about 1847, the guy on the screen here.

39
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:29,099
He's a highly trained assassin and he travels the world and kills people for money.

40
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:34,344
The game is a third-person creative stealth action game.

41
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:40,768
And it's an episodic game, which means that we're releasing it in episodes, roughly a month in between.

42
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:47,333
The first one went live in March, and that allows us to engage with the community in a whole new way,

43
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:50,915
where we can look at the content and actually react to what they're saying about the game,

44
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:53,197
and how they play it, and what they like and what they don't like.

45
00:02:54,257 --> 00:03:00,099
And also, today we're actually releasing a new episode, so there's a launch party, we just shipped it three hours ago.

46
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:06,381
The game is a lot about disguises and social stealth. That's one of the key mechanics we have in it.

47
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,442
It's about infiltrating and going close to a target under disguise.

48
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:17,646
We also have a very, very, very important part of the game, and that is the freedom of approach.

49
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:20,467
We don't tell you how to complete the missions.

50
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:24,810
It's almost like a puzzle game where you have to figure out how do I get away with murder.

51
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,932
So if you want to use explosives, that's one thing, that's fine.

52
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:29,353
If you want to use poison, that's fine.

53
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:33,875
If you want to use your sniper rifle, that's also fine, just as long as the guy dies.

54
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:39,781
These are the five games that led up to Hitman.

55
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:43,166
I just want to talk about Blood Money and Absolution for a bit.

56
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,311
Because from a level design perspective, these two are different.

57
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:51,639
Blood Money had these open sandbox levels where, again, you had a lot of freedom of approach.

58
00:03:53,729 --> 00:04:00,293
Hitman Absolution, we did more kind of small levels, like 70, and then divided by checkpoints.

59
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:04,595
So they were a lot easier to kind of digest for the player.

60
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:12,720
But this time we wanted to combine the sandbox missions from Blood Money with the AI fidelity and the game mechanics

61
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,282
that are a lot higher fidelity than what we saw in Blood Money.

62
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:21,485
So we want to combine the two into Hitman and just to show you guys what it looks like

63
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:23,727
I have a trailer that will kind of explain a bit

64
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:29,931
The essence of a sandbox game like Hitman is freedom of approach

65
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:39,517
Where you go, how you infiltrate, who you become

66
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:43,339
Knowing which disguises give you access is key

67
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,720
But beware

68
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:48,377
Some individuals are more observant than others.

69
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:49,237
Hey, who are you?

70
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:51,657
Hey, hey, watch out!

71
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:55,098
Be prepared to improvise.

72
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:56,218
Where is he?

73
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:56,899
You see him, anyone?

74
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:58,799
Yeah, where the hell did he go?

75
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,440
As you experiment with your play style...

76
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,820
We lost him!

77
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,401
Each hit can go from bloody murder...

78
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,402
...to a genuine masterpiece of assassination.

79
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,300
Complete mastery of a level is rewarded.

80
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:26,442
As your skills evolve over time, so do your options.

81
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:30,063
Prepare equipment in advance,

82
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:33,584
and plan the perfect hit.

83
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,805
New locations will appear over time.

84
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:40,526
You will travel the world.

85
00:05:41,586 --> 00:05:43,367
New missions, new targets.

86
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:48,715
Some targets only ever surface once, for a limited time.

87
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:51,358
When they are gone,

88
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:53,940
they are gone forever.

89
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:02,189
Yes. Our story today starts with our alpha build.

90
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,891
This was the first...

91
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:10,089
time the public outside of IOWA actually got to play the game and we of course weren't

92
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:14,770
finished but we created this palace that you see here. It's a four-story building located

93
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,771
in Paris and there's a surrounding garden and this is the entire level. The palace has

94
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:24,773
a complete interior so there's a lot of square meters to kind of knock yourself around with.

95
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:31,455
The mission for Agent 47 is to infiltrate the palace to eliminate Viktor Novikov and Dalia Margolis, the two targets.

96
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:37,077
When the mission starts, you start out front and then you're on your own, so you have to figure out how to pull it off.

97
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:42,398
Viktor Novikov, he roams the ground floor where he is attending his fashion show.

98
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:44,239
He's a fashion brand owner.

99
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:53,922
And then on the side he's running this spy community where they sell secrets in this secret auction on the top floor of the palace where Dalia is.

100
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:58,926
And then we, in the alpha build, we sent this out to the players.

101
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,329
They have a lot of things to do in the palace.

102
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:08,474
There's a lot of items, hammers, disguises, fire extinguishers, fireworks setups, a diorama.

103
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:11,997
There's escape helicopters, rat poison in the basement.

104
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:15,500
So there's tons of options and ways to go about completing your mission.

105
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,502
So that we gave to all the players.

106
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:24,747
But what we got back was that some of them, they actually did fine.

107
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:32,956
Yeah, thanks a lot man, real considerate.

108
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:46,884
But others, they did it like this.

109
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:53,388
That is Viktor Novikov, head of Sanguin and ringleader of Iago. Quite the wisdom.

110
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:08,829
Yeah, so Dahlia and Novikov won and Hitman 0.

111
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:13,553
They didn't use the palace, right?

112
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:16,496
Yes, and then we had the closed alpha.

113
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:22,868
We were really, really proud of what we were presenting to the players in this build.

114
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:24,990
The closed alpha is the first time we went live.

115
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:29,296
Hitman is a live game, so we wanted to do that as early as possible in the process.

116
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:35,663
And this was absolutely the biggest user base ever who got to play our level.

117
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:42,047
We knew maybe this would be a little bit tricky because there was a lot of stuff in this level

118
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:48,309
and we knew that they didn't have a tutorial, we didn't have any guidance, and we were of course working on both at this time.

119
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,370
We already had prototypes.

120
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:54,932
And our fears were confirmed, and maybe with a little bit on top.

121
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,514
They didn't really have a good understanding on how to navigate.

122
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:01,876
They had a hard time getting an overview.

123
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:05,937
and they just generally found it very, very difficult to approach.

124
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:09,138
We were prepared for this, kind of.

125
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,860
But what we were not prepared for was the fact that they felt that the level was empty.

126
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:23,323
When you are presented with such a big level, it can be a little bit intimidating

127
00:09:23,383 --> 00:09:27,005
and you can feel like a tourist sort of just being dumped there,

128
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,285
and that can be a little uncomfortable.

129
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:35,727
And we realized that maybe they were just presented somehow with the tip of the iceberg.

130
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:37,888
Maybe they didn't know how to find all this stuff.

131
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,788
Because we knew it was there, we were pretty sure, because we put it there.

132
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,810
So maybe we should do something in order to make sure that they could find it.

133
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,311
So the direction became, make the best Hitman tutorial ever,

134
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,192
and teach the players to think like Hitman.

135
00:09:56,927 --> 00:10:03,313
and also design a level guidance system that would help them find the rest of the iceberg.

136
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:06,637
But it was very important for us that we wouldn't like shove it down their throat.

137
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:07,878
We didn't want to force their hand.

138
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,601
So this became the mission.

139
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,444
Wanted to teach them how to operate the game.

140
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:16,587
Wanted to teach them the Hitman fundamentals of the game.

141
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:20,150
And we wanted for them to be able to set their own goals,

142
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,551
because for us that really felt like that was,

143
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:25,512
that was what it meant to think like a hitman,

144
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:27,954
to kind of, you know, find those possibilities,

145
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,054
those weak points and think,

146
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:30,215
hey, I'm gonna use that later.

147
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:34,077
And then the second part became,

148
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,278
well, we need to show them the iceberg,

149
00:10:36,318 --> 00:10:38,599
we need to find a way to illuminate it.

150
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,441
And we need to encourage replay while we do this.

151
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:43,682
So yes, now Jakob is gonna talk a little bit

152
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:44,442
about the tutorial.

153
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:45,303
Yes.

154
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:53,793
At this point we had the showstopper that you just saw, and then we had a prototype of the tutorial.

155
00:10:54,473 --> 00:11:00,415
And the tutorial is, the idea is that it's set in the past, it's 20 years before the game.

156
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:07,257
It allows us to peek into the background of Agent 47 where we've never been there before in the story,

157
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:12,919
so we also give something new to the fans about 47 and how he was trained and where he's coming from.

158
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:21,765
So the idea was to create the ICA, which is the agency that employs Hitman, to create their training facility.

159
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:29,930
And what they do is that they create these training mock-ups where you could then, you know, get taught like Hitman would be taught.

160
00:11:32,044 --> 00:11:43,354
So what we did for this prototype is that we kind of, we imagined that this is all the mechanics in Hitman games, so the way we looked at them was that, okay, they can be roughly divided into these five categories.

161
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:47,518
We have the ever-present ones, we have the item-dependent ones.

162
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:54,524
Ever-present ones is like running and crouching and all the stuff he can do without, it's like you and the controller can do.

163
00:11:55,786 --> 00:12:01,451
Item dependent ones, that's things that require specific items that unlock new kind of actions with 47.

164
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:08,057
And then we have the environmentally dependent ones such as agility, drain pipes, cover systems and all of that.

165
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:11,900
And then we get to the juicy bits which are the NPC dependent ones.

166
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,183
Of course you need people to subdue and kill and all of that stuff.

167
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:20,708
And then on the far right we have the NPC alert behaviors which is when they get angry, right?

168
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:21,870
There's something that we also want to do.

169
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:27,250
So what we did was that we looked at this and then we created a number of test chambers

170
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,212
where the idea was that each chamber would then be an isolated kind of proving ground

171
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:37,014
for a specific feature so we could teach you how to throw stuff, we could teach you how

172
00:12:37,074 --> 00:12:42,656
to subdue people, all of that, and then have them in small compartmentalized chambers.

173
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:47,259
that wouldn't affect each other because what we saw in the showstopper is that when they

174
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,961
get spotted, then the entire thing cascades and then they affect the entire level by getting

175
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:53,062
spotted in one corner.

176
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:57,124
So here we could harness this chaos and have it under control.

177
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:03,447
And then we gave that to the users and the users tested it and it was pretty fine.

178
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,248
They got the idea.

179
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,230
But then we looked at the level and it's like, okay.

180
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:13,230
This tutorial is not really representative of the game,

181
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,470
right?

182
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,312
It's like we're distilling it into some very simple

183
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:18,314
mechanics, but when we add everything together,

184
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:19,675
the complexity just explodes.

185
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:24,298
And the tutorial didn't do this, so they weren't really

186
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:25,639
any better.

187
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,842
They just got a little more time to actually try it.

188
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,096
So it was back to the drawing board.

189
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:35,317
We sat down and looked at each other and said, OK,

190
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,277
we need to do something about this,

191
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:40,158
because we have to change the way we think

192
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:41,478
about this tutorial.

193
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:45,199
So we came up with the mantra, you fight as you train.

194
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:48,179
It's an old saying in the army that you fight as you train.

195
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,400
And the idea is that once you get stressed,

196
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,980
you lose all ability to reason.

197
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,061
So we need to have all the reactions on you,

198
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:56,661
kind of deeply inside you, so you

199
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:57,881
don't have to think about the stuff.

200
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:58,562
You just do it.

201
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:03,245
So we have to create as real a training scenario as we can.

202
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,229
Then we need to build sandboxes because that's what the game is.

203
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:13,633
So we condensed the showstopper idea into a tiny sandbox,

204
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,215
which is the drawing that you're seeing here.

205
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:20,459
This is a paper prototype I made where I just cut up papers until I get the shape that I want.

206
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,595
But this is what we need to do.

207
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:28,097
Then we need to team up with the user team, user research team,

208
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:33,180
and do rapid prototype testing, where we just do it every second week,

209
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,601
punch out a new build, try it out again, with a smaller group of people.

210
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:40,623
And then we need to stop calling it the tutorial,

211
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:43,204
and instead we're going to rebrand it to the Prologue.

212
00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:45,745
And now I have to say the Prologue for the rest of this talk.

213
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:46,505
That's going to be a challenge.

214
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:50,531
Because this is something different.

215
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:52,532
Because people came to me and said, OK, Jakob,

216
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:53,832
we're going to put this in the tutorial,

217
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,472
and we're going to put this mechanic in the tutorial.

218
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:58,653
They had this linear compartmentalized mentality

219
00:14:58,713 --> 00:14:59,653
about the whole tutorial.

220
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:00,894
So we had to call it something else.

221
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:03,954
So what we came up with was a new structure

222
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:05,115
for the opening of the game.

223
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,575
Part one, the arrival, where we kind of open up

224
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:09,576
the scene, the whole training session.

225
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:14,237
Part two, the training, where we learn Agent 47, and the player

226
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:16,397
mostly, how to be Agent 47.

227
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:24,061
And then we have a final test, which is the second sandbox of the prologue, where we will test his skills.

228
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,374
I'm just going to go through each of these parts.

229
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:31,635
The opening of the game, that's this helipad.

230
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:34,075
And this is the ICA training facility.

231
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:36,256
It's a concrete construction far up north.

232
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,518
And 47 is just dropped there by helicopter,

233
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:42,058
and then he's on his own.

234
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:42,918
And so is the player.

235
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,319
So we don't tell you how to do anything.

236
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,220
Nothing really happens here.

237
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,160
It's just nice and cold.

238
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,161
and then your job as the player is to figure out, okay, I'm in control

239
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:55,822
and then you need to find the door up here. Sorry,

240
00:15:56,342 --> 00:16:00,103
things are getting ahead of myself here. There we go.

241
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:04,844
So you just have to... I'm out of power.

242
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:10,246
I'm not. So you have to find the door that leads inside the facility.

243
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:11,826
I am out of power.

244
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:20,537
Yes. Sorry about that.

245
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,760
All right, so one step back.

246
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,321
47 on the helipad.

247
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:27,582
Learn how to navigate.

248
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:28,502
Learn how to use the camera.

249
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,883
Enter the facility.

250
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:33,206
Then we have part two, which is the guided training.

251
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:36,608
And this is where the juicy bit of the teaching actually happens.

252
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:44,063
to the untrained eye this looks exactly like the drawing I've shown before and it kind of is

253
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:50,044
but this time we actually sat down and then we found the meaningful mechanics to learn the player

254
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:57,106
in order for him to kind of do a hit so this was about infiltrating eliminating and exfiltrating

255
00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:01,567
so instead of just going through all the mechanics one by one we picked the ones that you need

256
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:04,968
in order

257
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:11,159
You pick the ones that you need in order to complete a mission.

258
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:17,064
And then we created a story for the mission that you have to infiltrate this yard in order

259
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:20,246
to eliminate the owner who's an art thief.

260
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:24,930
And then all of a sudden there was kind of a small story there all of a sudden.

261
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,533
And then it turned into that these missions that they do at this ICA facility is actually

262
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:31,455
reenactments of former hits.

263
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:38,910
What we did next was, okay, but we need to add the rest, right, because it's a sandbox.

264
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,450
So we have all the things surrounding this as well.

265
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:47,772
And then in order to help the player do this, we then used a guide which is kind of pointing

266
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:50,872
you towards the next point in your mission example here.

267
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:58,134
So the requirements for the Prolog training here was that it has to be a real sandbox

268
00:17:58,174 --> 00:17:58,414
mission.

269
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,474
We've just been through that.

270
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:02,375
We need a very, very robust guide because at this point...

271
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:05,189
you haven't played any Hitman so far.

272
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,891
So we had to make the guidance system,

273
00:18:07,931 --> 00:18:10,272
the thing that tells you what to do, very, very robust

274
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:12,273
because things can go wrong, right?

275
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:14,814
And in my experience, there's three different ways

276
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:15,714
to play a game, right?

277
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:18,556
You do as we expect you to, or you do...

278
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:23,757
your own thing because you want to see how far can you push this game until it breaks.

279
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:27,998
And that's fine with us because then you're in on it and you're breaking it on purpose

280
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:29,478
just to see what happens. That's fine.

281
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,939
But then you have the last group of people, which are these people who really want to play your game

282
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:37,059
but they somehow mix it up and they get confused.

283
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:38,800
It doesn't really work out for them.

284
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,880
And those are the ones that we really have to take care of

285
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,381
because those are the ones that are going to throw away the controller and say,

286
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:45,121
I'm done with this.

287
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:52,804
And then, yeah, so those are the ones that I'm very, very careful about doing this guide for.

288
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:59,167
So it had to be taken into consideration that you would play it backwards or infiltrate in a different way.

289
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:02,088
Then it had to be easy but not boring.

290
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:05,010
We have a wall of difficulty in the showstopper we learned,

291
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,712
so again, instead we need to kind of get them on board and have them, yeah, get them rolling

292
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:14,114
and actually have a small success experience here to begin with.

293
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:16,818
The only way to fail is death.

294
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:20,061
You can't play the training mission wrong, right?

295
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:23,604
That would be kind of weird in a way, that we punish you severely.

296
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:26,226
So the only way to actually get punished is if you die.

297
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:31,931
We do not feature Cripple you, which means that we're not cheating with what 47 can do.

298
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:34,753
He is as real as he is when you play the showstopper.

299
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:40,518
That's a very important thing to us, because otherwise you wouldn't train as you fight.

300
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:41,880
Fight as you train.

301
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:49,044
And then we only want you to kill the target because Agent 47 is actually a very, very professional assassin.

302
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:54,928
So in the fantasy of a lot of, especially the fans, then he is only going for the targets.

303
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:58,470
He doesn't kill the cleaning person to get the disguise. He finds other ways.

304
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,973
A quick breakdown of the first play through here, right?

305
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:05,314
We start outside the yacht.

306
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,396
And again, it's made of plywood.

307
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:08,156
It's not a real yacht.

308
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:09,958
It's something they built inside this facility.

309
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:11,979
And you're told off by the guards.

310
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:13,140
You can't enter here, they say.

311
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:13,961
All right, cool.

312
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:14,882
I need to go in.

313
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:16,143
You do some infiltration.

314
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:17,384
You do some agility.

315
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:18,264
You go to cover.

316
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:21,147
And things are prompted using different systems.

317
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,748
We have this prompt up there.

318
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:32,252
And then you subdue the mechanic, you drag him away, you get his outfit and now you're on your way onto the yacht.

319
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:35,173
Here we push a sign about threats.

320
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:45,037
We had a hard time getting people to understand these dots, which is kind of the easiest way for us to actually communicate that these guys know who you are.

321
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:47,878
So they can see through this guy, you have to be very careful about that.

322
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,140
And as a result we saw people infiltrating and what they did was that you have the guy over here.

323
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:55,865
who's a threat, if he sees you then he's going to get angry.

324
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:59,970
And then people were gluing themselves to the car over here, so that really worked well.

325
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:02,993
We teach you how to use instinct to locate the target.

326
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:08,200
We follow the target and then he is rejected again.

327
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,103
So, okay, my disguise is no longer valid up there.

328
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:16,229
I need to get a new one, so now you need to disguise yourself as a crew member.

329
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:21,632
And here we actually, yeah, the throwing thing wasn't really a part of the original pan,

330
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:23,253
but we added it because it's really fun.

331
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:28,436
So the poor guy, he takes a wrench to the head and then, bing, and into the freezer.

332
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:30,838
So hide body and yet another disguise.

333
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:39,435
As 4070 is taking on disguises, he opens up new options in the missions where he can use the disguises to his advantage.

334
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:43,740
So in this place he's blending in, which means that he's taking the role of someone in the game.

335
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,024
And in this case he's taking a role as the bartender, and the target is standing right there in front of him.

336
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:53,209
So now we're very, very close, but as you saw before, if I just get out my gun here and just start shooting,

337
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,851
then it wouldn't work, so we can't do that with the player.

338
00:21:57,486 --> 00:22:04,431
We follow the target into his office, and it's a bit hard to see, but there's actually a bodyguard denying you access here.

339
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:06,413
So, again, you're denied access.

340
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:08,174
Okay, your disguise is not good enough for this either.

341
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:12,857
You sneak around, climb the window, and we prompt you for cover again.

342
00:22:12,877 --> 00:22:16,360
We prompt you for inventory, how to shoot and aim.

343
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:21,835
And then the target is off, and then it's about exfiltrating, it's about leaving the yard.

344
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:25,438
No one notices this when you shoot the guy.

345
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:32,525
And then once you're off, then it's find another way off, because of the threat.

346
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:37,989
And then crowbar, lock doors, and eventually complete the mission.

347
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:51,435
So this playthrough was designed in a way where we knew from Absolution that we had to show, we had to ask the user to do things several times in order for that to kind of stick and become something he would do without thinking about it.

348
00:22:52,555 --> 00:23:01,979
And in this case, we had three times we told you about threats and three times we told you about sentries because that's core of the design and of the level design.

349
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:05,000
This is this whole who has access where, the whole disguise gameplay.

350
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:09,324
Twice cover hide body and change disguises and some climbing through windows.

351
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:13,487
And then once we had the... actually down here we have the gun, right?

352
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:18,271
Which is... yeah, interesting in terms of what we think is important, right?

353
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:21,914
So we put a lot of effort into getting the players to understand the disguise gameplay.

354
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:26,158
After that, the training wheels are off, we have a final test.

355
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,079
No guidance.

356
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:30,837
in a way, but not heavily tutorialized.

357
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:35,298
And then we introduce you to the player guidance system. In this mission, Agent 47

358
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:38,199
have to eliminate a guy who's being flown away in

359
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,320
this jet, and you have to figure out how to get to him.

360
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,682
And that involves using the ejection seat.

361
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:53,986
And it also wraps up our story, so the whole training at the ICA, one thing we do when we start the mission,

362
00:23:54,147 --> 00:24:00,733
we meet Diana, and then here, when we're back at the helipad and we talk to Diana, we give 47 his name,

363
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:06,459
and eventually he leaves, and he is on his way into this showstopper 20 years later.

364
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,582
So now the flow looks like this.

365
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,282
That's fine. We had the arrival, we had the training, we had the final test.

366
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:17,124
And then the showstopper and people were playing this and trying it out and it worked fine.

367
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:21,287
So that kind of checked off the Hitman fundamentals. Excellent.

368
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:23,829
So now they know how to infiltrate, they know how to eliminate the target,

369
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:25,670
they know how to exfiltrate and that's fine.

370
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:28,893
But we were still lacking the set their own goals

371
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:33,396
because we really felt that that was important for them in this giant showstopper context.

372
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:37,599
They had to figure out how to do, kind of figure out what they wanted to do.

373
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:53,985
If we just looked at mechanics again from before, as I said before, we handpicked the mechanics we thought was important enough for you to actually put into the training, but we didn't put everything in, which means there was something left out.

374
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:57,786
The most important ones were actually this one, the NPC alert behaviors.

375
00:24:57,826 --> 00:25:04,028
Again, we saw people getting stressed out when the AI became angry at them, when they were trespassing, when they were discovered doing something bad.

376
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:05,629
So this was very much about...

377
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:07,651
they haven't actually seen this.

378
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:10,897
So when things go wrong in the showstopper,

379
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,419
they're still going to see new things

380
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,561
they haven't tried before.

381
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:16,246
So they needed more training.

382
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:20,393
So we literally asked them to play the level again.

383
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,533
And we give them a different briefing.

384
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:26,934
That was the idea.

385
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:27,655
We sat down.

386
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,216
OK, so we need to give them a new briefing.

387
00:25:29,256 --> 00:25:31,558
We need to explain to them that now they have to do it again.

388
00:25:31,818 --> 00:25:33,119
And people were like, OK, again.

389
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:37,462
And the idea was that before, we had the guided play-through

390
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:37,923
with the guide.

391
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:40,685
But this time, we wanted them to kind of seek out

392
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:42,026
other things in the mission.

393
00:25:43,847 --> 00:25:44,848
Again, set their own goals.

394
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:45,849
Find these other things.

395
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,775
So we created a challenge prototype, which was an alternate version of the yacht.

396
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:57,841
I just stripped out the guidance system that was on top of it and then inserted some items

397
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:00,003
and we just had a vanilla version of the yacht.

398
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:10,834
And we created a challenge paper handout because we decided that, okay, this is actually, this fits very well with our challenge system because we hadn't talked about that in the player's perspective yet.

399
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:17,538
And the challenge system is the way that you progress in the game. You level up your locations instead of leveling up Agent 47.

400
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:23,022
This is how you unlock all the good stuff, fancy explosives and fancy sniper rifles.

401
00:26:24,403 --> 00:26:29,006
So this would also be a great opportunity for us to actually show the player the challenge system.

402
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:35,381
So we designed a group of challenges for the player that would be deliberately simple and easy.

403
00:26:35,882 --> 00:26:38,884
And they would also be deliberately kind of revealing about themselves.

404
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:46,168
So find the rat poison on deck 0, I think it's called, disguised as the yacht crew in level 0.

405
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:49,450
Then we have eliminate the target, drown the target in the toilet.

406
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:52,792
And the tricky part about that is that actually requires the rat poison.

407
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,594
So that's a thing you would have to find out for yourself.

408
00:26:56,034 --> 00:27:00,216
generator, use that to distract the guard. Fiber wire the target instead of just shooting him.

409
00:27:00,896 --> 00:27:06,578
Disguise yourself as the target's guest. So we kind of pointed you in a lot of different directions

410
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:12,361
inside the game as you were playing this. We threw in some extra items, so when you start up,

411
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:17,203
then 47 is placed in front of a table with some explosives, a lockpick, some coins.

412
00:27:17,863 --> 00:27:20,770
And then behind him we had assault rifles and shotguns,

413
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:24,319
so we could kind of give you all the tools that we kind of wanted you to play around with

414
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:26,304
and get an understanding of how the game worked.

415
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,041
There was still tutorialization in this version.

416
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:36,124
We created these, we used the pop-ups because as before, this is the same pop-up you saw

417
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:36,645
with the thread.

418
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:40,207
But this time it was telling you about how to place explosives in the world.

419
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:45,930
So whenever you picked up an explosive, this would pop up only two times in a lifetime

420
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,411
and then it would disappear forever.

421
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:50,613
So even if you kind of tried it again a bit later, then you wouldn't get this.

422
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:57,714
Then off to user test, and we, the first prototype was just a piece of paper with these ten challenges, right?

423
00:27:57,734 --> 00:28:03,581
So it's like, they played it, the mission started, and they say, okay, now you get this piece of paper and these ten challenges,

424
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,424
and you have to complete some of them, and then complete the mission again.

425
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:09,909
And then all of a sudden we saw them roaming around the yard.

426
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:14,251
they actually began to set goals for themselves, right?

427
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,692
So they picked a couple of challenges,

428
00:28:15,732 --> 00:28:17,254
and then they began to explore the app

429
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:19,617
to find these solutions for these challenges

430
00:28:19,637 --> 00:28:20,237
that they were using.

431
00:28:20,838 --> 00:28:22,460
And as they did that, they actually stumbled

432
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,982
on the other things in the challenges.

433
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,263
So all of a sudden, they were connecting

434
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:26,364
the dots in their head.

435
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:28,767
They began to, okay, so there's also the generator over there.

436
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:32,989
So armed with the knowledge of the first playthrough, the layout of the yard,

437
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:35,970
then we actually had them kind of go nuts here.

438
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,711
And some of them they actually, because we later on created,

439
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:43,253
so it would prompt you again if you wanted to train more when you did this.

440
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,634
And because there were still unchecked challenges, of course,

441
00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:47,934
some people had to go back because they had to find them all.

442
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:53,934
We also learned that the setting was very, very tolerant.

443
00:28:54,395 --> 00:28:57,216
It's okay to do experiments in this place, because as I said before,

444
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:01,058
when the Paris fashion show level kind of cascades into chaos,

445
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:05,600
it feels very expensive. You're breaking something very, very, very expensive.

446
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,581
Whereas here, it's a plywood yard, right? That's fine.

447
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:12,883
So that worked really well, plus the whole training metaphor

448
00:29:12,943 --> 00:29:14,904
that he is there for the seven to get better,

449
00:29:15,364 --> 00:29:17,645
that actually also resonated very well for these people.

450
00:29:19,077 --> 00:29:30,148
And then, last but not least, we also got into the NPC reactions, where they provoked the NPCs in ways that would be very, very hard for us to actually tutorialize and use the real gameplay without heavily scripting it.

451
00:29:30,608 --> 00:29:35,373
So they got the reactions from the characters in the game as they would react in the showstopper.

452
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:40,998
So again, we taught them something real, something that would be exactly the same when they would be playing it inside the showstopper.

453
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:44,112
So this is the final version we ended up with.

454
00:29:45,313 --> 00:29:47,035
The arrival scene, a guided playthrough,

455
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:50,357
and then again the freeform playthrough,

456
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:51,518
and then the final test.

457
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,661
And that then allowed us to check off this one.

458
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:56,842
So now it goes.

459
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:57,622
Yes.

460
00:29:58,503 --> 00:29:59,584
Let's see if this one works now.

461
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:00,565
Yes, it does.

462
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:01,245
Thank god.

463
00:30:02,085 --> 00:30:04,667
OK, so now we're back and standing

464
00:30:04,687 --> 00:30:05,668
in front of the showstopper.

465
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:08,791
We're a little bit better prepared this time.

466
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:09,651
We've got a nice suit.

467
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:10,632
We've still got a silly hat.

468
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:11,152
Oh, sorry.

469
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:13,975
But yeah, but things will be fine now.

470
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:17,237
So now we just have to concentrate

471
00:30:17,277 --> 00:30:19,519
on making these experiences visible,

472
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,460
as I mentioned about this iceberg

473
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,961
that we had to illuminate somehow.

474
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:26,184
And if you look at other games that are doing the same,

475
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:27,285
they often make quests.

476
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,489
If we look at a quick breakdown of a quest, you often have a guy saying,

477
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:34,732
hey, I have information for you, there's something cool over there, you can go and get it.

478
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:42,399
You travel great distances and you may come find a clue that will then unlock a conversation

479
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:44,621
that you can have with a person somewhere else.

480
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:49,666
You'll go and find this person and engaging in this conversation will activate

481
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:52,689
maybe a sequence or something that will then...

482
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:56,230
lead you to a new cool location where there's a boss fight.

483
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,511
And when you're done with the boss fight,

484
00:30:58,532 --> 00:30:59,452
you will get the treasure.

485
00:30:59,472 --> 00:31:01,513
This is a classic breakdown.

486
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:04,914
Not all games, the sandbox games, of course, doing this.

487
00:31:04,994 --> 00:31:07,095
But this is how one of these could look.

488
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:11,037
And if we look at what really defines these types of quests,

489
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:12,438
they're often story dictated.

490
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:16,760
They have this checkpoint structure often.

491
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,641
Some kind of clue will unlock something

492
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:20,701
that will unlock something.

493
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:21,982
And that's completely OK.

494
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:32,068
Often they are a part of, or they are, like a big epic quest of sorts, that will maybe go on for a longer run.

495
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:34,769
And they have these unique endings.

496
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:43,654
Now if we look at how quests would maybe look like in Hitman, and if we look at Hitman in general, it's not story dictated.

497
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:51,379
That was kind of one of the goals for Hitman, that we didn't want to make it story dictated, we wanted to make it more free.

498
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,981
Anything can happen at any given time.

499
00:31:56,142 --> 00:31:59,524
This is something that's a little bit frustrating sometimes as a level designer,

500
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:02,446
but also what makes this game so awesome and unique.

501
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:05,388
Anything can just happen any time. You can kill everyone.

502
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:09,690
And that's actually a problem when you're making a quest,

503
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,931
because someone could just go missing.

504
00:32:12,652 --> 00:32:18,275
We want to encourage replay, and often these big unique quests, they don't really...

505
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:21,657
they want to give you this one really really cool experience.

506
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,940
Of course we have lots of stories that can be replayed, but in general this is more about that

507
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,481
one time when you meet it that's going to be really awesome.

508
00:32:31,522 --> 00:32:34,846
And of course all our quests have to end with target eliminated

509
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:42,435
We're not looking at unique endings necessarily. Well for each mission that is that is sort of your your goal

510
00:32:42,555 --> 00:32:45,858
We want you to kill the guy get out of there. So

511
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:51,585
We want you to to kill and we want you to do it again and again

512
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,322
And when we look at this kind of structure,

513
00:32:56,022 --> 00:32:58,824
we realize that it was strangely applicable

514
00:32:58,904 --> 00:33:00,246
to the movie Groundhog Day.

515
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:03,468
Don't know if any of you in here have seen Groundhog Day.

516
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:06,230
I'm guessing maybe you have.

517
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,151
It's from the 90s.

518
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:09,272
It's a great movie starring Bill Murray,

519
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:11,594
who is trapped in a time loop.

520
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,597
he has to experience the same day again and again and again.

521
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,982
Yes, and when you realize that you have to do it again,

522
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,723
like in this tutorial, again, really,

523
00:33:21,743 --> 00:33:24,666
it can give you that kind of emotion

524
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:25,687
that's going on in his face.

525
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:29,551
But there's also this really, really positive sides to it

526
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,893
because all of a sudden you get this amazing control

527
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:33,334
because you know what's going to happen.

528
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:34,875
at any given time.

529
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:39,819
You know exactly when that waitress is going to walk through the door, you know exactly

530
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:44,101
when Novikov is going to go smoke, and you know just where the sniper barge is.

531
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:49,545
So this can be an incredible empowering tool that we had to use in a nice way.

532
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:54,288
But you can also design it in a bad way,

533
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:57,490
where this constant recognition of patterns

534
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,351
can become a little bit unbearable,

535
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,992
maybe to the point of you just wanting to kill yourself

536
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:04,734
or rebel for the sake of rebelling.

537
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:08,697
That's the negative side of it, and we didn't want to,

538
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:10,058
of course, design for that.

539
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,560
So if we look at Groundhog Day quests,

540
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,121
we knew that they had to be optional.

541
00:34:16,915 --> 00:34:20,338
That was one of the big problems that Bill Murray is facing,

542
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:21,899
that he is feeling trapped.

543
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,200
We don't want to give you the trap feeling.

544
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,102
It had to be something nice that you

545
00:34:25,122 --> 00:34:26,183
could do if you wanted to.

546
00:34:26,203 --> 00:34:30,287
We want them to be flexible because anything can happen.

547
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:32,328
You can kill everyone and anything,

548
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,850
and you can do whatever you want.

549
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,171
So it's a playground.

550
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:39,114
We wanted it to continue being a playground while still having

551
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:41,476
this sort of having this guide there.

552
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:45,028
And then we needed to be consistent.

553
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,009
Again, you need to know exactly when

554
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:48,429
Novikov is going to go smoke.

555
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,870
That is really, really important.

556
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:55,412
So with these things in mind, let's look back

557
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:57,153
at our little quest breakdown and see

558
00:34:57,173 --> 00:34:58,874
what it would look like if we tried to shove that

559
00:34:58,934 --> 00:34:59,834
onto Hitman.

560
00:35:01,115 --> 00:35:02,795
You probably don't want to walk up to the guy

561
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:05,436
and say, hey, do you know how I can kill Novikov?

562
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:08,218
Or you probably want to hear two people talking

563
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:09,638
about a secret meeting somewhere.

564
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:14,122
some guy who's in town that no one has met yet, so you can easily take his place.

565
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,306
We don't want you to travel great distances, we want you to infiltrate.

566
00:35:19,107 --> 00:35:22,270
Instead of like classic sandbox games, often very, very large.

567
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:29,556
Ours are large for Hitman, but we want you to really engage in the space that is there

568
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:32,118
and not spend hours traveling.

569
00:35:33,972 --> 00:35:34,533
Clues are fine.

570
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:36,174
We can take that directly.

571
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:39,877
We can have conversations with people.

572
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:40,558
That's OK.

573
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:42,780
We could use that in our quests.

574
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,002
But we want you to be incognito when you do it.

575
00:35:45,862 --> 00:35:48,585
We want you to use social stealth,

576
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:50,126
change disguises, and so on.

577
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,396
And we can use cutscenes.

578
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:57,117
Sequences are fine, as long as you can get out of them

579
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:57,978
very fast.

580
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:00,619
And there's no cheating, because everything

581
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,640
needs to be consistent.

582
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,740
That was one of the rules.

583
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,401
So we cannot teleport you.

584
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:07,963
We cannot just end the next part of the sequence

585
00:36:08,003 --> 00:36:09,704
somewhere in the back of the garden.

586
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:10,564
That's not OK.

587
00:36:13,116 --> 00:36:13,977
We don't have a spice.

588
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:16,419
We don't do that now.

589
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:20,643
And for the treasure chest, we would

590
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:25,008
like to make sure that we leave the player in a spot

591
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:26,669
where they know what to do next.

592
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,772
But we don't want to hand everything to them.

593
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:30,673
Again, we want an autonomous player.

594
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:32,255
We want real hitmen.

595
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:35,038
And we want to keep encouraging them.

596
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,316
So hitman quests became opportunities,

597
00:36:40,057 --> 00:36:41,598
because that is what they were.

598
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:44,441
They were opportunities to get close to your target.

599
00:36:46,182 --> 00:36:48,304
This is an example of an opportunity.

600
00:36:49,412 --> 00:36:54,234
and this is the the helmet crew grow the male model opportunity and where you can

601
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:55,354
listen in on these two

602
00:36:55,374 --> 00:36:59,336
uh... stylists and i don't think you can see them who's talking about helmet crew

603
00:36:59,356 --> 00:37:00,696
crew this new model in town

604
00:37:01,657 --> 00:37:03,117
and he kinda looks like you

605
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,778
which is really practical

606
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:06,679
uh...

607
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:12,102
And when you run around in this world and you can listen in on these conversations,

608
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:14,764
and this is where we have the opportunity of revealing.

609
00:37:14,824 --> 00:37:16,985
Again, you can't just walk up and say,

610
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:20,768
hey, tell me how to become a male model, because I really want to kill someone.

611
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:26,711
We need to let you sort of feel sneaky and listen in on people

612
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:30,694
who are having this conversation and really empower you in this Groundhog Day.

613
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:36,759
So, we needed some kind of system where you would still choose to track it, and we wanted

614
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:41,244
to have a system that will, again, illuminate the iceberg, show you this is interesting,

615
00:37:41,264 --> 00:37:42,385
this is something that you can use.

616
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:46,509
So we have the opportunity of revealing that then becomes opportunity revealed, where you

617
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:49,892
can then track it directly and say, yes, this sounds great.

618
00:37:50,652 --> 00:37:54,496
And of course, there's volumes and stuff, so if you run away, it's fine.

619
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:58,500
Nothing's going to happen, and it's going to be available for you later in your menu.

620
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:03,284
Because we really want you to play, and not stick around if you feel like you have to.

621
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:14,251
Yes, so here you come into the menu where Diana will give you her briefing and explain to you why this is such an important opportunity.

622
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:22,543
Because here you can take Helmut Kruger's place, obviously, and then have a secret meeting with Dahlia, who's one of your targets.

623
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:27,660
And these are the different opportunities

624
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,641
that we have in the level.

625
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:30,382
All the blue ones will lead to Dahlia.

626
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,204
The orange ones will lead to Novikov.

627
00:38:33,805 --> 00:38:35,747
We wanted you to be able to just browse through it.

628
00:38:36,027 --> 00:38:37,708
Again, we want to show you content.

629
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,830
And this is such a great way to show your content.

630
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,851
Instead of just saying, we have a huge level.

631
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:42,572
There's lots of stuff.

632
00:38:42,592 --> 00:38:43,052
Have fun.

633
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:45,054
We can say, well, this is a huge level.

634
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:45,714
There's lots of stuff.

635
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:46,095
Have fun.

636
00:38:46,635 --> 00:38:48,276
And you can just go in and choose one of these

637
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:50,358
if you want a little tour, again,

638
00:38:50,498 --> 00:38:51,699
if we use the tourist metaphor.

639
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,821
Because these will definitely take you

640
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:54,601
around the whole level.

641
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,521
So if we continue, you find Helmut Kruger.

642
00:38:58,561 --> 00:39:01,484
That's one of your opportunity steps.

643
00:39:02,225 --> 00:39:04,567
You have to investigate him, find out what he's up to.

644
00:39:05,187 --> 00:39:07,850
This is one of the clues that we have from the quest breakdown.

645
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:11,533
And you hear that he's on the phone with Dahlia,

646
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:13,075
and he's planning to meet her.

647
00:39:13,295 --> 00:39:15,177
And she says, call me back later.

648
00:39:15,697 --> 00:39:18,480
So I will tell you then where the meeting is.

649
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,721
And that's also practical.

650
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:24,970
Then you become Helmut Kruger and get rid of the body, because that's part of it, right?

651
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,692
We don't tell you to get rid of the body.

652
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,013
That's something that you can just do.

653
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,754
We just tell you to become Helmut Kruger.

654
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:33,355
Then we ask you to call Dahlia.

655
00:39:34,356 --> 00:39:38,178
You find her phone, or his phone, and then you call her and you say, hey, you want me

656
00:39:38,198 --> 00:39:39,279
to come up now?

657
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,761
And she's like, no, it's essential that you walk the runway.

658
00:39:42,561 --> 00:39:44,163
We want you to have a little fun while doing this.

659
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,407
So you get your makeup on.

660
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,210
And in the classic style of Hitman,

661
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,593
you can also just subdue that poor stylist instead.

662
00:39:54,215 --> 00:39:56,998
You get your Hitman on, you get your makeup on,

663
00:39:58,419 --> 00:39:59,781
and then you have to walk the catwalk.

664
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:03,857
Yes, and you walk the cat.

665
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:05,298
I'm not going to show the video.

666
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:06,358
You have to go and play it.

667
00:40:07,758 --> 00:40:09,999
So here you walk the catwalk, and then Dalia

668
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:10,820
thinks that's awesome.

669
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,000
So now you can go and meet with her.

670
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:15,321
And this is actually where we're going to sort of step back

671
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:16,982
and say, great, you've earned it.

672
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:19,743
Now you're alone with her, and you can do whatever you want.

673
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:24,646
Her assistant is leaving, she's great, Helmut, good to see you.

674
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:30,170
And then you can sit down and do all this role play with a huge conversation, and you

675
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,393
can just, you know, take your time, think about what you want to do, or you can just

676
00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:35,574
shoot her in the throat.

677
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:41,578
I realize this is a bit extreme, I didn't notice I was aiming at her throat.

678
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:46,601
There's also a nice poison opportunity, I can really recommend playing this one, it's

679
00:40:46,621 --> 00:40:47,102
lots of fun.

680
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:48,202
So.

681
00:40:49,268 --> 00:40:52,310
When we design opportunities, which is also a really

682
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,974
important lesson learned, we're also designing how to fail it.

683
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:00,917
Again, we have a pretty extreme environment.

684
00:41:00,937 --> 00:41:01,657
It's very organic.

685
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:02,498
Anything can happen.

686
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:06,881
And that means that this guide needs to be flexible.

687
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:09,783
And we need to then say, well, you can't do it anymore.

688
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:15,288
Because what if you accidentally dump his body with the outfit

689
00:41:15,528 --> 00:41:16,088
into the river?

690
00:41:17,038 --> 00:41:24,831
then it's gone. Right? You can also just meet Helmut while being him. That's also a little

691
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:29,157
strange. Um, you can also shoot the people who's going to reveal it.

692
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:31,106
then you're not going to hear about it.

693
00:41:31,326 --> 00:41:36,407
And then we can't really say that we can guide you anymore

694
00:41:36,467 --> 00:41:38,687
because we don't really have our reveal anymore.

695
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:39,448
That's lost forever.

696
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,548
But in this case, you can actually still play it.

697
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,809
The guide will sort of shut down and say, well, now we

698
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:47,629
can't do this anymore.

699
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:50,470
But you can keep going if you know it by heart.

700
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:52,091
Yeah.

701
00:41:54,594 --> 00:41:57,776
So around Paris, we have a bunch of opportunities spread out.

702
00:41:57,796 --> 00:41:58,836
You saw them in the menu.

703
00:41:58,876 --> 00:42:01,057
And these are some of the points where

704
00:42:01,097 --> 00:42:03,658
you can listen in on conversations,

705
00:42:03,778 --> 00:42:05,019
all the yellow ones for Novikov.

706
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:07,000
And in this case, it's also all conversations.

707
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,701
And this is an example of a static reveal.

708
00:42:10,342 --> 00:42:14,343
This is the guest list that will tell you

709
00:42:14,383 --> 00:42:17,285
which room Shigel Ghazali is living in

710
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:20,246
and will then help you become him, basically.

711
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:22,107
This is from the other side.

712
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:24,388
Yeah, we have them spread out.

713
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:27,930
And we also, the opportunities allows

714
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,471
us to show you some really cool sites.

715
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:33,474
The pavilion here in the garden is one of those cool sites.

716
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:36,736
And you can also have this really awesome moment

717
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:39,538
where you can blend in as a bodyguard

718
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:44,522
and participate in the super secret meeting

719
00:42:44,582 --> 00:42:47,023
and then get a little alone time with Novikov afterwards.

720
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,065
So, sorry, that was very loud.

721
00:42:51,744 --> 00:42:54,426
The opportunities allowed us to really show the players

722
00:42:54,486 --> 00:42:55,066
the iceberg.

723
00:42:55,587 --> 00:42:59,670
But now we really had to make sure that we were still

724
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,191
encouraging replay.

725
00:43:02,232 --> 00:43:04,454
Now this led us to some design principles.

726
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,457
And I may say up front that we broke all of these,

727
00:43:07,597 --> 00:43:09,198
and that is why we have them.

728
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:11,220
Lesson learned.

729
00:43:12,747 --> 00:43:15,008
Information should never be a prerequisite for progression.

730
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:17,769
An example could be in the Helmut Kruger opportunity

731
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:19,329
where you hear about the meeting.

732
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:25,552
In the beginning, when we did this,

733
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:28,734
Kruger would only drop the phone if you

734
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:29,834
had heard about the meeting.

735
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:32,820
There would be no phone unless you knew about it.

736
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:35,262
That's not a cool way to fix things.

737
00:43:36,002 --> 00:43:37,464
Of course, we fixed it very quickly,

738
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:40,406
made sure that wouldn't happen again, because that

739
00:43:40,446 --> 00:43:41,987
doesn't support consistency.

740
00:43:42,047 --> 00:43:42,888
That was one of our rules.

741
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:45,530
And be very mindful of this.

742
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,471
If you are doing anything similar,

743
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,573
make sure that you use real things in the world.

744
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:51,354
Use items.

745
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:52,375
Use anything else.

746
00:43:52,415 --> 00:43:55,337
Just don't use information if you want this playground.

747
00:43:57,319 --> 00:43:59,500
Opportunities should let go before they kill.

748
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:02,375
Again, I kind of mentioned it before.

749
00:44:02,395 --> 00:44:04,036
We want this autonomous player.

750
00:44:04,056 --> 00:44:05,957
We wanted them to have fun.

751
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:11,640
But this also brings me back to the whole fail condition part.

752
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,821
Let's say that we told you to kill Dahlia.

753
00:44:16,742 --> 00:44:18,683
Well, we told you to kill her in a very specific way.

754
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:22,504
And we told you to listen to some of the conversation

755
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:23,725
and then stand up and shoot her.

756
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:26,506
That means that you have to fail the opportunity

757
00:44:26,766 --> 00:44:28,607
if the player does anything else.

758
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:32,181
And that is kind of a, that's a tall order.

759
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:33,784
And you shouldn't do that to your players.

760
00:44:34,264 --> 00:44:36,007
So think about what you're actually doing

761
00:44:36,027 --> 00:44:37,189
when you make these type of guides,

762
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:39,733
because you may end up giving your player

763
00:44:39,753 --> 00:44:40,715
a really bad experience.

764
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:45,815
The opportunity should always be available, even without the guide.

765
00:44:45,835 --> 00:44:50,756
Yeah, that's just, again, the consistency.

766
00:44:51,536 --> 00:44:53,597
You don't want the guide to be dictating anything.

767
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,617
We don't want the story to dictate anything.

768
00:44:55,817 --> 00:44:58,158
We want the level to dictate it.

769
00:44:58,178 --> 00:45:02,159
We want the player to be able to be in control, and not the other way around.

770
00:45:03,558 --> 00:45:05,760
And then we added some technical changes to support this.

771
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,882
We added the persistent bool, which

772
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:09,942
brings me back to the phone.

773
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:14,585
Once you've heard it the first time,

774
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:17,547
the persistent bool will become true.

775
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,908
And this is across all playthroughs.

776
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:22,810
So when you go back, he will definitely have that phone.

777
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,791
We also use this for all of the reveals.

778
00:45:25,552 --> 00:45:27,873
So if you've heard it once, you never have to reveal it again.

779
00:45:28,614 --> 00:45:30,555
You can still go over and listen to them,

780
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:32,497
and the widget will show up and all that stuff,

781
00:45:33,518 --> 00:45:35,900
because we wanted players to feel that consistency

782
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,021
in the HUD design as well.

783
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:38,562
But you don't have to.

784
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:41,004
You can just skip that step and go right ahead.

785
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,307
And we added an Intel HUD message.

786
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:46,629
We had Intel along, but it wasn't very prominent.

787
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,592
So we decided to push it a little bit

788
00:45:49,772 --> 00:45:52,014
to make sure that players felt like they had that option as

789
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:53,916
well, instead of just using opportunities.

790
00:45:54,156 --> 00:45:55,677
I'll show you an example in a second.

791
00:45:57,327 --> 00:45:59,488
And then we added different levels of guidance.

792
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:02,989
So you can decide if you want full opportunities,

793
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:08,172
if you want to have this minimal version where we don't give you

794
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:11,233
the marker in the world, but only the objective.

795
00:46:11,714 --> 00:46:13,935
And it's up for you to find out how you want to do it.

796
00:46:16,814 --> 00:46:18,916
Yes, and this is an example of Intel.

797
00:46:18,956 --> 00:46:20,097
This is Fireworks Schedule.

798
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:26,302
You read it, view Intel, take you to the menu, and here you have a description.

799
00:46:26,342 --> 00:46:30,565
These are kind of all the little parts of the opportunities, and if you are that type

800
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:36,030
of player who just wants to investigate on your own, we encourage you to use this instead.

801
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:38,452
The compromise, yes.

802
00:46:40,346 --> 00:46:43,132
I call this a compromise and not the perfect solution,

803
00:46:44,014 --> 00:46:45,878
because it really is a compromise,

804
00:46:45,978 --> 00:46:47,943
and it's something that we keep adjusting.

805
00:46:51,447 --> 00:46:52,848
what is the most important part?

806
00:46:53,008 --> 00:46:55,170
Is it the sandbox, or is it the guidance?

807
00:46:55,671 --> 00:46:57,332
And we also have replay value on top of that.

808
00:46:58,353 --> 00:47:00,616
So, fancy.

809
00:47:01,757 --> 00:47:03,519
So this is something that you constantly

810
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:06,622
have to adjust, because there's always

811
00:47:07,322 --> 00:47:10,025
some really, really cool idea about some narrative part that

812
00:47:10,065 --> 00:47:10,926
would be great to do.

813
00:47:10,986 --> 00:47:12,327
And then you have to think about, well,

814
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:13,568
what would that do to sandbox?

815
00:47:13,588 --> 00:47:15,270
And then what would that do to replay value?

816
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:17,792
And this is something that we do all the time.

817
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:19,954
It's not that we made up our minds and then we said,

818
00:47:19,994 --> 00:47:22,275
go, everyone, this is a template, design, design.

819
00:47:23,876 --> 00:47:25,818
Every time we have a new opportunity idea,

820
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:27,199
we sit and we talk about this.

821
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:29,740
Every time we add a step to an opportunity,

822
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:30,601
we talk about this.

823
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,843
This is a constant readjusting,

824
00:47:34,824 --> 00:47:36,365
and it's something that we're still working with,

825
00:47:36,806 --> 00:47:38,207
thanks to our episodic model.

826
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:40,348
We can keep adjusting this.

827
00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:42,249
So, yes.

828
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:46,428
So we managed to show them the iceberg

829
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:50,089
and still encourage replay in a balance

830
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:50,949
that we were happy with.

831
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,991
And we got really, really positive feedback.

832
00:47:57,031 --> 00:47:58,731
We're really, really excited about this.

833
00:48:00,032 --> 00:48:03,032
And we were also personally very happy with the result.

834
00:48:04,313 --> 00:48:05,033
So that was awesome.

835
00:48:05,973 --> 00:48:08,374
It seemed that they managed to find the iceberg, which

836
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:09,534
is exactly what one is to do.

837
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:11,075
And it felt like they were prepared to find it.

838
00:48:11,115 --> 00:48:11,655
So it was awesome.

839
00:48:13,205 --> 00:48:17,527
Yeah, so we just want to wrap up with some learnings that we made.

840
00:48:18,087 --> 00:48:21,089
You fight as you train turned out to be very true for us.

841
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:26,191
It turned out to be the right way to teach people how to play Hitman.

842
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:31,814
Make it as real as possible and we just used the right space for that

843
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:37,436
because if we had done that this in Absolution and asked you to play the opening of that once more...

844
00:48:38,117 --> 00:48:40,601
that would kind of break down because that's the story mission right so you

845
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:43,827
would kill an important person that you have to do it again and then it kind of

846
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:48,876
loses all meaning. But in this case we managed to create these sandboxes that

847
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:51,801
would actually behave as the real game because it was the real game.

848
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:56,021
We like prototyping a lot.

849
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,382
It worked really, really well for us.

850
00:48:57,582 --> 00:48:59,802
Here, we teamed up with the user research department,

851
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:02,983
as I said, and then we did rapid, rapid, rapid prototyping.

852
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,643
So I would punch out a build, run down,

853
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:06,283
and then have it evaluated the same day.

854
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:08,464
And then two weeks later, we would do it again.

855
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:13,305
And then paper versions, I am a believer in paper versions

856
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:15,545
of anything before you go digital,

857
00:49:15,565 --> 00:49:17,366
because it's a lot easier to cut your paper in half

858
00:49:17,486 --> 00:49:18,806
and just paint on it.

859
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,775
If we do a live game, then go live early.

860
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:29,937
This closed alpha was the first time people outside IOH

861
00:49:29,977 --> 00:49:31,939
had contact with our game.

862
00:49:32,279 --> 00:49:34,020
And that is also what allowed us to do

863
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,802
these pretty dramatic changes to the tutorial.

864
00:49:39,504 --> 00:49:43,446
Because all of a sudden we saw a lot of problems that we could fix before we shipped.

865
00:49:44,007 --> 00:49:49,311
So, highly recommended, because this is also a kind of internal fight-as-you-train exercise,

866
00:49:49,371 --> 00:49:51,713
because all of a sudden we have to release content outside,

867
00:49:52,213 --> 00:49:55,415
and we have to make sure that we have servers, that we have deployment methods,

868
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,777
that we have the development team behind it, the online team.

869
00:49:58,137 --> 00:50:00,219
So all of this became the same for ourselves.

870
00:50:00,779 --> 00:50:01,780
We had to do it the right way.

871
00:50:03,822 --> 00:50:03,902
Oops.

872
00:50:05,242 --> 00:50:11,547
Yes, and as I mentioned before, adding a guide in a game like Hitman means designing fail conditions.

873
00:50:12,067 --> 00:50:14,869
Please remember it if you're ever in the same situation as us.

874
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,533
It's just really important and it saves a lot of heartache to do it as fast as possible.

875
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,112
And then sandbox guidance means compromises.

876
00:50:24,192 --> 00:50:26,695
I already said that a lot.

877
00:50:26,876 --> 00:50:28,938
And I'll say it again, because it's important.

878
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:30,640
But it's OK.

879
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:32,322
It's OK with compromises.

880
00:50:32,342 --> 00:50:33,503
They're actually pretty great.

881
00:50:34,044 --> 00:50:36,187
It really makes you wonder a lot.

882
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:38,249
It makes you discuss a lot and talk

883
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:40,512
about what is actually the core experience that we

884
00:50:40,552 --> 00:50:41,773
want to create with this game.

885
00:50:41,853 --> 00:50:42,714
Why are we doing it?

886
00:50:44,096 --> 00:50:46,337
And the constant adjustment keeps you sharp.

887
00:50:47,098 --> 00:50:48,579
So, yes.

888
00:50:49,439 --> 00:50:53,122
That was our take on how to guide the player

889
00:50:53,742 --> 00:50:54,703
in a sandbox game.

890
00:50:55,223 --> 00:50:55,504
Thank you.

891
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:08,232
Yes, as usual, as you know, there is time for questions.

892
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:10,594
So if you have some, then please raise your hand.

893
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:11,415
There's one in the back there.

894
00:51:16,751 --> 00:51:18,291
I'm sorry about the sound, by the way.

895
00:51:19,592 --> 00:51:20,992
I hope you can all hear still.

896
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:22,052
You're all OK.

897
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:24,913
Hey.

898
00:51:25,273 --> 00:51:25,513
OK.

899
00:51:26,193 --> 00:51:27,913
So two questions for you guys.

900
00:51:28,073 --> 00:51:32,114
First, I have noticed that the list of opportunities

901
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,294
is break down by color.

902
00:51:33,334 --> 00:51:36,635
But I was wondering if you guys are doing by difficulty as

903
00:51:36,675 --> 00:51:36,875
well.

904
00:51:37,615 --> 00:51:40,576
And if you do that, how are you differentiating those?

905
00:51:41,936 --> 00:51:44,136
And the second one about the.

906
00:51:45,404 --> 00:51:51,369
guns blazing approach? Is it a no-no from the get-go, completely out of the game, or

907
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:55,912
are there going to be opportunities that actually allow the player to do something like that?

908
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,075
Allow the player to do something like what, sorry?

909
00:51:59,135 --> 00:52:00,776
Guns blazing, all guns blazing.

910
00:52:00,816 --> 00:52:07,681
Oh, guns blazing! But you can always go guns blazing. I mean, you mean like from the get-go?

911
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:10,683
So like a guide just saying go guns blazing?

912
00:52:10,703 --> 00:52:14,186
Accounting in one of the opportunities that you...

913
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:20,597
Also, like I said, we're not just like, we're like encouraging you to go guns blazing.

914
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:25,702
Well, we kind of have this no kill rule in the opportunities, which may sound weird since

915
00:52:25,762 --> 00:52:30,407
it's a hitman game, but we really, really want you to be able to choose your own style.

916
00:52:30,587 --> 00:52:33,309
We don't want to pressure you to do anything you don't want to do.

917
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,071
But I think like.

918
00:52:36,252 --> 00:52:38,534
I mean, you can really go guns blazing if you want to.

919
00:52:39,235 --> 00:52:42,578
And we also don't want you to limit yourself to opportunities.

920
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,980
We want you to go out there and have fun.

921
00:52:46,222 --> 00:52:50,325
As a general rule, we try to avoid telling you to kill a lot of people, because some

922
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:54,609
people really want to do the opportunities, but still go silent assassin and do it in

923
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:55,810
their own way.

924
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:57,632
Your first part of the question was?

925
00:52:57,652 --> 00:52:57,732
Yeah.

926
00:52:57,752 --> 00:52:58,253
Sorry.

927
00:52:59,534 --> 00:53:00,074
I'll be sorry.

928
00:53:01,697 --> 00:53:07,901
I was wondering if the opportunities are differentiated in difficulty by you guys, and if you reward

929
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:12,004
the player specifically for competing one opportunity over the other.

930
00:53:13,365 --> 00:53:14,426
Can I start?

931
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:14,706
Yeah.

932
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:15,187
Yeah.

933
00:53:15,267 --> 00:53:20,331
Well, we have, let's say that we have an opportunity that we know is very, very difficult.

934
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:24,134
We have one in Paris, the light rig opportunity.

935
00:53:24,154 --> 00:53:29,938
It is kind of difficult, and we actually just started in the roof.

936
00:53:30,779 --> 00:53:33,380
So it's behind like layers of trespassing.

937
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,442
So we're trying to do a little bit more in that style.

938
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:41,165
So we say that the really hard opportunities may be further in or something like that.

939
00:53:41,605 --> 00:53:43,846
But we try to vary them.

940
00:53:44,707 --> 00:53:47,808
So yeah, does that answer your question?

941
00:53:47,848 --> 00:53:49,029
Do you mean like categories?

942
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:51,931
Like saying level, like this is difficult, this is more...

943
00:53:52,906 --> 00:53:58,030
And if the player completes a difficult opportunity, he's rewarded differently at the end of the mission, right?

944
00:53:58,810 --> 00:53:59,071
Ah, okay.

945
00:53:59,091 --> 00:54:04,535
The opportunities are all, I think they give the same amount of points to your XP when you complete them.

946
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,736
So they're not differentiated in that way, no.

947
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:09,739
But they could have more challenges associated to them.

948
00:54:09,899 --> 00:54:10,900
Yes, there could be challenges.

949
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,620
Yeah, that's true.

950
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,103
So if it's long and complicated, there's probably more challenges associated.

951
00:54:15,463 --> 00:54:15,603
Yeah.

952
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:16,864
Thank you.

953
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:19,006
Yeah, we have one up front.

954
00:54:29,217 --> 00:54:34,939
I just want to ask, I was speaking to someone yesterday and I didn't know about this but

955
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:40,200
there was a certain amount of controversy that was generated by Eidos, Stroke, Square,

956
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:46,102
Enix, appropriating the Black Lives Matter thing for the DSX game that's coming out,

957
00:54:46,122 --> 00:54:50,843
like it's called All Lives Matter. I don't know too much about it but with regards to

958
00:54:50,943 --> 00:54:56,124
the political climate, how much of what's going on in the real world, how much of that

959
00:54:56,285 --> 00:54:56,705
affects .

960
00:54:58,395 --> 00:54:58,575
uh...

961
00:54:59,336 --> 00:55:01,096
the design of your games for example

962
00:55:02,077 --> 00:55:03,277
obviously has like uh...

963
00:55:04,857 --> 00:55:07,378
you shoot a woman in the neck and you know you

964
00:55:08,078 --> 00:55:09,559
assassinate like a black person

965
00:55:09,979 --> 00:55:10,779
so I just wanna know like

966
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,400
I think that's a

967
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:17,521
very very very very good question and and and thank you as everyone

968
00:55:18,342 --> 00:55:19,862
we are also just people right

969
00:55:19,882 --> 00:55:21,803
and and I believe that this

970
00:55:23,144 --> 00:55:29,767
game and this character is, he is an anti-hero, right? So what we do is that we actually give

971
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:34,708
the moral dilemma to you as a player, because the people that we are going after in the

972
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,849
story are the bad guys of our universe.

973
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:44,095
So what we do is that we actually hand the responsibility of the mission,

974
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:47,538
kind of how we perform it, that's your kind of morale,

975
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:54,264
because everything is designed in a way so you don't have to kill these innocent people.

976
00:55:54,845 --> 00:56:00,450
Again, it is something, we are in this moral zone of how do we go about this.

977
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:02,852
I hope that answers your question.

978
00:56:04,488 --> 00:56:06,069
Yeah, I don't have a problem with it.

979
00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:08,650
There's just so much blowback that's happening.

980
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:08,970
Yes.

981
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:09,871
I totally understand.

982
00:56:09,891 --> 00:56:11,131
People have too much time on their hands.

983
00:56:15,513 --> 00:56:16,014
Anyone else?

984
00:56:16,074 --> 00:56:16,534
Anyone else?

985
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,136
Oh, someone over there.

986
00:56:20,316 --> 00:56:20,456
Yeah.

987
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:20,856
Say something.

988
00:56:23,137 --> 00:56:23,217
Hi.

989
00:56:24,078 --> 00:56:25,959
Basically, I was wondering, because you

990
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:28,640
showed how the users kind of interacted

991
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,541
when they didn't have the prologue with the level.

992
00:56:31,762 --> 00:56:34,203
They just went in and killed the character.

993
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,844
How did it change when you added the prologue?

994
00:56:38,864 --> 00:56:43,889
Did you have to do some blocking gates as well?

995
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:45,611
Because initially, they could just

996
00:56:45,651 --> 00:56:48,034
walk through the main entrance and just kill the character.

997
00:56:48,494 --> 00:56:51,437
Did they instantly know after the prologue to not do that?

998
00:56:52,038 --> 00:56:54,460
Or did you also change the level design?

999
00:56:55,334 --> 00:56:59,956
Well, what we typically see when a seasoned player plays the mission, when they have knowledge

1000
00:56:59,976 --> 00:57:03,218
about how to approach the game, is that they rarely actually enter through the main gate

1001
00:57:03,238 --> 00:57:04,218
at the first thing, right?

1002
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:08,160
That they'll know that the target is just in there just by looking at the thing, right?

1003
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,140
So they will seek out the surroundings.

1004
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:14,522
So the example I showed was kind of like the worst case.

1005
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:18,604
Of course, we saw people who were infiltrating and experiencing and playing around with the

1006
00:57:18,624 --> 00:57:18,804
game.

1007
00:57:19,785 --> 00:57:22,326
But we didn't change the...

1008
00:57:23,987 --> 00:57:26,969
There was one thing we learned from the Alpha, and that was if you went right,

1009
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:31,232
there was this place where we had a fence that was guarded.

1010
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:34,854
And what would happen there was that people would approach the fence,

1011
00:57:34,894 --> 00:57:39,037
get told off by the Sentry guys, and then, because the layout was a dead end...

1012
00:57:39,697 --> 00:57:45,920
they wouldn't turn back, they would actually just keep pushing forward and then climbing the fence and then getting into a lot of trouble.

1013
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:52,722
So what we did was that we pushed the fence a bit back because there was an opening in the garden, a kind of fence,

1014
00:57:52,942 --> 00:57:58,404
so they could get up to the guy, get dismissed, say you can't enter here, and just continue to their right.

1015
00:57:59,065 --> 00:58:06,948
So there were these kind of changes where we discovered some bottlenecks, but we didn't, we don't want to block you off in this setting here.

1016
00:58:10,372 --> 00:58:10,853
Oh, yeah.

1017
00:58:15,516 --> 00:58:16,617
This will have to be the last question.

1018
00:58:18,959 --> 00:58:19,980
Hey, thanks for a great talk.

1019
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:24,644
So my question is, how do you go about user testing these things?

1020
00:58:24,664 --> 00:58:26,866
Because it's a very big sandbox, and as I say,

1021
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:28,307
there's lots of stuff you can do,

1022
00:58:28,427 --> 00:58:30,029
and everything interacts with each other.

1023
00:58:30,129 --> 00:58:32,811
And I mean, you could watch a video of every.

1024
00:58:33,769 --> 00:58:36,690
player playing the game but that's probably a lot of work and you probably

1025
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:42,592
had a lot of alpha testers. Yeah, that also takes many years. Yeah, exactly, so how do you go about that and do you have

1026
00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:46,054
like some metrics that you go about or do you do like just kind of a

1027
00:58:46,094 --> 00:58:46,934
questionnaire testing?

1028
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:51,415
Yeah, we do several different kinds of user testing, right?

1029
00:58:51,455 --> 00:58:53,056
The ones that I talk about, the rapid ones,

1030
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,776
we also have bigger user surveys where

1031
00:58:54,796 --> 00:58:55,817
we interview a lot of people.

1032
00:58:57,418 --> 00:58:59,519
They play the game and there's surveys.

1033
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:03,100
And then we also have, we send out questionnaires

1034
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,921
to the players and ask them directly.

1035
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:07,102
And we also have a user panel where

1036
00:59:07,162 --> 00:59:09,903
we are in kind of continuous dialogue with the players

1037
00:59:10,203 --> 00:59:10,944
about how they do it.

1038
00:59:11,864 --> 00:59:14,025
So that's the user testing thing.

1039
00:59:14,946 --> 00:59:15,586
Anything else to add?

1040
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:18,948
Well, that and then we also, like, we're doing an episodic game.

1041
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:23,050
That means people are playing the game in their own homes right now.

1042
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:27,352
So we have a very, like, we are really trying to listen to the community.

1043
00:59:27,372 --> 00:59:30,814
And we spend a lot of time just finding out what people are saying

1044
00:59:30,894 --> 00:59:33,615
and how are they feeling? Do they like it? What don't they like?

1045
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:37,037
And we have a lot of people who's spending a lot of time on that.

1046
00:59:37,677 --> 00:59:42,080
So, so, yeah, so both with user research, but also just listening to our players.

1047
00:59:43,654 --> 00:59:43,815
Great.

1048
00:59:44,279 --> 00:59:45,004
That was the last question.

1049
00:59:45,508 --> 00:59:46,092
That was the last question.

1050
00:59:46,112 --> 00:59:46,958
Thank you for coming.
