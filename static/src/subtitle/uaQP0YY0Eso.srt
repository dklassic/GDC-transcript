00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:05,292
On GDC Podcast Episode 5, we got a special guest, Hannah Flynn.

2
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:09,615
Hannah Flynn with Sunless Skies developer Failbetter Games,

3
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:14,919
and she'll talk about marketing your indie game so people might actually buy it, maybe?

4
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:21,703
Also stay tuned for the latest GDC 2020 news and hear opinions about 2019's best games.

5
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:22,083
Back in a sec.

6
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:46,206
Hey everybody, we're back. This is Chris Graft, editor-in-chief of Gamasutra,

7
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:49,755
and I'm here with my co-host Alyssa McAloon. Hey Alyssa!

8
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,511
Hi, I'm Melissa McAloon. I am a news editor,

9
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,312
and a social media producer.

10
00:00:54,312 --> 00:00:55,952
Producer? No, what is my job?

11
00:00:55,952 --> 00:00:57,333
Publisher of policytru.com.

12
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,453
Do you want to be a producer?

13
00:00:59,453 --> 00:00:59,573
No.

14
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:01,654
You got it.

15
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:04,115
Just add it to your title.

16
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:07,636
So let's go right into some GDC news

17
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:10,337
real quick before we bring on our very special guest.

18
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,217
So GDC 2020 is coming up in March still, right?

19
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:13,778
We haven't shifted the dates.

20
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:14,318
Near months away.

21
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:19,726
Yeah.

22
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:20,967
Mere months.

23
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:22,308
I can't take it.

24
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:25,091
This is like a, it's like three podcasts away.

25
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:26,272
Oh, don't change.

26
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,493
I've changed.

27
00:01:27,493 --> 00:01:30,136
Yeah.

28
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:32,558
My perception of time into podcasts.

29
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:36,422
So I hope that's a acceptable unit of measurement.

30
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:42,687
Uh, yeah, uh, it's coming up March 16th through 20th, 2020.

31
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:45,809
Get that year right, 2020.

32
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:51,532
Registration is open at gdconf.com and we would love to see you there.

33
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:53,393
I, we would, it would be nice.

34
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:54,233
Wouldn't it?

35
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:58,835
We actually have, it is a lovely atmosphere.

36
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,336
I mean, it has been for the past what?

37
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:00,496
31 years.

38
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,117
It's been nice.

39
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:03,678
Five, something like that.

40
00:02:03,678 --> 00:02:03,918
Yeah.

41
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,641
100? The century?

42
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:07,462
This is the 100th GDC?

43
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:08,183
Dog years, yeah.

44
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:08,843
Yeah.

45
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:14,928
We have some honestly really exciting, we're finally starting to talk about the talks that

46
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:15,709
are going to be there.

47
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,813
So have, Alyssa, have you heard of this game called Death Stranding?

48
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:23,375
The walking simulator, yes, I'm familiar.

49
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:23,575
Is it?

50
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,877
I thought it was a stepping and falling simulator.

51
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,483
dropping your packages all over the place simulator.

52
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:38,248
But there's going to be a talk, deconstructing the AI of Death Stranding.

53
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:40,229
That's going to be there. It's going to be great.

54
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:45,233
There's also a little app called Apex Legends,

55
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:55,440
known around Gamasutra's hallways as Apelegs, but more formally as Respawn's Apex Legends.

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,901
So yeah, there's a post-mortem on that.

57
00:02:57,847 --> 00:02:59,247
Come on down for that.

58
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:03,329
And, uh, last one I'm going to mention, although there are so many others that

59
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:13,232
are live on the site right now, uh, on GDC's website right now, there is going

60
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:13,932
to be one on the, uh, the ashtray maze.

61
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:14,152
In control.

62
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,613
What do you think of that, Alyssa?

63
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,074
I haven't beaten control yet, but that I probably watched someone play that part

64
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:23,956
and it is visually stunning, so I can only imagine the making of that has to be wild.

65
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:28,018
Yeah, I mean, watching games nowadays, it counts as playing, I think.

66
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:30,306
So, you have played the Ashtray Maze.

67
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:32,817
Dang, dang.

68
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:34,639
Yeah.

69
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:34,879
Yeah.

70
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,745
And then lastly, there are a bunch of alt control GDC.

71
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:46,450
This is, these are games that have these really wacky

72
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,452
alternative controls.

73
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:51,034
This includes a, this year there's

74
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:53,737
going to be a cow milking, competitive cow milking

75
00:03:53,737 --> 00:03:54,358
simulator there.

76
00:03:55,278 --> 00:04:00,261
I've seen, uh, I've seen it in pictures and it's exactly what you would think.

77
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:04,983
It would look like kind of like rubbery udders there.

78
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:08,664
And you, uh, go up against your friends and you mug a cow.

79
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:11,345
Alyssa and I are actually, we were raised in the Midwest, so I

80
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:13,426
think we would be pretty good.

81
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:14,687
It'll be a nice little sense of home.

82
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,048
I think in the middle of a chronic convention floor is just

83
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,009
a, some udders and a pail.

84
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:19,149
Yeah.

85
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:19,549
Yeah, absolutely.

86
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:30,576
And then last of all, you can, for our potential GDC guests

87
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:34,660
who need some financial help, we also have a,

88
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,182
what we call a low income pass lottery,

89
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:38,203
which you can apply for.

90
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:42,327
So check that out on the gdconf.com website.

91
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:48,453
So, on to our guest.

92
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:52,357
She is director of comms, that is short for communications,

93
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:55,740
I think, at Fail Better Games,

94
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,264
where she's worked on Fallen London, Sunless Sea,

95
00:05:00,264 --> 00:05:03,327
that is singular, not sunless seas,

96
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:06,991
sunless sea, as well as sunless skies, plural.

97
00:05:07,952 --> 00:05:12,636
She also came up with a really cool campaign last year,

98
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:16,238
the hashtag LoveIndies campaign, which we'll talk about.

99
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:21,783
She is a marketing guru in the game industry.

100
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:24,085
And in her past life, in a past life,

101
00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:28,328
she worked in book publishing, art, and charitable causes.

102
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,472
She is a past and future GDC speaker.

103
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:34,093
And she's spoken at a bunch of other places

104
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:34,914
sharing her knowledge.

105
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:35,494
It is.

106
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:37,915
Hannah Flynn.

107
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:38,355
Hey, Hannah.

108
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:39,416
Hello.

109
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,096
Thank you.

110
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:43,337
That was the warmest introduction I've ever had on a podcast.

111
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:46,858
You know that I F I feel like it was the warmest one that I've given.

112
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:50,220
And extremely accurate.

113
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,681
We pride ourselves in the facts here.

114
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:55,782
Finding research was worth it.

115
00:05:55,782 --> 00:06:00,063
And it's funny to think I am previously a speaker at GDC as well, because I spoke at GDC next.

116
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:05,563
You did yeah, I watched it. I'm really thinking of this one as my first go

117
00:06:05,563 --> 00:06:08,469
I don't know. Yeah, this is this is a big show

118
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,292
This is the big show. Yeah

119
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:19,209
Yeah, one of my favorite parts about your GDC Next talk back in 2014, I think, was that you were

120
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:25,193
a little under the weather, and every time you coughed, you asked the audience to applaud.

121
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:25,273
Yeah.

122
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:32,256
It was the most applause that I've seen during the entirety of a GDC talk.

123
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:37,816
I think it was the last talk at GDC Next, maybe, ever.

124
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:39,718
I think I closed it out with a lot of applause,

125
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:41,419
but yeah, I was quite sick.

126
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:44,042
And I'd been in the industry for a total of five weeks

127
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,002
or something at the time.

128
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:45,203
Oh, wow.

129
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:45,363
Yeah.

130
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:50,447
And you already knew so much that you had to tell everybody.

131
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:51,008
I came in on a high.

132
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:51,168
Yeah.

133
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:54,711
I had a baby in the middle, and now I'm back.

134
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:56,427
You're back.

135
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:57,467
All right.

136
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,108
So give us a little bit of your background.

137
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:03,129
You actually came to Fail Better Games

138
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:06,551
from a non-games background.

139
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,752
Yeah, I don't even have game-based qualifications.

140
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:11,472
I don't know what I'm doing. Me neither.

141
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,873
I don't know what I'm doing here.

142
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:16,814
I worked previously in film,

143
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:20,116
then in publishing for one of the biggest publishers

144
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:21,556
in the world, if not the biggest,

145
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:24,157
and then for museums and galleries.

146
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:33,312
digital team making games and interactivities for children and young people and that's the biggest gallery in the UK and

147
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:40,977
Then the biggest children's charity in the UK and after a while of not really knowing any of my colleagues names

148
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:46,701
I thought I quite like to work somewhere very very small and I joined fail better. I think I was employee number eight

149
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:46,961
number eight

150
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:51,365
yeah, at the time there were only eight of us.

151
00:07:51,365 --> 00:07:56,209
And that was much more my tempo, much more comfortable for me,

152
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,572
no longer having to try and curry favour with people on a different continent

153
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:01,894
who you sort of have to guess at their email

154
00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:05,557
and you need them to do something for you in short order.

155
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:06,738
Just, it was very stressful.

156
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:11,561
Very stressful. And gaming was less stressful than that.

157
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:16,044
Weirdly enough, I joined in 2014, right on the tail end of the first bit of Gamergate.

158
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:18,345
It was less stressful than working for a children's charity.

159
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:18,666
Good lord!

160
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:27,052
Okay, I guess counting my blessings there

161
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:29,473
Yeah, so

162
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:31,695
It's I always like stories where?

163
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:34,037
People come into the game industry

164
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:40,221
after not being in it because I know that a lot of people kind of are on the outside looking in and maybe think that

165
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:40,862
They can't get in

166
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:44,725
or that their background won't benefit

167
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:48,628
or is not transferable to a career in the games industry.

168
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:54,812
So what informed, how did your non-games work inform

169
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:58,575
your current work in marketing and communications and games?

170
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:02,017
Well, I've always worked across marketing and comms.

171
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:04,659
So the beautiful part of that discipline

172
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:06,741
is it's completely transferable.

173
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:08,722
I could go and market Kitchen Cleaner

174
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,163
if I felt strongly enough about it.

175
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:15,500
Do you feel strongly enough about it?

176
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,680
No.

177
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,642
I'm looking at my kitchen right now and it is not clean.

178
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,803
So I don't think I'd be a good ambassador for that industry

179
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:22,743
at all.

180
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:23,303
Let the record show.

181
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:23,444
Yeah.

182
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:27,586
Because comms and marketing is basically

183
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:30,227
about the audience and platform.

184
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:33,769
It's about finding the one through the other.

185
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,171
So when I arrived in games, I didn't really

186
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:39,792
understand, say, live streaming.

187
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:45,916
I hadn't used tools like that before but because I'd built audiences before

188
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:50,479
and I understood a bit about human behaviour and what people are looking for out of community,

189
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:59,184
it's something that you can really apply. So because getting into games is extremely competitive

190
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:04,228
and because roles like mine are really very rare even within the small industry that we're in.

191
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:08,272
It is slightly heartening, I think, for people to think,

192
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:12,776
I could do this for another business and learn,

193
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:17,040
and then take those skills plus my personal knowledge of games,

194
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,281
which I had,

195
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:19,503
and turn that into a role for myself somewhere,

196
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:20,344
you know, working on something that I love,

197
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:20,864
which is what I did.

198
00:10:25,898 --> 00:10:30,622
Do you feel like that kind of like accessibility has changed from like 2014-ish when you got

199
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:34,546
started to like the current state of the industry or is it about kind of the same?

200
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:38,650
I think it is getting better partially because I've done a number of talks where I just have

201
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,353
big letters on that said hire a marketer.

202
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:44,135
You're a marketer, Jesus Christ!

203
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:46,537
Oh, how can I, can I curse?

204
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:47,037
Yeah.

205
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,198
Never stopped us.

206
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:50,981
I don't think Jesus Christ is a curse word.

207
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:52,942
I stopped myself halfway through Jesus Christ

208
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:54,644
because I was thinking of something else.

209
00:10:54,644 --> 00:10:57,927
Because people, I think,

210
00:10:57,927 --> 00:10:59,708
marketing is becoming something

211
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,190
more and more studios need in order to get any traction.

212
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:07,932
and people are really having to consider what is possible within what they have

213
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:12,133
in terms of resources and money, obviously,

214
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:17,154
but also their ambition and how they can make something happen that matches the ambition they have for their games.

215
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,534
That's very much changing.

216
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:22,355
The need for what I do has definitely increased,

217
00:11:22,355 --> 00:11:25,775
but as Felbetter have been ahead of the curve on a few things

218
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:27,256
and lucked out on a few things,

219
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:30,936
and one of them, I think, was hiring a fully-fledged full-time marketer in 2014.

220
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:41,041
Yeah. Can you, uh, before we go on more about, uh, the, the marketing, uh,

221
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:47,049
details, uh, can you tell us a little bit about what fail better does and, uh,

222
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:49,853
the kinds of games that, that you all make there?

223
00:11:50,998 --> 00:12:00,521
Yeah, we make really beautifully, exquisitely written, story-driven narrative RPGs that are heavily text-based.

224
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:03,682
The most recent has more than 800,000 words in it, but primarily about giving...

225
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:15,679
extremely memorable, strange, oblique stories that you don't get anywhere else in games

226
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,942
through a setting that we've been developing for 10 years that's called Fall in London.

227
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:22,884
And all of our major games so far take place in this alternate history, Victorian Gothic

228
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:26,207
universe that we created ourselves and is now absolutely massive.

229
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:29,929
And in these games they've been quite successful too because of you.

230
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,168
Well, yeah, and because they're really good.

231
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:39,728
Which helps.

232
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:43,371
You sort of have to have both.

233
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,792
You have to have an exquisite product

234
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,954
and then you have to sell the crap out of it.

235
00:12:48,954 --> 00:12:51,655
There's no sort of getting away from

236
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:54,237
you needing to do both of those things.

237
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:55,598
Part of the reason that we're able to

238
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:57,579
maintain and sustain our success is

239
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,400
Fallen London, the original game,

240
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,201
is a browser game that's still going.

241
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:03,202
It's going to be 10 in January.

242
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:09,951
and has a subscription model that supports it, it's free to play.

243
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:12,992
And we have, you know, x-thousand subscribers still,

244
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,813
that enables us to take a few more chances

245
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:19,634
and to have something to fall back on

246
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:23,375
if one of the premium games that we make alongside Fallen London doesn't go so well.

247
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:27,336
So that is the bedrock of our business,

248
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:31,337
is this ongoing sort of game-as-service.

249
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:34,924
which enabled us to do a kickstart of Sunless Sea,

250
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:39,213
which succeeded brilliantly in a different age on Steam.

251
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:47,749
When we launched Sunless Sea, we were on the front page of Steam for all Steam users for about four days.

252
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:53,914
Which is a big piece of pie. And you don't get pie that big these days.

253
00:13:53,914 --> 00:13:56,677
Certainly not a game of our size.

254
00:13:56,677 --> 00:14:02,702
And then that in turn enabled us to keep going, do another Kickstarter,

255
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:06,045
create another Early Access title, which we launched this year, Sunless Skies.

256
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:13,682
which for the glory of everything has been even more wonderfully warmly received

257
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:18,046
and I would say has sold sustainably well and we're very happy.

258
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:22,210
But yeah, the time, the difference between when we launched on the sea and when we launched on the skies

259
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,455
is quite marked in terms of what you are, the audience you're able to reach.

260
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:32,213
Yeah. How about we just cut to the chase and I'll just ask you,

261
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:35,416
I'll just ask you, how do you market an indie game?

262
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,358
Like where do you even start forming a marketing plan?

263
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:41,701
Some people don't have one at all and don't know where to begin.

264
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:42,822
With conviction, Chris,

265
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:44,864
you have to, you have to believe that.

266
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:53,172
marketing your game is something that you need to do. You have to start there.

267
00:14:53,172 --> 00:15:02,980
And I guess the answer to this question comes differently if you are a person or two people or three people in a micro studio

268
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,782
versus a team of 10, 15, you know, 25 people.

269
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:11,406
If you have 25 people, you don't have a marketer. I'm afraid you've already made a few errors.

270
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:15,209
But if you're marketing something by yourself, the way that you start...

271
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:24,633
is with a really good store page, with a really good Twitter, and with a press list and a

272
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,594
press information.

273
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:34,777
You commit to doing those things, you nurture them and you, what's the word, where you grow

274
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:36,957
something and you cultivate it.

275
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:40,078
You cultivate those things.

276
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:41,439
Start making a press list.

277
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:42,439
Start day one by...

278
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:47,542
looking up a game that is a bit like what you want to make,

279
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,443
googling the reviews of that game,

280
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:51,784
looking at the journalists who wrote those reviews,

281
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,664
finding those journalists on Twitter,

282
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:56,145
and saying, hey, I saw you liked X, I'm making Y,

283
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:59,366
can I put you on the press list, could I send you a key?

284
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:01,906
And do that until you have a list of people

285
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:05,247
who are warmly interested in the sort of stuff that you make.

286
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,688
And do a little bit of that every day.

287
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:11,089
The big mistake is feeling like marketing is a big.

288
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:15,370
homogenous, single activity thing that you can spend lots of money on,

289
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,013
and if you don't have any money, you can't do marketing.

290
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:26,278
You can, you just need to account for marketing time within your development time.

291
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,540
It is part of development, it starts at the beginning of development,

292
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:28,960
um, but it's people who...

293
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:36,069
ignore it because it is daunting

294
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,610
that we'll miss out.

295
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,055
So you say it starts day one with development. How do

296
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:43,699
a developer who's like, here's my project, here's my idea, here's a game we're

297
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:45,401
gonna make, we're starting today,

298
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:49,165
what would be the actionable things that a marketer would do in that

299
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:49,566
situation?

300
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,059
I would ask them who it's for.

301
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:58,361
That gives you almost everything you need to know about what to do next.

302
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:05,244
We know our audience super well because a lot of the core people who are with us now

303
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:10,086
have been with us for 10 years, 8 years, since Fallen London was launched.

304
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:15,967
So we know where they live, not in a creepy way.

305
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:18,908
We know that they love to read, they love to feel clever,

306
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:25,452
they love mystery, they love representative characters, diversity.

307
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:29,154
We, as far as we know, were the first commercial RPG to have a third gender option at all.

308
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:35,536
So we know that a lot of people are with us for that stuff.

309
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:38,957
And we do quite deep research with them.

310
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:44,899
We sort of exist alongside them in our Discord and in our various community forum spaces.

311
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:47,640
But if you don't have that, then the first thing you need is to...

312
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:57,628
figure out if that audience exists, doing research on similar titles, establishing what

313
00:17:57,628 --> 00:18:05,350
you think the ambition for sales could reasonably be, and pitching yourself a sort of sufficient

314
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,251
level of activity, of marketing activity, to grow a community that could support that

315
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:09,811
type of sales level.

316
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:10,632
And being realistic about that stuff.

317
00:18:16,673 --> 00:18:20,274
And finding a niche and being happy to be niche is kind of the modern way.

318
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:22,155
Find an audience who will love it.

319
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:25,276
10 people who will love it is better than 50 people who think, meh.

320
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:27,476
So like, uh, you're kind of, I mean, you were talking about market research here.

321
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:28,237
Uh, and you mentioned discord.

322
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:52,158
uh how do you collect uh this information how do you quantify it how do you use all that data and

323
00:18:52,158 --> 00:19:00,422
information and apply it to development and marketing of a game well cunningly this is

324
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:03,223
kind of what i'm covering in my gdc talk oh yes so i'm doing a talk called um next level

325
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:05,184
indie game marketing um which goes into things like

326
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:17,772
How do you use player data research and understanding and knowledge of your audience to inspire

327
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:20,754
ideas that will work for your specific game?

328
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:23,155
A big deal is being specific.

329
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:30,559
to your thing. People oftentimes will look around and see these kind of big flashy, splashy

330
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,200
marketing ideas or they think the first things that come to mind when you think of video game

331
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:42,401
marketing is like massive announcements attached to big award ceremonies or huge side of bus or

332
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:48,222
side of building advertising. But being very specific to the tone of your thing.

333
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:54,249
and the information that you know about your audience is what enables you to narrow down

334
00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:57,093
and then you sort of put that through your mill

335
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:59,516
and what comes out the other end is the idea that will meet those...

336
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:04,161
those wants and limitations that you have.

337
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:09,564
A good example is the launch campaign for Sunless Skies.

338
00:20:09,564 --> 00:20:17,228
We had minimal advertising budget and we don't do a lot of advertising

339
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:21,470
so we wanted to use that money in as a constructive way as we possibly could

340
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,773
and we knew all these different things about what we wanted to achieve.

341
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:26,973
We knew that the launch window

342
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:34,942
was extremely short in which we could get enough public conversational and algorithmic interest in

343
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:42,348
the game in order to really when they say launch they mean you know punch through the atmosphere

344
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:43,129
launch the thing

345
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:46,071
and get that attention.

346
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:52,636
So we kind of narrowed absolutely everything into a 24-hour period.

347
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:55,058
We also knew from our understanding of our community

348
00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:58,080
that they are very charitably minded.

349
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,845
And we knew about our games, from having already made Sunless Sea,

350
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:09,489
that we weren't probably going to get a lot of attraction with streamers.

351
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:10,870
We get some streamers, but it's...

352
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:18,157
It's about specificity again. The people who really want to stream it are very, very few, but they will really go for it.

353
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:26,539
They want to read all the words, they want to wear a top hat and have a little train whistle and just go completely hard for it, which is amazing.

354
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:34,801
But we wanted to combine all of these things and kind of bake them and construct them into something that would give us that launch velocity.

355
00:21:36,402 --> 00:21:42,168
We did the Sunless Skies 10k challenge, for which in the first 24 hours after we launched,

356
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:47,053
we gave a pound per minute of streamed content to the gaming charity SpecialEffect,

357
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:52,539
aiming to get 10,000 minutes, hence the 10k challenge.

358
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:56,022
And because it was charitable, original...

359
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,633
It convinced people to stream it who might not otherwise have done so.

360
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,255
And we actually ended up with about 28,000 minutes of stream content in the first 24 hours,

361
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:07,038
which was fantastic and was a big part of the reason why we were able to chart on Steam in that initial period.

362
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,261
Stuff like that's so creative.

363
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:25,607
Um, do you feel like, uh, some developers who are kind of new to this are, uh,

364
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:30,211
you know, ma maybe they're, you know, they can come up with a good idea, but

365
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:33,573
are standoffish about trying something new like that

366
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:38,013
I think it's really intimidating to do something like that.

367
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:44,442
And I also think, if you can't afford to hire a marketer, then absolutely don't because

368
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:46,345
it will cost.

369
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,468
But if you can afford consultancy...

370
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:55,705
Talking about your game in great depth with someone who doesn't understand it very well is a great way to find

371
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:59,786
the points at which you can like

372
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:06,748
Convey exactly what it is and and a good marketer will be able to reflect back to you like oh you have something there

373
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:09,309
You know, what do you mean? People don't really want to stream your game

374
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:15,471
Oh, well, it's a load of setup and you get really breathless. They get people get tired of streaming it. Well, what if you know

375
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:18,252
It is really intimidating

376
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:18,312
But

377
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:25,494
This is not to say that everybody should go away and do exactly what I did,

378
00:23:25,494 --> 00:23:28,715
because it won't necessarily work for another type of game.

379
00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:35,538
But it is about mashing those things together and getting something new,

380
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:39,000
or even involving creative idea generation tools,

381
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,001
like rolling a dice or something,

382
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:45,263
to throw in some random elements until you get something that you think might work.

383
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:50,992
Yeah. And you also last year, uh,

384
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:53,935
formulated the hashtag love Indies campaign.

385
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:56,518
Can you explain what that was all about? That was a success.

386
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:59,855
Yes, it's been great. We've done it twice now.

387
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:07,817
Love Indies is a campaign that goes across players, developers and platforms

388
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:11,898
to basically encourage everyone to rate, recommend and review indie games.

389
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:18,220
Because we all play games and we all sort of fail to review them,

390
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,121
even if we really like them, it's a chore.

391
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:21,961
So we turned that part of...

392
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:28,096
you know, you can't just keep tweeting,

393
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:29,637
please review our games,

394
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:31,418
please leave me a review, I really like it.

395
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:33,460
It would be really nice if you,

396
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,801
like if you just keep saying the same thing

397
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:37,123
over and over again, it doesn't get you anywhere.

398
00:24:37,123 --> 00:24:38,904
So I chewed on that for a little while

399
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:43,007
and it came to me that every developer has this problem.

400
00:24:43,007 --> 00:24:46,250
So we reached out to a load of developers who we knew

401
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,731
and we put together a participation guide

402
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:50,092
that was extremely low friction,

403
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:51,614
really easy for people to pick up.

404
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:51,934
It had...

405
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:57,841
all the little social media things that people needed, all the links, example tweets to do

406
00:24:57,841 --> 00:25:02,987
and just sent it out into the world and then we had you know thousands and thousands of users of the

407
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:07,973
the hashtag during the Love Indies campaign period which was a week the first year,

408
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:08,914
two weeks the second year.

409
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,603
And it had some really amazing effects like a permanent change to Itch,

410
00:25:14,603 --> 00:25:19,487
where Leif from Itch had seen the campaign and created a tool

411
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:22,890
which surfaced any games in your library that you'd interacted with

412
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,412
but never left a review with.

413
00:25:25,412 --> 00:25:26,813
So it made it really, really simple for people.

414
00:25:28,348 --> 00:25:34,751
Everybody got a glut of these reviews and all that developers were so happy to see people reviewing their stuff

415
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:39,873
It just gives you such a boost. Honestly, we've just reached a thousand reviews on Sunless Skies and we practically had a party

416
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:45,195
That's yeah, those are great numbers. And can you can you explain for?

417
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:47,996
listeners who might not understand

418
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:52,838
Like why is the number of reviews so significant for game developers?

419
00:25:52,838 --> 00:25:55,739
It's more it's significant for morale

420
00:25:57,338 --> 00:26:03,424
We slave away. We slave and we just want to know what you think.

421
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:09,129
But it feeds into what I would call the health metrics of your store page.

422
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:12,372
I say when you start marketing your game, you should start with the store page.

423
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:17,977
No amount of stuff that you do to drive people to your store page will sell your game if your store page sucks.

424
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:26,897
So when you put it up, go back to it every two weeks, review it, change things, tweak stuff.

425
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:30,338
We were named a game of the year recently by a couple of wonderful outlets,

426
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,799
so I've put that on a bit of artwork and slapped it on the store page.

427
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,739
Your store page has to look healthy and alive.

428
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:40,920
And a contributing thing to that is review numbers.

429
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,900
On Steam particularly, it's the sort of...

430
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:48,851
I don't know what they would call it, the review descriptor, like overwhelmingly positive

431
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:50,793
or very positive or mixed.

432
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:52,174
Heaven forbid mixed.

433
00:26:52,174 --> 00:26:54,535
Oh, thank you, Your Majesty.

434
00:26:54,535 --> 00:26:56,316
Kiss of death mixed.

435
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:57,017
Just give me a negative.

436
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:59,879
At least that's what's in my interest.

437
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:02,701
Maybe mixed makes people read the page a bit more like, ooh, maybe.

438
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:08,928
But what you really want is overwhelmingly positive, which is extremely hard to get.

439
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:14,976
You have to have something like 100 reviews in the last three months and it has to be

440
00:27:14,976 --> 00:27:20,343
95% or more positive, which we have at the moment, which is really nice, on Sunless Skies

441
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:20,724
at least.

442
00:27:21,585 --> 00:27:27,791
But the rest of the health of your page is like, can people understand your capsule image?

443
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:30,553
When they look at it, do they understand the vibe of what they're getting?

444
00:27:30,553 --> 00:27:34,377
Do they get the genre of your game from what you're putting on there?

445
00:27:34,377 --> 00:27:36,038
Genre is so important to convey.

446
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:36,218
It's not...

447
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:41,922
People think about, like, oh, I want to put something on telly,

448
00:27:41,922 --> 00:27:44,603
I want to watch something, I want to watch a comedy,

449
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:47,384
I want to watch a thriller or something, a crime drama,

450
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:50,165
and you can tell from the pictures of these TV shows on Netflix

451
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:53,646
what they are, what type of show they are, you know?

452
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:56,407
But people, I don't think, recognise that when it comes to

453
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:59,108
pitching their games on platforms.

454
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:02,429
So selling the genre and getting, like, the actual verbs

455
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:05,970
that the player is doing and using every bit of the page, like...

456
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:12,412
I do Steam store page reviews or store page reviews every Wednesday when I'm on the train to London

457
00:28:12,412 --> 00:28:17,573
and I do looking at other people's pages and just going through all these things and

458
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:24,615
so many times people have not been specific enough to describe their own game in their own tone of voice

459
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:28,316
they haven't given enough imagery, they haven't given enough sense of genre

460
00:28:28,316 --> 00:28:32,698
and just a few changes of word brings the like the health rating of the page up.

461
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:40,601
And it just raises people's confidence to buy. People look at your page every day and they decide right then,

462
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:47,224
is this something I want to buy or not? And if you're like, oh, I just haven't updated my page in like a month,

463
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:51,046
then people are going to look at it and think that it's crap.

464
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:53,367
Hard truths with Flynn today.

465
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:59,250
But you have to kind of give yourself a recurring task to look at that and treat it as like, it's the shop front.

466
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,251
It's the book jacket for your game. It's so important.

467
00:29:03,254 --> 00:29:07,839
How often do you update pages for Fail Better Games?

468
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:16,948
Yeah, for Skies I do every couple of weeks, or every time I have a new bit of news, like any Game of the Year placements or stuff like that.

469
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:19,651
For Sunless Sea a little bit less now, because it's five years old.

470
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:24,676
But I will definitely be reviewing that for the fifth birthday, which is coming up in February.

471
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:32,011
Wow. For Steam page and like kind of see what works and what graphics you want up there and stuff like that,

472
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:35,954
is that somewhere we're having in established community or like a discord you have regular

473
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:39,678
interactions with kind of comes into play where you can bounce ideas off of them or solicit

474
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:45,743
feedback directly from the community? A little. It's a bit of a curse of knowledge type thing,

475
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:46,504
double-edged sword.

476
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:49,885
The closer they are to you, the more they want to be kind to you.

477
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:54,467
So they probably would not tell you if there were lots of problems with your page.

478
00:29:54,467 --> 00:30:00,129
But we have done, for example, we use Survey Monkey, we make surveys.

479
00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:05,011
We had some capsule art for Sunless Skies that really wasn't doing the job for us.

480
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:09,493
So we made a survey where we put together four different variants

481
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:12,414
and we sent that out both to people who knew what we were doing

482
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:14,135
and people who never heard of our stuff.

483
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:20,678
and it really helped us figure out that what we had was too complicated

484
00:30:20,678 --> 00:30:25,781
and we had some options that were like a lamp post in space, a Victorian lamp post in space

485
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:30,724
and all the people who knew our work was like, yeah, fall in London, I get it, nice

486
00:30:30,724 --> 00:30:36,887
and all the people who didn't know what we did, we had way too much percentage of those people say

487
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:39,088
I don't know what I would be doing in this game.

488
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:40,995
I don't know what it is.

489
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:44,657
So now it's literally a whacking great train in space.

490
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:50,479
It's a steam train in space, and it's flying, it's coming right at you, and it's got a beautiful

491
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:53,881
serif font that says sunless skies, and it says literary, and it says fucking space train.

492
00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:00,987
And it's the best-sounding space train image on Steam, I made sure of it.

493
00:31:00,987 --> 00:31:05,691
So that was the answer, was, oh, I know what I'd be doing in that game.

494
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:07,532
I'd be driving a train around in space. That's cool.

495
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,554
Because trains are cool.

496
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:10,454
Trains are cool.

497
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:11,355
I imagine it's kind of...

498
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:16,799
a similar issue for like, when you're writing something, you're too close to the topic,

499
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,841
and you hand this to someone who's never interacted with games before maybe, and they're like,

500
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:22,943
I don't know what any of these words mean.

501
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:26,705
Is there a similar trap for game development and game marketing, where you have to have

502
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:30,568
these fresh eyes, or make sure you're not using the terminology too much to have a wider

503
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:30,928
appeal?

504
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:31,248
Oh, yeah.

505
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:31,689
There's, I mean...

506
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:41,325
This is something that kind of comes to me often because of my past doing marketing for other stuff.

507
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:48,475
We have quite an insular situation, certainly with PC gaming and the way that we put together our pages for these games,

508
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:50,498
where you can say things like...

509
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:59,444
Can you just say this game is a turn-based RTS and people who've already played that kind of game and like it will go cool

510
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:02,525
I'll have that that looks great, but if

511
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:06,707
There are people out there who would enjoy playing whatever that is

512
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:08,488
But would not know what that meant at all

513
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:16,773
And that jargon wall is so hard in games, and I'm never sure where my job ends.

514
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:20,636
Is my job going to be to sell these games to people who right now don't even have a

515
00:32:20,636 --> 00:32:21,156
Steam account?

516
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:21,436
Is that...

517
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,591
it or am I selling to the Steam user?

518
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:28,954
And I think part of that conflict comes from the fact that Fallen London

519
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:32,517
is the most accessible game possible.

520
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:36,340
You play it in a web browser, you can play it with a screen reader.

521
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:41,725
So the makeup of people who play Fallen London is extremely broad.

522
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:42,966
Ages, you know, 10 to 80.

523
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:48,332
all manner of gender types, all manner of everything.

524
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:50,293
And that is not the Steam audience.

525
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:52,636
So I'm always pulled one way or the other

526
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:55,658
because we have these people who really love what we do,

527
00:32:55,658 --> 00:32:59,041
but they've never played a real-time game

528
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,944
where you have to control something using WASAD.

529
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:03,746
And they don't want to really play that,

530
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:05,247
but they really want to get more of our stories.

531
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:09,670
So that's just like, yeah, that's a point of challenge for me all the time.

532
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:15,372
Is there a kind of similar conflict where you have your, when you've been working in the same IP for

533
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:21,253
like a decade now, trying to make things and market in a way that appeals to the people you already

534
00:33:21,253 --> 00:33:25,875
have in your ecosystem versus the people who are out there and trying to get new players in?

535
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:29,836
Yeah, it's hard that.

536
00:33:29,836 --> 00:33:34,277
It's hard. And Sunless Skies is a sequel, you know what I'm saying? Like, it's a sequel.

537
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:39,435
We did a lot of work to make Sunless Skies much easier to get into than Sunless Sea,

538
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:43,437
which was extraordinarily punishing to the point of being completely obfuscated

539
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:46,698
in the first couple of hours to a lot of players.

540
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:50,520
It was too difficult, just immediate nope.

541
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,001
So Sunless Skies has way better onboarding, and we've definitely done a lot of work

542
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:56,963
that translates to more sales of Sunless Sea.

543
00:33:56,963 --> 00:33:59,964
After people have tried Skies, they're ready to go get more of the stories

544
00:33:59,964 --> 00:34:02,625
and kind of put up with the fact that Skies, the sea is harder.

545
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:13,294
But I'm looking forward to doing stuff that is not a sequel in the near future.

546
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:16,877
In the medium to near future, that's going to be pretty cool.

547
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:18,129
Cool.

548
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:21,891
The way that you talk about, you know,

549
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:28,333
your career at Fail Better and just talking to us right now,

550
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,694
so much of it is injected with this knowledge

551
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:31,834
of your community.

552
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:36,376
It just makes me feel like you are so in tune

553
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:38,756
with the kind of audience that you wanna reach.

554
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:46,186
So my question is, you know, how do you even begin to build a community around a game and

555
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:49,772
how do you nurture that community and help it grow as time goes on?

556
00:34:51,303 --> 00:34:56,828
I think with a strong perspective and what you might call a super objective, so it comes

557
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,771
back again to being specific.

558
00:34:59,771 --> 00:35:05,196
We recently launched our own Discord, having kind of crouched on the shoulder of a community

559
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:09,900
Discord for a while, and we invited people over, and we had set it up in a way that was

560
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,701
very surprising to them.

561
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:21,813
in a lot of ways because that's our specific way of doing things and that's the vibe that

562
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:23,874
you get when you come to us.

563
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:31,056
And a couple of examples, we have a channel where you can self-assign pronoun roles, really

564
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:37,237
important to our community that they are able to be recognised for the gender that they

565
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:38,398
are.

566
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:42,079
So you can assign roles that are sort of laced loosely on the ones you get in Fallen London

567
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,139
and it's cute.

568
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:44,440
We also banned memes.

569
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:50,246
I feel like really good about it.

570
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:53,628
But people were aghast.

571
00:35:53,628 --> 00:35:56,491
I mean it took about 24 hours for people to sort of go,

572
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:59,053
Oh, okay, you know, whatever.

573
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:00,434
But the fact that we've banned memes...

574
00:36:01,054 --> 00:36:05,779
Which sets us apart, I think from literally every other discord I've ever looked at and I did lots of research

575
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:08,281
it

576
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:12,185
That is a statement of intent and it is specific to fail better

577
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:17,911
It encourages people to have conversations about other stuff without pulling on

578
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:29,810
You know, just the latest meme that it might be something that half of the other people in the channel get and you get to feel smart by sharing it, but not that smart really because you're sort of alienating people.

579
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:39,241
It's brought people back in from the community who'd left other spaces because they felt just excluded, that they didn't understand what was happening because they weren't like deep into meme culture.

580
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:43,523
and instead we've been talking up we were retelling Norse myths and we've

581
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:48,345
gone through a whole big recommendation thread about webcomics and about Russian

582
00:36:48,345 --> 00:36:54,228
literature and all these things that are so idiosyncratic and true to what Felbeta

583
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:58,750
offer people who have literary interests people who have a huge amount of

584
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,492
interest outside of games and they're still happy to be in our discord what

585
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:08,334
was it the thing I said specificity and something else I was very clever when I

586
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:08,694
said it I'm sure

587
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,891
Yeah, we'll just, you know, our listeners can just rewind it.

588
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:15,371
And that other thing, do that as well.

589
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:19,032
Yeah, the other thing it's but yeah, I mean, I'm just talking

590
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:25,193
about the, you know, cultivating your community. And, you know,

591
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:29,054
how do you feel people end up entering your community? Like,

592
00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:31,915
why does somebody come to your discord channel? Or why does

593
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:33,555
somebody want to be a part of it?

594
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:34,455
That's a really good question.

595
00:37:39,295 --> 00:37:42,398
I think because it is safe and because it is different.

596
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:45,580
You can be yourself there in a way that a lot of other...

597
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:58,218
not high toxicity necessarily, but really highly online meme literate, fast velocity kind of

598
00:37:58,218 --> 00:38:03,320
communities can be quite off-putting, to the extent where I think a lot of people just feel

599
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:09,983
like Discord as a general thing isn't for them. Or the way I feel when I'm watching like a live

600
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:14,845
stream with a lot of people just going kek kek kek kek kek face face face face face on Twitch,

601
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:18,106
like oh my god this isn't, this is not for me.

602
00:38:20,772 --> 00:38:27,164
And in terms of people, how people find us, there's a really interesting phenomenon with Fallen London that

603
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:30,209
Ascendancy obviously brought in a lot of players to Fallen London as a persistent game.

604
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:39,353
but we still have people being referred in from TV tropes or people discover it via browsing TV

605
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:44,517
tropes or really once every six months there'll be like a free games you can play on your lunch

606
00:38:44,517 --> 00:38:48,579
break thread on Reddit and Fallen London will get voted to the top and then we'll get a few

607
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:54,463
thousand people join from that um which is just extraordinary when I think of the longevity of

608
00:38:54,463 --> 00:38:58,946
Fallen London but it's formed like a huge part of people's lives it's

609
00:39:00,711 --> 00:39:05,595
for a small number of people, like they check in every day.

610
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:09,438
You spend actions in the game to read stories and

611
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:11,961
some people are planning a year ahead of what they're going to play,

612
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:15,924
they are grinding out a vial of Hesperidion Cider,

613
00:39:15,924 --> 00:39:17,665
which is sort of an immortality juice,

614
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:22,750
which people, it's something you spend every action on for a year.

615
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,413
So they join the community for something to do while they're doing that.

616
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:35,642
Yeah, that's and that's one of the obviously one of the big challenges today is, you know,

617
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:43,050
there's so many games out there. And people are talking about discoverability. So, you know,

618
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:48,996
what's what's your view on today's marketplace? And how do you

619
00:39:50,317 --> 00:39:53,040
You know you've talked to you've talked some ways that you've done it

620
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,966
But what's your view on discoverability and and being effective at getting your game in front of potential customers?

621
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:01,608
Yeah, it's much harder than it used to be and yeah

622
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:05,271
I think that's the entry-level thing to say about it isn't it really but it bears repeating

623
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:08,714
Choosing the space that you want to be in is probably

624
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:24,137
the toughest decision like making sure you have the product that will succeed in the place

625
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:31,820
you know and and then being lucky or or fortunate or timely enough to get an exclusive somewhere

626
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:38,342
that someone will pay you for that could set you up for a long time apple arcade this year has

627
00:40:38,342 --> 00:40:46,344
secured the next year's development for tons of studios yeah out of nowhere um or an epic exclusive

628
00:40:48,786 --> 00:40:58,595
or I think the tightening up of discoverability means that people just need to have commensurate

629
00:40:58,595 --> 00:41:05,240
ambition for what they're trying to do. Being able to sustain what you're doing.

630
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:11,072
making it sustainable as as as like your first point of business

631
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:13,154
is much more important than it used to be

632
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:15,236
and it all ties into these ideas of

633
00:41:15,236 --> 00:41:15,837
of crunch

634
00:41:15,837 --> 00:41:18,559
and one big hit

635
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,201
and

636
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:22,123
being like a one big hit

637
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:25,066
you you can't look at one big hits and then do anything to

638
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,727
to make another one

639
00:41:26,727 --> 00:41:27,528
so you have to kind of

640
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:33,493
look at your life, like it's really serious stuff, look at your life and what do you want it to be

641
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:38,296
like and can you work another job and make your indie game and you know in two evenings a week

642
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:41,599
around caring for your children and is that what you want to do and does it really make you happy?

643
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,561
I think that's the questioning that the democratization of the tools and platforms has led to.

644
00:41:55,684 --> 00:41:59,946
Not that I want to put anyone off doing it, but just to be real.

645
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:03,608
Be real with yourself and don't hurt yourself.

646
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:05,829
We are so...

647
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:12,893
We won the Best Places to Work Award this year and in 2017 and we are sort of more proud

648
00:42:12,893 --> 00:42:15,675
of that than we are even of our games.

649
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:19,857
We want people who are healthy and happy to come in and they don't dread work on a Sunday

650
00:42:19,857 --> 00:42:20,057
night.

651
00:42:20,817 --> 00:42:22,619
and the work works for their life.

652
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,240
That's what we really want.

653
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,162
And to keep doing it, that's the key.

654
00:42:27,162 --> 00:42:28,603
Yeah, absolutely.

655
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:31,144
Do something that makes you happy.

656
00:42:31,144 --> 00:42:33,786
Seems like this weird novel idea

657
00:42:33,786 --> 00:42:34,706
when you frame it that way,

658
00:42:34,706 --> 00:42:36,988
but there's a lot of just kind of chugging away

659
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,049
and making yourself miserable for this thing

660
00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:41,231
that you think is gonna be this hit

661
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:42,111
or make you happy or whatever,

662
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:43,772
but you have to think day to day

663
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:45,253
rather than like the grand picture kind of.

664
00:42:45,722 --> 00:42:49,167
Yeah, basically, you've only got so many hours on the planet.

665
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:53,833
Like what do you want to spend them doing?

666
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,977
I'll offer a podcast, get kind of existential at some point.

667
00:42:57,725 --> 00:43:00,206
It's about the 40 minute mark every time.

668
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:02,968
We've cleared all the chaff now, gang.

669
00:43:02,968 --> 00:43:06,110
Here's the wheat.

670
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:11,953
Well, we are starting to get to the end of our time here.

671
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:14,614
I do want to ask, because I think

672
00:43:14,614 --> 00:43:17,976
this is kind of a practical question, what have you

673
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:23,179
found that have been some of the most effective tools for you

674
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:25,801
as a marketer of games?

675
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:26,341
Is it like?

676
00:43:27,202 --> 00:43:33,443
email, is it trying to get featured on a storefront,

677
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:36,244
discounting games so that people see it?

678
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:39,105
Like what are some of the things that really work

679
00:43:39,105 --> 00:43:41,045
that people should pay attention to?

680
00:43:41,045 --> 00:43:44,726
Collaboration and strategic discounting, I would say.

681
00:43:44,726 --> 00:43:49,487
The biggest things this year that have moved the needle

682
00:43:49,487 --> 00:43:52,068
on selling Sunless Skies since it came out have all been

683
00:43:53,862 --> 00:44:02,265
big sales, targeted sales, and digital collaboration slash events with other developers.

684
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:10,868
As an example, the publisher Fellow Traveller put together an event on Steam, within Steam, called Ludo Naracon.

685
00:44:10,868 --> 00:44:12,628
Ludo, you know, narrative game con.

686
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:18,875
And it was a bunch of their games that they publish and a handful of other people who applied for it.

687
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,597
I saw it on Twitter and I applied for it.

688
00:44:20,597 --> 00:44:25,502
Another important reason to be on Twitter because you find these things.

689
00:44:25,502 --> 00:44:32,550
And that was like a three-day sale where we committed to streaming a live stream of our game on our page.

690
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:40,581
and that was on the front page of Steam in the carousel with other stuff,

691
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:45,583
but it had live features, it had live streaming features, and it had discounts,

692
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:48,845
and we were I think one of like 16 featured games.

693
00:44:48,845 --> 00:44:54,008
But we were giving something to get that really fantastic placement

694
00:44:54,008 --> 00:44:59,811
and really like targeted specific niche.

695
00:44:59,811 --> 00:45:00,972
And we also have done like...

696
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:07,209
similar things with a slightly more altruistic bent like we were part of a steam um sale

697
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:14,370
around the charity War Child who help children in conflict do a big thing around Armistice Day in

698
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:23,152
November. So we created content within Summer Skies of an urchin, a young person who had lost

699
00:45:23,152 --> 00:45:28,254
her parents in conflict and was the star-worn urchin who'd seen too much of the skies and just

700
00:45:28,254 --> 00:45:33,075
wanted to hide away on your ship and she could become your ship's mascot. And because we

701
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:36,856
generated that and came up with that, again in line with the kind of stuff I'm talking about,

702
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:37,457
charitable.

703
00:45:38,437 --> 00:45:44,201
And despite having a game set in Victorian times, we do not just let children get tortured and messed around in our games.

704
00:45:44,201 --> 00:45:50,205
It's one of the content tenets that we had. So she's a really optimistic character.

705
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:54,088
She's not in a workhouse or something, which you'd often get in these slightly more bleak

706
00:45:54,088 --> 00:45:56,110
Victorian based games.

707
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:00,253
And that enabled us to get some visibility around that sale, and then we also raised money for charity.

708
00:46:02,257 --> 00:46:08,278
And I realize I'm saying all these things and it is contingent on having someone at

709
00:46:08,278 --> 00:46:10,879
Steam who listens to you.

710
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:11,759
Not everyone has that.

711
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:17,120
But collaborating with other people who are at a similar level to you, or a slightly more

712
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:21,921
aspirational level than you, is a really good way to reach new audiences.

713
00:46:21,921 --> 00:46:26,963
We're in a couple of bundles now, across different publishers, which makes our game appear on

714
00:46:26,963 --> 00:46:29,783
the Steam pages of other games in a way that we control.

715
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:35,376
and not just algorithmically, which is pretty cool.

716
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,522
So those are the big successes for us.

717
00:46:38,989 --> 00:46:42,632
Well, I mean, you talk about, um, I mean, you just mentioned, of course, like you

718
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:47,737
have these relationships, but I mean, fail better was at one point, you know,

719
00:46:47,737 --> 00:46:52,782
you said you were employee number eight, um, and you got to start somewhere.

720
00:46:52,782 --> 00:46:58,567
So, uh, yeah, it's, it's not like it's unattainable to gain these important

721
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:02,010
relationships with platform holders and whatnot.

722
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:02,571
No.

723
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:04,452
And I think you just have to.

724
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,417
I think a big part of what makes us look legit in the eyes of these platform holders is how

725
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:12,741
much we care about our presence on their platform.

726
00:47:12,741 --> 00:47:17,370
For Steam particularly, we are sort of Steam first, you know, we're porting Sunless Skies

727
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:17,831
next year.

728
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,665
but we developed it with Steam audiences in mind and started there.

729
00:47:24,665 --> 00:47:28,309
And we play the game, you know, our page is gorgeous, it looks great,

730
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:32,233
it's literary, it's a quality prestige sort of a game.

731
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:35,636
That's what people want to see,

732
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:39,981
it matches up with their kind of aspirations for the platform,

733
00:47:39,981 --> 00:47:40,481
I feel.

734
00:47:41,406 --> 00:47:47,449
It's something that you could put on itch with a really interesting indie aesthetic

735
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:54,873
and like, you know, some really traditional interactive fiction with no walking or anything.

736
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:59,595
Like, that's perfect for that platform and that will really energize that audience.

737
00:47:59,595 --> 00:48:04,418
So set it all up over there and see how you get on there.

738
00:48:04,418 --> 00:48:06,699
Like, tailor what you're doing to the space.

739
00:48:07,735 --> 00:48:12,822
Yeah, yeah, it seems like a theme there, being specific and tailoring it for the space.

740
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:18,929
So is there any parting thoughts before we let you go? You're in the UK.

741
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:24,575
Yes, my bedtime.

742
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,175
Yeah, it's bedtime.

743
00:48:26,175 --> 00:48:29,196
It's not even late, I'm just a parent.

744
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:31,216
Oh yeah, I mean, me too, I get it.

745
00:48:31,216 --> 00:48:31,517
Yeah.

746
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:41,379
Yeah, is there any parting thoughts, you know, tips for indies who are kind of trying to get their bearings

747
00:48:41,379 --> 00:48:44,800
marketing in this really tumultuous and difficult marketplace?

748
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,330
just do something now, do something now

749
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:54,211
because it's the same thing as prototyping, you don't know

750
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:59,532
what the finished product will look like and how it will behave until you've tried something

751
00:48:59,532 --> 00:49:03,633
and there's a lot of paralysis in the face of

752
00:49:03,633 --> 00:49:07,874
oh god, I don't even know, what should I tweet?

753
00:49:07,874 --> 00:49:11,215
what did you work on today that would make a funny or interesting gif

754
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:15,435
that is in reasonable shape but you don't mind showing to people

755
00:49:15,435 --> 00:49:17,496
tweet it, target IndieDevHour

756
00:49:18,265 --> 00:49:23,751
show it to someone, you know, begin by doing, begin by doing and don't sit on your laurels

757
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:28,095
because you need that, you need that cultivation time ahead of you.

758
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:33,800
All right, that sounds like a great place to stop and thank you so much for joining

759
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,381
us Hannah and...

760
00:49:34,381 --> 00:49:36,202
Thank you for having me.

761
00:49:36,202 --> 00:49:39,085
Yeah, of course, and best of luck with all your future endeavors.

762
00:49:39,085 --> 00:49:39,265
Thank you.

763
00:49:55,802 --> 00:50:00,370
And we're back. That was a great conversation.

764
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,213
Oh yeah, that was. Marketing's wild.

765
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:10,648
Yeah, I know. It's difficult just the attention span of people, uh, you know, and it's, I mean,

766
00:50:10,648 --> 00:50:15,992
it's me too. I'm not criticizing people for having the attention span of a, of a butterfly

767
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:22,137
these days. I'm the same way. It's just we're, we all get pulled in so many directions now.

768
00:50:22,137 --> 00:50:27,622
Even when I'm playing a game, I noticed that I get distracted by other games

769
00:50:27,622 --> 00:50:31,425
and then I go and start playing another game. Do you do that?

770
00:50:31,986 --> 00:50:36,313
yeah especially the last like month of the year when i'm like oh i want to do my godi list stuff

771
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:39,759
oh uh but this game looks really cool oh but what if i play red dead online

772
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:42,243
for five hours every day instead and like it's

773
00:50:44,288 --> 00:50:51,396
Yeah, yeah, I know. I keep getting distracted by these, these older games and it, you know,

774
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:57,524
it like Destiny 2. I'm randomly decide to get back into Destiny 2 when I need to be catching up.

775
00:50:57,524 --> 00:51:00,487
Well, it was good before, but like they did a lot of good changes recently,

776
00:51:00,487 --> 00:51:01,548
so you're going to be hooked.

777
00:51:01,548 --> 00:51:02,309
Yeah, I know. I like it.

778
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:06,931
Yeah, but that's not a 2019 game.

779
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,472
Shadowkeep came out, I guess.

780
00:51:09,472 --> 00:51:11,653
I guess that you can kind of, that's

781
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:15,974
why it's difficult with these end of year lists.

782
00:51:15,974 --> 00:51:19,896
Like press outlets, we kind of, I

783
00:51:19,896 --> 00:51:23,497
think we should keep on doing it to recognize the new things

784
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,578
that come out every year.

785
00:51:24,578 --> 00:51:29,720
But we do it as a kind of tradition, and a tradition

786
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:29,920
that.

787
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:38,245
You know, I as an editor, I sometimes question the value of it because people do play, you

788
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:40,387
know, there's so many live games now.

789
00:51:40,387 --> 00:51:41,007
Like what's a 2019 game?

790
00:51:41,007 --> 00:51:48,972
And is the game disqualified for this reason or that or the other?

791
00:51:49,092 --> 00:51:52,896
I always found like, I think every year I've written a game of the year list for Gamasutra,

792
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:53,937
I've gotten Hitman on there.

793
00:51:53,937 --> 00:51:55,860
I don't think it's going to be on there this year, but I'll figure it out.

794
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:56,700
You'll find a way to get Hitman on there.

795
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,924
But it's because of live games and like, oh, I will.

796
00:51:59,924 --> 00:52:03,067
And there's just like, yeah, games are, they aren't this like one-time event anymore.

797
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:03,948
The entire landscape has changed.

798
00:52:03,948 --> 00:52:04,129
Yeah.

799
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:04,249
Yeah.

800
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:04,409
Yeah.

801
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:04,509
Yeah.

802
00:52:04,509 --> 00:52:04,629
Yeah.

803
00:52:04,629 --> 00:52:04,729
Yeah.

804
00:52:04,729 --> 00:52:04,809
Yeah.

805
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:04,970
Yeah.

806
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:05,310
Yeah.

807
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:05,450
Yeah.

808
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:05,530
Yeah.

809
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:05,610
Yeah.

810
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:05,710
Yeah.

811
00:52:06,371 --> 00:52:13,956
Yeah, and a game that might have launched this year that stinks might be good next year.

812
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,977
It might be great next year.

813
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:20,640
And what, they just missed the boat on the accomplishments that they got?

814
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:28,163
Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege was like, when it launched in 2014, I don't go out and battle

815
00:52:28,163 --> 00:52:32,765
with years, when it launched several years ago, it was like a shadow of what it is now.

816
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:37,506
It wasn't that great, and now that game is doing really well, it's got a solid community,

817
00:52:37,506 --> 00:52:42,848
it was up for an award at the Game Awards because they recognized in that way that games

818
00:52:42,848 --> 00:52:47,489
are kind of like this process that evolves beyond a launch, especially when you take

819
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:50,210
as good care of it as Ubisoft has, and they're really good at that.

820
00:52:50,989 --> 00:52:54,492
Yeah. And to segue this back into marketing discussion with Hannah.

821
00:52:54,492 --> 00:52:55,132
Marketing.

822
00:52:55,132 --> 00:52:58,895
Yeah. I mean, that is marketing. Live games, like it's like, there's so much

823
00:52:58,895 --> 00:53:02,979
marketing involved with these games that are updated constantly and, you know,

824
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:10,325
feel better. Um, they also update their games regularly. Uh, they're living, if

825
00:53:10,325 --> 00:53:11,646
you will. And.

826
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:17,651
Well, and while the games are living the steam pages for them are kind of like evolving in a similar way as well

827
00:53:17,651 --> 00:53:22,115
Or that process never really stops. It just changes. Yeah

828
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,596
Yeah, and you know

829
00:53:23,596 --> 00:53:32,163
It's been like this forever. I feel like with indie games in particular

830
00:53:32,163 --> 00:53:37,788
People don't you know, they just don't market their their games enough or they don't

831
00:53:37,788 --> 00:53:38,028
You know

832
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:45,146
do it with the same kind of intention that Hannah does.

833
00:53:45,146 --> 00:53:48,108
I mean, she clearly does her research,

834
00:53:48,108 --> 00:53:53,770
like deep research on the audience, on what they want,

835
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:56,511
how to better serve them, how to expand your audience.

836
00:53:56,511 --> 00:54:00,092
She talks about, you know, the store page,

837
00:54:00,092 --> 00:54:01,513
which seems like an obvious.

838
00:54:01,713 --> 00:54:05,997
thing. People know that they should have a store page and they're going to have a store page,

839
00:54:05,997 --> 00:54:11,503
but what makes a good store page? You know, when you Google a game's name, its title,

840
00:54:11,503 --> 00:54:16,848
that's what you come across. The, you know, the Steam page or the main page.

841
00:54:16,848 --> 00:54:20,311
Not just a placeholder, it is an advertisement for the product you're trying to release and

842
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:23,234
yeah, it's easy to forget that. Yeah. And like there were

843
00:54:23,835 --> 00:54:24,455
Oh, go ahead.

844
00:54:24,455 --> 00:54:24,575
Sorry.

845
00:54:24,575 --> 00:54:28,298
I was just going to say that the people who are Googling

846
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,161
the game in particular, they're already aware of it,

847
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:35,204
or else they wouldn't be Googling the name of the game.

848
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:39,828
So they're finding that they're already

849
00:54:39,828 --> 00:54:41,409
close to being part of your community,

850
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:44,331
to being converted into a customer.

851
00:54:44,331 --> 00:54:45,832
They're that close.

852
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:48,795
And then they get to the page, and then they

853
00:54:48,795 --> 00:54:49,816
might just be like, oh.

854
00:54:51,477 --> 00:54:55,779
As we said during the broadcast interview.

855
00:54:55,779 --> 00:55:01,223
There were a lot of takeaways that I didn't write down fast enough because my keyboard

856
00:55:01,223 --> 00:55:02,463
is loud.

857
00:55:02,463 --> 00:55:07,407
But the fact that marketing should be a day one part of the development process is something

858
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:07,627
that like...

859
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:13,091
I think it's not the easiest thing to wrap your head around, because what am I going

860
00:55:13,091 --> 00:55:13,752
to do day one?

861
00:55:13,752 --> 00:55:17,495
But she had some very good advice for what you should do in those early stages.

862
00:55:17,495 --> 00:55:21,119
But otherwise it can be too easy to kind of be like, okay, well, I'm going to work on

863
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:21,539
my game.

864
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:26,059
And then now that I have something shippable, I'm going to start, now that it's ready to go,

865
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:29,663
I'm going to start getting attention on it. And like, you can't segment the process like that.

866
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:29,703
No.

867
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:33,648
She had a lot of really good advice on how to kind of bring that process together and

868
00:55:33,648 --> 00:55:37,052
weave marketing throughout every step of the development process, which was nice.

869
00:55:37,052 --> 00:55:42,338
Yeah. And I hear similar stuff from other people who market games, particularly.

870
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:44,879
indie games, you know

871
00:55:44,879 --> 00:55:50,841
it's funny because you know, I keep an eye on the Steam charts and

872
00:55:50,841 --> 00:55:56,483
Sometimes it'll be like this number one game just came out of nowhere. It's like then you Google it

873
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:59,324
It's like oh it didn't come out of nowhere. They've been

874
00:55:59,324 --> 00:56:03,685
Doing like they've they've been cultivating this community on reddit

875
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:13,493
for the past two years, three years. So there is like this perception among some developers that

876
00:56:13,493 --> 00:56:18,277
oh this game just came out of nowhere, like they must have you know gotten linked somewhere,

877
00:56:18,277 --> 00:56:22,701
got lucky, or just... They had a good idea and it took off on its own. Yeah, it took off on its own, which...

878
00:56:23,702 --> 00:56:27,063
I can't think of a case.

879
00:56:27,063 --> 00:56:31,926
I guess if I thought hard enough, I could think of an exception.

880
00:56:31,926 --> 00:56:36,268
But it's usually like when you see that, quote unquote,

881
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,829
out of nowhere hit on Steam, number one.

882
00:56:40,009 --> 00:56:43,971
Do yourself a favor and Google the name and then find the reddit page

883
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:49,274
like that's been there for like three years that has crap loads of followers and

884
00:56:49,274 --> 00:56:55,377
And then you'll see that and learn from that. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely

885
00:56:55,377 --> 00:56:59,840
So, yeah, let's talk about like the end of end of year stuff real quick end of year stuff

886
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,801
Yeah, we're planning things earlier than we did last year. Yeah

887
00:57:04,802 --> 00:57:05,703
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

888
00:57:05,703 --> 00:57:13,266
For Gamasutra, we do, uh, uh, our end of year lists and, uh, yeah, we, I'm also

889
00:57:13,266 --> 00:57:16,228
pushing back a little bit when we're going to publish these, we're gonna do

890
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:18,189
it, some of the big ones properly.

891
00:57:18,189 --> 00:57:21,871
We're going to wait until the end of the year, just in case something comes right

892
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:26,173
before the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, if a game comes out and it's

893
00:57:26,173 --> 00:57:31,436
just like mind blowing, and then we can laugh at everybody who published their

894
00:57:31,436 --> 00:57:32,016
list too early.

895
00:57:32,733 --> 00:57:36,395
Someone did that last year where everyone was like, all right, I got my list ready to go.

896
00:57:36,395 --> 00:57:39,776
And then the next day, some really cool indie dev published some really cool game.

897
00:57:39,776 --> 00:57:43,858
And I'm like, ah, yeah, that'd be, uh, that's what I would do.

898
00:57:43,858 --> 00:57:47,339
If I was an indie developer, like a really talented one.

899
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:48,300
People's gaming your list.

900
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:48,840
Yeah.

901
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:56,763
Just like release my amazing game right before the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

902
00:57:56,763 --> 00:57:56,983
Yeah.

903
00:57:56,983 --> 00:57:59,404
That'll really get those journalists.

904
00:57:59,404 --> 00:58:01,005
That'll show them.

905
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:09,594
We've got best trends coming up in comics future best events best devs. Yeah of the year and then best games

906
00:58:09,594 --> 00:58:14,901
That's not all of the categories we hit. Yeah, we're all gonna do games

907
00:58:14,901 --> 00:58:21,008
Apple arcade games. Yeah. Yeah, I don't really like a lot of Apple arcade games this year. There's some good stuff

908
00:58:21,815 --> 00:58:26,480
It's my Grindstone subscription, but sometimes I remember to branch out a little bit.

909
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,882
I like having narrative games on my phone, so that's really nice.

910
00:58:28,882 --> 00:58:31,224
Yeah, Grindstone is great.

911
00:58:31,224 --> 00:58:34,447
Bleak Sword is incredible.

912
00:58:34,447 --> 00:58:37,770
I will sing Neocab's praises.

913
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:38,390
It's so good.

914
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,031
Yeah.

915
00:58:39,031 --> 00:58:44,596
Dear Reader is another one that is very good, that doesn't have a lot of, like, cool...

916
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:48,526
characters or attention or anything on it, I think, but it's just a really cool literary

917
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:49,126
puzzle.

918
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,287
It's really great.

919
00:58:50,287 --> 00:58:50,788
It's a lot of fun.

920
00:58:50,788 --> 00:58:52,609
I stayed up until 4am playing it.

921
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:53,030
Yeah.

922
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:57,273
It's been interesting seeing the kinds of games that are being recognized.

923
00:58:57,273 --> 00:59:04,158
Some of them are kind of what you would expect on other publications' top 10 lists, like

924
00:59:04,158 --> 00:59:06,940
you got Outer Wilds.

925
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,763
That's being really talked about, that's a great game.

926
00:59:09,763 --> 00:59:10,383
I know, right?

927
00:59:10,383 --> 00:59:10,583
Yeah.

928
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:13,895
The first 10 minutes are great.

929
00:59:13,895 --> 00:59:15,257
I don't have any free time.

930
00:59:15,257 --> 00:59:17,079
Hey, you got plenty of time.

931
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:21,484
You got, I'll get it to it after my list is written before the end of the year,

932
00:59:21,484 --> 00:59:22,505
unfortunately, but yeah.

933
00:59:22,505 --> 00:59:25,008
Just make sure to play it before the stroke of midnight.

934
00:59:25,008 --> 00:59:27,450
Years, even it can make, make your list.

935
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:31,775
So yeah, I think that that's all for this week for the GDC podcast.

936
00:59:32,594 --> 00:59:34,295
two more podcasts away from GDC itself.

937
00:59:34,295 --> 00:59:37,958
Yeah, we are officially two podcasts away from GDC,

938
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:42,121
which I don't know what our podcast plans are exactly,

939
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:47,065
but might get a torrent of,

940
00:59:47,065 --> 00:59:50,668
like a torrential downpour of podcasts

941
00:59:50,668 --> 00:59:53,971
out of GDC during GDC week.

942
00:59:53,971 --> 00:59:56,313
But that's not a promise.

943
00:59:56,313 --> 00:59:57,354
All that good content.

944
00:59:57,354 --> 00:59:58,675
There'll be good content no matter what.

945
00:59:58,675 --> 01:00:01,277
Yeah, there'll be some kind of hashtag content.

946
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:07,909
Yeah, so check us out on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify,

947
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:11,650
and we're at YouTube where you can stare at a static picture

948
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,791
and listen to us or just change tabs on us

949
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:19,051
and just listen to us out of your computer speakers.

950
01:00:19,051 --> 01:00:20,672
We'll never know either way.

951
01:00:20,672 --> 01:00:22,572
Yeah, you could play a video game

952
01:00:22,572 --> 01:00:27,593
that we are talking about on the podcast on your computer

953
01:00:27,593 --> 01:00:28,613
while listening to it.

954
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:32,930
I'm not sure. I think my brain is melting.

955
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,191
It's the last month of the year.

956
01:00:35,191 --> 01:00:37,091
It's the last couple of weeks of the year.

957
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:38,652
Yeah, it's just, it melted.

958
01:00:38,652 --> 01:00:39,412
It's gone.

959
01:00:39,412 --> 01:00:39,512
Yeah.

960
01:00:39,512 --> 01:00:40,832
All right, everyone.

961
01:00:40,832 --> 01:00:41,332
Thanks again.

962
01:00:41,332 --> 01:00:42,553
Thank you.

963
01:00:42,553 --> 01:00:46,814
If you enjoy us, if you love us,

964
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:49,254
leave us a good review, give us a thumbs up on YouTube,

965
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:56,056
give us a five star review on iTunes.

966
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:57,877
I mean, this is what we have to do, right?

967
01:00:57,877 --> 01:00:58,977
That's what Hannah was talking about.

968
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:01,200
Reviews are important for podcasts too.

969
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:01,881
Yeah, that's right.

970
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:02,882
They really are.

971
01:01:02,882 --> 01:01:03,702
Please like.

972
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,084
Yeah, please like.

973
01:01:05,084 --> 01:01:05,324
Be kind.

974
01:01:05,324 --> 01:01:08,366
All right, thanks everyone and we'll see you next time.

975
01:01:08,366 --> 01:01:08,727
Bye.

976
01:01:08,727 --> 01:01:09,107
Bye.

977
01:01:35,977 --> 01:01:36,038
you
