1
00:00:06,096 --> 00:00:12,738
Good morning everyone. Thank you so very much to be here today at such early hour in the morning

2
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:20,281
to talk about ethics. It's a subject, a topic that is becoming really dear to my heart and

3
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:25,963
I really appreciate that you wake up early to come listen to what I have to say.

4
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:28,085
So my name is Celia Houdin.

5
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:32,350
I have a PhD in psychology, so cognitive psychology

6
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,110
is my background.

7
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,313
And in the past 10 years, I've been

8
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,614
working in the game industry.

9
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:40,778
I started at Ubisoft over 10 years ago in France,

10
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:42,280
because I'm French, hence the accent.

11
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,364
And I was working with the editorial team

12
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:48,947
there mostly in the strategic innovation lab.

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:58,575
Then I moved to Ubisoft Montreal where I worked at the Playtest Lab and also worked on various franchises and mostly Rainbow Six.

14
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:10,681
I moved early 2012 in San Francisco at LucasArts to work on Star Wars games and after LucasArts closed in 2013 I moved to Epic Games.

15
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:14,304
So I became director of user experience at Epic.

16
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:19,989
I was overseeing several projects

17
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,711
in terms of UX and UX strategy,

18
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:25,775
such as Unreal Engine and multiple games,

19
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:26,796
and of course Fortnite.

20
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:32,602
And I left Epic at the end of 2017 to become a consultant.

21
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:35,324
So today I'm again UX consultant, I work independently.

22
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:39,707
And as you can see, I am not an ethicist.

23
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:43,750
So this is just my humble perspective on the topic

24
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,292
through a cognitive science lens, which is my background.

25
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,254
And this is what I wanted to share with you today.

26
00:01:50,274 --> 00:01:53,316
It's still very much a work in progress.

27
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:56,258
I do not pretend to offer you the right angle

28
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:57,259
to treat the topic.

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,422
complicated topic, it's delicate.

30
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:05,026
So it's just, I care about it,

31
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:09,490
and so I just wanted to offer you my reflection

32
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,150
and where I'm at.

33
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:12,973
Hopefully it's gonna be interesting for you,

34
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,315
and I'm looking forward to your feedback

35
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,197
so we can start a conversation about this.

36
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:24,062
Okay, so video games generate the most revenues in the entertainment industry today, while

37
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:25,984
often having terrible press.

38
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:32,210
Some of the games we've worked on, or we are working on, are accused of making people violent,

39
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,811
turn them into addicts.

40
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:40,018
It's quite disheartening, especially since most of this is just fear-mongering with no

41
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:41,359
solid scientific grounds.

42
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:47,425
However, as content providers, we have certain ethical responsibilities

43
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,047
that we need to discuss more about.

44
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:52,811
So today we are going to talk about four main topics.

45
00:02:53,952 --> 00:03:00,898
We're going to talk about addiction, loot boxes and gambling, violence, and dog pardon.

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,005
Actually, I'm going to start with Dr. Edmund and I'll talk about violence in the end.

47
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:16,516
And for these different elements, we're going to go through what the public is concerned

48
00:03:16,556 --> 00:03:16,797
about.

49
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:21,601
And what science actually says, I'm going to debunk some fear-mongering claims

50
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:28,386
that actually I believe it's steering us away from addressing what truly is a concern.

51
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:32,890
And from these concerns, I'm going to see what we could do about it.

52
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,092
Notice I'm saying here could, not should.

53
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:42,057
This is again just some suggestions of what we can talk about.

54
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:47,717
This is by no means an exhaustive list.

55
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:50,919
And this is not about pointing fingers.

56
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:54,841
I'm going to be very careful to not be pointing fingers in the game industry.

57
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:57,483
Not because we should not address these concerns,

58
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:01,345
but I think it's too early in my reflection to start doing that,

59
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:03,227
and I think it's not the moment right now.

60
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,729
So, it's more going to be like, hey, if you're doing this,

61
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:09,771
this is maybe what's going on with your players.

62
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:12,472
It's just, again, an invitation to think about these things.

63
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:18,674
And again, I'm not an ethicist, and this topic needs much more in-depth expertise

64
00:04:19,354 --> 00:04:21,135
than I have to be tackled properly.

65
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:25,616
And of course, the diversity of perspective to define, you know,

66
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,337
what are the moral values I want to defend.

67
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:33,558
But because I have a cognitive science background, I can actually debunk some

68
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:38,679
of these things and explain some others, and I'll take it from there.

69
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,582
So it's just an invitation.

70
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:44,283
All right.

71
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:45,764
Let's start it.

72
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:48,186
So addiction.

73
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:52,009
We hear a lot about addiction these days.

74
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:56,953
And the biggest concern is video games are addictive.

75
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,796
And so you have all these parents

76
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:01,557
that are very worried for their kids

77
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:05,020
and people who suffer from addiction.

78
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:09,082
And in some countries such as South Korea and China,

79
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:11,483
video gaming has been recognized as a disorder

80
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:13,784
and treatment programs have been established.

81
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,825
So what does science say?

82
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:24,268
The Internet Gaming Disorder was added in 2013 in the DSM-5.

83
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:28,189
So the DSM-5 is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual

84
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:30,470
of Mental Disorders, and it's used

85
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,791
by mental health professionals to diagnose mental disorders.

86
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,510
There was not sufficient evidence

87
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,352
to determine whether the condition is a unique mental

88
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:42,593
disorder or the best criteria to classify it at the time

89
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:45,995
of the DSM-5 was published in 2013.

90
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:51,558
However, it's recognized internally gaming disorder

91
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:53,159
in a section recommending conditions

92
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,501
for further research along with caffeine use disorder

93
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:57,281
and other conditions.

94
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,388
like alcohol, tobacco, stimulants, marijuana, and opiate,

95
00:06:02,408 --> 00:06:04,470
like substance-related addictive disorders.

96
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:08,535
Gambling disorder is the only behavioral addiction identified

97
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:11,339
in the DSM-5, as opposed to substance use.

98
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:19,470
So the DSM-5 notes that gaming must cause significant impairment or distress

99
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,692
in several aspects of a person's life.

100
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:26,637
This proposed condition is limited to gaming and does not include problems with general use

101
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:29,881
of the internet, online gambling, or use of social media or smart phones.

102
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:36,267
So the proposed symptoms of internet gaming disorder include, I'm sorry it's small, but.

103
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:40,985
Preoccupation with gaming, withdrawal syndromes when gaming is taking away,

104
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:48,530
like sadness, anxiety, irritability, tolerance, the need to spend more time gaming

105
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:54,414
to satisfy the urge, inability to reduce playing, unsexual attempts to quit gaming,

106
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:59,558
giving up other activities, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities due to gaming,

107
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,340
continuing to game despite problems.

108
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:05,405
deceiving family members or others about the amount

109
00:07:05,445 --> 00:07:09,946
of time spent on gaming, the use of gaming to relieve negative

110
00:07:09,986 --> 00:07:11,847
moods such as guilt or hopelessness,

111
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:15,048
risk having jeopardized or lost a job

112
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:16,848
or relationship due to gaming.

113
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,149
So under the proposed criteria, a diagnosis

114
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,370
of internet gaming disorder would require experiencing five

115
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,571
or more of these symptoms within a year.

116
00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:33,801
You also might have heard about the World Health Organization

117
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:37,563
in late 2017 who announced that in the coming edition,

118
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,526
the 11th revision of the International Classification

119
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:43,708
of Diseases, ICD, gamete disorder will be identified

120
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:44,549
as a new disorder.

121
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:51,998
So the problem is that so far, the researchers don't agree.

122
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,099
There's no consensus.

123
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,740
A lot of people are actually saying that there's a lack

124
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,661
of rigorous research to back it up,

125
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,062
to really create a gaming disorder.

126
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,104
And it's creating a moral panic,

127
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:08,946
and it can also stigmatize billions of gamers.

128
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,467
We have over two billion gamers in the world today.

129
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:15,689
So if we identify what gaming is a disorder,

130
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,490
like a new disorder,

131
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,132
then we're really creating a specific classification.

132
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,533
And it can stigmatize people,

133
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:26,615
and again, can create a treatment or a center assistant.

134
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:30,737
Gamers that actually don't have an addiction,

135
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:33,360
they can have a problem with games,

136
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,623
but they don't have like a gaming addiction,

137
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:37,144
the problem may be somewhere else.

138
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:42,049
So that's right now what the scientists,

139
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,110
the researchers are saying.

140
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,493
It's not, it's really, there's no consensus.

141
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:48,376
It's way too early to draw these conclusions.

142
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:56,102
And our research found that 0.3 to 1% of the general population

143
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:59,665
might qualify for a potential diagnosis of internet gaming

144
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,145
disorder.

145
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:02,487
So it's very small.

146
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:05,889
And we need to distinguish between passionate engagement

147
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:08,972
with video games and a true pathology.

148
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:16,639
So whether the gamer is distressed with their gaming may be the key factor in distinguishing the two.

149
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,104
So this is what this research is saying.

150
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:33,376
And this article by Schubeskeel and Orban, they're saying that problematic gaming is best viewed as coping mechanisms associated with the underlying problems such as anxiety or depression.

151
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:38,031
So, if you have a problem with gaming, if you qualify to say

152
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:42,493
that you're addicted to gaming, the problem is most likely

153
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:45,474
outside of that you have anxiety, depression,

154
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:48,895
you have problems and you escape through gaming.

155
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:54,038
So, this is where we're at at the moment.

156
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:01,981
That being said, we do tend to use the term addiction

157
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:02,701
or addictive.

158
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:05,814
all the time, and we do that ourselves.

159
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,036
So what we could do, we could try

160
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,956
to avoid using the term addictive

161
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:16,037
to start, to describe fun and engaging games.

162
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:20,179
So if you look at games on the Apple Store,

163
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,200
you'll find a few games that are describing themselves are super

164
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,661
addictive, as if this was a good thing.

165
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:32,364
It's not. It's actually a problem. Some people really suffer of game addiction.

166
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:37,307
So what you want to say is this is a fun and engaging game, not addictive.

167
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:40,209
We should not use that term as if it was a good thing.

168
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:41,752
Words matter.

169
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,532
Using the term addiction instead of engaging

170
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:46,633
is reinforcing a stigma, and it's

171
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,393
downplaying real addictions.

172
00:10:49,193 --> 00:10:51,533
So game developers do that.

173
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:55,714
Journalists will use that term instead of saying engagement.

174
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:59,355
Or gamers also say, oh, it's a fun game, super addictive.

175
00:10:59,395 --> 00:10:59,715
I love it.

176
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,036
Try to think about the words that you're using.

177
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,776
Addiction is a problem.

178
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:09,837
So an addictive game is not a good thing.

179
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:21,819
Other thing I wanted to point out is children and teenagers have low self-control and they

180
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,280
have a hard time delaying gratification.

181
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:31,894
Granted that adults have problems with that too, but children even more so, they are not

182
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:35,476
completely mature to be able to exert self-control.

183
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:42,598
So therefore, maybe we should not exploit their weakness and maybe we should try, before

184
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:43,759
all the names are rated.

185
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,102
teen or everyone should have mechanics that encourage breaks.

186
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:52,484
Especially if you know that, I mean, if it's specifically targeted to children,

187
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:55,286
you want to have moments when there's nothing else to do.

188
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,567
Like, think about Animal Crossing.

189
00:11:57,207 --> 00:12:00,289
There's a moment when you have not much to do but wait

190
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,592
until once you've completed your tasks.

191
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:12,497
So think about how we can have mechanics that can encourage breaks,

192
00:12:12,758 --> 00:12:14,018
especially if you target kids.

193
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:21,020
There's also a lot of discussion these days about attention economy.

194
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:28,963
So you might have heard of Tristan Harris, who is an ex-Googler and was an ethicist there.

195
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,583
And now he started his own thing.

196
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:38,545
He wants to talk about all these mechanics that are made to keep you engaged with a platform.

197
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:43,487
Of course, all the platforms on the internet, Google, Facebook, Twitter.

198
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:51,519
Snapchat, they measure their revenues through the time you spend on your website.

199
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,820
This is how they can make money.

200
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:58,404
And so this is, they're trying to maximize for that.

201
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:00,566
This is also what we try to do.

202
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:03,308
We try to maximize, you know, we need to make profits.

203
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,671
So we try to maximize that, make sure that people are engaged.

204
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:10,313
But while doing that, and it's not necessarily.

205
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,490
We don't necessarily want to do that.

206
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,471
We don't necessarily want to trap people.

207
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:17,192
But this is what can happen for some people.

208
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:21,554
If you have a mechanic that you have auto-play on YouTube,

209
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:24,695
you watch a video, and after the video is over,

210
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:30,257
you actually have a few seconds before you can say, no, no, no.

211
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,438
I don't want to see the next video.

212
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:33,478
But they're going to auto-play a next video.

213
00:13:33,518 --> 00:13:36,219
So sometimes it's cool because it's about what you care about.

214
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,720
And sometimes it's a completely unrelated subject.

215
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,702
We do that too, and multiplayer games.

216
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:49,925
Some games are rematching you in a new game automatically.

217
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,707
You don't have to say, you know, I want to play another match.

218
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:56,829
It's automatically put you in a new match unless you opt out for it.

219
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,773
Another example that's super under fire right now is Snapchat with the Snapstreaks.

220
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:04,414
I don't know if you heard of that.

221
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:08,116
But on Snapchat, if you, so you send a message to.

222
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:11,899
your friend and your friend has 24 hours to send a message back

223
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:16,101
and you know if every day you send a message to one another then you

224
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:19,163
accumulate points and then you have streaks

225
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:23,245
and apparently it's creating like for some kids they have

226
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:27,828
a hard time not keep you know stop the streak and if the streak

227
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:31,731
You know, it's hard for them to handle it.

228
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,674
And they're currently under fire with this specific mechanic

229
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:40,178
because it's really forcing the kids to keep going and replying.

230
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:42,680
And apparently some kids are asking their friends

231
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,482
when they're on vacation to sign in on their account

232
00:14:45,522 --> 00:14:46,663
to keep this rate going.

233
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:49,596
So think about that.

234
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:53,198
We are also using some of these elements.

235
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:56,181
Should we not use that?

236
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:57,642
What's the implication of it?

237
00:14:58,502 --> 00:15:05,147
So it's one of the things that we can try to do is avoid, to start, you know,

238
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:07,428
punishing disengagement, that would be a good start.

239
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,652
You know, you had the fear of missing out, and if your players are not here, their friends

240
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:19,675
might be playing and accumulating XP, and you're like, oh, I missed something.

241
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:24,337
And when they come back, they can see the discrepancy and they can see all the things

242
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:24,717
they missed.

243
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:29,600
What we can do instead of guilt-tripping them and saying, oh, look at what you're missing

244
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,441
and your friends are playing and you're not, and here's what they did and you didn't.

245
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:37,365
we can actually try to not punish disengagement.

246
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,687
World of Warcraft does that, for example,

247
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:42,189
if you stop playing and you take a break.

248
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,153
When you come back, your XP bar is gonna go down.

249
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:52,477
It's going to increase twice as fast as if you did not have a break.

250
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:57,660
So that's allowing you to catch up with your friends if you took a break.

251
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,462
So think about that sort of things so that at the very least,

252
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,804
your players are not punished for not engaging with your platform.

253
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:07,625
They should not feel trapped into keep playing.

254
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:14,290
And most of us, I know, struggle to survive given the competition.

255
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,311
So of course, the main question is,

256
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,893
how are we going to be able to survive in this industry

257
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:20,993
if I do a free-to-play game?

258
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:22,454
It's extremely difficult.

259
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:24,875
We see a lot of our studios closing.

260
00:16:24,935 --> 00:16:27,617
Even our studios have had a lot of budget.

261
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:29,758
It's extremely hard.

262
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:32,059
So most of us, we're just trying to survive

263
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:33,640
and make sure that we have good retention

264
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,262
so people monetize, and we can keep making games.

265
00:16:38,202 --> 00:16:41,606
But for those of you, if you have a game that's

266
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:44,470
super successful, maybe now you can

267
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,772
consider collaborating with psychiatrists

268
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:49,556
to find ways to identify and help struggling gamers.

269
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:52,118
And maybe consider working with researchers

270
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:53,600
to help them define gaming disorders.

271
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:57,665
So I know it's a hard conversation to have,

272
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:00,669
but there are some problems and maybe we can start

273
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:04,694
looking at it before waiting that we are under fire,

274
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:07,778
just like Snapchat or Facebook or whoever,

275
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,543
to start looking at solutions to these issues.

276
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:18,533
All right, so now I'm going to talk about loot boxes and gambling.

277
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:23,016
So the main public concerns that loot boxes are like gambling.

278
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:26,900
And gambling is not considered like a good thing.

279
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:31,744
And it's minors are not allowed to gamble in most of the countries.

280
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:36,070
And the Netherlands and Belgium now consider loot boxes

281
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,071
as gambling and are thus illegal.

282
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,953
The Chinese government considers that the video game industry

283
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:41,953
needs strict control.

284
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:43,534
So you've probably heard of that.

285
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:45,656
But last year, there was a 10-month freeze

286
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:47,797
before China finally accepted to release video games

287
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:48,918
on its territory.

288
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,519
As of today, I believe it's a freeze again.

289
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,321
China formed a regulatory committee, the Online Games

290
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:58,303
Ethics Committee, to oversee the approval of new games

291
00:17:58,423 --> 00:17:59,104
on their territory.

292
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:01,205
And so the review can take a while.

293
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:04,386
So now more regulations are coming up,

294
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:06,928
more and more countries are looking into this.

295
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,972
So what does science say?

296
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:12,833
So the definition of gambling,

297
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:15,936
so one of the definition that is the most out there

298
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:18,759
is playing a game for money or anything of value,

299
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,661
mostly requiring an ability to cash out.

300
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:23,203
So think about casinos.

301
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:27,286
But both gambling and casinos and loot box,

302
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:31,349
and games, and RNG, but we can't talk about all that,

303
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,111
are a form of what we call an intermittent reward

304
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:37,573
with a variable ratio reinforcement schedule.

305
00:18:38,254 --> 00:18:39,315
Heard of the Skinner box?

306
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:40,255
This is it.

307
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:43,638
So I'm going to explain a little bit what it is

308
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:45,979
because not everybody is super clear

309
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,921
about what the Skinner box is.

310
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:53,184
So this is behavioral psychology conditioning.

311
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:59,186
And a skinner put rats and pigeons and whatever in boxes.

312
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:02,888
And they had to do a certain thing when there was a stimulus

313
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:04,970
to say, oh, at some point, they're

314
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,952
going to light a green light.

315
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:12,495
And if the rat presses a lever at that moment

316
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:17,138
to answer to that stimulus, then the rat

317
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:19,200
is going to get some food, like a pellet of food.

318
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:24,953
So you have stimulus, the rat has to have a response, and if it's the correct response,

319
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:25,934
the rat is rewarded.

320
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:29,719
If it's not the correct answer, the rat can be punished.

321
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,323
So this is what the Skinner box is.

322
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:36,639
This is how it looks like.

323
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,604
If you want to shape the behaviors of rats or people,

324
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:45,828
if you want to see an increase of a certain behavior,

325
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:49,531
like say the rat is pressing this level at a certain time,

326
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:54,616
or you want the players to log in to your game a certain time,

327
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:56,378
you have to reward that behavior.

328
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:02,576
So you can reward that behavior by giving a carrot.

329
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:05,819
You did the right thing, so here's your reward.

330
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:07,180
You have a cookie.

331
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:10,904
Or you can reward the behavior by removing something

332
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:13,226
that was considered a stick.

333
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,289
So let's say for the rat, what it was doing

334
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:20,353
is the rat had electrical shocks up until it

335
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:21,634
was pressing the lever.

336
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,756
And so if it was the right answer,

337
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:25,498
then the electrical shocks would stop.

338
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,277
which is rewarding because now no pain anymore.

339
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:33,441
So you can either give a reward or remove something

340
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:36,864
that's considered as a punishment.

341
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,587
And if you want to see a decrease of behavior,

342
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:41,168
you don't want the rat to press the lever.

343
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:44,831
Then when the rat does it, you punish the rat by, I guess,

344
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:46,953
a death penalty.

345
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:51,249
giving a stick, you know, beating with a stick, so a critical shock.

346
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:58,012
Or if your player, you don't want them to go in an area that's super difficult for them because they're low level,

347
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:02,114
they try to enter the area, they have instant kill, that's a punishment, and they're like,

348
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:07,677
okay, I'm not going to try that again. They understand that this is not a good, a good, the optimum solution.

349
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:10,960
And the same thing, you can also remove a carrot.

350
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:16,164
So if, for example, the rat is doing something

351
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:18,146
that we don't want the rat to see,

352
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:20,868
then the rat is not going to have the food.

353
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:24,150
Like, we remove the food from the rat's cage.

354
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,792
For players, if we don't want them

355
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:31,857
to be harassing other players online, and if they do it,

356
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:33,938
well, we can punish them by banning them

357
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:35,760
from the community for a certain time.

358
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:38,874
So when we do that, we shape behavior.

359
00:21:38,914 --> 00:21:41,295
And it's not necessarily a bad thing.

360
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:44,477
When we design something, it's all about shaping behavior.

361
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:47,599
Video games, it's a bunch of stimuli.

362
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,620
And the player is going to do some things that's allowed.

363
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,501
And actually, it's good.

364
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,942
You can min-max if you do that.

365
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,563
Or other behaviors are not that efficient.

366
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:58,604
And so players, through experimentation,

367
00:21:59,164 --> 00:21:59,745
figure this out.

368
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:04,539
But usually rewards are more effective than punishment

369
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,881
if you want to see a behavior increasing.

370
00:22:09,183 --> 00:22:12,426
So I'm gonna just like focus on rewards.

371
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:14,488
You have different types of rewards.

372
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:18,111
Rewards can be continuous or intermittent.

373
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:20,554
It's continuous every time you do the action,

374
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:21,775
you're always rewarded.

375
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:24,137
And it's intermittent when the behavior is sometimes.

376
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:29,517
rewarded. So if you always open the chest and every time you open the chest you have

377
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:33,821
something awesome, that's continuous. If you open the chest sometimes you have something

378
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:39,647
awesome and sometimes you don't, you have crap. This is intermittent. Intermittent rewards

379
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:44,271
are more engaging. You have different types of intermittent rewards. It can be based on

380
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:48,776
time, we call that interval. Or it can be based on behavior, it's called a ratio.

381
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:52,979
Both of them can be either fixed or variable.

382
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,602
It's fixed when you can anticipate it.

383
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:58,028
It's variable when you don't know when or how it's going to happen.

384
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,518
I'm going to give you a few examples just in games

385
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:03,219
so I can have a better idea.

386
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:06,340
A fixed interval is any time the reward

387
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:15,543
is happening at a very precise moment, like daily rewards.

388
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:18,484
You know that every morning, if you log in,

389
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:19,805
you can have your daily reward.

390
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,465
Now, you can log in 10 times.

391
00:23:23,046 --> 00:23:23,646
It doesn't matter.

392
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:25,107
You only have the reward once.

393
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,603
Maybe it's at 7 a.m., you have the new reward,

394
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:28,924
and you know when it's gonna happen,

395
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,544
so you don't need to log in several times to have it.

396
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:32,425
It's once and for all.

397
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,965
So you can anticipate when it's happening.

398
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:38,266
Variable interval is still based on time,

399
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:40,287
but you can't anticipate it.

400
00:23:40,947 --> 00:23:42,747
So an example in games would be rare spawns.

401
00:23:43,307 --> 00:23:44,968
You know that at some point they're gonna spawn here,

402
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:47,068
so you're looking for them, they're here, no.

403
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:48,429
Oh, it's here now.

404
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:50,469
So you know that it's gonna happen.

405
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:51,990
It's not based on your behavior.

406
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,250
You can just dance around,

407
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,070
and I can do a little.

408
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:58,448
sinks on whatever, it's not going to make the response spawning.

409
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:01,330
It's just based on time, but you don't know when.

410
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,191
Ratio is based on behaviors, based on what you do.

411
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:09,533
When it's fixed, you have to do a certain number of actions

412
00:24:09,954 --> 00:24:10,974
before getting the reward.

413
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:15,996
So typically, it's like if you have to kill 10 zombies

414
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:21,579
to get an achievement.

415
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:24,026
that's typically a fixed ratio.

416
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,887
Because you have to do it 10 times

417
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:27,068
before getting the reward.

418
00:24:27,808 --> 00:24:28,749
And when it's variable,

419
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,990
it's like no matter how many times you do it,

420
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,671
like opening a box,

421
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:35,412
you're gonna be rewarded at some point,

422
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:36,953
but you don't know when,

423
00:24:36,973 --> 00:24:38,494
you don't know after how many times

424
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:40,895
you click on it to open it and get something.

425
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:44,037
So you can't really,

426
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:45,357
you don't really know it.

427
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,238
And that's the variable ratio,

428
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,260
that it's at the heart of gamblings,

429
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,941
not machines and loot boxes and card packs and all that.

430
00:24:54,146 --> 00:25:01,309
Back into Skinner box and the rat and all that, this is how these rewards, the impact

431
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:02,750
that they have on behavior.

432
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,333
So if you look, so you have the fixed ones, so you know when it's predictable.

433
00:25:08,793 --> 00:25:12,775
The variable ones, you don't know how it's going to happen, it's not predictable.

434
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:14,636
Interval based on time.

435
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:17,217
Ratio based on behavior.

436
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:21,821
And you see the ones that are fixed, so after you have it,

437
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:23,803
because you could predict it, you were like,

438
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:26,545
oh, I'm gonna do that, it's gonna be at that moment,

439
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:27,746
or it's gonna be after 10 times.

440
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:29,347
As soon as you have the reward,

441
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,129
you see there's a decrease in behavior.

442
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,311
So you have it, and then you stop engaging

443
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,353
for a little while until you know you can engage again,

444
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:37,815
or you want to have more stuff again.

445
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,831
When it's variable, you don't see that drop in behavior.

446
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:44,612
It stays way more constant.

447
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:47,713
And when you see an interval, it's constant,

448
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:51,274
but it's not as intense as ratio.

449
00:25:52,314 --> 00:25:55,255
You can see here that the variable ratio ones,

450
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:59,036
so loot boxes, is where you have the highest and more steady

451
00:25:59,276 --> 00:25:59,837
response rate.

452
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:04,757
So we know that this is engaging people more.

453
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:07,058
So it's not necessarily a bad thing.

454
00:26:07,578 --> 00:26:09,259
There's a lot of games that use that.

455
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,960
Every time you have a game where you have a throw of dice

456
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:13,061
is using this.

457
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:14,622
Sometimes you're gonna have a shitty score

458
00:26:14,662 --> 00:26:15,802
and sometimes you have double sixes

459
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:17,463
and you're like, yoo-hoo!

460
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:20,264
So it's not, again, it's not bad

461
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:23,206
and there's a lot of mechanics that use that.

462
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:27,187
It's more questionable when you use that for monetization.

463
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:28,628
So for having people...

464
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:35,631
pay, engage through their money. And again, it's not new. I grew up with card packs.

465
00:26:36,852 --> 00:26:42,615
Yeah, I was super into the middle ones. But you know, like sports card packs.

466
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:44,911
Of course, magic.

467
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:46,711
So it's not new.

468
00:26:47,592 --> 00:26:49,152
What is a bit new?

469
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,153
And of course, critical hit.

470
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:52,493
Sorry, I should have mentioned that.

471
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:56,035
Critical hit is also sometimes you're going to shoot at enemies

472
00:26:56,095 --> 00:26:58,036
and at some point you're going to kill them.

473
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:00,617
Because, oh, critical hit, you're awesome, feels good.

474
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:03,378
And again, it's a type of variable ratio.

475
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:05,640
So it's not necessarily a problem,

476
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,782
it's actually pretty exciting.

477
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:09,905
It's more a problem when it touches monetization.

478
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:15,290
And what's a bit new nowadays is that there are less steps

479
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:18,594
for us to really exert self-control.

480
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:22,297
Because in one click now we can buy.

481
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:24,980
It's not like as a kid you wanted to have a new card back,

482
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,822
you maybe have to ask your parents.

483
00:27:27,342 --> 00:27:29,423
maybe get the money and then go buy it.

484
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:32,584
So there's a lot of different steps that you have to wait.

485
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,604
And today we don't have all these steps,

486
00:27:34,624 --> 00:27:37,305
so it's harder to actually exert self-control.

487
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:38,285
And on top of that,

488
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:40,706
we can have a lot of different hard currencies

489
00:27:41,086 --> 00:27:43,507
that is also adding some distance

490
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:45,047
between you and actual money.

491
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:46,467
So it's hard to really remember

492
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:47,588
if you're actually spending money.

493
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:56,141
And lastly, there are some games where you can actually get something valuable in real life.

494
00:27:56,342 --> 00:28:00,024
So a lot of people are saying, yeah, but you know, in games, even, you know, you buy loot boxes,

495
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:03,446
but it doesn't have a value outside of the game, just inside of the game.

496
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:11,831
So it's not really like gambling, except that you have marketplaces where sometimes you can sell an item that you got through loot boxes.

497
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:14,073
And then it is like gambling.

498
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:18,599
So again, maybe it's not a problem for adults,

499
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,939
even though it's hard for us to exert self-control.

500
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,559
We're supposed to be able to do that.

501
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,460
For kids, it's not as easy.

502
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,701
So I don't know if you remember the marshmallow test

503
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:32,042
where kids, they're shown a marshmallow and they're told,

504
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:34,642
hey, you need to, if you don't touch the marshmallow,

505
00:28:34,662 --> 00:28:36,863
I'm going to walk away and let you alone in the room.

506
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:38,823
If you don't touch it, I think it was 15 minutes,

507
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:41,304
I'll give you two, another marshmallow,

508
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:42,304
and then you can have them both.

509
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,185
So the kid had to stay in front of the marshmallow

510
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:45,445
and then.

511
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:50,368
The experimenter would leave the room, the kid was just all alone in front of the marshmallow,

512
00:28:50,408 --> 00:28:54,651
like, ah, I tried to eat it, but I can't, I won't have the second marshmallow.

513
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:58,714
And so it's really hard for kids to exert that self-control.

514
00:28:59,715 --> 00:29:02,516
And so loot boxes can be particularly hard to handle

515
00:29:03,796 --> 00:29:05,576
by minors, children, and teenagers.

516
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:07,997
Don't have yet the brain maturity needed

517
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:11,057
to be able to resist the temptation to have self-control.

518
00:29:11,657 --> 00:29:13,818
And again, we're not necessarily particularly good at that

519
00:29:13,898 --> 00:29:18,739
as adults, but we're better at that than kids.

520
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,379
So developing the self-control needed to resist loot boxes,

521
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:25,240
loss aversion, fear of missing out,

522
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,900
all these things takes time.

523
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:31,445
even adolescent brain is too immature to exert control over impulsive drives.

524
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:38,353
Minors are not allowed to gamble in casinos and it's easy to control it because we can ID people

525
00:29:38,374 --> 00:29:43,620
if you go to Vegas or you have to show your ID if you want to apply.

526
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:48,175
And so, can we regulate loot boxes for kids?

527
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:49,736
I would say we should.

528
00:29:49,936 --> 00:29:52,397
The problem is that practically how we do that,

529
00:29:52,677 --> 00:29:55,898
it's not easy to really ID the people who are playing your games.

530
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:57,298
It's easy to cheat and say,

531
00:29:57,518 --> 00:30:00,559
sure, I'm over 21 or over 18,

532
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:03,660
whatever the age we define that as acceptable.

533
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,521
So it's more difficult to control that,

534
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,862
and that's why different countries now

535
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,922
made loot box illegal, like I said,

536
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:13,723
like the Netherlands and Belgium.

537
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:18,484
And the Federal Trade Commission announced this year

538
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:20,305
that they would conduct a public workshop

539
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:21,685
on loot box later this year.

540
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:23,966
It's coming, so we need to be ready,

541
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:26,047
we need to understand why it's a problem

542
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:28,187
and how we want to address it,

543
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:31,988
maybe before we get regulations on it, on us.

544
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:36,165
So what we can do is, at the very least,

545
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:37,326
we need to protect minors.

546
00:30:38,787 --> 00:30:41,409
And we can avoid loot boxes when we

547
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:43,491
know that a lot of kids are playing our games,

548
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:45,972
or even more so if it's targeted to kids,

549
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:49,415
especially if it's tied to monetization, of course.

550
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,256
And there's another problem.

551
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:54,138
It seems that child gambling has quadrupled

552
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,419
over the past few years.

553
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,521
So that's from the Gambling Commission in Great Britain.

554
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,242
It was a study on 11 to 16-year-old children.

555
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:07,588
And apparently, so it's becoming a problem.

556
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:10,149
It's not just, they're not looking at gambling in games.

557
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:12,851
They look at gambling overall in like scratching tickets,

558
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:13,411
stuff like that.

559
00:31:13,712 --> 00:31:16,393
And apparently kids are engaging with this

560
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:18,094
way more today than before.

561
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:20,496
And there's another problem then.

562
00:31:20,856 --> 00:31:23,918
There are some gambling ads that appear

563
00:31:24,078 --> 00:31:26,400
in children's games.

564
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:30,084
So at the very least, make sure that you do not allow

565
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:34,607
for gambling ads on your games that are really targeted to kids.

566
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:38,270
So they should not be bombarded by these gambling ads.

567
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,311
And sadly, it happens today.

568
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,134
Another thing we can do is explore more transparent

569
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:45,335
monetization techniques.

570
00:31:46,476 --> 00:31:49,458
And maybe avoid variable schedules or reinforcement

571
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:53,301
in ratio in monetization.

572
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:54,301
Okay.

573
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:54,401
So...

574
00:31:56,443 --> 00:32:01,627
Again, China is asking to reveal the odds.

575
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:04,609
When you have loot boxes, you have to reveal the odds.

576
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,331
It's more transparent.

577
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:08,012
It's not really solving the problem,

578
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:10,114
because even if you know the odds, first of all,

579
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:11,935
humans don't really understand odds.

580
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,097
So that's another problem.

581
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:17,479
But it's not really preventing us from engaging with it.

582
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,541
It's more transparent, but it's not really

583
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:20,782
solving the problem.

584
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:30,327
You can also, so Fortnite and then Save the World mode, they had the x-ray on their mind

585
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:32,407
which you can see what you're going to get.

586
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:33,668
So that's interesting.

587
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:40,649
And also what you really have to think about and maybe prohibit marketplaces where loot

588
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:41,750
box items can be sold.

589
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:47,291
So sometimes, of course, most of the time it's out of your control, but you have to

590
00:32:47,651 --> 00:32:51,852
be careful because it's usually like you don't control it, it's outside of your system.

591
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:56,093
But you have to be conscious of that because it's part of the problem.

592
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:01,014
Okay, so now I'm going to talk about dark patterns.

593
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:06,996
And the biggest fear is, you can see here and there, is that video games manipulate

594
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:07,116
us.

595
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:10,869
Okay, so put a pin on that.

596
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:13,251
I'm just going to show you a few things

597
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:15,593
and explain a few things about dark remnants before.

598
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:18,596
I'm going to ask you to do a little game.

599
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:21,158
So if you know the answer, that's a bit cheating,

600
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:23,440
but it's okay, we can participate.

601
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:28,004
You have a bat and a ball, and it costs $11 total.

602
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:30,526
The bat costs $10 more than the ball.

603
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:32,247
How much does the ball cost?

604
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:34,670
Very quickly, do the math.

605
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:40,690
If you're well caffeinated or if you sense there was a trap

606
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:43,333
or you knew that before, you're actually very good at math,

607
00:33:44,294 --> 00:33:46,336
you might not have fallen into the trap.

608
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:50,380
But most people, when they ask that question,

609
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,582
we don't really think about it because, you know,

610
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:53,543
we're on a maintenance mode.

611
00:33:53,563 --> 00:33:56,305
We're just like, it's 9 a.m., just like leave me alone.

612
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:59,899
And we just go straight to a shortcut, which is saying $1.

613
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,726
If you do the math, this is not adding up.

614
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:05,269
So the ball costs $0.50.

615
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,625
And so that's coming from the cognitive reflection test

616
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:14,046
that was made by Shane Frederick.

617
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:17,990
And so there were three of these similar questions like that.

618
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:21,254
And it turns out 83% of MIT students

619
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,777
answered wrongly to at least one of these three questions.

620
00:34:24,457 --> 00:34:25,859
So it's happened to everyone.

621
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,401
It's not saying that you're always going to fall for traps,

622
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:29,443
but you're always going to.

623
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:32,631
fall at some point, you're going to fall for a trap.

624
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:34,816
And that's OK.

625
00:34:35,998 --> 00:34:37,742
It's not to say that we're not logical beings.

626
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:39,125
But.

627
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:42,340
Our brain is very limited.

628
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,981
We have a lot of biases.

629
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,323
And I don't know if you've heard of that book,

630
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:49,544
Thinking Fast and Slow, from Daniel Kahneman, who

631
00:34:49,845 --> 00:34:51,286
has a Nobel Prize in economics.

632
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:52,586
He's a psychologist.

633
00:34:53,227 --> 00:34:58,230
And he's studied these biases and is

634
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:01,032
part of a new discipline called behavioral economics.

635
00:35:02,207 --> 00:35:04,710
So it's behavioral psychology, you'll remember Skinner box,

636
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,492
all that, applying to economics.

637
00:35:07,053 --> 00:35:09,716
What he says is that we have two systems in our brain.

638
00:35:09,756 --> 00:35:12,319
And it's not physical systems, it's not,

639
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:14,181
you can't pinpoint where it is in the brain,

640
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:16,544
there's just like functions in our brain.

641
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:18,787
We have what he calls a system one,

642
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:20,589
which is fast, automatic, effortless.

643
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:26,955
If I say three times six, you're going to get the answer right away because you know that by heart.

644
00:35:28,036 --> 00:35:36,043
And if your system one is the only awake this morning, you might have just said one dollar to your previous question

645
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:42,750
just because most of the time we don't want to do math and we're just going to get to a fast answer.

646
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,252
System two is slow, controlled, and effortful.

647
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,913
It's a system that you need to activate when you have

648
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:54,096
to do more complex calculation or you have

649
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:55,476
to really think about something.

650
00:35:55,496 --> 00:35:59,519
So if I tell you it's 12 times 31, then you know

651
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,320
that you can't have a quick answer for that.

652
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,440
You're going to have to calculate.

653
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,661
So it's activating system two.

654
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,330
It's costly.

655
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:08,272
The brain is consuming a lot of our energy

656
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:10,094
compared to its size.

657
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:13,856
And so most of the time, we are running on economy mode.

658
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:16,318
And we're not going to do the math,

659
00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:17,919
and we're not going to apply control

660
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:22,062
and effort for computation.

661
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:25,465
When we, in everyday problems, we're

662
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:27,646
just going to go straight to the point most of the time.

663
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:32,458
So we rely mostly on system one, but the problem is that this system is biased,

664
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:37,222
because it's not careful and is going to go straight to shortcuts.

665
00:36:37,682 --> 00:36:40,765
And most of the time, you know, it's allowed us to survive predators,

666
00:36:41,505 --> 00:36:43,947
because we don't have, you know, to think about, is this really a lion?

667
00:36:43,987 --> 00:36:44,428
I'm not sure.

668
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:45,589
We have to, you know, run away.

669
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:46,029
Otherwise...

670
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:53,054
We wouldn't be here today talking about cognitive biases, but it is with our complex environments.

671
00:36:53,174 --> 00:36:58,757
We still have the same brain as back in the savannah, but our environment is more complex,

672
00:36:58,998 --> 00:37:02,100
and we can fall for biases more and more often.

673
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,303
So it's an issue, and if your system, too, is not awake, is not like,

674
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:11,106
hey, be careful, there's a trap here, you should actually really think about it.

675
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:12,682
we're not aware of it.

676
00:37:13,082 --> 00:37:15,944
And so we fall for bias, we fall for these biases

677
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:18,186
without really being fully aware of that.

678
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:22,789
And that's okay, I mean the brain is extremely good

679
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,390
at very quickly making sense of the world

680
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,471
with little information.

681
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:28,513
Again, that helped us survive predators.

682
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:33,717
But because of that, you know, we're gonna make mistakes.

683
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:34,817
I know, it's easy words.

684
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:37,019
But we're gonna make mistakes.

685
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,101
Because sometimes, you know, the easy answer

686
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:41,482
is not the correct answer.

687
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:49,743
So, again, all these mistakes the brain makes are insignificant trade-offs in the scale

688
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:50,504
of evolution.

689
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:55,431
However, we need to be aware of our limitations, of these biases, to avoid being manipulated

690
00:37:55,532 --> 00:37:57,895
ourselves and also to be a fair society.

691
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:01,709
So we know the brain has limitations.

692
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:03,070
I'm not going to cover all that.

693
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,171
This is my usual spiel.

694
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:09,294
But when we consider UX, user experience, when we build a product,

695
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:14,637
we have to be mindful of these limitations so we can offer the experience we intended.

696
00:38:15,038 --> 00:38:20,661
So we look at how the brain processes information, how we learn, and it starts with perception.

697
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:24,984
And then we're going to memorize what we perceived and processed.

698
00:38:25,324 --> 00:38:26,165
This is how we learn.

699
00:38:26,185 --> 00:38:27,405
If we don't memorize, we don't learn.

700
00:38:27,997 --> 00:38:30,478
And this process is influenced by many factors,

701
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,020
including attention, which is really crucial.

702
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,961
If you don't pay attention, it's hard for you to remember.

703
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:38,143
So I'm not gonna go through that today,

704
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:40,984
but we know that perception is subjective.

705
00:38:41,345 --> 00:38:43,026
What I perceive is not necessarily

706
00:38:43,046 --> 00:38:43,886
what you're gonna perceive.

707
00:38:43,986 --> 00:38:47,208
It's perception is a construct of the mind.

708
00:38:47,468 --> 00:38:52,191
Therefore, it's heavily biased depending on your background,

709
00:38:52,231 --> 00:38:55,573
your prior knowledge, your expectations, your culture.

710
00:38:56,607 --> 00:38:57,547
Attention is scarce.

711
00:38:57,728 --> 00:38:59,248
We can't multitask.

712
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:01,008
We're terrible at doing many things.

713
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:02,729
And memory is fallible.

714
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,089
So we forget a lot of stuff.

715
00:39:04,149 --> 00:39:06,130
And for what we remember, it's not accurate.

716
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,630
And sometimes we even have false memories.

717
00:39:08,571 --> 00:39:09,871
So we have all these limitations.

718
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,692
And we have a bunch of cognitive and social biases.

719
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:14,312
I'm not going to go through all this.

720
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:17,553
It's just to make you realize that we have biases.

721
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:19,134
And we know they exist.

722
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:22,755
And this is going to sway people.

723
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,215
And this is how we get manipulated.

724
00:39:24,235 --> 00:39:24,835
It's just because.

725
00:39:25,055 --> 00:39:27,236
We don't pay attention to everything because we can't.

726
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,417
And therefore, here's an example of what a dark pattern is,

727
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:34,678
is to exploit these little, for example,

728
00:39:34,718 --> 00:39:35,938
because we don't pay attention,

729
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,979
we see the big yellow button,

730
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,099
we believe that, yeah, I just, you know, checked out,

731
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,940
I want to check out, I want to keep going,

732
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,201
but we might not necessarily read all the little text

733
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:50,002
because we're in a hurry and we don't realize

734
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:52,682
that we're signing up actually for Amazon Prime.

735
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,742
If you want to opt out, you actually need to click on the tiny little link

736
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:00,084
that you can't really see well unless you really pay attention.

737
00:40:01,385 --> 00:40:03,547
So this is an example of a dark pattern.

738
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:10,293
This is when what you're trying to do, like engage people more with your platform,

739
00:40:11,173 --> 00:40:14,636
is going against the experience that your user wants.

740
00:40:14,856 --> 00:40:17,739
Just like check out and they don't necessarily want to sign up

741
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:20,881
and maybe they're going to sign up by mistake.

742
00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:25,839
Another example that I like, it's pretty creative,

743
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:28,261
it's faking that you have a hair on your phone.

744
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:30,543
So you're gonna swipe up to get rid of it

745
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:33,086
and thus you go to the shopping screen.

746
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:37,810
Yeah, it's pretty creative.

747
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:41,153
So it's taking, again, it's taking advantage of...

748
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:45,754
a problem with attention and we don't process things very well.

749
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:50,676
If you're interested in dark patterns, there's an excellent website called darkpatterns.org

750
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:54,236
that explains what dark patterns are and gives a lot of examples.

751
00:40:56,837 --> 00:41:02,118
So here's an example of one of these cognitive biases that can lead to dark patterns.

752
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:07,420
That's from Dan Ariely, another permanent figure in behavioral economics.

753
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,961
And ESOL subscription for the economist.

754
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:13,682
And there were three options.

755
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:17,864
You could subscribe for a year only through web, so online only.

756
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:20,725
Or you could have the print subscription only.

757
00:41:21,285 --> 00:41:23,867
So it was web, $59.

758
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:25,487
Print, it was $125.

759
00:41:25,888 --> 00:41:29,269
And you could have the print and web for the same price, $125.

760
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:36,302
So he wondered who would ever pick the middle option,

761
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:39,243
because it's obviously not as good as the rest.

762
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:42,825
And so he was at MIT and he did a research

763
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:44,086
with the students there and asked them,

764
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:44,986
which one would you pick?

765
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:48,968
And surely enough, most people would pick

766
00:41:48,988 --> 00:41:50,548
the print and web subscription option,

767
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:53,150
and no one would pick the print subscription only.

768
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:57,338
So why do you have that option if no one wants it?

769
00:41:57,938 --> 00:41:59,699
What happens if you remove that option?

770
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,362
So that's what he did, and he asked more students

771
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:05,924
to answer among these two options, which one you do pick.

772
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:08,885
In that case, most people choose the cheapest option.

773
00:42:10,306 --> 00:42:12,988
So this is called the decoy effect.

774
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,090
And we use that all the time.

775
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,631
Again, in monetization, this is what

776
00:42:19,651 --> 00:42:23,132
we do when we show the different options to buy hard currencies.

777
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:24,732
Most of the time we do that.

778
00:42:24,772 --> 00:42:29,353
We have a decoy to make another option look more interesting.

779
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:34,835
So decoy, if I see in the monetization,

780
00:42:34,895 --> 00:42:37,035
and sometimes I'm like, is it a dark card?

781
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:40,036
And should we be more attention to that,

782
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:41,316
should I be paying more attention to that?

783
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:44,587
But the problem is that whether or not it is a dark pattern

784
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:49,328
is not obvious, because it's a big gray area.

785
00:42:50,248 --> 00:42:50,928
Look at this.

786
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,889
If you want to delete your character in Wow,

787
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:56,530
so that's an old screenshot.

788
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,150
Back in the day, if you wanted to delete your character,

789
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:02,351
it's not just like a confirmation block saying,

790
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,552
are you sure you want to delete that character that you spent

791
00:43:04,592 --> 00:43:07,553
hours and weeks and months developing.

792
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:10,173
I was actually asking you to type delete.

793
00:43:11,072 --> 00:43:17,533
And today I believe they ask you to type in the name of the character to make sure that you really want to delete that specific character.

794
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,167
So we could say, hey, it's a dark parent, they prevent me,

795
00:43:21,187 --> 00:43:22,808
you know, they guilt trip me.

796
00:43:22,828 --> 00:43:24,849
And granted, the character's not crying.

797
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,971
That would be more guilt tripping.

798
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:28,992
Like, oh no, you don't want to kill me.

799
00:43:29,152 --> 00:43:29,773
Don't kill.

800
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:31,554
That would be guilt tripping.

801
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:32,515
It's not the case here.

802
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:36,077
I would argue this is actually a case of good UX

803
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:38,819
because it's what we call error prevention.

804
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:40,180
Want to make sure because, you know,

805
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,501
you put a lot of effort in that.

806
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:43,963
You want to make sure you're not deleting it by mistake.

807
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,274
So where's the line?

808
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:50,036
And it's not obvious, but it's for us to try to think,

809
00:43:50,456 --> 00:43:52,297
talk about these things and try to decide

810
00:43:52,377 --> 00:43:54,878
where's the line and what we should do or not do.

811
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:57,642
So what can we do?

812
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:01,446
We can maybe avoid dark partners for kids

813
00:44:03,648 --> 00:44:05,650
and maybe reconsider in other games.

814
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:08,994
But again, kids, children, and teenagers

815
00:44:09,074 --> 00:44:11,016
are more sensitive to all these tricks.

816
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:12,798
So there's guilt tripping.

817
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:13,739
We just talked about it.

818
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:15,942
There's a

819
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:19,724
So knowing how human behavior can be influenced

820
00:44:19,905 --> 00:44:22,346
up until now and knowing the acute sensitivity of children,

821
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:24,388
consider this, a game targeted to kids

822
00:44:24,588 --> 00:44:27,149
in which a character cries if the child dismisses

823
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:28,070
in that purchases.

824
00:44:29,115 --> 00:44:32,437
It's not hypothetical, it's actually happening in some games.

825
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:33,858
These are real examples.

826
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:37,200
So consider what it's doing to the kids.

827
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,741
Is it ethical or not?

828
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:39,781
Is it doctrinal or not?

829
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,002
I'll leave that to you, but think about that.

830
00:44:42,363 --> 00:44:43,503
So that's called kill tripping.

831
00:44:44,304 --> 00:44:47,265
Loss aversion, so losing a streak, for example.

832
00:44:47,305 --> 00:44:49,566
The snapshot example is an example of loss aversion.

833
00:44:50,027 --> 00:44:51,748
We have all that, we don't want to lose it.

834
00:44:53,368 --> 00:44:56,770
And so it's consecutive days of playing also in games.

835
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,942
Also, if you have a free-to-play game and you start playing,

836
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:02,802
you don't have to pay.

837
00:45:02,842 --> 00:45:04,263
But also, you're like, hey, if you

838
00:45:04,283 --> 00:45:06,024
want to keep your character, now you need to play.

839
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:07,424
Otherwise, you're going to lose all that stuff

840
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:09,605
that you accumulated.

841
00:45:10,386 --> 00:45:12,247
So all that is loss aversion.

842
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:16,029
The fear of missing out.

843
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:19,130
Oh, you missed out.

844
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,611
Look at all the things you missed out

845
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,712
and all what your friends did and what you didn't do.

846
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:23,793
We talked about that a little bit.

847
00:45:24,699 --> 00:45:30,082
Again, for children it can be way more distressing and harder to handle.

848
00:45:30,582 --> 00:45:38,167
Pay to win, so we, usually it's a good practice anyway, like players hate it, but you don't

849
00:45:38,227 --> 00:45:44,070
want to make players pay to be able to actually progress in the game and succeed, or make

850
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,211
them pay to ruin frictions.

851
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:48,793
Like if you're playing and all of a sudden you're interrupted and there's an ad or whatever,

852
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,151
For us, it's already annoying.

853
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:54,656
For kids, it's like they have a hard time handling these things.

854
00:45:56,178 --> 00:45:57,440
So think about all that.

855
00:45:58,281 --> 00:46:00,024
Last one, the social obligation.

856
00:46:00,535 --> 00:46:02,075
hey, you really want to progress in the game?

857
00:46:02,115 --> 00:46:03,956
Well, now you need to have friends playing with you

858
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,736
and you need to do things together.

859
00:46:05,756 --> 00:46:08,197
And now they need to send you missions

860
00:46:08,277 --> 00:46:10,738
and now you need to send them things to do as well.

861
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:14,239
So that can also put players in the social obligation

862
00:46:14,259 --> 00:46:15,899
like, oh, do you still want to play?

863
00:46:15,919 --> 00:46:17,960
Like, oh, if I don't play, my friends

864
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,321
are not going to have the thing that they need.

865
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:20,781
So think about all that.

866
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:23,242
And especially again for kids, it's hard to handle.

867
00:46:23,342 --> 00:46:25,823
And it's not, by any means, it's not an exhaustive list,

868
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:27,703
but this is just a few examples

869
00:46:27,723 --> 00:46:28,643
of what you need to think about.

870
00:46:31,101 --> 00:46:32,083
Last one is violence.

871
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:35,870
So, of course, you've heard the headline,

872
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,274
video games make us violent.

873
00:46:38,575 --> 00:46:40,979
It's a hard topic to talk about, especially.

874
00:46:41,437 --> 00:46:44,158
with the recent horrible events.

875
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:50,963
And a lot of people are concerned about that.

876
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:54,746
And given that we have two plus billion gamers,

877
00:46:56,387 --> 00:46:59,609
I mean, if it was creating, making us aggressive,

878
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:01,630
we would have a big, big problem.

879
00:47:02,331 --> 00:47:04,833
But so far, we have no conclusive evidence

880
00:47:04,953 --> 00:47:07,414
that violent video games encourage aggressive behavior.

881
00:47:08,155 --> 00:47:12,397
which is good news, but the problem is you still have fear mongering, it's still coming back,

882
00:47:12,557 --> 00:47:18,981
oh it's because of video games. So no, so far we can't say that, there's no evidence that we can

883
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:24,384
say that, and the problem is that when we focus on these big things like fear mongering, like

884
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:30,728
addiction and violence, we don't talk about the things that are in the gray areas that could

885
00:47:30,788 --> 00:47:34,790
actually be problematic, because we're talking about the big things that are making people

886
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,072
panic when actually there's no evidence.

887
00:47:37,412 --> 00:47:42,097
need to panic for these big things because they don't really, there's no evidence that this is happening.

888
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:51,307
However, again, children and teens can be affected by violent content. It can be hard for them to handle it.

889
00:47:51,873 --> 00:47:56,536
That's why we have ratings like ESRB or PEGI in Europe.

890
00:47:57,717 --> 00:47:59,678
The problem is, again, it's hard to control

891
00:47:59,938 --> 00:48:01,199
who is going to play our games.

892
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:04,761
And even back when we had physical copies,

893
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:09,364
we did not ID children when they were buying a game that

894
00:48:09,424 --> 00:48:10,365
was not made for them.

895
00:48:11,345 --> 00:48:13,426
And today it's even more difficult because most of it

896
00:48:13,506 --> 00:48:15,527
is just through digital.

897
00:48:16,448 --> 00:48:18,729
So how do we deal with that?

898
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:22,210
Should it be just the responsibility of parents?

899
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:24,731
Maybe, but parents don't necessarily

900
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:28,493
know how to do the parental control on their consoles,

901
00:48:28,553 --> 00:48:30,714
even though all the consoles allow for it.

902
00:48:31,994 --> 00:48:35,576
So they might need help to be educated about that.

903
00:48:36,236 --> 00:48:38,237
But also, we might think about.

904
00:48:39,257 --> 00:48:45,680
What content we put and if again if we knew that our game is very successful for it with our children

905
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,822
You know, how is this content gonna affect them? It's gonna cause us some distress

906
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:52,263
How can I how they're gonna handle it?

907
00:48:53,742 --> 00:48:58,183
And above that, you know, vitamin B-digens may not be associated with aggression,

908
00:48:58,223 --> 00:49:01,164
but that doesn't mean that their content is not problematic.

909
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:04,765
We are responsible for the content we put out there.

910
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:10,027
And again, remember that the notions of free will and rational decisions are

911
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:11,888
at best quite suspicious.

912
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:21,495
We are swayed by our environment, and so we are influenced by society and what we see

913
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:23,656
and experience, mostly unconsciously.

914
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:29,580
And that's why we still have big problems with racism and sexism and having a hard time

915
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,521
getting out of it, because it's mostly unconscious.

916
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:35,104
And it's reinforced every day with little things that we don't think, you know.

917
00:49:35,524 --> 00:49:38,566
is important but because it's repeating every day, every day, and every day

918
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:45,829
that now we unconsciously have certain stereotypes and now we're biased and we don't even realize it.

919
00:49:47,447 --> 00:49:49,708
So this is how stereotypes and discrimination thrive.

920
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:53,349
They are shaped partly by environment, by our culture,

921
00:49:53,669 --> 00:49:57,411
by our society, by ads, and also by video games,

922
00:49:57,551 --> 00:49:58,771
because they're part of the culture.

923
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,952
They're not a specific thing that's out of it.

924
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:04,173
They're not, I'm not saying that's all in video games.

925
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:07,574
It's in everything, therefore also in video games.

926
00:50:09,055 --> 00:50:14,196
One of example of this bias is the availability heuristic.

927
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:17,867
What comes to mind quickly is going to be a stereotype.

928
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:21,008
Like, you know, if you think about a very dangerous animal,

929
00:50:21,028 --> 00:50:24,569
you're going to think, oh, sharks, and they kill us.

930
00:50:24,629 --> 00:50:27,010
And you look at the data, it's actually there.

931
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:31,231
The chance of you to be killed by a shark is very, very small.

932
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:33,572
Not to say that some people are not killed by sharks.

933
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:35,372
Happens, but it's very, very small.

934
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:38,853
Mosquitoes kill way, way more people than sharks.

935
00:50:39,353 --> 00:50:41,334
But it's not the first animal that pops in our mind.

936
00:50:41,754 --> 00:50:43,754
So that's what we call the availability heuristic.

937
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:48,770
And for example, again, I'm more likely to remember women

938
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,672
like being emotional and crying all the many times

939
00:50:52,712 --> 00:50:53,412
that they did not.

940
00:50:54,132 --> 00:50:56,093
And because the women are supposed

941
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:57,274
to be the emotional ones.

942
00:50:57,694 --> 00:51:00,135
And we don't necessarily think about all the times

943
00:51:00,175 --> 00:51:05,317
that a man colleague was yelling at their colleagues,

944
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:07,278
which is also being emotional and not being able

945
00:51:07,338 --> 00:51:08,758
to handle the emotions well.

946
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:12,560
But for some reason, this is not what pops to mind.

947
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:15,844
So, this is where we're at.

948
00:51:15,944 --> 00:51:18,708
We're not, again, we have to get out of the guilt.

949
00:51:19,489 --> 00:51:20,851
We just have to face it.

950
00:51:21,071 --> 00:51:21,692
We are biased.

951
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:23,574
And if we want to get out of it, we

952
00:51:23,594 --> 00:51:27,079
need to think about how the environment is designed

953
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,844
and how it's making us fall for these biases.

954
00:51:33,505 --> 00:51:35,245
This is what we call choice architecture.

955
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,666
The design is going to encourage certain behaviors

956
00:51:38,086 --> 00:51:39,827
and discourage other behaviors,

957
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:42,427
or even won't allow certain behaviors.

958
00:51:43,408 --> 00:51:45,348
An example, this is again,

959
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:47,709
let's say a hypothetical example,

960
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,409
because it's not about pointing fingers,

961
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:51,570
and I'm not even saying that this is a problem.

962
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,871
But if you have a game where you can go see a prostitute

963
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:58,512
to regen health, and then you can kill the prostitute

964
00:51:58,552 --> 00:52:00,392
to gain your money back.

965
00:52:01,112 --> 00:52:04,954
I mean, it's not necessarily a problem, it's not unethical, it's just you're min-maxing.

966
00:52:04,974 --> 00:52:08,737
This is what you're doing in the game, this is what you're maximizing for what you need to do.

967
00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:13,099
So it's not necessarily what options are in the game that pose problems,

968
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:16,341
it's the options that are not in the game.

969
00:52:16,621 --> 00:52:24,725
Because in this hypothetical game, can you make a durable relationship with other prostitutes

970
00:52:24,785 --> 00:52:26,486
and maybe have another way to min-max?

971
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,521
I don't think so.

972
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:36,090
So the other way you can do it is to perpetuate violence on women, which is again perpetuating

973
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:38,733
biases and discrimination.

974
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,975
So think about what your game is allowing.

975
00:52:43,336 --> 00:52:44,216
We love systems.

976
00:52:44,256 --> 00:52:47,557
We love that a player can take the systems

977
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:48,857
and do whatever they want to do with it.

978
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:50,198
This is what makes a game fun.

979
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:51,818
But you have rules.

980
00:52:52,178 --> 00:52:56,039
And these rules are encouraging players to do certain things

981
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:58,060
and discouraging them to not do certain things

982
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,540
because they're not helping them to min-max.

983
00:53:01,441 --> 00:53:02,421
or to achieve their goals.

984
00:53:03,401 --> 00:53:06,543
If you want to have more examples of that,

985
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:08,343
I really recommend you to read the book,

986
00:53:08,383 --> 00:53:10,424
The Ethics of Computer Games by Miguel Sicart.

987
00:53:11,364 --> 00:53:12,145
That's really interesting.

988
00:53:13,105 --> 00:53:15,466
So think about your game as this.

989
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:19,528
You know, what behavior are you favoring

990
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:21,248
and what are you punishing?

991
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:25,930
And what is it normalizing in the name of fun?

992
00:53:26,854 --> 00:53:30,696
Is it okay to have fun raping women?

993
00:53:30,996 --> 00:53:33,618
What is it saying, especially in our society today?

994
00:53:33,898 --> 00:53:37,300
What is it enforcing and what is it normalizing?

995
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,342
And what is it saying that,

996
00:53:40,482 --> 00:53:42,403
oh, it's okay to have fun with that?

997
00:53:45,272 --> 00:53:49,573
So, you know, is it, again, think about casual sexism.

998
00:53:50,073 --> 00:53:51,634
It's not a problem if you have a character,

999
00:53:51,654 --> 00:53:54,395
a few characters in your game that are sexy,

1000
00:53:54,435 --> 00:53:56,635
whether it's women or men characters.

1001
00:53:57,035 --> 00:53:59,716
It's a problem if only the women characters are sexy

1002
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,297
and all the women characters are sexy.

1003
00:54:01,677 --> 00:54:04,678
Because then, you know, you're reinforcing that image

1004
00:54:04,978 --> 00:54:07,718
that women are just a sexual object.

1005
00:54:10,173 --> 00:54:11,654
All right, so what can we do?

1006
00:54:11,674 --> 00:54:14,935
Be mindful that despite the ESRB ratings,

1007
00:54:15,315 --> 00:54:16,995
minors might get access to violent games

1008
00:54:17,315 --> 00:54:18,416
and feel distressed by them.

1009
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:23,097
They might see your trailer, E3, whatever,

1010
00:54:23,337 --> 00:54:24,757
even if they're not supposed to see it.

1011
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:27,178
So we have to keep that in mind.

1012
00:54:27,198 --> 00:54:28,318
I know it's hard to control.

1013
00:54:28,338 --> 00:54:32,259
Again, I'm not saying, oh my God, no violence ever.

1014
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,900
This is really not what I'm saying.

1015
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,020
Just keep that in mind.

1016
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,981
The children are gonna have access to that content.

1017
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:40,503
And we're responsible for the content of our games.

1018
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:43,827
Consider if your game is perpetuating discrimination

1019
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,549
or worse, glorifying harmful behaviors.

1020
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,051
Do you want that?

1021
00:54:49,192 --> 00:54:51,514
If you do, then that's a whole different story.

1022
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,596
But if this is not what you want to do,

1023
00:54:53,997 --> 00:54:56,980
keep in mind that indirectly, unconsciously,

1024
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,141
maybe this is what's happening.

1025
00:54:59,715 --> 00:55:07,862
Protect your players from antisocial behaviors, because also your players are going to have bad experiences with other players within your systems.

1026
00:55:08,983 --> 00:55:15,108
So antisocial behavior, toxicity, is a very big concern. We need to think about that.

1027
00:55:15,128 --> 00:55:17,150
I highly recommend you to...

1028
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:22,173
look into the Fair Play Alliance, they're having a bunch of, they're having a summit today I believe

1029
00:55:22,473 --> 00:55:28,558
next door, also look at what they're doing, they exchange it's an org across many different

1030
00:55:29,718 --> 00:55:36,003
studios, like big studios, and they share best practices and they think about all these things.

1031
00:55:37,086 --> 00:55:40,671
Participate in that and be conscious that people with bad intentions

1032
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:43,754
will use your game and social platforms to harm others.

1033
00:55:44,515 --> 00:55:48,581
Do you want to wait until you have a big problem such as Facebook is facing now?

1034
00:55:50,258 --> 00:55:52,841
Now our games can be used as a social platform.

1035
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:53,462
It's happening.

1036
00:55:53,962 --> 00:55:56,965
And I can tell you that secret services are looking

1037
00:55:57,025 --> 00:55:59,748
at what's happening and the games just like they're looking

1038
00:55:59,768 --> 00:56:01,210
at what's happening on Twitter and Facebook.

1039
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,572
Because some terrorists, of course,

1040
00:56:03,612 --> 00:56:07,976
are using these platforms to recruit or to,

1041
00:56:08,897 --> 00:56:11,580
and some people are just using it to spread the hate.

1042
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:12,321
So.

1043
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:14,722
It's happening, it's gonna happen,

1044
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:17,703
and it's gonna be increasingly more of a problem.

1045
00:56:17,963 --> 00:56:19,523
How are we gonna deal with it?

1046
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:23,164
Because we're gonna have to deal with that at some point.

1047
00:56:23,224 --> 00:56:25,745
But again, this is beyond the design.

1048
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:27,505
This is not by design.

1049
00:56:27,665 --> 00:56:29,825
We know that it's not necessarily our fault,

1050
00:56:29,865 --> 00:56:32,606
but okay, it's happening, so what do we do now?

1051
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:36,027
And I just wanna leave you with that.

1052
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:38,447
There's no such thing as mutual design.

1053
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:41,708
This is from Thaler and Sunstein from the book Nudge.

1054
00:56:43,669 --> 00:56:48,549
And if, think about that, if we believe that video games can be educational,

1055
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:53,850
they can help people, be a force for good, and positively change the world, well,

1056
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,671
we also need to acknowledge that they can negatively affect our society.

1057
00:56:58,431 --> 00:57:02,472
So we need to face it, we need to understand how this happens, and if we care,

1058
00:57:03,692 --> 00:57:06,693
try to see how we can do to prevent that to happen.

1059
00:57:07,993 --> 00:57:10,513
Thank you so, so much for your attention.

1060
00:57:20,094 --> 00:57:22,336
It's a very sensitive and delicate topic.

1061
00:57:22,536 --> 00:57:25,718
I hope that you found it interesting.

1062
00:57:25,878 --> 00:57:27,259
Please give me your feedback.

1063
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:28,440
Let's start a conversation.

1064
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,683
Like I said, I just wanted to share with you

1065
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:32,784
my thoughts on that.

1066
00:57:33,104 --> 00:57:36,486
Nowhere near to a completed deep thought about it.

1067
00:57:37,427 --> 00:57:40,029
But please, even after this session,

1068
00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:42,231
just connect and let me know what you think

1069
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:44,272
and what's missing and what you care about.

1070
00:57:44,392 --> 00:57:47,314
And I have one minute for questions.

1071
00:57:49,774 --> 00:57:51,035
Yes? Do you want to ask a question?

1072
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:56,457
Have you heard of a person named Raman Shrokasad?

1073
00:57:56,998 --> 00:58:01,320
He's the one who posts a lot of articles about the free-to-play

1074
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,381
and connecting it with psychology and whole lots of things,

1075
00:58:04,461 --> 00:58:07,643
such as consumer-friendly F2P.

1076
00:58:08,783 --> 00:58:09,103
Yes.

1077
00:58:09,544 --> 00:58:11,765
Raman Shrokasad?

1078
00:58:12,225 --> 00:58:13,646
Yeah, I think I've seen a few things.

1079
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:14,906
I don't exactly remember.

1080
00:58:15,206 --> 00:58:16,287
So what's your question?

1081
00:58:17,267 --> 00:58:18,068
Do you know him?

1082
00:58:19,144 --> 00:58:20,225
No, not personally.

1083
00:58:20,765 --> 00:58:21,145
I don't.

1084
00:58:22,426 --> 00:58:24,727
Have you looked into any of his articles?

1085
00:58:26,327 --> 00:58:31,289
Yeah, but I remember maybe seeing one of these articles, but it's not, for what I remember,

1086
00:58:31,409 --> 00:58:32,630
maybe I need to look back at it.

1087
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:37,452
It's not very different from what we're talking about, behavioral psychology and all these

1088
00:58:37,532 --> 00:58:38,772
elements that I just laid out here.

1089
00:58:39,997 --> 00:58:46,123
Because when I looked at the ethics in gaming, it reminds me a lot of those articles.

1090
00:58:46,984 --> 00:58:50,347
You should read more into it and maybe contact him too.

1091
00:58:50,608 --> 00:58:54,451
Sure, absolutely. There's a lot of people talking about ethics.

1092
00:58:56,413 --> 00:59:00,157
And I did read a bunch of it. Yes.

1093
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:06,177
Hi, I just wanted to clarify something from one of your earlier slides.

1094
00:59:07,258 --> 00:59:13,242
When you said that about 0.3 to 1% of the general population could potentially be diagnosed

1095
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:17,925
with a gaming disorder, by general population, do you mean people who play games or the population

1096
00:59:17,965 --> 00:59:18,385
of the world?

1097
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:21,247
Andrew Shabilsky, are you here?

1098
00:59:21,887 --> 00:59:22,347
Yes.

1099
00:59:24,008 --> 00:59:24,649
The world.

1100
00:59:24,989 --> 00:59:25,389
The world.

1101
00:59:25,669 --> 00:59:26,610
I figured, just making sure.

1102
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:35,206
Okay, so say that again so I can put it in the mic.

1103
00:59:35,226 --> 00:59:37,371
Oh.

1104
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:40,157
The countries that you are referring to.

1105
00:59:40,197 --> 00:59:40,818
United Kingdom.

1106
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:43,204
United Kingdom, United States, Canada and Germany.

1107
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:46,043
All right, do we have still time for questions?

1108
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:46,783
Just let me know.

1109
00:59:46,923 --> 00:59:47,284
No, okay.

1110
00:59:47,304 --> 00:59:49,224
I have signs like, no, stop.

1111
00:59:49,765 --> 00:59:51,465
Okay, well, thank you so much again.

1112
00:59:51,585 --> 00:59:53,806
I'm gonna stay here to answer your questions.

1113
00:59:54,246 --> 00:59:56,748
And again, like I said, I'm not saying

1114
00:59:56,788 --> 00:59:57,928
that I have all the answers.

1115
00:59:58,288 --> 01:00:01,470
I read a lot of stuff, but I didn't read all the things,

1116
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:04,571
for sure, but this is more an invitation

1117
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:06,232
to start talking about this more.

1118
01:00:06,472 --> 01:00:08,993
And I know that people do talk about it,

1119
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:10,433
and this is great, so let's keep moving.

1120
01:00:10,533 --> 01:00:11,814
Thank you so much, and have a great GDC.
