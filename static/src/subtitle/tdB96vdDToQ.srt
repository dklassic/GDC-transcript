1
00:00:03,215 --> 00:00:05,416
Okay, hi everyone, thanks for coming.

2
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:08,619
Of course you have to silence those noisemakers devices,

3
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:11,561
and don't forget to evaluate us at the end of this talk.

4
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:12,641
We'd love to hear your feedback.

5
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:15,784
So we are very excited to share our journey

6
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:18,325
about the Ratchet & Clank franchise,

7
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:19,887
and why it has endured.

8
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:23,109
But first we should talk a little bit about ourselves.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,431
So I'm Brian Allgaier, I was the design director

10
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:28,112
on the first Ratchet & Clank game.

11
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:29,573
I was also the creative director

12
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:31,575
on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 game.

13
00:00:33,254 --> 00:00:35,195
And I was very fortunate to work with this guy.

14
00:00:35,915 --> 00:00:37,275
And I'm TJ Fixman.

15
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:39,155
I was the senior writer at Insomniac Games

16
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:40,196
from 2007 to 2013.

17
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:44,377
I worked on all the PS3 and PS4 Ratchet titles with this guy.

18
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,357
I also served as a creative consultant for Hasbro,

19
00:00:47,377 --> 00:00:49,918
working on movie properties like Transformers,

20
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,098
G.I. Joe, and Micronauts.

21
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,098
So before we get started, we just

22
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:55,619
want to share a little clip that we like quite a bit.

23
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,619
And this will help some of you who may be

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,000
unfamiliar with the franchise.

25
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:06,470
All right.

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,911
I don't know what just happened there.

27
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,792
We have a technical difficulty.

28
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:12,874
Sorry about that.

29
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:17,737
It worked when we were rehearsing in our hotel room this morning.

30
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:21,119
Okay.

31
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:21,980
This should now work.

32
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,201
Yes!

33
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,322
Space.

34
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:25,962
It's huge.

35
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:26,462
It's huge.

36
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:27,063
It's huge.

37
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:27,743
It's huge.

38
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:28,324
It's huge.

39
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:30,485
It's huge.

40
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,366
It's huge.

41
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:32,286
It's huge.

42
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:32,886
It's huge.

43
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:39,999
So huge, in fact, that if you lost your car keys in it, they would be almost impossible to find.

44
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,261
Luckily for Ratchet, Captain Copernicus L. Quark was on the case.

45
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:49,301
His mission, rescue the Lombax's one and only friend.

46
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:54,043
Yep, without Clank, Ratchet was alone in the universe.

47
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:58,063
Alone. Alone. Alone.

48
00:01:58,764 --> 00:02:00,764
You realize this ship has an ejector seat, right?

49
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:05,984
Sorry, I guess you could say I've been a little antsy in my pantsy at the thought of getting back into the hero business.

50
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:10,786
Yep, these wild stallions have been in the stable too long.

51
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:11,466
Hyah!

52
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:11,907
Heh!

53
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:12,507
Hey!

54
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:12,807
Heh!

55
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:13,347
Eee!

56
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:14,167
Right.

57
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:16,048
Look, just keep your eyes peeled.

58
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,649
Talon says this sector's crawling with mercenaries.

59
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,110
Rest easy, my friend.

60
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,171
My vigilance is both eternal and peripheral.

61
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:25,932
Warning! Warning!

62
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:28,113
Unidentified anomaly detected.

63
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:29,013
Hang on.

64
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:30,674
Shifting to evasive maneuvers.

65
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,519
Oh no, we're going to die, we're going to die!

66
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,720
Oh, good thing I'm wearing clean underwear.

67
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,281
Will you shut up?!

68
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,062
We are not going to die!

69
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:52,905
A million! Engage gravimetric stabilizers!

70
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:54,245
Negative stabilizers are flying.

71
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:55,446
Thrusters are flying.

72
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:56,946
Landing force are flying.

73
00:02:57,147 --> 00:02:58,547
All right, hello? We're going to die.

74
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:00,788
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

75
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:06,151
All right.

76
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:14,222
Sorry, so the reason why it worked was because it was in presenter view.

77
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,703
And now we have to go back to presenter view.

78
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:19,224
This is like the most awkward presentation I've ever given.

79
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,804
Okay, here we go.

80
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:34,849
Okay, and everything is now going to work for the rest of the presentation.

81
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:35,809
Okay.

82
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:36,069
Okay.

83
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,879
Yeah, my computer has a mind of its own.

84
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,840
Okay, so I have to say it's been really hard to believe it's been over 15 years

85
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,861
since the first Ratchet & Clank was developed at Insomniac Games back in 2002.

86
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:52,342
I feel very fortunate, we feel very fortunate to be standing here looking back at this long-running franchise.

87
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:56,703
So I'm curious, how many people played Ratchet & Clank back in the day in 2002?

88
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:59,943
Wow, okay, that's a lot of hands.

89
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:00,323
All right.

90
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:00,803
That's awesome.

91
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:04,344
How many people worked on the Ratchet & Clank games?

92
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,613
Hey, all right, we got some insomniacs, some old schoolers here.

93
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:16,017
Okay, so never did I dream that that very first game would lead to

94
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:20,481
six games on the PlayStation 2, six games on the PlayStation 3,

95
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:25,124
mobile games, a manga series, a comic book line,

96
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:30,027
toys and vinyl figures, art prints, tattoos and cosplayers.

97
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:32,329
That's when you know you've really hit it big.

98
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:42,362
Adorable plushies, a feature length movie, and in 2016 we made a game based on the movie based on the original game.

99
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:46,403
Despite how confusing that all sounds, the 2016 reboot was actually massively successful.

100
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:51,285
It was our fastest selling Ratchet game ever and it won Family Game of the Year at the Dice Awards.

101
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:57,587
And one of the things that surprises us most is that over the years, platformers and mascot style games have become kind of a tough sell.

102
00:04:58,237 --> 00:05:04,498
Console gamers have been drifting more towards darker and more realistic fare, so it's really cool to see that Ratchet and Clank still has a place in audiences' hearts.

103
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:11,019
So out of the 14 Ratchet and Clank games made in the last 15 years, Insomniac developed 11 of them.

104
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:18,040
We started with a trilogy of the first Ratchet and Clank, and for us it's certainly been a journey fraught with both ups and downs.

105
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:27,262
Insomniac turned out a new title almost every year, which feels insane in retrospect.

106
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:33,881
I can brag for them because I was an employee at the time, but they did this all in-house with a 35 person team.

107
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:37,404
But I promise this is not just going to be a stroll down memory lane.

108
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:40,586
We'd like to treat this as a sort of franchise post-mortem.

109
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,350
So we can talk to you about what worked, what didn't, what really didn't,

110
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,752
and offer some tips on why we believe some franchises endure.

111
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:50,575
But to do that, we're going to have to travel back in time.

112
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:53,257
And fortunately, we have a connection at the Great Clock.

113
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:57,362
this temporal space station from a crack in time that also happens to be 100% real.

114
00:05:58,222 --> 00:05:59,462
So Sigmund, are you there?

115
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:01,283
Yes, sir.

116
00:06:01,703 --> 00:06:06,404
Senior caretaker Sigma-0426A standing by at the great clock.

117
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:07,204
Awesome.

118
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:08,265
Can you take us back to March of 2001?

119
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:10,965
I don't know.

120
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:16,727
Orbit said I'm not supposed to use this thing as a time machine, but I guess I can make

121
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:18,647
an exception for the insomniac folks.

122
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:21,328
Stand by for temporal displacement.

123
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:34,529
All right, so the year was 2001. Insomniac's new game was going to be our

124
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:39,031
fifth game. We'd made Disruptor and the three Spyro dragons before that, and our

125
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:44,815
team size was 35 people. George W. Bush was in office. Phones made just phone

126
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:49,018
calls back then, and the laptop gun was all the rage, and of course there

127
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,559
were some classic cinematic masterpieces.

128
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:55,550
TJ, where were you back then when all this happened?

129
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,851
In 2001, I was in college, so probably somewhere in Orlando

130
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,512
with a really bad, slim, shady haircut.

131
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:01,992
Let's just check in and confirm.

132
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:02,893
Yep, that's it.

133
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:07,495
Ooh, did you do that to your hair on purpose?

134
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:08,535
Sadly, I did.

135
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,356
I did do that to my hair on purpose.

136
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:14,338
OK, so let's talk about Ratchet & Clank, the beginning.

137
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:16,438
So Ratchet & Clank actually started out

138
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:18,099
as a girl with a stick.

139
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,760
Actually, our code name was Girl With a Stick.

140
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:24,713
And so we had worked on the Spyro games.

141
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:26,374
We wanted to try doing something a little bit older.

142
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:28,174
And for about a year, we worked on this project,

143
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,994
which was kind of a mashup of Tomb Raider

144
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:32,015
meets Legend of Zelda.

145
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:34,755
And the team just wasn't feeling it.

146
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,756
And our CEO, Ted Price, saw the writing on the wall

147
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:40,777
and he had the courage to just kill the project.

148
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:41,977
It was time to work on something

149
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:43,677
that we could all really get excited about.

150
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:45,797
So we went back to the drawing board.

151
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:47,518
We started coming up with a bunch of ideas.

152
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,833
and our chief creative officer, Brian Hastings,

153
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:54,935
offered a simple idea that got everyone really excited.

154
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:58,817
And that was, an alien that travels from planet to planet

155
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:00,317
collecting weapons and gadgets.

156
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,298
And as simple as that sentence is,

157
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:03,779
it actually got us really excited

158
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,219
and sparked our imaginations,

159
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,181
and we started to draw upon inspirations

160
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,822
on how to create this new alien.

161
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:13,663
So one of Brian's early inspirations

162
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:15,064
was the book, The Little Prince,

163
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:17,225
but there were plenty of other influences,

164
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:17,545
like...

165
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:27,357
Marvin the Martian, Star Wars, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Banjo Kazooie, Miyazaki's Nausicaa

166
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:35,741
of the Valley of the Wind, Super Metroid, The Iron Giant, Super Mario 64, and Legend

167
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,282
of Zelda.

168
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:42,645
So one thing we all loved about Brian's pitch was this idea of exploring the unknown universe.

169
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:47,387
Our team was excited by the idea of building this living, breathing, colorful galaxy.

170
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,181
that people could discover.

171
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:56,106
Character artist Dave Gurtin began to sketch our hero, starting with this lizard-inspired

172
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,688
creature who had this massive weapon and extendable arm.

173
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:04,972
He was cute, but not very relatable, and lacked that charm we wanted.

174
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:12,777
He needed to be warmer and more approachable, and eventually evolved into our famous furry

175
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:13,398
mechanic here.

176
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:19,231
I first heard Ted Price actually coin the term Lombax to describe Ratchet's race.

177
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,932
We also liked the idea of him having a voice, which was very new for mascot characters back

178
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:27,034
then, so we needed someone for Ratchet to talk to.

179
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:33,436
So the original design for Clank, we painted him as this childlike C-3PO.

180
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:37,877
We even experimented with having a child voice with a British accent.

181
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,350
And it just wasn't working.

182
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,831
It felt like this kind of weird father-son relationship.

183
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:45,372
So we decided to put the two on more equal footing

184
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:48,513
and focus on making it more of a buddy story.

185
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:51,314
For Clank's particular backstory,

186
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:53,875
he was written as being this factory defect

187
00:09:54,515 --> 00:09:57,696
who almost got scrapped and was saved from the assembly line.

188
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,757
Brian Hastings and Ted imagined the game

189
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:04,138
as feeling almost like an intergalactic buddy cop story.

190
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:09,598
the wisecracking alpha would shoot first and ask questions later while the logical sidekick would act as his foil.

191
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:14,541
It's a dynamic that we've seen a lot in movies, but if you drop into a game full of anthropomorphic characters,

192
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:15,782
you get something really fresh.

193
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:19,905
And we almost imagine it's sort of like a lethal weapon meets Saturday morning cartoons.

194
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:25,248
So, you know, we certainly wanted humor to be a prominent aspect of the game,

195
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:29,111
so we developed another franchise favorite, which was Captain Quark.

196
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:34,730
He became such a vital part of the series that when he was left out, fans would actually be upset.

197
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:39,233
We view this guy as being kind of like a Homer Simpson meets Captain Kirk.

198
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:45,898
And the environment artist started imagining Ratchet's home planet, Velden, along with places that he would travel.

199
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:49,501
Like space stations and high-tech cities.

200
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:56,227
So we wanted to really get going quickly and start putting these levels into the game.

201
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,831
But the problem was we were just starting to develop the PlayStation 2 engine and tools

202
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:03,354
and we couldn't actually create these levels with these long draw distances.

203
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:06,937
Fortunately, we were working with industry legend Mark Cerny. Hi Mark.

204
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:07,317
Hey Mark.

205
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:12,943
Who actually had this, he was helping us design the game and came up with this great idea

206
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:18,007
to create these dioramas which are also now called Beautiful Corners.

207
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:20,703
where we could create the starting level of a game

208
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:23,205
and actually look like a real game, felt like a real game.

209
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,407
And that started to get people really excited

210
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:28,070
and definitely got interest from Sony

211
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,551
and started to give us the green lights.

212
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:35,916
So one of my first tasks was taking Metropolis

213
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:37,337
and turning it into a real design.

214
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:39,299
And we started to develop the metrics

215
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:42,101
for how fast and far Ratchet would run and jump.

216
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:44,563
The same metrics that would be used consistently

217
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,785
throughout the 15 years of the franchise.

218
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:50,776
And all of this, of course, was being done using 2D paper maps.

219
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,658
We weren't messing with any of that 3D stuff back then.

220
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,099
Eventually, our engine tech could

221
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:59,380
handle the long draw distances, and Metropolis

222
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,561
was fully realized here.

223
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:02,242
This is the actual shot of the game.

224
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:04,603
Now, during the prototyping stage,

225
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,784
it quickly became apparent how important weapons and gadgets

226
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:08,505
are to the series.

227
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:12,027
So Insomniac designed over 60 weapons and gadgets.

228
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,787
We abandoned hard science because we figure,

229
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:15,928
who wants to be restricted by physics?

230
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:20,597
when we could be turning enemies into rabbits or chickens or penguins.

231
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:28,841
So in November 2002, Ratchet was very innovative for its time and was of course positively

232
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,803
received, but we felt like we haven't really pushed it far enough.

233
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:40,028
It's to some degree felt weapons optional and it was like a platform game, but we wanted

234
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:42,509
to really dive deeper into more of the RPG elements.

235
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,231
We were just really kind of dipping our toes in the RPG waters.

236
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:49,356
And a story and characters need a lot of work, too.

237
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:51,396
Because at the time, Insomniac was a baby studio.

238
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,177
They needed to focus primarily on gameplay

239
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:55,398
so they can get to gold, get it out the door,

240
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:56,778
and then hopefully get to make another one.

241
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,799
So Ratchet and Clank wasn't really a universe

242
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,059
from a mythology perspective.

243
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,780
The characters showed promise, but they

244
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,600
didn't have a lot of depth.

245
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,261
In fact, if you play the first game,

246
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:05,921
you'll notice that Ratchet was kind of a jerk.

247
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,562
He was too sarcastic, too snarky, too selfish.

248
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,743
So for the next game, we recast Ratchet

249
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:12,763
with James Arnold Taylor, and we rewrote him

250
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:14,724
to be a kinder, more curious character.

251
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,191
with a sense of humor that didn't require putting others down.

252
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:21,654
So thanks to that first Ratchet game, Insomniac learned a basic but important lesson.

253
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,817
Make the time to develop your heroes and their relationships.

254
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:33,080
In game design, it's very easy to get laser focused on the game because the natural inclination

255
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,181
is to say, hey, we have to make the game work before anything else.

256
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,784
But your audience is not going to care about your heroes if they don't care about their

257
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:39,564
place in the world.

258
00:13:42,215 --> 00:13:44,737
So over the next two sequels, we refined the franchise.

259
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:46,839
On Going Commando, we fully embraced the weapons

260
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,861
for our gameplay strategy and added RPG elements.

261
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,363
We had a lot of variety in this game

262
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:53,644
in the form of mega games.

263
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:56,606
We included this battle arena that really let people

264
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:59,648
test out their weapons and encourage people to buy weapons

265
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:01,890
and try them out in these really cool spaces.

266
00:14:03,411 --> 00:14:05,552
We also had these new tiny planets

267
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:07,013
that we called Spherical Worlds.

268
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,655
This was actually something that we had prototyped

269
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:10,236
for the original Ratchet and Clank.

270
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:10,556
We had them.

271
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:12,345
Flying around one on a hoverboard,

272
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,046
but we just realized we couldn't do it in time,

273
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:15,768
so we saved that idea for this game.

274
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:21,092
We had hover bike races and space combat missions too.

275
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:24,235
Now players appreciated the huge leap forward

276
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:25,756
in terms of gameplay depth and breadth.

277
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:28,318
They also loved the double entendre of go and commando,

278
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:30,419
because not a lot of stylized franchises

279
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,861
could be so subversive.

280
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:34,122
So we decided to embrace that going forward,

281
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:36,224
and another Ratchet and Clank tradition was born.

282
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,640
Yeah, when they pitched going commando to me,

283
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,841
I didn't know what that meant.

284
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:44,364
Sounds good, yeah, okay.

285
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,366
Okay, so that leads us to, of course, Up Your Arsenal.

286
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:50,629
Okay, so in that game, we introduced multiplayer,

287
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:51,770
single-player battlefields,

288
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,793
and our most iconic villain of the series, Dr. Nefarious.

289
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:59,435
He was inspired by old-school sci-fi B-movies

290
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:02,037
and quickly became our most recognizable super villain.

291
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:06,260
Up Your Arsenal was a huge hit with players and critics

292
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:08,985
Looking back, there were a lot of key elements that made it successful.

293
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,127
Ratchet and Clank had a textured relationship.

294
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,849
They bantered, they disagreed, but you could always tell these guys were buddies.

295
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,631
We had outrageous weapons with badass upgrades.

296
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,593
There were gadgets and planet hopping.

297
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:19,994
We had tons of Captain Quark.

298
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:23,477
The visuals were stylized with rich detail and a vibrant palette.

299
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:28,141
It had a Douglas Adams-inspired humor that I love so much and a great balance of platforming

300
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:28,522
to shooting.

301
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:34,729
But yet this was around this time where we suddenly started to see mascot characters

302
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:39,291
like fading away or they were kind of putting on the back shelf until later.

303
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:42,513
And they started to go into hibernation.

304
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:48,556
But we believe that part of the reason why the Ratchet & Clank series endured was that

305
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,637
we dramatically evolved it.

306
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:56,360
We transformed it from being a platformer with shooting to a shooter with platforming.

307
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:59,938
So we had seen that people were very receptive to the guns,

308
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,079
and we've really integrated that.

309
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:06,580
And by the third game, we had full circle strafing

310
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,681
with R1 trigger and really made this

311
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:12,762
into a modern-day third-person shooter in terms of mechanics.

312
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:16,823
So the big lesson here was we really had to adapt or die.

313
00:16:17,963 --> 00:16:20,484
It's really important to listen to what players want to play.

314
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:22,884
But then, of course, you're having

315
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:26,005
to watch the market trends and learn

316
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:27,025
what other games are doing.

317
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:31,847
But then you also want to amplify what's great about your own game and what makes it stand out

318
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:34,028
So there's definitely a tricky balance there

319
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:39,451
so we really thought we'd hit our stride with up your arsenal, but we started to face a

320
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:42,953
small obstacle here and

321
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:45,154
That is the fourth game slump

322
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:46,695
so

323
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:49,017
Really what that is is that?

324
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:57,377
This happens all the time with movies and trilogies where you feel like you've said all that you could say with the third game, you nail it, and then you're like, oh, people want more.

325
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,298
We have the opportunity to make another game that people want to play, but what do we do?

326
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:04,640
So, you know, again, it's like that rule of threes.

327
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,661
And we were concerned, too, that we'd made these three games back to back one year after the next.

328
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,742
And what do people want with the fourth game?

329
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:12,782
Are they starting to get tired?

330
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:17,184
And is there some level of franchise fatigue happening here?

331
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:20,695
So the question was, well, maybe we need to adapt further.

332
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:23,457
Maybe with Up Your Arsenal, we made it a third person,

333
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:26,959
modern shooter, but how can we take this even further?

334
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,981
And we were looking at other games that were really big.

335
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:33,023
We were looking at, I don't know, your GTAs

336
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:33,903
and stuff like that.

337
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:36,945
And we had a little bit of envy, like,

338
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:37,946
what can we do there?

339
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:41,288
So at the time, for us, it was Halo.

340
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:41,588
I know.

341
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:44,210
So in 2005, we went dark.

342
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:53,253
And right off the bat, you're going to notice that we dropped the double entendre.

343
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:55,414
We even took Clank's name off the title.

344
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:58,614
In hindsight, we've got to acknowledge that was kind of not cool.

345
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:03,116
While other co-op multiplayer features were strong,

346
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:05,296
it was still a big departure from the franchise.

347
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,117
We removed fan favorite Captain Quark,

348
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:08,377
we sidelined Clank,

349
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:10,158
and lost the exploration factor.

350
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:12,078
Instead, we sent Ratchet to various planets

351
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:14,539
simply to survive a Running Man-style game show.

352
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:15,619
It was a fun game.

353
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:17,293
just not a Ratchet and Clank game,

354
00:18:17,393 --> 00:18:19,173
and definitely falls into the what were we thinking

355
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:20,213
category of the franchise.

356
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:23,914
So, you know, co-op was very well received,

357
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:25,495
and the game was a commercial success,

358
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:27,455
but the reviews were not as favorable.

359
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:29,756
Deadlock received lower than expected scores,

360
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:32,336
and even one reviewer called it soulless gun porn,

361
00:18:32,616 --> 00:18:33,217
which, that hurt.

362
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:33,977
That's cold.

363
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:34,797
I know.

364
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:38,358
At the time, we had three huge successes behind us.

365
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,838
We thought we could not fail.

366
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,299
Now, looking back at the checklist

367
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,639
that made Up Your Arsenal successful,

368
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,680
it's easy to see why this was sort of a misstep for us.

369
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:56,447
We had no engaging buddy story, our customizable weapon feature resulted in reduced personality, planetary exploration was gone, quark was left out of the fun, the color palette was muted, and we went overboard with the shooting.

370
00:18:56,987 --> 00:18:59,328
We even covered Ratchet's face for the majority of the game.

371
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,929
Insomniac tried to make the game different, but in doing so, we swung the needle just a bit too far.

372
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,711
It was clear that we had just deviated too far from the franchise DNA.

373
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,032
Okay, so what do we mean when we say franchise DNA?

374
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:16,826
These are the core pillars of the game from both a gameplay and lore perspective.

375
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:20,989
No matter what you change from game to game, this is the stuff that stays constant so that

376
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:23,490
each entry feels like it was made by a singular voice.

377
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,552
It's one of those things you don't really think about until you see it done poorly,

378
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:29,094
and then when it's done poorly, it really stands out.

379
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:35,038
So we knew we had to return to what made previous games great, but also faced a new challenge

380
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:37,139
on the horizon, which was the PlayStation 3.

381
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:41,416
For this new platform, we needed to overhaul our engine and our tools.

382
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:43,877
This meant we needed to build everything from the ground up.

383
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:48,498
We couldn't reuse any of our characters, any of our sounds, any of our assets.

384
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:50,099
We had to redo everything.

385
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:54,040
So this was a big technology upheaval for us.

386
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,221
This is common to most franchises that span multiple platforms.

387
00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:02,382
Anyone, of course, who's worked in the industry for a few years knows this happens quite a

388
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:04,143
bit where you have to kind of do a retooling.

389
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:05,723
So...

390
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:08,483
We had promised with Tools of Destruction, though,

391
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:11,205
that we were going to make this CG animated movie,

392
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:13,846
or it was going to feel like you could play a CG animated movie.

393
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:16,507
And I started to get really caught up

394
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:19,729
in the allure of what the PlayStation 3 could do.

395
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,610
And I was thinking about, oh, maybe there

396
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,712
could be procedural worlds, or we could have multiplayer modes.

397
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:28,693
We could have this open space exploration.

398
00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:32,655
And I started chatting about this in one of the design

399
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:33,035
meetings.

400
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:36,917
And a team member decided, walked up to the whiteboard

401
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:41,541
and wrote in giant letters, technology is evil.

402
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,125
And so he was coming from having worked

403
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,848
on our other PlayStation 3 game, which was a launch title,

404
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:50,409
which was Resistance Fall of Man.

405
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,092
And that game had a ton of ambitious systems.

406
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:53,632
We had like.

407
00:20:54,218 --> 00:21:00,603
procedural glass and cloth and like hoses and crazy AI systems.

408
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:02,704
And we managed to get glass into that game,

409
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:05,045
but everything else, a lot of other stuff had to get cut.

410
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:08,988
Because in the end, you have to really be careful

411
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:10,309
when you're starting with new tech.

412
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,210
There's just, it can be a lot of rope

413
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,011
that you end up hanging yourselves with.

414
00:21:14,812 --> 00:21:15,712
The glass was great, though.

415
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:16,633
The glass was great.

416
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:22,176
So given that we had to rewrite our new engine and tools,

417
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:23,697
this meant a smaller scope.

418
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:30,981
And so we had fewer cinematics just because of the higher fidelity animation.

419
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:39,288
There was no multiplayer or co-op, no spherical worlds, and no fun stuff like racing or other special modes.

420
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,710
We had to really go lean on this one.

421
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,935
So we were wondering, how do we please long-time fans if the graphics were taking a step forward

422
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:50,657
and our gameplay and story breadth was taking a step back?

423
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:54,172
We needed to go lean and deep on our franchise DNA,

424
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:55,312
but where to start?

425
00:21:56,853 --> 00:22:00,094
So the answer for us was to tell a tightly told story

426
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:01,955
about Ratchet and Clank's origins.

427
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,156
Rather than following the fly by the seat of our pants

428
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:06,076
approach as we did with our previous games,

429
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:08,217
we needed to start thinking about world building.

430
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:10,218
That's what we brought on TJ.

431
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:13,019
I've been working on games for a couple years by then,

432
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:15,520
doing QA and design support on Resistance Fall of Man.

433
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,481
And I also come out to LA at the time

434
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:18,361
to build up a writing career,

435
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:19,922
but I had never written a video game before.

436
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:22,306
that was coming on board several months into production.

437
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:26,227
And one of my chief duties was to take the sort of loose

438
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:29,109
mythology of Ratchet and Clank and work with this guy and

439
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:32,110
Brian Hastings to build out a unified lore that could inform

440
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,370
future games, as well as comics and movies.

441
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,791
Around this time, stories were starting to matter more in the

442
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:39,392
gaming space, so we really knew that we had to step it up.

443
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,513
We had a great set of characters and planets, but the

444
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:46,195
original lore was done 100% on the fly and had to be tied

445
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:48,636
down so that we could satisfy some of the audience's

446
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:49,476
pressing questions.

447
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:52,900
Here's a horrifying list of things that we did not have the answers to.

448
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:54,882
Who is Ratchet?

449
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:56,423
Simple, right?

450
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:59,165
Beyond just guns and wisecracks. I believe it or not, we didn't know.

451
00:22:59,506 --> 00:23:01,928
We knew the surface-y stuff, like what made him fun,

452
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:04,230
but what about all the writer-y stuff that I like to talk about

453
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,891
to make programmers' eyes glaze over?

454
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:08,033
What drives him? What's he afraid of?

455
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:10,515
I love that Ratchet was a wide-eyed engineer

456
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:13,798
who prioritized fun and thrills over basic safety protocol,

457
00:23:14,118 --> 00:23:16,119
but the earlier games never really explored why.

458
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:16,940
And to me...

459
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:19,680
Gratchet is constantly struggling with his identity

460
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,182
because he was born an orphan and the only Lombex

461
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:22,962
as far as he knew.

462
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,764
So his need to invent came from his need

463
00:23:24,784 --> 00:23:26,505
to feel like he had an impact on the universe.

464
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:29,007
Building on this vulnerability helped us create

465
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:30,949
a more textured character that players could relate to.

466
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,871
Where are the Lombexes?

467
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:36,833
I would love to tell you all that we had this mapped out

468
00:23:36,953 --> 00:23:39,555
in a Bible like in Underlock and Key of the Insomniac Vault,

469
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:40,676
but we had no idea.

470
00:23:41,517 --> 00:23:42,597
It was White Space at the time.

471
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:45,039
Fans were dying to know what happened to the other Lombexes

472
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,141
and we wanted to address this in the new trilogy.

473
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,920
Who is Clank?

474
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,281
The original game featured him as a factory defect

475
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,221
that escaped the junk heap.

476
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:55,801
But over the course of four games,

477
00:23:55,841 --> 00:23:57,702
the studio felt like there had to be more to him.

478
00:23:58,342 --> 00:23:59,582
Brian Hastings asked me to come up

479
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:02,403
with a reveal for him that would shed new light on his origins

480
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:04,103
without hopefully feeling too retconned.

481
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:06,223
And during one of our brainstorming meetings

482
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:07,624
on Tools Destruction, the team was

483
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:10,104
very excited about time manipulation as a mechanic.

484
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:12,645
So we developed a connection between Clank

485
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,985
and a faction of time-bending creatures called the Zoni.

486
00:24:15,465 --> 00:24:17,106
And at the time, I had a vague idea

487
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:18,306
of how he was connected to them.

488
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:21,577
but felt that this could tee up a compelling origin story

489
00:24:21,597 --> 00:24:22,718
to be revealed in a future game.

490
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,220
And there was so much more we didn't know.

491
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:28,622
These are all questions fans wanted the answers to.

492
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:31,324
And even though we were going to a new galaxy in a future saga,

493
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:33,606
I had to start compiling a franchise Bible

494
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,307
so that every team had a place to start.

495
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:37,469
And I had to get started halfway through production

496
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,991
when all our sets were built, our characters were modeled,

497
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,412
levels were already locked down.

498
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:44,634
So this was truly trial by fire for a first time game writer.

499
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:47,056
You like to throw people into the frying pan sometimes.

500
00:24:47,076 --> 00:24:47,396
Yes, you do.

501
00:24:48,895 --> 00:24:53,776
And once we hit alpha, it became very clear that we didn't have the time or the resources to answer everything.

502
00:24:54,136 --> 00:24:57,057
So I had to prioritize while laying the groundwork for the next game.

503
00:24:57,377 --> 00:24:59,777
That way fans could feel secure knowing that the answers were coming.

504
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:01,958
I like to call these mythology branches,

505
00:25:02,178 --> 00:25:05,339
fleshing out your world with details that serve as flavor in one game,

506
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:06,999
but can be a full meal the next.

507
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:09,860
So the Zoni, Terracnoid Sages, the Court of Azimuth,

508
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,381
as well as other terms that might sound like gobbledygook if you haven't played the series,

509
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:15,962
these concepts were seeded in Tools Destruction.

510
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:19,063
without knowing exactly how they would be used going forward.

511
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:22,204
But when we paid it off, it provided a sense of continuity

512
00:25:22,624 --> 00:25:25,185
and the illusion of a plan that I definitely did not have.

513
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:25,925
Cheers.

514
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:27,585
I thought he had a plan.

515
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:28,426
Yeah, no, no, no.

516
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:29,146
Heavy fold.

517
00:25:30,686 --> 00:25:31,666
So what did we learn from all this?

518
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:33,287
If writers do their jobs right,

519
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:35,548
the audience will engage with and comb over

520
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,848
every crumb of lore they're offered.

521
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:40,469
It's the double-edged sword of good mythology work.

522
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,610
They'll look for cracks and continuity errors.

523
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,290
They'll create fan-made wikis to point out every consistency.

524
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,363
So keep in mind, make sure not to define heroes by a game mechanic.

525
00:25:51,423 --> 00:25:54,644
Find something emotional and relatable about them, something that they're missing.

526
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,145
Audiences want to see themselves in their heroes.

527
00:25:58,046 --> 00:26:00,867
And that's going to give your character the kind of depth you'll need to carry them

528
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:04,088
over the next two or three, or in our case, seven games.

529
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:08,630
White space is okay, but nail down the critical aspects of your lore.

530
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:12,712
Use mythology branches to tee up a larger world.

531
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,372
Be specific about those aspects.

532
00:26:15,672 --> 00:26:17,693
No ambiguity, because ambiguity can oftentimes

533
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:19,494
read like plot holes or an unsure writer.

534
00:26:19,874 --> 00:26:22,515
And consider whatever you write, law going forward.

535
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:25,275
Write for the hardcore gamer.

536
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:28,156
When you're deep in crunch, it's very easy to say,

537
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:29,357
people won't notice.

538
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:33,278
But the hardcore do, I promise you, they always do.

539
00:26:33,978 --> 00:26:35,739
They will YouTube it, they will Wiki it,

540
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:37,420
they will tweet it at you angrily.

541
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,980
They will evangelize or eviscerate your work.

542
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,421
I've had both done, and I can give you a guess

543
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:43,321
as to which one is better.

544
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:47,756
Putting in the work benefits not only the team,

545
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,837
but future partners and ancillary products

546
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:50,658
based on your series.

547
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:56,321
So, by doing all that work and defining the mythology,

548
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:57,742
it just gave us a great foundation

549
00:26:57,802 --> 00:26:59,483
for building these worlds and adventures

550
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,144
that are for our upcoming trilogy.

551
00:27:02,884 --> 00:27:04,045
But as new designers joined the team,

552
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:06,786
we realized we could not solely rely on oral tradition.

553
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:10,268
Over the six years, we had people leaving,

554
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,569
coming in, new designers.

555
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:16,755
And so we had to start figuring out how do we develop a rat and,

556
00:27:16,995 --> 00:27:19,695
sorry, ah, ratchet and clank and standardize our process.

557
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:24,316
One thing that came up, which was kind of wild, was we had these crate stacks.

558
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:26,857
And for a lot of us working on the early games,

559
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:28,657
some of this was pretty intuitive on how to place them.

560
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:33,418
But some of our new designers would either put these giant stacks,

561
00:27:33,478 --> 00:27:35,838
and people would just start getting tired of pressing the square button,

562
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:38,959
like hitting all of those crates, or they'd have very sparse stacks

563
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:40,979
that wouldn't quite be stacked correctly.

564
00:27:41,478 --> 00:27:49,341
So Brian Hastings, our creative officer, actually wrote a four-page document on how to stack crates.

565
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:51,442
The subtle art of crate-crafting.

566
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,582
Yeah, it was pretty in-depth. It was impressive.

567
00:27:56,143 --> 00:28:01,385
So, of course, one of the most important processes that we had to standardize was how to design great weapons.

568
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:08,087
On Deadlocked, we had this really cool feature, which was you could create customizable weapons in various combinations.

569
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,993
but they started to kind of lose a little bit of their soul and personality.

570
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:13,874
So we thought, well, you know,

571
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:16,996
what are some general guidelines or goals that we could use while

572
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,437
brainstorming weapons? And so we threw out three.

573
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:24,100
One is they had to be comedic, strategic, or spectacle.

574
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,302
And they had to hit a 10 in one of those categories.

575
00:28:27,963 --> 00:28:31,665
And so this actually helped us in developing a one of our favorite weapons,

576
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:32,586
Mr. Zircon.

577
00:28:33,932 --> 00:28:37,833
where originally he was designed as being a Synthenoid,

578
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:39,834
which was a character we'd had in earlier games

579
00:28:39,874 --> 00:28:41,994
where it was a fire and forget drone

580
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:44,075
that would kind of hover above you and just shoot at enemies.

581
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:45,515
And they were kind of fun to have,

582
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:47,556
but we thought, how do we step this guy up?

583
00:28:47,636 --> 00:28:50,437
And we started building this character,

584
00:28:50,457 --> 00:28:51,917
and he looked like one of these consumer bots

585
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,058
on the left here and had very little personality.

586
00:28:54,118 --> 00:28:56,818
And we're like, okay, there's no strategy here.

587
00:28:57,078 --> 00:28:58,659
It's not really much spectacle,

588
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:01,760
but we can certainly push it in terms of the comedy factor.

589
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:06,038
So I asked the art team if we could give him a mouth.

590
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:07,319
I walked over to TJ, I'm like,

591
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:09,081
hey, we got this guy named Mr. Zircon.

592
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,383
He speaks in the third person, go.

593
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,965
This is not the kind of request

594
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,307
you want to get during crunch time.

595
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:17,529
But I understood Brian's vision.

596
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:18,790
I agree with him that it was important.

597
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,872
So I came up with what, in hindsight,

598
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:23,615
looked on paper to be the dumbest idea for a character ever.

599
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:26,297
I wondered if Mr. Zircon loved to talk trash

600
00:29:26,317 --> 00:29:27,658
but just happened to be really terrible at it.

601
00:29:28,604 --> 00:29:29,884
He thought everything around him was stupid.

602
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,485
He had no inflection in his voice,

603
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:33,166
and he lived only to kill what was around him.

604
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:36,708
So in a couple days, I whipped up 400 lines of VO

605
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,450
and took it to the team, and they looked at me

606
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,350
like I was insane.

607
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:41,811
But when we recorded it, got into the game,

608
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:44,013
and balanced it, it worked, and it became

609
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,194
one of the most iconic character gadgets

610
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:47,215
in Ratchet and Clank history.

611
00:29:48,335 --> 00:29:50,397
Yeah, I think it's all because we had those goals

612
00:29:50,477 --> 00:29:52,398
early on on how to push all these weapons

613
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:53,238
and bring them up to a 10.

614
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,023
So one of the weapons that was a big favor, of course,

615
00:29:57,063 --> 00:30:00,005
was the Groovitron, which was a weapon that makes enemies dance.

616
00:30:00,726 --> 00:30:02,067
And it's interesting.

617
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:04,829
When we started to have that way of evaluating our weapons,

618
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:06,110
we looked back at this weapon, and we

619
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,711
realized why it was so successful.

620
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:09,532
It actually hit all three of those goals.

621
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:10,934
It was hilarious.

622
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:14,536
It also had this big spectacle with all these beams coming out,

623
00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:15,697
all these enemies dancing.

624
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:16,998
And it was a very strategic weapon.

625
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,021
You could toss it out, and it was like an AoE stun weapon.

626
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:29,556
So as part of our return to form on Tools of Destruction, of course, we brought back one of our signature levels,

627
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:31,657
which was Metropolis or Aliro City.

628
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:37,101
And this time it was featured in stunning detail with enemy fire raining down.

629
00:30:38,722 --> 00:30:41,504
Ratchet & Clank Tools of Destruction was a big hit with fans.

630
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:46,727
It was often praised as looking like a Pixar film and hit all of the key ingredients of our DNA.

631
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:51,350
In terms of story, it both answered and raised many questions about Ratchet & Clank's origins.

632
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,452
But the game's cliffhanger ending left people feeling a bit cheated.

633
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:59,554
And if I was to do it over again, I probably would not have done it.

634
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,195
Sure, cliffhangers can be appealing, and I think used appropriately,

635
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:05,236
they are an effective way of retaining audience interest.

636
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:08,817
But I think oftentimes it just ends up leaving players feeling frustrated.

637
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:13,299
Yeah, essentially, you know, Clank got abducted by the Zoni,

638
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,100
and nobody knew what happened to him, so players were left...

639
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,990
hanging with this question.

640
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,711
And we really wanted to address this cliffhanger,

641
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:22,612
but our problem was that the next game

642
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:23,592
was gonna be in a couple years,

643
00:31:23,612 --> 00:31:25,193
and we didn't know if people could wait that long.

644
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:29,634
But fortunately, we received both a blessing and a curse

645
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,115
in the form of a, that's my fancy PowerPoint transition

646
00:31:33,135 --> 00:31:35,276
there, development curveballs.

647
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:39,017
And so all projects face these, we're out of the blue,

648
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:41,458
there's a particular request, the publisher asks

649
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:44,579
for something, or some tech change happens.

650
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:49,828
And during Tools of Destruction, what happened with us was we originally wanted to do a co-op,

651
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:55,173
have a co-op feature, and be able to play the campaign with split screen or potentially online.

652
00:31:55,893 --> 00:31:59,977
And we talked to Sony about this, we promised it, and then about midway through, I think we were

653
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:04,660
like, yeah, that's not going to happen, sorry. So the deal we ended up making was like, well,

654
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:11,906
now we'll make a smaller product instead, and would come out in 2008 between Tools of Destruction

655
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:14,268
and A Crack in Time, which was the next big installment.

656
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:20,689
So, you know, that was DLC at the time, it was like this brand new concept,

657
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:26,992
and we were pretty excited about working on this, but unfortunately it would eat a lot into our pre-production time.

658
00:32:27,452 --> 00:32:30,654
So for a while we had a bit of a freak-out moment,

659
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:37,077
and we realized, though, that we could turn this obstacle into an opportunity.

660
00:32:37,637 --> 00:32:40,938
With a smaller game we could experiment with new ideas and new mechanics.

661
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:43,769
and they could potentially lead into future games.

662
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,351
And one idea that was starting to gain traction

663
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:49,072
was doing this 2D space combat game

664
00:32:49,672 --> 00:32:51,013
that was similar to Geometry Wars

665
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:53,335
because that was kind of the flavor of the month.

666
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:56,516
But then we thought, well, we've got this cliffhanger.

667
00:32:56,556 --> 00:32:58,718
We kind of want to continue Ratchet and Clank's story.

668
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:00,278
T.G. was getting hate mail.

669
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:03,700
So maybe we should, you know, focus more on the story.

670
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,462
And the one thing we really loved about the previous game

671
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:08,923
that we wanted to do was Space Pirates.

672
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:10,784
I mean, those are just awesome.

673
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:11,145
And...

674
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:14,334
So that's how Quest for Booty was born.

675
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:17,796
It's actually the title that we originally wanted to come with,

676
00:33:17,836 --> 00:33:22,179
Tools of Destruction, but it worked much better for this smaller pirate-based game.

677
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:25,060
And we really loved pirates at the time.

678
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,724
We actually started to decorate the office with pirate flags, we had pirate skulls.

679
00:33:30,744 --> 00:33:32,965
We felt like the little band off in the corner,

680
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:36,127
making this crazy little experimental game.

681
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:40,240
But, you know, we could leverage all of the stuff we had from tools of destruction, but

682
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,881
this also gave us the opportunity to start experimenting.

683
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:47,163
And we came up with this idea for this wrench tether gadget where the head of the wrench

684
00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:49,785
would detach and latch onto bolts and you could kind of pull them down.

685
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:54,627
And it was really a new concept for platforming and puzzles.

686
00:33:55,868 --> 00:34:00,930
We had, you could also pick up flaming lava rocks with it and throw them off of grind

687
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:01,330
rails.

688
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:06,473
And we had this really cool open island that you could freely explore with these towers.

689
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:12,900
We also had several NPCs that Ransom could talk to and experiment with conversation trees.

690
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:18,344
We wanted to see how far we can get, pushing features that you often find in RPG-style adventure games.

691
00:34:21,547 --> 00:34:27,112
Now to address the cliffhanger, we used this game as an opportunity to reveal the identity of the villain who kidnapped Clank.

692
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:31,175
We used Dr. Nefarious. Fans had been clamoring for his return ever since Up Your Arsenal,

693
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:36,080
and bringing him back felt like a great way to build out our universe, which now spans something like three galaxies.

694
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:39,843
So we saw a lot of positives with this project.

695
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:42,344
We developed, of course, the new wrench mechanic.

696
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:45,405
It was like one of our biggest returns on investment,

697
00:34:45,425 --> 00:34:46,886
even though that investment was pretty small.

698
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:48,847
It's cool to see that it's still making money.

699
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:53,148
And it was, for me, actually one of the most enjoyable games

700
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:54,949
to work on, given its small scope.

701
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,690
It had much fewer headaches.

702
00:34:57,991 --> 00:35:01,412
In terms of, oops, sorry.

703
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:08,753
In terms of negatives, our Metacritic was actually one of the lowest ones I think Insomniac ever got, which was 75 at the time.

704
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:19,620
It was three to four hours long, people complained about the length, no weapon upgrades, there was no cork, and then we had this teapot matter, which I like to call teapot gates.

705
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:28,205
At one point in the game, you're traveling around this level I believe we called Marl Caverns with a decapitated space pirate's head on a stick.

706
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:33,644
And he would walk around, he would talk as you're walking from room to room, and I thought it would be funny

707
00:35:34,204 --> 00:35:37,224
if he just sang I'm a little teapot in order to open one of the doors.

708
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:41,245
It was just one of those dumb, funny jokes that you'd throw in without thinking a lot about it.

709
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:47,166
It turns out someone actually owns the rights to I'm a little teapot, and that person has lawyers.

710
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:52,727
So they got involved, and it actually became Teapotgate.

711
00:35:52,907 --> 00:35:56,808
So the bonus tip here is don't ever assume that a nursery rhyme is public domain.

712
00:35:58,063 --> 00:36:00,545
I was actually thinking of playing the clip, but we probably shouldn't.

713
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:00,885
Yeah.

714
00:36:03,146 --> 00:36:06,827
Okay, so for that game, we adopted this why not mindset.

715
00:36:07,968 --> 00:36:11,310
You know, we really wanted to turn our curveball into an opportunity.

716
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,130
We felt like we did.

717
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,531
It gave us a chance to really flesh out our universe.

718
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:20,274
It really helps, you know, experimentation we find helps lead to future breakthroughs.

719
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:24,725
you really need to kind of do these on the heels of a success.

720
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:28,607
Had we done this after Deadlock, that probably would not have been a wise choice.

721
00:36:28,627 --> 00:36:32,850
Of course, smaller, cheaper games have lower stakes as well.

722
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:36,732
So for our next game, it was Ratchet & Clank Future, A Crack in Time.

723
00:36:36,752 --> 00:36:38,693
A Crack in Time was my favorite,

724
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:41,655
and it's still available at Holo game stores everywhere.

725
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:42,715
Thanks for the plug.

726
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,818
So we had less than a year to make our, um...

727
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:51,998
biggest PlayStation 3 game because, you know, Quest for Booty again ate up a lot of our pre-production time.

728
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,941
We really wanted this game to be great because we started to think that

729
00:36:56,822 --> 00:37:02,206
this was probably going to be the end of the trilogy, if not the franchise, and it was going to be our last and best

730
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,387
Ratchet and Clank.

731
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:08,131
Now at the start of the game we revealed that Clank had been taken by the Zoni

732
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:12,535
to the Grey Clock, which had fallen under the control of Dr. Nefarious.

733
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:16,687
We pull up the curtain back on Clank's origins,

734
00:37:16,747 --> 00:37:18,148
explaining his connection to the Zoni

735
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:19,529
as heir apparent to the station.

736
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:21,930
Rather than just being a defect,

737
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,771
we reveal that Clank was destined to watch

738
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:25,112
over the flow of time.

739
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:30,335
And I hadn't even started watching Doctor Who yet, folks.

740
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,876
We had Charles Martinet voice him,

741
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:34,258
and meeting the guy who plays Mario

742
00:37:34,638 --> 00:37:36,439
was definitely a career highlight for me.

743
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,321
I'm happy we don't have a picture of when I met him,

744
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,782
because you would absolutely be able to tell

745
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:41,862
from the look on his face

746
00:37:42,123 --> 00:37:43,303
that it was a career highlight for me.

747
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:50,560
So Clank's story led us to develop a lot of special time puzzles where players could

748
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,463
play and record multiple versions of Clank to solve these mind-bending puzzles.

749
00:37:56,724 --> 00:38:01,828
From our open world layout experimentation that we did in Quest for Booty, we actually

750
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:05,391
developed this Krell Canyon level in A Crack in Time.

751
00:38:06,872 --> 00:38:08,934
And remember that mythology branch called the Court of Azimuth?

752
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:13,498
Well, from that branch alone, we were inspired to create a Lombax character named Alistair

753
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:13,878
Azimuth.

754
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:19,219
It was a huge reveal for fans and it helped us answer a lot of questions I mentioned earlier about Ratchet's history and Lombax lore.

755
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:26,641
We played off other mythology branches as well. The Trachnoid stages became a full-on faction in Kraken time.

756
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:36,384
So this game was massive, even featuring space exploration, which is something that we really wish we could have done in previous games.

757
00:38:36,424 --> 00:38:41,126
We finally got to do it with this one. You could fly from planet to planet and engage in space battles.

758
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,901
And even though our schedule was impossible,

759
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,821
we kept piling more onto our plates for this one.

760
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:47,662
So for example, there was this idea

761
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:49,622
that was pitched to our team about space radio,

762
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:51,123
where as you travel around the galaxy,

763
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,563
you could actually listen to different stations.

764
00:38:52,603 --> 00:38:54,824
I think the audio guys were playing a lot of GTA at the time

765
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:57,224
and it felt like something that could be really fun

766
00:38:57,264 --> 00:38:58,345
for Ratchet and Clank.

767
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:00,125
But I had something like three days

768
00:39:00,185 --> 00:39:03,826
to write hours of commercials, DJ segues,

769
00:39:04,286 --> 00:39:05,607
banter, news broadcasts.

770
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:08,447
Implementing it is, I'm told, a nightmare.

771
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:09,668
The audio guys did it, not me.

772
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:15,875
But this was an opportunity to build out our mythology and take one step closer to the feel of a living breathing universe.

773
00:39:15,995 --> 00:39:20,118
And everybody loved it. I think it ended up being one of the biggest selling points of the game.

774
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,642
It's always a great sign when you're working on a project and it's kind of late in production.

775
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:27,684
We feel like feature creeps have been hitting us pretty hard.

776
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:32,748
And then you put in this other request, but everyone's really excited to make it happen and see the potential of it.

777
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:38,659
So not only could you fly to these different planets, of course, you could visit these

778
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,060
small spherical worlds.

779
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,061
And this, of course, was something that we had developed in Going Commando.

780
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:48,682
Around the same time, our animators were really hitting their stride in terms of making what

781
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:51,063
felt like a feature-quality movie.

782
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:53,003
I really hope this movie plays.

783
00:39:54,844 --> 00:39:55,024
Yes.

784
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:55,364
All right.

785
00:39:55,404 --> 00:39:55,504
Quick!

786
00:39:55,524 --> 00:39:56,724
Everyone inside the temple!

787
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:57,465
Ocelot is coming!

788
00:39:57,505 --> 00:39:57,885
Ocelot is coming!

789
00:39:57,925 --> 00:39:58,285
Ocelot is coming!

790
00:39:58,305 --> 00:39:58,665
Ocelot is coming!

791
00:39:58,725 --> 00:39:59,065
Ocelot is coming!

792
00:39:59,085 --> 00:39:59,485
Ocelot is coming!

793
00:39:59,505 --> 00:39:59,905
Ocelot is coming!

794
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:00,305
Ocelot is coming!

795
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,024
Alright Quark, you ready to let those stallions out of the stable?

796
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:07,527
I was born ready.

797
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:09,470
Aldemar!

798
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:14,497
I believe Dr. Nefarious was clear as to the repercussions of leaving your hull.

799
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:17,180
The clock is ours.

800
00:40:18,002 --> 00:40:19,163
Whoa, uh, wait.

801
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,162
Who? Dr. Nefarious has no authority here, villain.

802
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:27,105
In fact, I'm not even entirely convinced he's a real doctor.

803
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:31,407
So return my sidekick's power before I bring the thunder.

804
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,632
You win again, technology.

805
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:44,976
So as you can see, our animators had a tremendous amount

806
00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:46,297
of fun with Captain Quark.

807
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:47,838
And of course we even had Nurse Quark.

808
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:48,278
I love him.

809
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,714
As we headed towards the end of production for A Crack in Time, Brian and I talked about what to do with Dr. Nefarious.

810
00:40:56,055 --> 00:41:01,720
We were fairly convinced this was going to be our last Ratchet and Clank game, and we wanted to kill him off in spectacular fashion.

811
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,743
Something poetic, and nuanced, and beautifully tragic.

812
00:41:05,524 --> 00:41:09,507
Then we put him on top of a flying saucer and slammed him into his own space station.

813
00:41:10,328 --> 00:41:14,292
We even hired an outside effects house to vaporize the entire level after the crash.

814
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:18,922
We made this guy super dead, and I remember feeling really sorry for whatever poor writer

815
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:20,943
would have the task of resurrecting him down the line.

816
00:41:21,723 --> 00:41:25,183
We felt at the time that this was like the perfect send-off for such an iconic villain,

817
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:28,424
but of course, if you've played other games in the series, you know this came back to

818
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:28,764
bite me.

819
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:33,885
I remember how during the first game Ratchet was kind of a sarcastic jerk.

820
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:37,325
By this time we had evolved him to the point where he could have moments like this.

821
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:42,646
So, I can't talk you out of this, can I?

822
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:43,507
Ratchet.

823
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:47,973
We have been on many adventures, but the clock needs someone to protect it.

824
00:41:48,654 --> 00:41:50,935
It is what I was built for.

825
00:41:50,955 --> 00:42:01,903
Our animators actually spent more time on that one shot than any other shot in our cinematics.

826
00:42:02,343 --> 00:42:05,486
And fans sent me messages saying that this is the first time a Ratchet and Clank game

827
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:06,206
ever made them cry.

828
00:42:08,048 --> 00:42:11,530
And I hope you all realize that there would be spoilers when you came to this talk.

829
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,340
So, Kraken Time hit all of our franchise DNA.

830
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,241
It was a buddy story with heart, imaginative weapons,

831
00:42:19,441 --> 00:42:22,562
robust space exploration, gadgets, quark, vibrant visuals,

832
00:42:23,162 --> 00:42:24,562
Douglas Adams-inspired humor,

833
00:42:24,882 --> 00:42:26,943
and a great balance of shooting and platforming.

834
00:42:28,743 --> 00:42:29,443
And then some.

835
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:33,584
It featured many favorite features from past games,

836
00:42:34,624 --> 00:42:35,725
plus some familiar ones.

837
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:38,125
At TGI, I agree, this was definitely

838
00:42:38,165 --> 00:42:39,405
our favorite game in the series,

839
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:41,966
and what we consider to be a peak for the franchise.

840
00:42:42,712 --> 00:42:45,194
But unfortunately, we had a hard lesson here,

841
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:47,075
which is don't get cocky.

842
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:49,837
So every peak has its valley.

843
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:53,640
One of the things that was interesting is that a lot of

844
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,081
times long-running series faced franchise fatigue.

845
00:42:56,922 --> 00:43:00,584
We'd ship what we thought was our best game and our last one.

846
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:04,847
But yet, it had done well enough to warrant some sequels.

847
00:43:04,967 --> 00:43:06,848
And so we knew that there were still people out there who

848
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:07,869
wanted Ratchet and Clank.

849
00:43:09,162 --> 00:43:12,304
But reviewers who liked the game were raising concerns

850
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:14,285
that the series was getting a bit long in the tooth.

851
00:43:15,046 --> 00:43:18,948
So this was another time for us to adapt or die.

852
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:22,551
And the next three years, the series took a number of detours.

853
00:43:24,432 --> 00:43:25,953
What we learned after A Crack in Time was

854
00:43:25,993 --> 00:43:29,495
that friendly family games were moving into other popular genres

855
00:43:29,535 --> 00:43:32,517
like couch co-op with titles like Little Big Planet

856
00:43:33,138 --> 00:43:34,278
and Castle Crashers.

857
00:43:35,051 --> 00:43:40,495
We're also finding that fewer younger players were playing less console games or migrating towards mobile.

858
00:43:42,737 --> 00:43:49,322
So we decided to make a four player co-op game Ratchet and Clank all for one and notice that we have our pal doctor Nefarious in the bottom right.

859
00:43:50,223 --> 00:43:59,110
That's the same guy we smash into a space station. So here's another little bonus tip for you never ring a bell if there's even a slight chance that the publisher might want it on rug.

860
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:04,514
Because after we ship the crack in time Chad desert and Sean McCabe they pitch this new Ratchet game to Sony.

861
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,274
One key piece of feedback they received was to make Dr. Nefarious a playable character.

862
00:44:09,294 --> 00:44:12,716
I just remember hearing this and my jaw dropped. I was like, we just flew that dude

863
00:44:12,957 --> 00:44:16,660
into a space station and Greg Phillips was like, maybe it was just a flesh wound.

864
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:22,704
So I had to use the Ratchet and Clank comic to get Nefarious off the saucer before it crashed.

865
00:44:24,386 --> 00:44:27,828
Mayhaps not my most elegant retcon, but I think you got to give me a pass on this one, folks.

866
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:32,105
So the game had a number of highlights.

867
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:34,486
It took some of our classic Ratchet gadgets,

868
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:36,867
like the suck cannon and the swing shot,

869
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:39,648
and turned them into these really cool co-op devices.

870
00:44:39,668 --> 00:44:41,248
You could actually grab other characters

871
00:44:41,268 --> 00:44:42,689
and throw them off of platforms.

872
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:44,370
You could have a chain of characters

873
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:45,910
swinging along on swing shots.

874
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:49,031
And it was also a very gorgeous looking game.

875
00:44:50,212 --> 00:44:51,032
I also thought it'd be funny

876
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:52,613
to make Captain Quark President Quark,

877
00:44:52,633 --> 00:44:54,814
because I felt like the idea of a lying, pompous,

878
00:44:54,854 --> 00:44:56,494
blowhard celebrity getting elected president

879
00:44:56,514 --> 00:44:57,155
would be hilarious.

880
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,813
It's a joke that has not aged well.

881
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:12,419
So, All for One embraced many elements of our franchise DNA, but excluded some, most notably the buddy story and the third-person shooting mechanics.

882
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,182
One criticism we weren't prepared for was the title. Fans just found it too kid-friendly.

883
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:20,704
For the record, Chad and Sean's original title was Foreplay.

884
00:45:23,606 --> 00:45:27,188
When that one didn't clear, the one that I tried to push through was Multiple Organisms.

885
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:34,256
And there you go.

886
00:45:34,956 --> 00:45:38,277
I think that may have been the fastest no I ever received from Sony.

887
00:45:38,297 --> 00:45:48,919
Okay, so All for One did succeed financially and there was a lot of love for it, but many fans and critics were also disappointed.

888
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,320
What followed was Full Frontal Assault, which returned to classic gunplay.

889
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,541
It had this tower defense context.

890
00:45:57,286 --> 00:46:00,828
but it lacked this heartfelt buddy story and a feeling of space exploration.

891
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:05,151
2013's Into the Nexus was more of a return to form,

892
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:09,094
but felt like a half-step towards the epic adventure that people expected.

893
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:13,156
So, looking at this graph of the series,

894
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:17,179
and this isn't like an accurate, like I didn't actually measure out,

895
00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:21,202
but it's not to scale, yes. It's clear that we

896
00:46:21,242 --> 00:46:23,583
hit a bit of a lull with these last three games.

897
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,351
While some of these experimental games had done well,

898
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:29,492
the reception from fans of drones was mixed.

899
00:46:30,112 --> 00:46:34,213
But that's okay, because what we found

900
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:36,554
is that you really need to embrace the unknown.

901
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,635
And I realize that there's a bit of a contradiction here

902
00:46:39,655 --> 00:46:41,615
where I'm like saying, well, we adapted or died,

903
00:46:41,995 --> 00:46:44,536
but we also had to embrace our franchise DNA.

904
00:46:45,076 --> 00:46:47,977
And the truth is that it's a tough line to walk.

905
00:46:48,638 --> 00:46:50,158
You have to constantly evolve,

906
00:46:50,178 --> 00:46:51,418
you have to constantly change.

907
00:46:52,468 --> 00:46:54,729
but then you also have to know what's made things great.

908
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:58,229
And trying to stick that landing is very tricky.

909
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:04,011
So we realized that to keep our series going,

910
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:05,571
we had to take these bold steps.

911
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:07,232
We had to take these experiments

912
00:47:07,732 --> 00:47:09,312
to move it into new directions.

913
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:13,093
So now around the same time

914
00:47:13,153 --> 00:47:14,554
as we were working on Into the Nexus,

915
00:47:15,014 --> 00:47:17,994
development for Ratchet and Clank the movie had begun.

916
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:20,835
And for us, this was a sign that we had really hit it big.

917
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:30,691
Never did I dream that there would be a movie based on this franchise with Paul Giamatti, Sylvester Stallone, Rosario Dawson, and John Goodman.

918
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:35,792
It was great to know that Ratchet, Clank, and Quirk would be voiced by the original actors though.

919
00:47:37,872 --> 00:47:45,994
And while we had some influence over the film, we knew that we had to do right by the fans and make a great game despite being in the position of making a game based on a movie based on the original game.

920
00:47:46,674 --> 00:47:51,095
The team had the challenges that we never had to face before because after I wrote the original draft of the movie,

921
00:47:51,474 --> 00:47:56,277
It was handed off to writer-director Kevin Munro and Jerry Swallow and the Rainmaker team up in Vancouver.

922
00:47:56,637 --> 00:47:58,779
And from there, things started to change around dramatically.

923
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:05,082
So we got to experience the thrills of parallel development with an animated movie that was constantly in flux.

924
00:48:08,064 --> 00:48:12,787
Insomniac's North Carolina studio director, Chad Desernes, suggested that the PS4 game,

925
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:16,689
rather than being called a reboot, that we thought of it as a reimagination.

926
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,172
And the movie was going through numerous rewrites, and we were always playing keep up with the changes.

927
00:48:21,728 --> 00:48:24,789
Sony even wanted us to use some of the movie's cut scenes as game cinematics.

928
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:29,270
And since the movie's storyline deviated from Insomniac's mythology, this presented a challenge.

929
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:34,931
How do we make a game that feels like our universe when it's based on a movie that's since departed from its source material?

930
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:38,691
Our solution was to tell the story through the eyes of an unreliable narrator.

931
00:48:40,372 --> 00:48:42,272
This guy, my favorite character, Captain Quark.

932
00:48:42,872 --> 00:48:45,273
Here he is getting the full spa treatment over in Zora Dune prison.

933
00:48:46,813 --> 00:48:50,393
With this device, we can have Quark exaggerate, we can have him lie, we can have him manipulate events.

934
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:53,739
so we could divert from the movie where we felt it was necessary.

935
00:48:55,701 --> 00:48:59,003
So we updated all of our shooting mechanics and RPG gameplay.

936
00:48:59,043 --> 00:49:01,565
I actually went back and tried to play the original Ratchet & Clank

937
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,647
and all the controls were so weird to me.

938
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:05,628
I had trouble just shooting something.

939
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:09,331
So we took all the lessons that we had learned over the entire series

940
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:13,374
and we improved the game and brought it up to date.

941
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:17,276
Metropolis made a return visit to this game.

942
00:49:18,646 --> 00:49:22,108
where Ratchet could fly his ship in a city with an insane amount of detail.

943
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:28,751
So ultimately, revisiting our original game helped us re-embrace what made the series

944
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:34,354
great, a robot and furry alien from opposite sides of the galaxy who team up to stop a

945
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:36,415
supervillain and become friends in the process.

946
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:40,517
We had this wonderful opportunity to have this epic do-over.

947
00:49:41,097 --> 00:49:44,298
We took everything we used about what made Ratchet and Clank.

948
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:48,709
the world that the characters inhabited and how to face challenges optimistically and

949
00:49:48,749 --> 00:49:51,652
at times fire our engines into the unknown.

950
00:49:54,794 --> 00:49:57,016
And of course the best games are made by the best teams.

951
00:49:57,596 --> 00:50:01,559
We count ourselves very lucky to have worked with some of the incredibly talented individuals

952
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:02,279
over at Insomniac.

953
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,223
Yeah, it's been an amazing ride and I just want to thank, a few thank yous, Nolan North

954
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:10,926
did the voice actually for, he's Nathan Drake of Sigmund.

955
00:50:11,888 --> 00:50:14,150
And also Amy Hennig helped us mentor this talk.

956
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,672
And I just want to thank Sony, all the Insomniacs,

957
00:50:16,732 --> 00:50:18,233
all the creatives and wonderful people

958
00:50:18,273 --> 00:50:20,375
that have helped make Ratchet & Clank

959
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:21,556
such an amazing franchise.

960
00:50:22,237 --> 00:50:24,278
So thanks for coming, and it looks like we have

961
00:50:24,338 --> 00:50:27,261
about 14 minutes, 13 minutes for questions.

962
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:27,901
Thank you.

963
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,252
So yeah, if you could, thank you.

964
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:48,216
Hi, I wanted to ask about my favorite recurring planet, planet Burbank, and ask why in the

965
00:50:48,256 --> 00:50:53,199
first place the Insomniac Museum was added to the games, why some didn't get them, and

966
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:54,800
the varying levels of that.

967
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,802
I feel like, is that Mike Stout?

968
00:50:56,842 --> 00:50:57,742
I can barely see.

969
00:50:57,762 --> 00:51:00,084
Oh, maybe not.

970
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:03,266
Okay, I thought, so Mike Stout, he was one of our designers.

971
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:05,387
I thought I recognized someone over there.

972
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:08,209
It looks just like, it's Mike Stout's doppelganger over there actually.

973
00:51:11,575 --> 00:51:15,658
We had all this cool stuff that we were throwing away that we wanted people to see.

974
00:51:15,998 --> 00:51:17,739
And so he actually spent extra time.

975
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,922
He was originally helping out QA on the first game.

976
00:51:21,522 --> 00:51:25,825
And then he started to do some design work and became a great designer.

977
00:51:26,806 --> 00:51:30,809
And so he just in his spare time laid out this level and he mapped out the Burbank floor.

978
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,271
And it was always something that we ended up doing.

979
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:34,812
Like someone would take on this project.

980
00:51:34,832 --> 00:51:38,515
We never scheduled it in because all of our schedules were like maxed out.

981
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:39,576
There was no room for them.

982
00:51:40,395 --> 00:51:44,877
But in Into the Nexus, we actually did dedicate some time to a museum level,

983
00:51:45,277 --> 00:51:47,638
and we gave it all the proper artwork and everything.

984
00:51:48,178 --> 00:51:52,620
But that's something that I feel like should be in every Ratchet and Clank game moving forward, certainly.

985
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,621
Thank you.

986
00:51:56,641 --> 00:51:59,022
Are there any other questions? Feel free to step up to the mic.

987
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:00,643
We don't throw anything or bite.

988
00:52:00,663 --> 00:52:05,865
Oh, we've got someone over here.

989
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:09,786
Can you enlighten us on the art of stacking boxes?

990
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:17,687
Sure, so the question is the art of stacking boxes and how did that work?

991
00:52:18,227 --> 00:52:24,272
I would have to go back and re-read that doc, but I remember it was in Kraken Time, that

992
00:52:24,312 --> 00:52:30,437
temple level, with this big open space and there were giant stacks, like 10 crates high

993
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:32,238
by like 10 crates deep.

994
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:36,382
And there was just like multiple versions of them and we just were like getting really

995
00:52:36,402 --> 00:52:36,842
tired because

996
00:52:37,138 --> 00:52:41,562
there's this weird compulsion to actually clear out all the boxes.

997
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:46,426
And then once we make you do that for like 10 minutes in like this one room,

998
00:52:46,506 --> 00:52:49,429
it starts to get kind of painful. So there's this,

999
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:53,272
so in his document he specified the rhythm,

1000
00:52:53,352 --> 00:52:57,295
the amount of boxes and then how to stack them and also to vary it up in such a

1001
00:52:57,335 --> 00:53:01,558
way where you could have explosive boxes in some crates that would encourage the

1002
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:02,139
wrench throw.

1003
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:07,140
You'd typically stack boxes behind enemies that were explosive so you could knock an

1004
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:07,960
enemy into them.

1005
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:14,345
We actually had special code where the enemy would magnet to the crates so that you would

1006
00:53:14,385 --> 00:53:16,347
typically see them getting thrown through them.

1007
00:53:16,987 --> 00:53:21,230
So there was lots of little things like that that just made it so much more satisfying.

1008
00:53:22,091 --> 00:53:25,793
And one thing just to add to that is that the bolts that would pop out of those crates.

1009
00:53:26,348 --> 00:53:28,269
I thought it was interesting, when I joined Insomniac,

1010
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,470
the audio team told me that they actually based that sound

1011
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,891
on Vegas slot machines, because those were designed

1012
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:34,752
to make you feel happy when you would collect the coins.

1013
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:36,632
So there's even like a little bit of psychology in it.

1014
00:53:38,613 --> 00:53:38,993
Thank you.

1015
00:53:41,034 --> 00:53:43,735
Hi, I got into Ratchet and Clank with the PS3 games,

1016
00:53:44,076 --> 00:53:46,357
and that was my first introduction to them,

1017
00:53:46,377 --> 00:53:46,917
and I loved them.

1018
00:53:47,837 --> 00:53:49,838
And I usually don't 100% games,

1019
00:53:49,878 --> 00:53:51,079
but I love that game so much,

1020
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:53,760
because I love that they would just banter during the level,

1021
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,461
and they would banter on the way to a level.

1022
00:53:56,838 --> 00:53:59,119
And once I completed the story, and I wanted to 100%,

1023
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:01,580
they stopped talking completely.

1024
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,841
And when you would travel in a ship,

1025
00:54:04,101 --> 00:54:05,842
it's like they were deliberately mad at each other

1026
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:07,483
or something, like there was silence.

1027
00:54:07,903 --> 00:54:09,724
And it's like, I would never hear their voices again.

1028
00:54:09,784 --> 00:54:10,824
They spent too long together.

1029
00:54:11,004 --> 00:54:11,705
Yeah.

1030
00:54:11,825 --> 00:54:13,665
After a cabin fever, such sadness.

1031
00:54:13,725 --> 00:54:16,967
It was so weird, I've never experienced that feeling of,

1032
00:54:17,327 --> 00:54:18,428
oh, I'm kind of sad now,

1033
00:54:19,028 --> 00:54:19,828
they're not talking anymore.

1034
00:54:20,268 --> 00:54:21,829
Is that a complaint that's ever come up?

1035
00:54:22,113 --> 00:54:31,738
It's not a complaint, but it's certainly something that we always look into, because it's like in a crack in time, I remember vividly that there were 10,000 lines of dialogue that I wrote that made it into the game.

1036
00:54:32,218 --> 00:54:35,900
And that's not counting what we cut, which is probably another 10,000 to be honest with you.

1037
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:45,824
And like, so when we dump these massive amounts of dialogue into the game, there's always somebody who has to go in there and balance them and make sure they don't play too much too often, they don't trip over each other.

1038
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:50,126
So it may have been a cool down issue, it may have just been like they're afraid that it would start to get too repeaty.

1039
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:56,154
something like that. It's like balancing dialogue in a game so that it doesn't trip over anything else that you're doing is a

1040
00:54:56,394 --> 00:54:59,577
full-time job in and of itself. So something we're always constantly working on.

1041
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:03,841
And just to add to that, when we first implemented like Mr. Zircon, I think we had Clank talking,

1042
00:55:03,881 --> 00:55:07,404
we'd have like these updates, and at one point one person was just like, I just want this game to shut up.

1043
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:11,708
It's like everything was talking all the time. So we had to actually figure out the right pacing for that.

1044
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:11,968
Yeah.

1045
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:25,538
My question is, with the newest game and the movie, they made Ratchet's face rounder and softer.

1046
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:33,521
And I was just kind of wondering if you guys know why? Because it didn't look like Ratchet anymore.

1047
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:38,243
It still felt like Ratchet, but it didn't really... I don't know, it was kind of uncanny.

1048
00:55:38,483 --> 00:55:40,904
Yeah, I know what you mean. At first, the plan when we first...

1049
00:55:41,292 --> 00:55:44,315
Because I was working with the team during the first couple of months of the Ratchet movie

1050
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:48,839
and we sent all our assets basically up to them with the idea that the same assets would be used in the movie.

1051
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,103
But ultimately when they pulled it into their animation software,

1052
00:55:52,483 --> 00:55:55,666
it didn't translate very well, so they actually had to rebuild everything.

1053
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:59,269
And we had animators and artists who would give as much feedback as they could,

1054
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:02,713
not just when it came to the models, but also the way that Ratchet smiles,

1055
00:56:02,733 --> 00:56:04,655
or the way that Clank lilts his head, that kind of thing.

1056
00:56:05,108 --> 00:56:08,649
And unfortunately, this is something that goes with the territory any time you have somebody

1057
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:13,910
who hasn't been working on that franchise for, you know, 15 years, where they do their best to

1058
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:19,351
mimic, but sometimes it just doesn't work out the way fans expect. Yeah, this was interesting on

1059
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:23,652
Tools of Destruction. We did a commercial for it, Digital Domain, who's this amazing effects house,

1060
00:56:24,072 --> 00:56:27,813
animated Ratchet, and we're like, who is that guy? Because he just, his face was off,

1061
00:56:27,893 --> 00:56:31,513
everything was different. And even though they had super talented animators,

1062
00:56:32,148 --> 00:56:35,851
We ended up creating like a model sheet where one of our animators did poses of his face

1063
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:40,134
so that people could follow it. It's really hard to get right. Like when people start to know a

1064
00:56:40,174 --> 00:56:48,639
character really well, you can tell when it's off. Question over here. Hi, so Ratchet and Clank got

1065
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:54,524
me into the games industry, so I was just curious like what got you guys into the industry? Oh wow,

1066
00:56:54,784 --> 00:56:59,467
wow that's a great question. Well the thing that got me into the game industry, I mean

1067
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,463
It's funny, I'd always been a gamer ever since I was a kid,

1068
00:57:03,483 --> 00:57:04,885
and I even remember when I was 12,

1069
00:57:05,766 --> 00:57:08,388
I wrote a story for Super Mario Brothers,

1070
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:10,110
and I sent it into the address

1071
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:11,872
on the back of a Nintendo Power magazine,

1072
00:57:12,532 --> 00:57:15,235
because in my mind, everything was just in one building,

1073
00:57:15,255 --> 00:57:16,616
and they would just run it up and use it.

1074
00:57:17,257 --> 00:57:18,939
But it didn't really work out like that.

1075
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:22,382
But when I came out to L.A. to start a writing career,

1076
00:57:22,402 --> 00:57:24,865
I also had a background in computer animation and ended up.

1077
00:57:25,629 --> 00:57:30,352
Doing QA and doing light design work over at insomniac and then they found out that I wrote and then that became sort of

1078
00:57:30,473 --> 00:57:32,894
My my big entrance into the into the industry

1079
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,877
Yeah, I actually

1080
00:57:35,897 --> 00:57:39,139
Started playing games in the early 80s. I was totally into the Atari

1081
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:44,243
I went to the smoky arcades all the time played all the games there and then at a certain point

1082
00:57:44,323 --> 00:57:46,925
I kind of stopped playing games. I just really want to figure out how to make them

1083
00:57:46,945 --> 00:57:51,889
I spent a lot of the time in the 80s mixing around my Commodore 64 trying to figure out how to program

1084
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:53,030
I was like super nerdy

1085
00:57:54,102 --> 00:57:58,043
And then I didn't realize I could actually get a job in the early 90s as a

1086
00:57:58,884 --> 00:58:00,084
game designer or an artist

1087
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:07,187
So fortunately this opportunity just came up where I could do art because back in 1991 artists were actually scared of computers

1088
00:58:07,227 --> 00:58:08,367
They just wanted to use paintbrushes

1089
00:58:08,387 --> 00:58:10,588
They didn't want to touch that stuff and I was like one of the few people

1090
00:58:10,608 --> 00:58:14,569
Willing to do that. So I ended up getting a job and doing something. I really love to do

1091
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:19,971
Thank you. That's a great question. I don't know how we're on time. It's 1230, but I think we have

1092
00:58:20,912 --> 00:58:22,092
What's the fist mean does that mean?

1093
00:58:23,429 --> 00:58:24,150
One more question.

1094
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,211
Gotcha, okay.

1095
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:26,212
One more question.

1096
00:58:26,232 --> 00:58:28,134
All right, one question.

1097
00:58:28,995 --> 00:58:32,338
How much did you guys share tech with Naughty Dog?

1098
00:58:32,419 --> 00:58:35,602
Because I remember vaguely that the Jak and Daxter engine

1099
00:58:36,162 --> 00:58:38,225
was the same one that you guys used for Ratchet and Clank.

1100
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:41,128
And when they made a sequel, you would update your tech.

1101
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,030
And for how long did you guys do that?

1102
00:58:44,242 --> 00:58:45,222
So that's a great question.

1103
00:58:45,262 --> 00:58:46,262
It comes up a lot.

1104
00:58:46,462 --> 00:58:49,263
And unfortunately, I wasn't a tech guy working on it.

1105
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,803
I know that we didn't just outright take their engine

1106
00:58:51,863 --> 00:58:53,404
and just outright take ours.

1107
00:58:53,424 --> 00:58:56,804
There were lots of components that we tried to share.

1108
00:58:57,285 --> 00:58:59,725
But it's always hard to integrate that tech,

1109
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:00,685
especially back then.

1110
00:59:01,366 --> 00:59:04,826
So in the very early days, there was definitely

1111
00:59:04,886 --> 00:59:06,767
some components that were being shared.

1112
00:59:06,827 --> 00:59:08,567
I just don't know the specifics of that.

1113
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:15,164
Because I remember like the patch rendering and then the vehicles got added and Jack and Dexter 2 and some other went into

1114
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:22,586
Ratchet and Clank 3. Yeah, we typically didn't share any like gameplay code. It's more on the rendering side. Okay. Yeah

1115
00:59:23,746 --> 00:59:26,507
Thanks. Okay. I think we're that's it. Oh wait wait. Oh

1116
00:59:27,687 --> 00:59:29,428
If anybody has any further questions

1117
00:59:29,728 --> 00:59:36,370
The speakers can go to room 2022 or 2024 around the area over there for further questions and Q&A with tables

1118
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:39,202
OK, we will be there. It's 2022.

1119
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:41,870
OK, well, thanks a lot, everybody.
