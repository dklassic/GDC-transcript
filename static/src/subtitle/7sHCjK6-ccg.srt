00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,749
Hi, welcome to this session in the Independent Games Summit of the Game Developers Conference.

2
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,737
We call this one, you have to stop working, even when you can't stop working.

3
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:27,664
And I've spoken to many people throughout the years

4
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:29,807
about crunch and burnout.

5
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,993
And suffice to say, I'm not a fan. Do not recommend.

6
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,414
I mean, none of us are. We just get stuck in it anyway, somehow, don't we?

7
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:43,319
I had the idea for this panel because usually when we talk about crunching burnout in the

8
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,284
broader game industry, the worst crimes against developers tend to be studio management ordering

9
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:52,248
people in their power to work harder and burn themselves out faster.

10
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:59,513
In the indie space, we can often burn ourselves out more joyfully, more enthusiastically,

11
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:04,196
and more violently than any AAA worker because literally no one can stop us.

12
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,181
Not legally, not physically, not emotionally.

13
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:10,303
It's just us versus ourselves.

14
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:15,166
So here are a few very experienced independent developers

15
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:20,309
with different insights and strategies for how to avoid working yourself to death.

16
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:24,532
You deserve a long career, my friend, making games,

17
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,073
many, many games in the years to come.

18
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:32,476
So please listen carefully to their survival strategies.

19
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:33,437
Good luck.

20
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,492
Hi everyone, I am Chandanayakanaika.

21
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:38,353
I'm the co-founder and creative director

22
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:39,974
of Outerloop Games here in Seattle.

23
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:44,698
I've been in the game industry for almost 24 years.

24
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:46,119
I was born in Sri Lanka,

25
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:49,301
and my parents moved us when I was about eight years old

26
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,083
during a civil war, going to Sri Lanka to the States.

27
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:55,186
They, you know, they didn't feel comfortable

28
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:56,707
us being there.

29
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,869
Me, my brother, my sister, we were pretty young,

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,471
and they wanted to have more opportunities for us.

31
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,994
So we moved to the US, lived in Maryland, went to art school in Savannah, Georgia.

32
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:11,897
And I watched my parents, you know, having to start over,

33
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:13,918
moving to a whole new country.

34
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:18,122
And I think I learned a lot of my work ethic from watching them

35
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:21,144
see how hard they worked to provide for us.

36
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:25,028
So I went to art school and then got a job at Bethesda at 19.

37
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:26,249
Right place, right time.

38
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,552
And I just did everything I possibly could.

39
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,053
When someone asked me to do something, I did it.

40
00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:41,156
I felt like the only way I could get ahead in games was to just put, just, you know, throw myself onto it and do anything that it needed to get done.

41
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:50,046
So I started in art, got into production, UI, trailers, design work, whatever needed to get done on the project, I was willing to do it.

42
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:53,650
Eventually moved over to LA and Orange County.

43
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:58,576
where I worked on a couple of Matrix titles for the movies that were coming out at the time.

44
00:02:58,717 --> 00:03:02,059
And then we eventually, after having our first kid, moved to the Seattle area,

45
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:08,744
and we've been living there since. In my 20 years prior to starting Outerloop,

46
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:13,747
I worked on a bunch of different games, and the team sizes varied from 10, 15, to

47
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:21,733
150 to 200 people, depending on the project. And there was one commonality with all these,

48
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:23,554
with the studios I worked at, was that

49
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,614
The game had to ship, the game had to get done,

50
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:33,318
and we needed to do whatever we could to help with that.

51
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,659
It wasn't necessarily, you know,

52
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:37,340
some places, depending on the time,

53
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,081
there was a mandatory crunch,

54
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:41,583
but most places it's not mandatory crunch.

55
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:43,364
It's this more implied crunch.

56
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:47,946
It's the scheduling, it's peer pressure from the team,

57
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:50,788
or it's major deadline with the publisher,

58
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:52,049
external pressure.

59
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:52,189
It all.

60
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:59,484
amounted in us working a lot of hours. I mean, there were times during work on Enter the Matrix

61
00:03:59,644 --> 00:04:06,572
that I put in 100-hour weeks because the game had to get done for the movies that were coming out,

62
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:11,558
and that was a fixed date. So regardless of the issues we were having on the design side or

63
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,359
production...

64
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:17,180
just meant a lot of us were working a lot of hours. I mean, I would come home three in the morning,

65
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,602
barely see my partner, get up in the morning, you know, for after a couple hours of sleep,

66
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:26,804
and do it all over again. And that after a while, years of doing that just takes a huge

67
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:32,566
mental and physical toll on your body. And when you're, you know, working that many hours,

68
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:36,268
you're not being very productive. Like you can barely think of what's going on, you're making

69
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:41,350
a lot of mistakes. It's just not healthy. And it's especially not healthy for the long term.

70
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:46,854
So I've been doing that, having done that for 20 plus years,

71
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:49,656
I decided that, you know, there must be a better way to do it.

72
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:51,718
And I want to be able to spend more time with my partner,

73
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:55,021
spend more time with my family and with my kids.

74
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:59,184
So about four years ago, I started Outerloop as a fully remote studio.

75
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:00,685
I think the timing was good.

76
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:04,628
The tools and technology has gotten better with Zoom and Discord and Slack.

77
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:08,271
We were able to, you know, myself and two other partners

78
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,833
that I started the company with that I had worked with before,

79
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,834
and we decided to try it remotely.

80
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:15,047
And we all work out of our houses.

81
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,494
It's grown from three people to four people to, you know, our first project was

82
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:22,656
about nine when we shipped.

83
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:26,881
I was still learning how to run a company and still doing too much.

84
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:32,347
So there's like a responsibility and a work ethic that I, you know, I think I.

85
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:37,082
I learned over the years, and some of the habits are really hard to make. I think a lot of my

86
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:43,204
self-worth was tied into how productive I was being, which is not a healthy way to make anything

87
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:50,146
or make a living. So over the years, I've learned to try to make myself more redundant, you know,

88
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:55,527
hire people that we need to fill certain roles so that I'm not trying to do like eight different

89
00:05:55,547 --> 00:06:00,948
jobs that's been healthier, you know, and after having kids.

90
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:06,071
we're forced to kind of budget our time better.

91
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:09,372
You know, I wanted to see my kids' first steps

92
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:11,213
and spend time with them as they grow up

93
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,133
because they do grow fast.

94
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,414
I mean, everyone tells you that kids grow fast,

95
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:18,475
but oh boy, yeah, I mean, 14 years, 15 years

96
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:22,376
with my two sons have gone by real quickly.

97
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:27,058
So starting the studio remote was also just a decision

98
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,099
for myself and my partner to spend more time

99
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,339
with our family.

100
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:36,409
And part of that is also making time for other things outside of games and staying away from

101
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:42,090
the screen. So I coach sports. Before COVID, I would coach sports with both of my kids.

102
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,251
And now that things are getting better in Washington, I'm doing that again.

103
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:50,632
It's been really healthy, not just mentally, physically, to kind of stay away from the work

104
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:57,554
side when I'm not working. Creatively, it's been a lot better, too, just to have that break to

105
00:06:57,594 --> 00:07:01,375
focus on something else. To solve problems, you kind of have to step away sometimes.

106
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:07,912
It's made for a better work environment, a better family life balance, but it's a constant struggle.

107
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:13,755
I'm pulled in constantly to think about like, how's the team doing? And you know, are we paying

108
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:19,338
our bills on time? And everyone, you know, all that stuff. But I'm trying to shut off work when

109
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:21,579
I'm not at work and focus on work when I am.

110
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,413
The team is up to 15 now.

111
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:29,035
We're spread across nine cities and 12-hour time differences.

112
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,176
So we're definitely trying to find different ways for that to work.

113
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:37,477
We're more empathetical for the different needs.

114
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,898
Even though the COVID situation in the U.S. has gotten better,

115
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:42,639
it's not the same in other parts of the world where our partners are.

116
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,760
So over the last year, it's been really stressful on everybody, too,

117
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,521
and make sure that people have time.

118
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:55,577
We encourage mental health days. We encourage people to take minimum number of days off.

119
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,561
They have to take a number of days off every year.

120
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,114
We try to make sure, you know, check in on people more often, make sure they're doing well.

121
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:08,698
And scheduling wise for the amount of work that's required, you know, we're trying to be better

122
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:12,762
about that too, so that they're not feeling the same kind of pressures I did in my previous

123
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:17,346
companies where I felt like I had to get stuff done because everyone else was doing. So I need

124
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:25,233
myself as a, you know, studio head needs to be do a better job as an example for the rest of the team.

125
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:31,827
We're also, the team is a little older, so you know, one of my partners had a baby recently,

126
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:36,271
so we made sure that he had three, four months of paternity leave. And we plan around that,

127
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:40,876
you know, we know that's a coming thing and we plan around it. So far it's been working out

128
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:44,679
pretty well, but it's a constant struggle for myself to make sure that I'm not doing too much,

129
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,002
which is easy habit to get back right into.

130
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:55,680
So yeah, working for 24 hours, 24 years,

131
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,121
well, I've learned a lot to what not to do,

132
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,682
and it's really healthy,

133
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,503
and it's better for the project and the team.

134
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:04,784
If you can take the time,

135
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:06,945
you definitely should take the time,

136
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:09,466
and it's responsibility on the studio heads

137
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,627
and the production team to make sure

138
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,488
that the project is scheduled in a way that

139
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:19,615
people's mental health and well-being are taken into account. That's the biggest part of making

140
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:24,901
any game is the people. And if you're not taking care of yourself or your folks, then it's just

141
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:30,988
in the long run, it's just not going to be healthy. And the products won't do as well,

142
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,533
and neither will the studio. All right. Thank you.

143
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:40,938
Hi, I'm Astrid. My pronouns are she, her.

144
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:44,059
I'm CEO and co-founder of Triple Topping Games

145
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,479
and advisor to Carbonites.

146
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,240
Ever since we founded Triple Topping,

147
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,341
it has been important for us to rethink

148
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:53,322
how we structure work and allow ourselves to stop working.

149
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:57,003
If you're curious on how we handle all this in details,

150
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,024
you can always read our contract

151
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:00,984
and employee handbook on our website.

152
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:04,686
Before I start, I just want to give a small trigger warning,

153
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:06,927
especially for those who are parents themselves.

154
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:15,013
some context. To give the best understanding of my talk, I want to share a little bit of

155
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:22,114
my current personal life situation. Last year, I gave birth to our baby Bobby. They were

156
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:28,076
born premature week 34 with an emergency C-section. Since then, we have learned that Bobby most

157
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:32,317
likely suffered from a chronical illness and we have spent countless hours at the hospital.

158
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:36,498
I for the first time had to say no to things I planned.

159
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:40,764
I even took a break from work from my work at Carmel Knights.

160
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:46,206
But working is also what helped both my partner and I to focus on something else and allow

161
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:48,367
ourselves to take a small break from the hospital.

162
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:53,150
Socialize with other people and be creative and have a sense of normality.

163
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,671
I'm thankful that I always practice to stop working.

164
00:10:57,312 --> 00:11:00,753
Otherwise, I would not in time have realized that that's what I had to do.

165
00:11:01,814 --> 00:11:04,895
I hope that the learnings I shared today can be helpful for others too.

166
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:13,247
why it's hard to stop. Most people want to do the absolute best at any given job. On top of this,

167
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:17,928
most people identify themselves by their profession and the job they do, especially

168
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:24,289
in the games industry. This makes it incredibly hard to stop working. Personally, I don't believe

169
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:29,630
in what I call the Netflix model. They share a handbook with no fixed amount of work hours.

170
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,531
Because how do you know when to stop? What if your colleagues work more?

171
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:38,013
Are you then lazy? Or maybe your boss thinks you are?

172
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:44,277
I believe we need to help ourselves to stop. I believe we should all just agree on working

173
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:50,761
less hours. Our industry combines conferences, parties, fun hangouts and discord and even

174
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:57,005
rollerblades with our work. The lines between spare time and work are blurred. Game development

175
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:59,327
are for some a lifestyle, not a job.

176
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,010
It's our own way of coping with work-life balance.

177
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,071
And it's a huge part of why I love this industry.

178
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:09,793
But it also makes it so hard to stop working.

179
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:13,014
I learned all this myself the hard way

180
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:14,694
when I was expecting my first child,

181
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:17,075
and once again when Bobby arrived.

182
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:20,436
My love, care, and headspace were needed somewhere else

183
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:22,196
than on our company Slack channel.

184
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:27,758
Most of us have a hard time not to think

185
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:29,198
about work in our spare time.

186
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:31,555
It's because our work makes us worry.

187
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:34,798
You worry about job role, the next deadline,

188
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,119
that comment during lunch,

189
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:38,381
if the CEO likes you or dislikes you,

190
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:41,163
how to announce your pregnancy, et cetera.

191
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:43,104
So to stop working,

192
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:45,346
you also have to learn how to stop worrying.

193
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:48,048
And I use this tool by advice from my dear brother.

194
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,870
If it's not a problem in six months,

195
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,111
it's not a problem now.

196
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:58,253
Like running a studio, doing a job, life can be challenging and sometimes you're presented

197
00:12:58,314 --> 00:12:59,994
with a hill that seems too high to climb.

198
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:03,556
To help myself, I think of challenging this way.

199
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,297
Most things within six months from now have presented itself with a solution.

200
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,779
A good or bad solution, but a solution.

201
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:13,940
A break up right now.

202
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:20,074
when it's happening, it can feel like the end of the world, but in six months you will start to

203
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:26,637
move forward and see all the new positive changes in your life. It can also be a game release. In

204
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:33,021
six months from now, the game is out. Maybe it will do amazingly, maybe not, but you will know and you

205
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:38,044
will have the answer. Some things will not have presented itself with a solution in six months

206
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:44,407
from now. Climate changes, for example. So we should worry about that. I even schedule winter

207
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:44,607
spring.

208
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:50,437
Very often your worries lie in the hands of other people, like a yes or no on funding.

209
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:53,900
But until they give you that answer, stop worrying about it.

210
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:57,964
I will also not allow myself to think about my worries before I sleep.

211
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:03,789
It's hard and I practice it this every night, but I always tell myself a good story before I sleep.

212
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,711
Sometimes I have to make it up.

213
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:11,810
I know it's easy to tell you to stop worrying about work, especially going through a pandemic,

214
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:15,713
many of us working alone from home, but it's always good to practice.

215
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:20,155
How I stop working.

216
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:22,236
Communication goes a long way.

217
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:28,059
If you tell everyone when you are not working, it actually helps you to keep that promise

218
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,760
to yourself too.

219
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,182
So communicate to people when your work hours are.

220
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:36,744
Let them know if you are on vacation and when you are back.

221
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,280
Respect other people's time zones and office hours too.

222
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:44,402
I put my work hours and time zones in my email footer.

223
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:45,283
It helps a lot.

224
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:47,864
Realize things can wait.

225
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:50,405
No need to email a reply at 1 a.m.

226
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:51,846
Other people are sleeping.

227
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:54,447
Budget and plan for time off.

228
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:55,608
Things take time.

229
00:14:55,948 --> 00:14:57,449
Game development, a long time.

230
00:14:57,989 --> 00:15:00,230
But try not to make a budget and time schedule

231
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,511
that requires you to work 70 hours per week.

232
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:04,873
It's like taking a loan on your own health.

233
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,413
You can't keep doing it.

234
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:12,074
Demand of your partner to be equal in parenthood, not only when it comes to weekends, but during

235
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:12,794
work week too.

236
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,555
My partner and I have worked every second day.

237
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:20,336
It helped us to structure our work schedules and be 100% there for Bobby when they needed

238
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:20,416
it.

239
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:22,876
It made planning work-wise easy.

240
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:25,717
Set goals and monitor your work time.

241
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:29,738
Go from 50 to 40 or 40 to 35 hours.

242
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,258
At some point, you'll get the same amount of work done in 32 hours.

243
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:40,475
The benefit from this is also that if you need to work more, like towards a big deadline,

244
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:46,640
a game release, for example, it would take a lot of extra work before you end up having

245
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,620
to work long nights.

246
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:54,545
Working towards a more healthy work life takes practice, but it's just as important as the

247
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:55,245
game you are making.

248
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:00,785
I know taking time off and working is a privilege.

249
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:06,650
It requires you to have a secure job in the first place,

250
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,113
to have sick pay, paid holiday, live in a welfare state,

251
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,215
and you need to advocate your rights.

252
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:15,937
Ironically, to be able to stop work,

253
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,280
you need to have the resources to work.

254
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:25,563
We are all in this together, but some of us have a lot more power than others.

255
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:29,205
While I'm speaking from a small business perspective,

256
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:33,147
the power for change lies at both ends of the spectrum.

257
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,929
The small power I have to set an example or to advocate

258
00:16:37,349 --> 00:16:39,690
still needs to be met by the big corporations

259
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,512
to build better working conditions, better publishing contracts,

260
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:45,513
and better internal cultures overall.

261
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:52,556
So I'm inviting all of us who are privileged enough to be able to take my advice on how to stop working,

262
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:54,097
to help those who are not.

263
00:16:54,858 --> 00:17:01,263
Support people of color, indigenous people, women, non-binary people, trans people, queer people,

264
00:17:01,383 --> 00:17:06,108
and recognize that the struggle for a life worth living is also bigger than work.

265
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,772
It is in solidarity for the people suffering apartheid in Palestine.

266
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:14,495
It is in advocacy for migrants and global human rights.

267
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:21,182
hire diverse candidates, take your job as an employer seriously, listen and learn.

268
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:27,908
Put your money and your advocacy out there, buy people's work, make space, make connections,

269
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:29,190
pass the mic.

270
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,273
Let's work together to redesign our industry with dignity in mind.

271
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:37,697
And thank you, Hannah Nitzling, for helping me putting together this last slide.

272
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:39,379
And thank you all for listening.

273
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,321
Hi, I'm Danny Day.

274
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:46,761
I run a 14-year-old game studio in South Africa and occasionally contract internationally.

275
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:51,926
I burnt out really hard last year while working for a wonderful US studio that had very little

276
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:52,366
to do with it.

277
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:57,311
I burnt out because time zone related overwork combined with having a toddler and the global

278
00:17:57,331 --> 00:18:02,115
pandemic to completely overwhelm the lifelong coping mechanisms I'd built up around undiagnosed

279
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:02,356
ADD.

280
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:07,493
I went from being a high-functioning person that relied on hyperfocus and random inspiration,

281
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:13,334
to someone that was barely able to focus on anything and constantly failing to spot glaring errors in what I did manage to do.

282
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:17,335
After a difficult conversation, I took a month off, then resigned.

283
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,356
I really, really had to stop working.

284
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:24,016
Things are much better now. I'm excited to be running a team and making a game,

285
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:28,357
armed with the understanding of my ADD, good therapists, and support of an amazing partner.

286
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,498
So, I'll be talking about two things.

287
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:37,577
avoiding time zone stress, and how to get the most out of therapy. Sleep. Sleep is important.

288
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:41,460
The major mechanism of time zone stress is a lack of or severely disturbed sleep.

289
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:46,725
Bad sleep is a huge red flag. Remote working is great for flexibility, but working across

290
00:18:46,785 --> 00:18:51,449
time zones can get complex. It's normal to want to work with the people you work with.

291
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:55,766
Not only is pure asynchronous communication difficult, but the times when you can chat

292
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:59,328
directly to your co-workers and pair up on issues just feel so much more productive.

293
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:04,771
Work hours tend to shift as a result. It usually starts out as just being up late or early for this

294
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:09,313
one thing, which goes really well. Soon your work hours have shifted slightly to give you

295
00:19:09,353 --> 00:19:13,436
more overlap with your co-workers. Then meetings get scheduled for when you're always around.

296
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:18,478
So to keep up the pace, you shift your day a little more. Spot the feedback loop.

297
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,657
It requires constant effort to prevent time zone slippage.

298
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:24,899
For some people, like me, it's nearly impossible to avoid,

299
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,321
and we end up working a local night shift completely disconnected from where we live.

300
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:32,783
In my case, that was a feature at first. Working remotely for a US studio meant I

301
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:37,065
could look after our infant child and get work done all night. But as the child started

302
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:40,167
sleeping through, the demands on my time meant I couldn't just sleep all day.

303
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,032
Fast forward a couple of years and I was working in three distinct chunks every day,

304
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:48,034
interspersed with hours of responsibilities in my regular time zone, and sleeping and eating

305
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:53,157
in incredibly strange times. I was essentially experimenting with polyphasic work, and it felt

306
00:19:53,197 --> 00:19:58,520
like being jet lagged for months at a time. Cool, so that sucks. How do we not do that?

307
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,003
Individually, you can counteract the pull into another time zone by focusing more on maintaining

308
00:20:04,043 --> 00:20:06,184
a constant starting time that's good for where you live.

309
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:10,775
People will learn that you're always on at X time, but now that will work in your favor

310
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:13,778
because they'll leave comms waiting for you or have quick handover meetings.

311
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:17,421
Be reasonably ruthless about when you're not going to work.

312
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:21,484
Sure, make yourself available for meetings and special things that need everyone's attention,

313
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:24,667
but if you're doing those outside of what would be regular work hours for you,

314
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:27,669
set time limits on those meetings and don't keep working afterward.

315
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:31,927
Acknowledge that you're going to be working async a lot and plan around that.

316
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:35,449
Make sure you always have tasks you can switch to if you get blocked on anything

317
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:39,011
waiting for someone to get back to you. Be proactive about issues when they pop

318
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,852
up and treat your pairing and co-working times as precious.

319
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:45,814
Schedule and push for socializing time with your co-workers.

320
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:49,557
This is fine to do outside regular work hours and be open to people wanting to

321
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:51,598
socialize with you in their off hours as well

322
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:53,819
because this doubles the time you have for connections.

323
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:57,018
Monitor your time in more than just hours spent.

324
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:59,182
Track your start and end times each day,

325
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:00,786
spot trends, and watch for slippage.

326
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,609
If you're routinely staying on through

327
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,253
your co-workers' entire workdays,

328
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:05,796
stop and take a breather.

329
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:09,565
When it comes to running studios across multiple time zones,

330
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:12,327
it's part of your responsibility to build systems that help

331
00:21:12,347 --> 00:21:14,409
your team members avoid time zone stress.

332
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:17,691
This sounds obvious, but be aware of everyone's time zones.

333
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:19,413
Build-in automatic do not disturbs

334
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:21,074
based on when they don't want to be working.

335
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:22,816
Respect their time when you schedule

336
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:24,877
those inevitable meetings outside their workday,

337
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:27,139
and if someone's obviously working later and later,

338
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:28,220
check if they're okay.

339
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,483
Plan far enough in advance that people are comfortable

340
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:32,984
working asynchronously and picking up

341
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:35,106
other tasks if they're blocked waiting for someone else.

342
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:39,954
Treat that kind of waiting as a conveyor optimization task for yourself,

343
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:42,676
rather than an availability problem on their part.

344
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,498
Cut down on the concept of core hours that require everyone to be around.

345
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:50,339
They're directly undermining your asynchronous capabilities.

346
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,022
I get why core hours feel like a good idea, and you definitely do need some kind of occasional

347
00:21:56,102 --> 00:22:00,163
overlap so that important discussions can be had, but try to figure out ways to make those less

348
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:00,443
frequent.

349
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,404
And finally, commit to being remote.

350
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:05,806
If some of your studio works at the same office,

351
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,908
that's going to become the de facto time zone

352
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,510
that everyone else is pulled towards.

353
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,972
Part of this is making sure all your meetings can

354
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:12,973
be caught up on the next day.

355
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:14,815
You don't have to be minuting everything,

356
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:17,397
but at least record decisions and expected outcomes.

357
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:19,800
No time for a segue.

358
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,181
On to the therapy cheat sheet.

359
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:26,748
Therapy is a good thing. If there's one takeaway from my part of this talk, it's that you should

360
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:31,669
go to therapy, even if it's only for a limited period, preferably well before you hit a situation

361
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:35,870
like mine. The thinking that eventually got me looking for a therapist went something like this.

362
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:41,692
What if I've frog-boiled myself into using up loads of resources just to function each day?

363
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:46,273
What if there are other ways to exist that leave me less drained, and I can't see them from where

364
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:51,134
I am now, but there are literally professionals that can help me figure this sort of stuff out?

365
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:55,978
In my case, that led to an adult diagnosis of ADD, which has been incredibly helpful.

366
00:22:56,598 --> 00:23:01,220
Just understanding how and why I make decisions and how that differs from other people's mechanisms

367
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,440
has alleviated so much stress and made running a team much easier.

368
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:10,162
It's very important to know what you want from therapy. That can be catharsis, healing,

369
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:14,703
new tools, self-knowledge, anything based on poking how you feel inside your own brain.

370
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:18,364
It's not just the extremes of sobbing on the couch, which is perfectly okay,

371
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:21,405
or some personification of a grinning self-help book on steroids.

372
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:26,581
Different therapists prefer different approaches and patients. Finding a therapist is a lot like

373
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:30,243
dating. You're going to need to meet a bunch of different people until you find someone

374
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:34,026
that gels with you because therapists make that same call from their side as well.

375
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:39,129
Also, please note that I'm coming at this from a privileged perspective in South Africa where I

376
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:43,311
can both afford and choose therapists. Other people in my country don't have as many options

377
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:46,353
and other countries' health systems restrict choice in other ways.

378
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:53,018
It can be extremely exhausting to sit down with a person you've just met in a strange environment,

379
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:56,762
pour parts of yourself out in front of them, and feel like they're just not engaging.

380
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:01,486
Because they're not. A trained therapist will want to know as much about you and your situation as

381
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:06,251
they can before they decide if they can indeed help or not. Until they know, they'll make extra

382
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,133
sure they're not going to get in the way of anyone else.

383
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:12,595
At the end of your first session with someone, if they think they can't help,

384
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:17,797
they'll be extra distanced and disconnected. This isn't them judging you. It's them making

385
00:24:17,837 --> 00:24:21,279
sure they don't set anything in motion that another therapist won't know about.

386
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,341
They really do want to help, so ask for recommendations for therapists they feel

387
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:30,364
might work for you. Once you find a therapist you can work with, be prepared for things to take

388
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:35,027
time. Very few therapists are going to recommend anything super impactful early on. It's mostly

389
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:36,968
tests, questions, and trying out theories.

390
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:43,987
You didn't get to where you are overnight, and your therapist first needs to figure out where that even is before you can start taking steps to move elsewhere.

391
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:46,408
Thankfully, things add up over time.

392
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:54,711
You're not obligated to keep seeing anyone that makes you uncomfortable, and you can always ask your therapist to stop any practices or methodologies for whatever reason.

393
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:56,772
Therapy is about ongoing consent.

394
00:24:58,314 --> 00:25:02,317
Getting a diagnosis is a complex set of feelings to navigate, especially as an adult.

395
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:05,860
It's important to know that you're still the same person and your life doesn't need to change

396
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,304
drastically. You just know more about yourself. How you choose to use that knowledge is up to you,

397
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:15,548
and you don't have to disclose any diagnoses to anyone else in your life if you don't want to.

398
00:25:16,268 --> 00:25:20,652
A diagnosis isn't a sentence or a proclamation about you. Most of the time, they're great for

399
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:23,374
giving you a window into how the fuck other people do what they do.

400
00:25:25,264 --> 00:25:28,705
Medication isn't just something that happens. It's a com...

401
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:31,926
Okay, hang on. Let's go into more depth about medication.

402
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:36,528
Medication can only come from registered psychiatrists.

403
00:25:37,088 --> 00:25:40,329
Often, you'd be recommended to a psychiatrist by another therapist you're seeing.

404
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,050
Psychologists can do diagnoses, but no meds.

405
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:47,252
If someone that's not a psychiatrist recommends or offers medication, stay away.

406
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,878
The choice to be medicated or not is up to you.

407
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:53,119
Attitudes towards medication are complex,

408
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,979
but the most important thing is how safe and empowered you feel.

409
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:59,680
Additionally, please don't weigh in on anyone else's choice to medicate or not.

410
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,380
That's gross.

411
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,321
Psychiatrists issue medication.

412
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:08,422
They're the pilot in a plane that's taking you to a destination of your choice.

413
00:26:08,982 --> 00:26:11,942
If you want to get off, they'll land it for you and help you pick a different flight.

414
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:16,103
But self-medicating is a bit like hijacking a plane because your friend likes shrooms

415
00:26:16,623 --> 00:26:17,863
and has played a lot of flight simulator.

416
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,483
don't do it. Should you choose to start medicating, know that the best approaches to medication are

417
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:29,425
long-term. Nothing is a silver bullet. Yes, some people start meds and find that their situations

418
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:33,927
change almost overnight, but if you've got a network of coping habits already, figuring out

419
00:26:33,987 --> 00:26:38,990
how and when those change due to medication takes time. A good psychiatrist will ease you into a

420
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,332
medication gradually, letting you know what to expect and what to watch out for. It's perfectly

421
00:26:43,412 --> 00:26:47,014
okay to say, nope, I don't like how this impacts me and look for something else.

422
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:52,274
Everyone's relationship with their meds is different and we get different things out of them.

423
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:57,695
Sometimes meds are long-term interventions like glasses giving you a different perspective that you couldn't hold before.

424
00:26:58,376 --> 00:27:02,477
Other times meds are short-term like someone learning you a car so you can get back on your feet.

425
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:08,278
Provided you're working with your therapist, there is no right or wrong way to be medicated or not.

426
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:12,700
In fact, there is no right or wrong way to be full stop.

427
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:17,818
Therapy is just a very good way to get someone else's expert input on how you are

428
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:21,220
so that you can decide where to go next. You should try it.

429
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,302
Thank you. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the chat.

430
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:30,884
Hey everyone, my name is Rebecca Saltzman and I'm going to be talking to you a little bit today

431
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:35,786
about our work-life balance at Fingy and I've entitled this talk Constrained by Space and Time,

432
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:39,748
which we are. We are constrained by space and time.

433
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:45,872
I'm the CEO of Finji and I'm going to tell you just a little bit about myself real quick.

434
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:51,855
We are both a development studio and an independent publisher. So we make our games and we publish

435
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:56,478
games. Some of the things that we made internally are Canabalt, that endless runner from 2009.

436
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,642
And also, Overland, which we launched in 2019.

437
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:06,744
And sort of in between years, we have launched Night in the Woods,

438
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:10,326
Wilmot's Warehouse, Spiced, Panoramical, and last week,

439
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:13,048
because I'm recording this a little bit early,

440
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:15,649
we launched Chicory, A Colorful Tale on PS5.

441
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:23,028
Why am I here? Because we have opinions on work-life balance.

442
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:27,330
I run my studio with my husband and partner Adam Saltzman and we have a

443
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,011
family. So running a studio and having a family

444
00:28:31,391 --> 00:28:32,411
can be a bit tricky.

445
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:39,334
So Fingy. There's so much about Fingy that wants to take over my life.

446
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:41,838
It's kind of endless.

447
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:42,979
We have our games.

448
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,143
Adam and I have been mentors

449
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,525
for a really long time in the industry.

450
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:49,908
We support initiatives all over.

451
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,933
We have events in person and online now.

452
00:28:55,296 --> 00:29:02,240
I have to manage budgets and pitch decks and HR and operations and talks and travel and meetings

453
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:09,205
and I could go on and on and on and on and Fingy doesn't want to give up any time.

454
00:29:09,745 --> 00:29:11,246
It can be a bit of a black hole.

455
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:18,364
It does want to be every single day of my life.

456
00:29:18,544 --> 00:29:20,425
The to-do lists will never end.

457
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:23,927
The emails just keep coming, including on weekends,

458
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:26,548
because weekends are work days in some places.

459
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:31,230
And if I let Fingy really take over,

460
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:35,032
if I pay attention to it 100% of the time,

461
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:37,413
I actually won't have any more time for me

462
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,474
or my family or my kids.

463
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:46,194
or my hobbies, there is always, always, always something more to do.

464
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:51,465
Dear Hindi, please, please leave me alone.

465
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,911
And like, I can say that, it's my company,

466
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:57,793
but also like seriously, Fingy, leave me alone.

467
00:29:58,874 --> 00:30:00,095
It's been a lot of years

468
00:30:00,155 --> 00:30:03,277
and I kinda just don't want a to-do list anymore.

469
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:05,058
Because let's be real,

470
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:09,701
this is way effin' more important than making video games.

471
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:12,903
My family and my pets and playing at the beach in the summer

472
00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:13,143
like,

473
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:17,528
At the end of my time here on Earth, I have my creative life,

474
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:19,588
but I also have my family life.

475
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:23,930
And that is equally as important as just making cool things.

476
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,831
And there are so many, so many obstacles staying in the way

477
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:30,512
of what's important to me.

478
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:33,852
We have my work to-do list that never goes away.

479
00:30:34,313 --> 00:30:35,893
My work and my computer live in my house,

480
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:38,434
and the pandemic has made that way worse.

481
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,594
I'm actually in my office right now by myself.

482
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:41,255
It's very weird.

483
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,659
I have external pressures that feel

484
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,400
incompatible to flexibility.

485
00:30:47,142 --> 00:30:49,623
For example, we have money, like we

486
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:51,064
have a finite amount of money.

487
00:30:51,905 --> 00:30:52,965
My family needs my time.

488
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:54,246
My team needs my time.

489
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:55,967
My publishing partners need my time.

490
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:59,670
My team has expectations of me alongside with my family,

491
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,051
my business development partners.

492
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:04,553
All of these things are incompatible to being

493
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:05,073
flexible.

494
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:11,794
I also have years of poor record keeping, not just from me,

495
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,956
but from all of us collectively.

496
00:31:14,076 --> 00:31:15,377
Did we write things down?

497
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:17,698
And are we redoing work that we just poorly

498
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:18,919
documented in the past?

499
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,562
And then we have destructive internal dialogues,

500
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:25,964
the most insidious of which is fake it till you make it.

501
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,105
And I say it all the time.

502
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:30,247
But at what point are I not faking it anymore?

503
00:31:30,787 --> 00:31:33,549
How much do I really have to work to not fake it?

504
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:37,690
Am I working hard enough to deserve what I have?

505
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,133
Or am I convinced I'm not working hard enough

506
00:31:40,154 --> 00:31:41,255
so I can't get what I want?

507
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,759
Like all this stuff is just there in my head,

508
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,243
keeping me from trying to take time to myself.

509
00:31:47,494 --> 00:31:49,015
And then why am I working all alone?

510
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:51,996
Sometimes we really are working alone.

511
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,877
We're a single person team,

512
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:56,799
or we're the only expert in our particular field.

513
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,499
We have no one to bounce things off of,

514
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:01,161
which means it feels like we have to work twice as hard

515
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:05,803
or 10 times as hard to like prove to ourselves

516
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:06,563
we're doing it right.

517
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:12,816
So all of this stuff has been here like we're years over a decade into Fingy now.

518
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:18,820
And at a certain point, Adam and I were like, we really need to change. We need to change our

519
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:24,684
mentality. We just need to think a little bit harder about like how we're going to work in

520
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:29,867
this industry for a long time because we can't burn out. We have burned out and we have suffered

521
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:35,291
the consequences of that. Gotta say the flu after PAX and GDC sucks.

522
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:38,444
So how did we change?

523
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:40,047
And this is going to sound really stupid,

524
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:41,790
but the very first thing that we changed back

525
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,813
when we like sort of rebranded Finji

526
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:45,356
is we published a mission statement

527
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,720
to hold ourselves, me and Adam, accountable.

528
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:48,722
And like.

529
00:32:49,691 --> 00:32:51,612
It seems sort of light and fluffy or whatever,

530
00:32:51,672 --> 00:32:53,994
but there's a really important piece of it

531
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:57,256
at the bottom, which is like, we practice inclusive team

532
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:59,417
policies that support good quality of life,

533
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:01,038
meaning no crunch.

534
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:04,501
And we provide significant revenue shares or bonuses,

535
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:07,943
however you want to use that word, for all team members.

536
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:12,126
And that was written because we, Adam and I,

537
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:14,187
needed to understand that we couldn't crunch.

538
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,870
And we wrote this when we were parents of two young children.

539
00:33:19,918 --> 00:33:21,300
Now, like this was our deal with ourselves.

540
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,382
And then we had to take that

541
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:25,283
and make that same deal with our collaborators.

542
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:27,065
So we have our FING policies

543
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:28,646
where we work 40 hour work weeks.

544
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,290
We have collaborator buy-in on short studio sprints,

545
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,492
time zone overlaps per discipline and team

546
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:36,253
to make sure we overlap in our working together.

547
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:39,476
We have five planned weeks of studio closure every year

548
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:40,157
that are paid.

549
00:33:40,637 --> 00:33:42,399
We have unlimited scheduled PTO.

550
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,661
We have maternity leave and paternity leave benefits.

551
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:46,102
We have six time, six.

552
00:33:46,582 --> 00:33:51,966
days, flexible work locations. We have weekends that don't belong to Fingy. We have comp time

553
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:57,490
after travel and sprints. But I can say these things all day long, but it's just a promise.

554
00:33:58,031 --> 00:34:03,935
It's our job to follow our own policies and to be honest with ourselves. If we expect

555
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:08,859
our teams to take time off, Adam and I have to take time off as well. We have to be intentional

556
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:09,419
about this.

557
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:11,487
So how do we do it?

558
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:15,889
And this seems like an impossible problem in front of us.

559
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:18,470
And we just took some really simple steps

560
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,790
to sort of pull ourselves accountable.

561
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,551
And the first thing is we have a production schedule

562
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:25,212
and that seems obvious, but we have a schedule.

563
00:34:25,312 --> 00:34:27,153
We put things on it.

564
00:34:27,393 --> 00:34:28,173
We use it.

565
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:29,614
We share it with the team.

566
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:34,296
We schedule short-term, medium-term, long-term, 12 months from now.

567
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:38,099
These are things that we have to do and they're going to change, but at least we

568
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:43,882
have it written down so we understand the context of changes. We plan for and

569
00:34:43,902 --> 00:34:47,344
announce studio closures. We help the team wrap up projects or come

570
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:50,786
to a reasonable pausing point before those studio closures. We actually have

571
00:34:50,846 --> 00:34:54,508
one in like two weeks. And studio closures means we don't work.

572
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:58,448
Like yes, Discord lives on when we're not at work,

573
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:02,410
but we also have admins that help us manage while we're on break.

574
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,271
We have backup.

575
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,732
So if somebody needs to go on vacation, we have somebody who can take over

576
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:10,593
their spot if it needs to be taken over while they're gone.

577
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:15,035
No, how else do we do it? We have communication rules.

578
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:17,116
You know the saying about assume.

579
00:35:17,737 --> 00:35:19,658
Don't make an ass of me and you,

580
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:21,379
or you and me, however you want to say it.

581
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,461
We have to have collaborator buy-in.

582
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:26,743
We can't have assumptions on how people are going to work.

583
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:29,946
Your partners, your people that you live with,

584
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:32,447
and your family, you can't assume

585
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:34,149
that they're okay with what you're doing.

586
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:35,530
They're probably not.

587
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,490
Have you talked to them?

588
00:35:37,691 --> 00:35:39,272
You need to have buy-in from them.

589
00:35:39,432 --> 00:35:40,753
You need to have these conversations.

590
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:44,132
We try to solve problems with solutions,

591
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:47,134
and we tend not to discuss the merits of ideas or opinions,

592
00:35:47,194 --> 00:35:51,257
because those can let us bog down in valuing people

593
00:35:51,457 --> 00:35:53,499
rather than solving problems.

594
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,541
And that's how we keep our design discussions

595
00:35:56,661 --> 00:35:59,543
and our to-do lists and task lists sort of on track.

596
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,745
And then we write things down.

597
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:04,706
We write down so much stuff.

598
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:07,848
We have definitely discovered the value of documentation.

599
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:10,664
And we also trust but validate.

600
00:36:11,164 --> 00:36:12,706
We have team one-on-one check-ins

601
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:15,428
to see how our collaborators are doing.

602
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:20,473
We also do validation for our tasks.

603
00:36:20,774 --> 00:36:24,177
So if we're gonna put something on a programmer's schedule,

604
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:26,419
we need to understand how long this stuff is gonna take

605
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:26,660
because...

606
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,742
If you are wrong or wildly wrong, you didn't have that conversation,

607
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:33,904
you may have assigned a 20-hour task when you thought it took two.

608
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:40,329
And now you are setting someone up to fail and to not be able to take time to have that work-life

609
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:40,769
balance.

610
00:36:42,638 --> 00:36:44,199
And we have constant collaboration,

611
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:46,199
or not collaboration, we do that too.

612
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,681
We have constant calibration that what we're working on

613
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:50,822
is the right thing at the right time.

614
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,403
Sometimes you need to punt things

615
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:55,804
because you're going to get bogged down

616
00:36:56,064 --> 00:36:57,985
in something that doesn't have a solution yet.

617
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:00,586
And we've gotten very comfortable with punting it forward

618
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:03,748
and doing something that we can do in the time that we have.

619
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:09,270
And we rely on these processes to keep us honest,

620
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,771
honest with ourselves.

621
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:21,701
Because we can't have Fingy and making things take over our entire life because we're more than what we create.

622
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:34,409
Now, I'm a lot of people outside of games. Like, I'm a person that you don't know when I'm home here in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

623
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:42,875
I have hobbies and I have friends who don't work in games and I have interests that are not making things and creating things.

624
00:37:43,873 --> 00:37:50,337
And I am able to have these things because at a certain point, I realized I had to have these things.

625
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:58,121
And like, yes, parenthood forced a bit of it, but like I could have ignored that.

626
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:07,567
I could have let that continue to encroach upon the life that I sort of agreed to have with both my husband and my family.

627
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:14,153
I have birthday parties and soccer games and swim meets and dance recitals and

628
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:19,076
that those have nothing to do with games. And I want you to think if nothing else

629
00:38:19,596 --> 00:38:25,619
after this talk today the thing that I want you to think about is who are you

630
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:30,822
outside of games? Who are you beyond your projects? Are you comfortable with who

631
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:36,125
that person is? And like have you given time? Have you given that person space?

632
00:38:36,992 --> 00:38:39,434
to also be a complete person.

633
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:42,056
And that's work-life balance.

634
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:46,098
And we had to use process and documentation

635
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:50,001
and communication skills to put together

636
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:54,784
a laborious process for us to make room for that person

637
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:58,827
that wasn't Rebecca Saltzman, game developer,

638
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:01,348
Adam Saltzman, game designer.

639
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:05,131
We had to make room for the people who's Rebecca Saltzman,

640
00:39:05,231 --> 00:39:05,451
mom.

641
00:39:06,492 --> 00:39:11,593
you know, me, a dancer, me, a goofball who makes Halloween costumes for my kids. Like,

642
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:20,295
I had to make space for that. And I, we did that by making sure that Finji space belonged to Finji.

643
00:39:22,615 --> 00:39:26,256
Now, if you have any questions, you can feel free to reach out to me. I'm on the Twitters,

644
00:39:26,296 --> 00:39:31,837
and I don't shut my DMs. But yeah, feel free. Thank you for listening. I'm probably gonna

645
00:39:31,857 --> 00:39:33,158
be taking questions. Um,

646
00:39:34,168 --> 00:39:36,529
some place when this shows in about a month.

647
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:37,870
Thank you.

648
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,812
Hey there, on this beautiful day,

649
00:39:41,252 --> 00:39:44,394
I'm going to talk to you about how I manage my motivation

650
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:49,296
and deadlines whilst preventing myself from crunching,

651
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,978
even though I still remain productive and ambitious.

652
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:56,320
Small spoiler though, it's really hard.

653
00:39:57,674 --> 00:39:59,936
Before I dive into that, a quick minute about me.

654
00:40:00,637 --> 00:40:04,700
My name is Sanine Veldman and I make games and other forms of art here in Utrecht.

655
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:07,283
That's a cosy city in the centre of the Netherlands.

656
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:10,806
The best-known thing I've worked on is called Hidden Folks.

657
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:16,731
An interactive Where's Waldo, designed and created by Adrian De Jong and Sylvain Tegur.

658
00:40:17,612 --> 00:40:23,236
And I specifically worked on the last two levels, where I did the design and the interaction.

659
00:40:24,385 --> 00:40:30,550
I'm currently working on some personal projects and a Godlike card game called Similand.

660
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:32,472
But the second one!

661
00:40:33,873 --> 00:40:37,076
It's out in the open, but we haven't made an official announcement yet.

662
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:39,978
And I'm doing this together with my good friend Tymon.

663
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,921
He's the original creator and designer of the first Similand.

664
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:48,245
And in this project I do mainly the art and the design.

665
00:40:50,095 --> 00:40:54,038
I work on all my things in a co-working space with a bunch of great friends.

666
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,580
And the space is called Boomhut.

667
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:01,704
This is a really nice place where we can easily share ideas,

668
00:41:02,664 --> 00:41:05,626
talk about our work and also our work style.

669
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:10,250
So I've seen a lot of things there and I also have seen a lot of crunches.

670
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:15,574
I think to crunch is a very personal thing.

671
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,620
and it's hard to give a clear definition.

672
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:23,102
It kind of boils down to when you're working more hours in a day,

673
00:41:24,522 --> 00:41:28,003
or feeling more frequently tired or sad than usual,

674
00:41:30,904 --> 00:41:34,425
or when you constantly think about work and have a hard time stopping that.

675
00:41:35,185 --> 00:41:37,026
I would call that crunching.

676
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:40,367
It can have several reasons too.

677
00:41:41,007 --> 00:41:43,508
Most obviously, a deadly deadline.

678
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:50,515
or you perhaps really love what you're doing and it's hard to stop working or thinking about it.

679
00:41:51,996 --> 00:41:58,582
That's the one the one I struggle most with is an ambitious obligation to yourself

680
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:02,725
and the strong will to achieve something or make something great.

681
00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:11,758
And it's really easy to justify bad working habits when you're working on something you're very enthusiastic about,

682
00:42:12,298 --> 00:42:13,899
or you feel like you really need to.

683
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,660
And besides, how can being productive be a bad thing?

684
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,261
Well, let me give you some examples.

685
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:24,802
Let's start with my development experience with Hindenfos.

686
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,063
During the development I was allowed to have a very flexible development style,

687
00:42:30,603 --> 00:42:35,026
as Adrian De Jong is a very chill guy. And I was able to set my own deadlines,

688
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:39,349
and work at my own pace, and ship the game basically once it was ready.

689
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:46,293
So, especially towards the end, when all the fun parts had been done,

690
00:42:47,374 --> 00:42:52,597
I felt pressure building as time was passing by and my money was running out.

691
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:59,761
I remember working my late evenings, during my weekends and taking my laptop with me on my holidays.

692
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:06,003
And at some point I even went back to taking Ritalin, which is a drug that helps you concentrate.

693
00:43:06,723 --> 00:43:11,924
It works well, but I knew it also made me nervous, depressed and more socially anxious.

694
00:43:12,744 --> 00:43:13,805
So, yeah...

695
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:21,721
I also had moments when I was really deep into a project, like my website, and I really loved working on it.

696
00:43:22,242 --> 00:43:28,448
And I had a hard time stopping and thinking about it or doing other things.

697
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:35,315
Although making my website gave me quite some energy, it drained way more in the end.

698
00:43:36,175 --> 00:43:40,518
There was a moment, and actually several smaller ones,

699
00:43:41,178 --> 00:43:43,939
where I just lost all confidence in what I had done

700
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,181
and I really disliked the sight of my work.

701
00:43:47,561 --> 00:43:49,883
Looking back now, I did not take enough breaks

702
00:43:50,223 --> 00:43:53,865
and therefore didn't really have time to reflect on it.

703
00:43:54,705 --> 00:43:57,487
And being exhausted from continuously working

704
00:43:58,067 --> 00:43:59,608
did not help my mindset at all.

705
00:44:00,664 --> 00:44:05,006
If I had taken the distance I needed, I could have easily prevented these lower moments

706
00:44:05,566 --> 00:44:07,427
and stayed motivated towards the end.

707
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:13,969
Currently, things with Simulant go at a very chill pace.

708
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:17,771
Two reasons for that is that we just don't stress it.

709
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:27,094
Taimen and I really like a chill workflow and also Taimen has to release a game every four months.

710
00:44:28,048 --> 00:44:32,571
So that creates an obligated break in the development every...

711
00:44:33,651 --> 00:44:35,773
Did I say two? I mean four months.

712
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:42,597
So yeah, it creates a break, but it actually has been quite interesting and quite positively so.

713
00:44:43,798 --> 00:44:48,601
It gives us time to reflect and have a better perspective on the project.

714
00:44:49,241 --> 00:44:55,045
And therefore I think we made some better design choices and better art-related choices, in fact.

715
00:44:55,905 --> 00:45:01,508
I don't expect it to be completely crunch free, but I feel confident that it will manage

716
00:45:01,628 --> 00:45:02,669
any pressure quite well.

717
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:11,993
And then I have to be frank and honest, because being crunch free is really hard, like I said,

718
00:45:12,193 --> 00:45:13,354
even when you really want to.

719
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:20,917
And ironically, whilst making this talk, I've been actually experiencing a fresh little

720
00:45:20,977 --> 00:45:21,857
crunch just now.

721
00:45:22,872 --> 00:45:25,974
I really wanted to perform well and put a lot of pressure on myself.

722
00:45:26,715 --> 00:45:33,220
Besides, I really enjoy doing this. I've been working in evenings and in my free times and

723
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,905
not taking enough breaks for some part. So actually breaking most of the rules I

724
00:45:40,045 --> 00:45:47,811
had written in the first place. On top of that, I thought this recording was due

725
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:51,554
next week, the beginning of next week, but it was actually Friday.

726
00:45:52,687 --> 00:46:00,792
So what did I do? Nothing. I did nothing. So Tuesday I walked for several hours in a row.

727
00:46:01,372 --> 00:46:08,676
Then Wednesday I spent all time, all my time, or all the morning working at Boomhut because it's

728
00:46:08,717 --> 00:46:16,801
quite new and needs to be built still. And Thursday I went on to go climbing and work some other stuff.

729
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,182
So, yeah, when I was working, I made sure I was taking enough breaks.

730
00:46:24,123 --> 00:46:31,587
And that little distance every time allowed me to have a better reflection on all I'd written and drawn.

731
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:38,590
So, whether your continuous working style comes from a strong ambition, often like mine is,

732
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:42,732
or a crunching deadline, crushing deadline,

733
00:46:44,573 --> 00:46:47,255
or an enthusiasm for the work you're doing.

734
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:54,466
that makes it hard to stop, I present to you my ultimate list of things you can do.

735
00:46:55,687 --> 00:47:00,249
So the first thing I would say is you could keep track of your working hours.

736
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:04,852
I've been doing this for one and a half years and

737
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,507
I love this kind of data. It actually gave me a lot of insight on my behavior and style.

738
00:47:11,148 --> 00:47:18,038
Plus, it made me realize when I've been slacking off a bit, or actually working really hard when I felt I wasn't.

739
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:25,552
I do this in Google Sheets and you can do it precisely as precise as you want, but in

740
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:30,815
the end it's going to give you an overview of how many hours you work on something, what

741
00:47:30,835 --> 00:47:35,378
hours you tend to start and stop, and how efficient you're working.

742
00:47:36,879 --> 00:47:39,100
And that's also when you're making over hours.

743
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:43,162
So I'm not the only one who does this.

744
00:47:43,562 --> 00:47:48,765
I actually got the idea by being inspired by my other game developer friends.

745
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:52,958
Everyone that I know who does this would totally recommend it.

746
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:59,904
It really helps with other things too, like making it easier to start working

747
00:48:00,584 --> 00:48:02,746
and making sure you have enough breaks.

748
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:10,892
Then another tip I have for you is guard your weekends and evenings with your life.

749
00:48:11,873 --> 00:48:16,837
Seriously, I hear this over and over again and it's a very important thing to safeguard.

750
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,382
Keep at least one hour before bed, solely for relaxing purposes,

751
00:48:23,643 --> 00:48:27,706
because you need time to wind down from your day and get a good rest.

752
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:31,488
Not doing that will exhaust you very, very quickly.

753
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:36,712
Then a thing you could do is work out a bit, you lazy bastards.

754
00:48:37,452 --> 00:48:40,835
I myself love to work, well, love to bother,

755
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:44,297
no matter what deadline or how deep I'm into my work.

756
00:48:45,146 --> 00:48:50,193
I go two or three times a week, not because I'm a very fit or active person.

757
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:51,976
Believe me, I'm not.

758
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:57,884
But I found that it really helps my mind to get off things.

759
00:48:58,205 --> 00:49:00,889
And it's really nice for stress relief.

760
00:49:01,886 --> 00:49:08,947
So it also keeps you healthy and some other more smart people would tell you that's healthy too.

761
00:49:09,688 --> 00:49:19,510
So yeah, you could work out a bit and it doesn't really matter if you like to climb, run, swim

762
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:25,231
or try at least to walk an hour a day and I'll tell you it helps a lot.

763
00:49:26,371 --> 00:49:31,052
And then what I find the most important one is to take breaks.

764
00:49:32,164 --> 00:49:35,066
Maybe every hour, but at least every two.

765
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:40,109
Go outside for a walk, make yourself some tea, coffee,

766
00:49:40,649 --> 00:49:44,071
or in the evenings play a game, watch a series at night, read a book,

767
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:45,332
find what works for you.

768
00:49:46,012 --> 00:49:49,054
But this not only gives your mind time to calm down,

769
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:53,157
but it gives you a fresh look on your work when you're restarting it

770
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,798
and dive back into it.

771
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:04,503
If you still feel stress and you find yourself not relaxing and still working it out in your

772
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:07,344
mind, it still helps a lot.

773
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:14,347
And when things are really bad and you have a really, really hard time relaxing, try to

774
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:21,110
go back to being in the moment, look at small things around you, try to listen to the noises

775
00:50:21,631 --> 00:50:26,253
and that helps me relax in even some really hard days.

776
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:33,865
And on top of taking breaks being good for a busy mind,

777
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,946
it's also most important for your work too,

778
00:50:38,966 --> 00:50:43,587
as it resets your focus and opens up space for a new idea

779
00:50:44,227 --> 00:50:48,188
and gives the necessary break for your mind, preventing total exhaustion.

780
00:50:49,128 --> 00:50:53,209
So I've been practicing these tactics for quite some time now.

781
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:58,719
And although it's hard to remain totally crunch free, I think it's very possible.

782
00:50:59,419 --> 00:51:03,161
And I hope you try one of these tips and you'll find them useful.

783
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:08,403
Anything? Anyway, it's time to take a break now.

784
00:51:09,223 --> 00:51:10,604
I think I'll leave these for you.

785
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:13,225
And take good care.

786
00:51:13,765 --> 00:51:15,386
And thank you for listening.
