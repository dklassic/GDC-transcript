00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:10,545
Hello and welcome to this Ask Me Anything session

2
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:12,947
on hopping and skipping your way into last place

3
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:13,928
with Zaire Lanier.

4
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:16,490
Zaire, thank you so much for making time

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,371
to chat with me today.

6
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:20,914
We're gonna have a chat room here with polls and stuff,

7
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:23,756
so folks who are in chat, please just feel free

8
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:26,218
to say hi and ask whatever questions you want.

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,800
Upvote ones you really wanna hear the answer to,

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,081
and we're gonna hear all about how,

11
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:34,044
and what Zaire has learned in her freelance career.

12
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:35,906
But first of all, Zaire, could you tell everyone?

13
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,107
through who you are and what you've been up to this year.

14
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:41,148
Yeah, I'm Zaire.

15
00:00:41,168 --> 00:00:43,209
I was a IGDA scholar for 2020.

16
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,391
So I was having to go to GDC and then, you know,

17
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:48,571
everything happened.

18
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:52,752
So during quarantine, I wrote a comic

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,473
and started a comic Kickstarter.

20
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:59,195
And I was asking for 5K and ended up somewhere around 80K.

21
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:00,755
And then shortly after that,

22
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:03,997
I got hired at Unknown Worlds on Somatica Below Zero.

23
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,603
So I feel a little funny doing this chat because I no longer feel like I'm in last place, but I did

24
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:17,388
spend a pretty significant time there. And in last place I feel like you find quite a lot of

25
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:23,052
community there, and I think that's something that's very important to work towards when you're

26
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:27,456
trying to enter the video game industry. Yeah, I was gonna say, this is last place,

27
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:32,240
you're making it look pretty good. We're reaching here in chat, people are still saying hi, so let's

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:32,761
talk about...

29
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:40,242
Sort of the journey, even in that short month or two between, you know, getting together, sort of think through this talk, things started happening for you.

30
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:46,765
What changed? What happened that really sort of kickstarted your jump into the industry?

31
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:57,630
Um, I think it was making a point to try to insert myself into the community, not in like an aggressive way.

32
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,391
But I want to be a writer and narrative designer.

33
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:02,712
So I found someone.

34
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:05,393
relatively famous as a writer and narrative designer.

35
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:08,994
And I literally went and followed probably two thirds of the people they

36
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:13,175
followed. Cause I didn't know any other way to find those people.

37
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:17,556
It's not like something I feel like you easily Google. Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:22,277
And then eventually I started seeing people pop up and having conversations.

39
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:24,517
And so, you know, you have the people like,

40
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:28,338
like the really big people who've been in it and they have like successes and

41
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:31,838
their names are well known. Like say like a, like a Mary Kitty or like a,

42
00:02:32,966 --> 00:03:00,595
Someone like that, but then, you know, those people have their own communities and they've already kind of done their time, so to say, in my opinion, and they're having some success and you want to look for the people who are in the same spot you are, because those are the people who when they get a job as studio, and someone recommends them, then they say, oh, this person was helping me like edit my twine stories or I looked at their stuff and I know they're actually like pretty cool so you kind of get

43
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,580
You start creating these connections in different places.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,381
So I'm like, you know, I've got friends all over the world.

45
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,221
Well, Twitter friends, but I consider, you know, some of them

46
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:10,381
pretty close friends at this point.

47
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:15,922
You really, even though you're like in last place, because, you know, I sent

48
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:20,563
out a bunch of applications over the past three or four years, I feel like I really

49
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:22,264
found kind of like my niche of people.

50
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:26,644
And I feel like that's almost more important in the long run

51
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:28,525
than like immediate successes.

52
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:30,757
Yeah, I mean, I think you're right.

53
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:35,039
It's really sounds like a more sustainable and enjoyable way to pursue a career in games.

54
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:43,381
So, yeah, I think I think it's a common that's a common learning that we we hear often, especially places like GDC and especially recently where,

55
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:52,263
you know, it can really burn you to not to not like get to not work with your peers and get to know your colleagues and all kind of like.

56
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:56,156
work together, it can sort of isolate you from the industry and isolate you from your peer group

57
00:03:56,576 --> 00:04:03,141
if you only chase the established game industry veterans who are fantastic, but you know, at

58
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:08,324
different stages in their career. So, you know, is this a good example of how you got your recent

59
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:15,249
gig writing on Subnautica, or was that kind of a different way in? I think so. I think my

60
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:19,712
Kickstarter really helped with that, and I think my Kickstarter

61
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,721
succeeded as much as it did in part because over the past couple years I had tried to create a little community

62
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:30,523
and I was supportive of other people's works and I feel like

63
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:37,565
people are more likely to be supportive of your work if they see you also, you know, sharing and retweeting other people's things

64
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:41,386
hyping up people who are, you know, doing something new and interesting

65
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:43,607
and being an overall like

66
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:50,289
nice encouraging person in a like a genuine way because I think people can definitely sense when you're like

67
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:54,126
only interacting with them to get something for yourself.

68
00:04:54,907 --> 00:05:00,012
Because I'm sure that it happens a lot just due to the nature of the industry.

69
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:04,397
Like, you know, there's only so many spots and, you know, a ton of people want to get in.

70
00:05:04,697 --> 00:05:04,838
So.

71
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:09,576
Yeah, it's always striking, especially in narrative and design, how small the industry

72
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:14,179
really is for how big it is globally and how important stuff like this can prove over the

73
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:14,480
years.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,842
I have lots more questions, but folks in the chat are finally coming up with some good

75
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:18,042
ones.

76
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:21,024
And by all means, if anyone has any questions for Zaire, please throw them in.

77
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,445
We're going to get to as many as we can today.

78
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:24,907
Yori right off the bat had a good one here.

79
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:25,827
Excuse me, Tori.

80
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:30,811
Tori asks, how did you work to build your writing and narrative design portfolio before

81
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:31,931
you were hired by a studio?

82
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:42,069
Um for for building my portfolio I ended up some of those like higher up people actually they had

83
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,173
like guides and stuff that you can um like on the websites that I looked up Greg Buchanan's I think

84
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:53,457
Mary Kinney had one um a couple other people whose last names I can't remember so I don't just want

85
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:58,560
to like blurt them out but I literally looked over as many of those as I could and some of those

86
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,643
people would you know if they say hey I have a couple minutes to chat about

87
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:05,295
people who want to enter the industry, you know, talking to them.

88
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:09,817
But what I ended up doing, um, almost universally, everyone said, make a twine

89
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:13,359
game, because it, it's something you can do yourself.

90
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:16,060
You don't need to know any kind of coding necessarily.

91
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,162
You don't need to have any skills really, other than clicking a button and typing.

92
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:23,483
Um, and then doing different genres.

93
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:25,184
I started doing game jams.

94
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:27,425
Uh, itch.io was really good for that.

95
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:30,447
Um, when I first was starting out, I probably was doing like.

96
00:06:31,234 --> 00:06:34,777
to game jams a month for like six months to a year.

97
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:38,401
Did you experiment with other stuff, other engines?

98
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:41,684
Um, with the game jams, I got paired with a team.

99
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:46,829
So I got lucky cause I mean, in the art and not most of them,

100
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,831
I would say didn't even like work out.

101
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:53,675
Like someone would like just decide not to, and then the team would fall apart.

102
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:57,078
But I ended up making, I ended up making, um,

103
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:01,570
I think like two or three small games, and then you can put those in the portfolio.

104
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,593
And those, I think, show that you can work with a team and that you're at least trying.

105
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:13,896
Someone told me if you have a portfolio, you're probably ahead of 80 to 90% of the people

106
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:18,118
out there already who just like want to enter the game industry, but haven't done any work

107
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,700
to show why they should be in it.

108
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,200
Absolutely.

109
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:24,141
It's frustrating to hear that.

110
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,954
Oh, perhaps not surprising that game jams have the same problem as school projects do.

111
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:29,934
Yeah.

112
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:32,456
Someone's not going to do any of the work and someone else is going to do the rest of

113
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:32,596
it.

114
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:38,641
One of my game jams, someone has to drop out literally because they got like attacked by

115
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,221
a machete.

116
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:41,002
Like we didn't hear from him for like two months.

117
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:41,823
Oh my god.

118
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:41,923
Okay.

119
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:42,243
I mean, that's...

120
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:47,207
He was like, he was like, Oh, I still, I still want to do the programming, but I got attacked

121
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:47,747
by a machete.

122
00:07:47,787 --> 00:07:51,450
So I was like in the hospital and my family was like looking for the guy that did it.

123
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,871
And we ended up finishing the game.

124
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:59,430
I think that was my very first game jam, so I've had some like really random experiences with a few of my game jams.

125
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:03,833
Yeah, Attack by Machete is like a definite get-out-of-jam-free card for sure.

126
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:04,594
For sure.

127
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:09,958
Let me just turn away from Blade of Weapons here for a second. Nathaniel has a question.

128
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:13,240
So how did you go about contacting people specifically?

129
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,463
I still find myself trying to get the attention of people above me to know success.

130
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:18,724
How can I grab their attention?

131
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,136
And I think, you know, not just people above you, because I think there was part of that

132
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:26,139
where you were really suggesting that you sort of raise up your peers.

133
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:29,822
But how do you get in touch with people who seem out of reach, like, you know, whether

134
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,844
they're on your level or above it, they've got their own projects, they've got their

135
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:37,028
own communities, what's a respectable, polite way to reach out, do you think?

136
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,390
I think I mostly did it through Twitter.

137
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:46,435
And like I said, every once in a while, someone would say, hey, I'm taking on a mentor or

138
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:47,056
something.

139
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:52,796
You can schedule a time to talk with me about your resume or your cover letter.

140
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:57,058
And I think it's kind of scouring Twitter for opportunities, almost.

141
00:08:57,558 --> 00:09:05,440
Every day I was searching, looking for plus narrative designer or various iterations of

142
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,401
that to look for people who were in need of story writers.

143
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:12,783
And I also found that a lot of discords have overlapped.

144
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:18,958
Like, every time I join a Discord, I feel like there's at least seven other people from another Discord that I know.

145
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,503
Because I feel like I've been doing some stuff for games, comics, and TTRPGs.

146
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:31,628
And, I don't know, I just feel like there's an overlap in the community because they're all kind of small.

147
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:35,331
I mean, they're all big, but all small at the same time.

148
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:38,633
And a lot of people who have, like, similar interests, so, you know.

149
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:43,687
A lot of game designers played Dungeons & Dragons, and I know at least two or three people who

150
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:45,408
introduced me to Dungeons & Dragons.

151
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:46,188
Nice.

152
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:51,991
And then I found someone who helped me get some writing for a prompt.

153
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:59,134
A lot of it, I don't know, it's hard to say exactly because for every person it's different

154
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:03,997
and every situation is different, but a lot of people are quite nice and if you approach

155
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,078
them in a professional manner.

156
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:10,271
Like a lot of people have like maybe their email on their website.

157
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:14,134
If they say that, unless they say, you know, professional only.

158
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:17,957
But a lot of people are willing, I think, to help other people.

159
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:21,720
Not too many people so far who were like

160
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,382
very stingy with how they got into the industry.

161
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:25,743
Yeah, I agree.

162
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,685
I don't know if that answered the question well, but.

163
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,927
I think you did. Yeah, absolutely.

164
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:33,829
I mean, you know, just my own experience as a as a writer

165
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:36,592
and as a writer about the industry, not on games.

166
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:44,129
Folks have been sort of very willing to, you know, reach out, talk about their work, and talk about, you know, how they got to where they are.

167
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:47,690
I've only ever seen people really start to get tired of...

168
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:58,635
There's this trend of game design classes and game development classes, like, asking students to contact devs to, like, do interviews and stuff, and I think that can be challenging.

169
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:02,937
But for peers in the industry and colleagues, absolutely, that sounds totally legit.

170
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:06,001
Let's see, there's a bunch of good questions here.

171
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,822
I want to get a good one that we missed.

172
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:09,864
Andy asks, how do you manage looking

173
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:10,985
for entry-level positions?

174
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:12,726
But most of the qualifications wants

175
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,688
you to have five or more years of experience

176
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:17,290
or and AAA titles under your belt.

177
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,236
I think that one is just, to some extent, it is what it is.

178
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:26,197
It's systemic.

179
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:29,159
Like, I don't think there's personally anything

180
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,762
that we can do to change that.

181
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:37,946
Um, you know, I, I can't go to Riot and be like, Hey, now that's a really

182
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:41,148
unreasonable qualifications or something.

183
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:41,668
You know what I mean?

184
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,451
I can't, I can't go to any studio and say, you know, I think you should change this.

185
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,774
But I think as more people get into the industry and as more people make it known,

186
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:55,499
um, that those qualifications are often prohibitive for a lot of groups of people.

187
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,901
Um, I know a lot of people said just apply anyway.

188
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:02,304
Uh, and that's kind of all you can do in some respects.

189
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:11,618
The job I got now at Subnautica, actually someone recommended me for, and I think that goes back to the idea of community.

190
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:27,573
You aren't necessarily going to stand out just just starting out in like a sea of applications. But if you're in the community you're helping people, you're putting out small twine games you're doing game jams you're like, contributing to different things

191
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:29,114
in the community. I think that

192
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:32,663
is where you get those kind of like opportunities.

193
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:34,624
And I know those opportunities aren't,

194
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:37,165
they're not numerous.

195
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:38,085
Yeah.

196
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,386
There aren't a lot of, you know, junior positions,

197
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:42,246
especially for writers and narrative designers.

198
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:45,847
And when they do pop up, like, you know,

199
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:48,268
it's like a thousand retweets and, you know,

200
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:52,750
like 2000 likes, there's just a lot of people pounce on it.

201
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,531
And that's, I mean, that's just kind of the reality of it.

202
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:58,032
But I really think that

203
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:06,545
It's just persistence. I know someone told me they applied to something like 92 jobs before they landed a job.

204
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:07,645
Great studio.

205
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:09,586
Was that in game writing?

206
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,726
No, I think it was for production.

207
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:14,167
Oh yeah.

208
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:19,948
But I know that's probably not comforting, but it's at least what I've experienced.

209
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:23,929
And, you know, do stuff with your friends.

210
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:27,642
I know my friends, a couple of them did like a pretty cool game jam.

211
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:31,565
They made like some stuff and now it's sitting in their portfolio and apply for

212
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:34,947
those different like mentorships. If you can, it's like I said, it's not,

213
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:39,550
it's not easy. Um, I'm still amazed I'm here to be honest.

214
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,992
Um, but that's, that's, that's my advice.

215
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:46,214
I'll be here for a long time to come. What, what do you, what,

216
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:48,835
what do you think about cover letters? You know,

217
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:50,516
I mentioned you probably sent out a few in your day.

218
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:54,259
I don't know. I don't, I really struggle with cover letters.

219
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,411
Like I get it, but also like, I don't know, it feels a little bit like...

220
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:01,111
You think anybody reads it?

221
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:05,412
I'll like beg for it, like I don't know, flatter this company.

222
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,872
But like I kind of understand them.

223
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:15,094
Um, I don't know, I almost feel like, I don't know, like a resume and then like samples

224
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:19,354
should speak for themselves and the cover letters maybe like, hey we're between these

225
00:14:19,374 --> 00:14:20,655
like five candidates.

226
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:24,095
You know, I don't know, I just, it feels, it's just irritating I guess.

227
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:31,486
Because it's so labor-intensive, I understand they're necessary, but like, I don't think anyone actually likes them.

228
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,148
And if they are, I don't know, they're probably like an alien in disguise or something.

229
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:37,049
There's a necessary evil, I feel like.

230
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:41,531
Yeah, it's hard to pour out your heart and soul like 92 times in three months.

231
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:47,173
It's a lot. Anyone in chat is a hiring position or that kind of stuff?

232
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:50,135
Please tell me why cover letters are still a thing.

233
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:54,077
There's also some good questions in here. Let me scroll back up a little bit.

234
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,131
Oh my gosh, my eyes are going, forgive me.

235
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:57,811
I think it's Rue here who asks,

236
00:14:57,871 --> 00:14:59,812
what are most important social platforms

237
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,392
for reaching out and finding communities

238
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:02,772
and making connections as a newcomer?

239
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:04,733
We've already talked about Twitter and Discord.

240
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:06,473
Were there any other places you found real value

241
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:07,353
or are those kind of the main ones?

242
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:07,953
Not really.

243
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:11,574
Twitter and Discord were like,

244
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:14,235
Facebook groups are kind of like,

245
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:16,135
for me, they felt like the wild west.

246
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:17,416
Yeah.

247
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:18,656
And so I just was like,

248
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:20,897
oh, I should get back out of here.

249
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:24,798
But yeah, I think Twitter and Discord were the ones that like,

250
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:31,142
I found the most community. I found like, start running into the same people and comments about

251
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:36,165
like the same ideas. And then I even feel like I learned a little bit about other disciplines.

252
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:43,110
Like obviously I'll never be an expert in like 3D art, but like seeing how things work in like

253
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,293
when they post a thread about the work they did on a certain game, I like get a little bit of

254
00:15:47,353 --> 00:15:48,854
understanding about the work and like.

255
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,546
effort that goes into other disciplines.

256
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:54,046
And I don't know, it's just been really interesting.

257
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:56,327
I feel like Twitter gave me like a full,

258
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:59,907
like a more full experience that I wouldn't have gotten

259
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,908
just like trying to do it on my own.

260
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,928
Yeah, I totally agree.

261
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:05,168
I mean, without Twitter, we'd never know

262
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:07,009
what frustum culling is.

263
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:09,209
Let me scroll up here.

264
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:11,670
A lot of good questions, a lot of fun ones.

265
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,470
This is a quick one I want to get onto.

266
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,411
So we were talking about all the jobs you applied for

267
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:17,551
relatively recently.

268
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:20,880
Jonathan wants to know how wide of a geographical region,

269
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,321
well, excuse me, region, were those jobs you applied for?

270
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:25,801
Like, how do you, during your job search, how do you,

271
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:30,362
how do you choose how far, how wide of a net to cast?

272
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:32,623
Is it just in your city, in your state,

273
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:33,683
is it anywhere you're working?

274
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:36,044
Oh, I definitely looked, like, internationally,

275
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:38,085
especially if I live in the Midwest,

276
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:41,165
and there's a little bit of a gaming industry

277
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:42,246
start kind of popping up,

278
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:44,927
but no one really looking for narrative designers.

279
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:51,874
So, I mean, West Coast, obviously, because that's, you know, gaming mecca, I guess.

280
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:53,836
For the best coast.

281
00:16:54,396 --> 00:17:00,240
Right. And then just kind of anywhere that said, you know, remote jobs, like, available.

282
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:05,584
I guess if you don't have, like, a wife and kids and, like, your family's there,

283
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:10,188
if you're willing to move to, like, another country, then that's an option, too.

284
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:14,190
I know Canada has some really good gaming studios.

285
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:14,791
Yeah.

286
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,932
It's probably an easier move than moving to Sweden or something.

287
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:24,395
But, I mean, honestly, I applied to anything that looked pretty reasonable.

288
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:32,579
You know, like I said, I don't have a family or kids or anything like that, that would be...

289
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:37,862
Yeah, it does seem like this industry, more than most, often requires travel.

290
00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:42,964
And strangely, I mean, it's been interesting during this whole pandemic, this global lockdown.

291
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:49,578
Watching the industry rapidly adapt to, you know, like full company wide work from home setups.

292
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:55,459
And I kind of hope that that leads to a general shift in the industry where folks can do remote work.

293
00:17:55,479 --> 00:18:00,340
My girlfriend's like looking at me because I was I said the thing about moving and she's like, really?

294
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,421
Yeah, you shouldn't have to move if you don't want to.

295
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:08,402
I mean, if you're just writing sentences into a spreadsheet or whatever, you should be able to send that off.

296
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:10,702
But what do I know?

297
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:19,529
All right, there's another question here from Katerina who wanted to know, I think a fun general question, what inspired you to pursue your current profession?

298
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:32,518
Um, honestly, I went to, when I went to college, I like super struggled. I graduated in 2010. I just will be graduating this year.

299
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:38,762
And I felt like I was doing a lot of things that I felt other people wanted me to do.

300
00:18:39,427 --> 00:18:42,008
And so when I finally just kind of like sat down and was like, well,

301
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:44,688
what do I like and what am I like good at?

302
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,689
I kept coming back to writing and video games.

303
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:53,030
The first video game story I remember like that really had a impact on me was

304
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,210
Knights of the Old Republic.

305
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,851
Nice choice.

306
00:18:56,331 --> 00:19:00,852
Yeah. My grandmother bought an old Xbox and I stayed up to like four

307
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:01,792
in the morning playing it.

308
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:06,273
I finished it. My mind was like, like it was just like crazy to me.

309
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,573
And I was like, I want to like replicate that feeling.

310
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,413
I bought a PS3 when I was like 20 or something.

311
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:19,278
I don't know, it was some sketchy Craigslist buy that I bought in some alley somewhere.

312
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:25,243
And I kept getting Dragon Age, The Last of Us, Mass Effect, and I really started getting

313
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:26,484
into story-driven games.

314
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:32,188
And so I was like, well, I'm failing at everything else, so I might as well try to fail at something

315
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:32,488
I like.

316
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,770
And that was really what inspired me.

317
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,339
to try to like get into it.

318
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,460
I really enjoyed those stories and the interactivity of them.

319
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:44,882
And I wanted to try to make worlds and games myself.

320
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:50,444
Yeah, I wonder now that you're creating, how do you look at that appeal

321
00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:53,865
of enmeshing yourself in a narrative and making decisions?

322
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:55,706
Because I was about to ask, like, oh, what is it about,

323
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:59,427
you know, games that made you pursue creativity there

324
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:01,347
rather than films or art or anywhere else?

325
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,788
But now that you're actually doing it, how do you.

326
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,120
How do you think about designing choices into story?

327
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,102
How do you think about designing a story for a game?

328
00:20:11,863 --> 00:20:13,044
If that's not too broad.

329
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:14,104
No, I...

330
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:16,026
It's a lot.

331
00:20:16,446 --> 00:20:22,029
It's a lot different than writing a short story or a novel.

332
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,931
Because you have to deal with player agency.

333
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:26,032
You have to deal with...

334
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:29,975
You only have so much space to make people feel something.

335
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:41,329
You know, like you don't generally have huge paragraphs unless maybe you're reading like a like a lower sample or something like you only have and then you know, you get the people who just like skip everything.

336
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:57,081
So I think, for me, I've been learning that narrative design is more than just like the words it's also like the things you see in the environment, it's like the mechanics that play in everything and I'm learning how they kind of all mesh together.

337
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:57,181
Yeah.

338
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,719
Definitely very new at it.

339
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:07,824
Um, like I I feel like I'm constantly learning and like will probably always be learning.

340
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:13,229
Um, but I'm learning that it's a lot more complex than just like make this sound pretty.

341
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:19,194
You know, you're you're working with a whole team of people to make something happen and

342
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:24,258
they all have to like all the gears have to fit into each other to make the machine go.

343
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,780
That's and that's something I'm getting used to.

344
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,661
Nice.

345
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:29,680
I mean, that's why I think your perspective is so valuable.

346
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,160
I mean, you have fresh eyes on this.

347
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:34,041
You're just, you know, not just starting out,

348
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:34,982
but just taking off.

349
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:36,442
And you have these two projects,

350
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:37,903
one where you're working with a team,

351
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:38,903
and the other one you sort of have,

352
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:41,164
it sounds like, creative control and direction.

353
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:43,185
Because it's your own thing.

354
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:43,965
Yeah.

355
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:48,647
So, what I'm curious to know is,

356
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:50,328
and there's so many good questions in the chat

357
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:52,129
that I just kind of lost my train of thought,

358
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:54,730
but I sort of want to sort of pick apart how you...

359
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:58,339
What you're learning from having that dual approach to,

360
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:00,259
oh, here's something you're creating on your own,

361
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,080
pretty much, kind of like a twine game,

362
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,700
and then here's this project you're working on with a team

363
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,520
where I assume you, and you can tell me,

364
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,461
whether you have specific deadlines to hit,

365
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:09,461
specific targets to hit,

366
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:11,561
specific things you need to achieve.

367
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:17,002
How do you switch modes when you're changing projects

368
00:22:17,022 --> 00:22:20,583
to go from lead creative to team member?

369
00:22:21,763 --> 00:22:23,243
Well, a Kickstarter is.

370
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:29,431
I don't want to say I'm just writing because it's a comic, but like the writing is a part

371
00:22:29,472 --> 00:22:35,596
of it, but like people read comics for the kickass, you know.

372
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:43,481
And so a lot of it for me has been like trusting the artists, like I give them a rough idea

373
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:47,564
of what I want this panel to happen, what I want to happen in this panel.

374
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:52,348
And then I just kind of watch them do the magic.

375
00:22:54,014 --> 00:23:02,761
Like it's, it's really interesting and it's honestly really humbling because it's like a completely different skill set, but it's like absolutely necessary to what I'm doing.

376
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:16,692
And so, you know, I'll do like concept art and stuff but it's, I really like being kind of creatively, because they like, I have an idea and we but we discussed it as a team I try not to be like too overbearing.

377
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:19,314
I don't think anyone wants to be like.

378
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:28,297
Oh, she won't let me, like, what's the point of having an artist and like, that's their life if I'm not going to trust them to like, bring my vision to life.

379
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:40,064
And it's, it's really paid off because every time they send a page. I'm like, oh my god, I'm so like, that's so good. Like, thank you. Like, like, like I'm bowing down to you. This is amazing. And then with the

380
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:48,509
Working on Subnautica, my writing process has always been super chaotic. Like I have notes on this envelope. I have notes on a post-it note over here, like

381
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:52,274
It's two in the morning and I just wrote two pages.

382
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:56,858
And then, you know, the project lead will be like, where's your stuff?

383
00:23:56,878 --> 00:23:59,941
And I'm like, oh, oh, it's in, it's scattered here.

384
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:01,943
And they're like, okay, but like, I can't see it.

385
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:07,988
So like, like adjusting my process that I've always done to working with a team

386
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:10,910
is like, it's taking me a little bit, but it's also really rewarding

387
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,073
because then it's like, I get pretty quick feedback, you know,

388
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,894
I get to read other people's stuff.

389
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,074
It's.

390
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,504
You get to kind of like jump around a little bit.

391
00:24:19,704 --> 00:24:20,725
It's nice, but it's-

392
00:24:20,765 --> 00:24:24,628
That cherished, like shipped a game experience point

393
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,369
on your resume.

394
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:26,370
Yeah.

395
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:27,651
Wait, what?

396
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:29,572
Oh, I was just making a bad joke.

397
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:30,693
I was saying after the end of this,

398
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:32,015
you get this cherished,

399
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,417
like the thing so many would-be game devs are searching for

400
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:38,260
is like that experience on shipping an actual game

401
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,141
and working with a team.

402
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:42,904
Yeah, I can't like deny that I'm very, very,

403
00:24:43,044 --> 00:24:44,405
very excited about that.

404
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:44,945
Nice.

405
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:46,187
Very excited.

406
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,670
That's fantastic.

407
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:49,791
I got away from the questions here,

408
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:50,932
so I'm going to come back, you guys.

409
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,293
Let's see.

410
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:56,195
There was a really good question that followed up on Jonathan's.

411
00:24:56,956 --> 00:24:57,496
And here it is.

412
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,197
So, Sydney wants to know,

413
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,778
can you work remotely in this industry

414
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:03,059
or still mainly in person?

415
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,740
And I want to ask this because things are changing

416
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,781
so rapidly right now.

417
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:08,822
And you just recently, you know, were on the job.

418
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,303
So, I'm curious to hear your perspective.

419
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:11,644
Like, did you see a lot of employers

420
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:13,625
who really wanted you to come into the office

421
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,867
or was there more openness to remote work?

422
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:46,326
Um, I, the jobs that I applied to were at the time, mostly like, you know, you need to like come to the office and then COVID hit. And I started seeing a lot more remote work or people had to move to that city, but they still were working from home. So Nautica is like a whole company is remote. So we have people from like all over doing like zoom meetings and stuff. I'm hoping that the industry, I mean, it's kind of

423
00:25:46,670 --> 00:26:12,396
I think it's proven somewhat that you can do some remote work. I don't know how, I'm sure some of them studies on it on like whether it's efficient or not, but I think it's showing that's like even if it's partially remote like you only have to come in like two or three days a week, or, you know, something like that I think the industry can change to accommodate more and I hope that's something that does come out of this terrible pandemic.

424
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:14,417
Yeah, I think so too, for sure.

425
00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:17,867
We have about four minutes left in this talk.

426
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:19,647
I'm sorry to mention earlier folks in chat.

427
00:26:20,108 --> 00:26:21,248
If you got any questions, get them out.

428
00:26:21,268 --> 00:26:23,208
We'll try to burn through them as fast as we can here.

429
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,609
I'm gonna put some ones in.

430
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:27,010
I wanna get to Adana's question if you got a second.

431
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,270
Adana wants to know,

432
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,370
what does the day-to-day look like

433
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,971
when you're doing narrative design in games?

434
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:33,632
Is it a lot of collaboration or is it working on your own

435
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,112
or does it depend on the team?

436
00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:35,832
So this is kind of like,

437
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,474
let's dig more into your experience,

438
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,134
switching between your own project

439
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,155
and working for the team at Subnautica.

440
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:46,690
I'm just curious, how does your day break down typically?

441
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,811
And sort of how do you structure it

442
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:54,213
to be able to serve both those needs?

443
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,834
My Kickstarter is definitely more hands-off.

444
00:26:57,194 --> 00:26:58,895
Like I just kind of send in the script pages

445
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:01,936
and then they give me like the art

446
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:03,796
and then I might give some feedback

447
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:06,057
and then they change it and I say, oh, that's great.

448
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:07,998
It's not as intensive.

449
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:10,299
It might get more so with the closer we get

450
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,899
to shipping out the first issue of the comic.

451
00:27:13,277 --> 00:27:18,481
But for now, it's pretty, I wouldn't say chill, but it's definitely not like something that's very stressful.

452
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:26,727
Subnautica, since it's the whole company's remote, there's two, there's like weekly meetings, two a

453
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:31,591
week, I think. And then each department, like I know the narrative one, I have one with a meeting

454
00:27:31,611 --> 00:27:38,076
with my person on Tuesdays. And then we have a myriad of online tools that we can comment and we

455
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,457
can send links in that we can.

456
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:42,283
like comments like, oh, I finished this section.

457
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:43,304
Can you take a look at it?

458
00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:46,846
So it's kind of like a constant interaction,

459
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,086
but it's very like loose.

460
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,807
It's not like super strict.

461
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,488
I can't speak for other studios

462
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:53,249
because this is definitely my first studio,

463
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:56,290
but for me, it's been pretty pleasant and like,

464
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:57,831
pretty pleasant.

465
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:02,934
I've heard similar things from small teams,

466
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:06,295
you know, 10 people, 20 people, 30 people, less sometimes.

467
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,596
Often seem to have a lot of success working remote,

468
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:08,857
whereas.

469
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,101
Larger companies I see here have stuff less.

470
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:12,761
All right, one last question before we go.

471
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,743
I wanted to get to the pay question.

472
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:17,124
There was a good question about pay.

473
00:28:17,624 --> 00:28:19,465
Adana, nope, forgive me, Adana,

474
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:20,506
we already asked that question.

475
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:22,707
Here we go.

476
00:28:23,107 --> 00:28:23,827
I want to give credit.

477
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:26,069
Salvatore asks, how did you handle pay rates

478
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:26,989
when you were starting out?

479
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:28,770
What's a reasonable range for folks breaking

480
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,711
into the industry to ask for

481
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:32,752
when the job ad asks you for a rate?

482
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:33,853
Now, I don't expect you to have.

483
00:28:34,794 --> 00:28:41,799
A knowledgeable answer about this because, you know, who knows what they think that job is worth. But how did you navigate this challenge when you were looking for your first gig?

484
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:54,108
Um, a lot of people. I know I did. I had several friends like yell at me over the internet, because I think when you're starting out, you tend to undercharge yourself.

485
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:55,029
Yeah, low ball.

486
00:28:55,229 --> 00:29:01,654
I was charging, I think 15 an hour. And one of my friends was like, that's like, absolutely unacceptable. And I was like,

487
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:18,432
I'll work on it and you and you want to kind of diminish yourself because you want those jobs like you want a mobile, you really want that, like, credit to get your portfolio. But, um, I think, valuing yourself and your time especially if you're a freelancer.

488
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:29,721
You don't get health insurance, you don't get any kind of benefits, you don't, and you have to like pay taxes directly on your paycheck yourself. Yeah, a lot.

489
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:30,461
Someone told me.

490
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,382
Do like all your expenses for the year, figure out what that is.

491
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:40,845
And then I can't remember what it was, but it was something like three times that.

492
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:45,848
So like, like if you're charging yourself 15 an hour, take out what you would for taxes, blah, blah.

493
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:47,890
And maybe you'll end up at like 45 an hour.

494
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:58,156
And I know a lot of people in like art, writing, music, tend to undercharge themselves just because it's, it feels very saturated.

495
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,516
But I found that when I raised my rates, I got a higher quality of client.

496
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:08,417
Um, just because they're more likely to see that, like, especially if you have a

497
00:30:08,437 --> 00:30:14,299
good portfolio, they are willing to pay for good writing as opposed to just like

498
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:19,300
some random person who's like, you know, 10, $15 isn't really that much, but

499
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,601
someone willing to like, Hey, I want to pay $35 an hour for eight hours.

500
00:30:23,641 --> 00:30:26,862
That's someone that, you know, is probably a lot more serious about the project.

501
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:35,074
Thank you right so yeah that's fantastic. We got to get out of here. But before we go, is there anywhere you would direct people who want to follow your work or get in touch with you.

502
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:45,860
Yeah. Um, if you want to like, ask me questions that I didn't get to answer here you can go to my Twitter, it's at the linear 21.

503
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:57,606
And then just like, send me a thing and I will make time to try to answer your questions or just like tweet out a response, and my web, my portfolio is on there.

504
00:30:59,008 --> 00:31:08,691
So you're linear.com. Yeah, that's, that's where I have all my work. And yeah, that's, that's pretty much it. I don't really do much else online.

505
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:17,334
Yeah, you're too busy writing. Fantastic. You nailed it. Thanks, everyone for joining us. Enjoy the rest of your last day of juicy summer. And yeah, have a great 2020. Bye.
