1
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:10,028
Alright. Wow. Okay. My name's Scott.

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,913
Um, I... well I started out with an um. Right now.

3
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:20,095
Um, there's no um. Okay.

4
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,237
So, these are the games that I've worked on.

5
00:00:22,597 --> 00:00:27,901
I started at Lucas Learning, and, uh, but I'm here to talk about these games mostly.

6
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:30,483
Probably not Costume Quest as much, but, um...

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,824
I've also done a lot of comics and gallery shows.

8
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:39,466
And, what else?

9
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,748
Illustration. Children's book illustration.

10
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:46,232
That's kind of the spectrum of what I do.

11
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,994
But today we're going to talk about some of these guys.

12
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:50,775
You guys.

13
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:52,276
Okay.

14
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:55,218
Psychonauts.

15
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:02,230
I feel like I should be really dramatic with all you guys.

16
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,532
So many of you.

17
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:07,016
So yeah, you guys, Psychonauts.

18
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:12,382
Raise your hand if you have, just so I could...

19
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:15,005
Okay, cool.

20
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:15,625
Yes.

21
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:18,248
Okay, I won't go into that much detail about it then.

22
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:27,980
It's basically a psychic kid who goes to a camp with all these, like, psychonauts, which are very, you know, an epic kind of, um, secret agent group sort of thing.

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,343
And they all have psychic powers, like telekinesis, and they can lift things and throw things with their mind and stuff.

24
00:01:32,784 --> 00:01:34,305
And he uncovers a secret plot, and...

25
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,807
It's really exciting, you guys.

26
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,891
So, um, but these...

27
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:42,692
The main character...

28
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:45,733
I'll talk a little bit about what goes into it.

29
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:49,554
Because today, I'm going to assume all you guys know how to draw a little bit.

30
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:54,276
And you know all the basics about like, yeah, you know, you know how shapes,

31
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:58,098
certain shapes make certain, like, characters feel a certain way,

32
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,698
or look a certain way, or act a certain way.

33
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:02,639
You know basic drawing and life drawing and stuff. That's cool.

34
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,641
But today, I'm going to focus mostly on, like, getting pumped about it.

35
00:02:09,182 --> 00:02:11,123
And finding the meaning behind what you're doing.

36
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:12,963
Maybe the back story and the character.

37
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:19,690
You know what I mean? Like everything that you put in there is it could be a story

38
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,256
You don't just put a bunch of belt buckles on a dude and a bunch of like swords or something

39
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:24,977
Which is fine, too

40
00:02:25,297 --> 00:02:30,424
But if you have a reason for that like the dude is really into swords or something or he's really into belts

41
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:30,745
but

42
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:33,725
Otherwise, don't do that as much. You know what I mean?

43
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:37,370
You have a reason for it, because everything you put in a character has a story, you know?

44
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,854
So, for the first game, for, um...

45
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:41,915
um...

46
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:45,179
D'Artagnan was the name of the main character in the beginning.

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,662
And he started out being really inspired by, um...

48
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:54,185
Like, he escaped from a traveling circus, like a group of gypsies in a caravan.

49
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:58,546
He was very acrobatic. That's how he can do all the acrobatics in the game and everything, you know?

50
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:03,168
But he's really into the Psychonauts, so he had to be very, very stern about it.

51
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:07,469
And so Tim was always... Tim Schafer is the... You guys don't know Tim.

52
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,631
Anyway, he's really into the backstory of all of his characters and writing that all out.

53
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,272
And he has an idea for this guy, the new Legend of Shaolin kid right there.

54
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:23,835
is kind of who we wanted to be like. He wanted to be kind of tough like that and really

55
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,095
serious about being a psychonaut.

56
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:29,996
So this is what he looked like after a million drawings. This is what he looked like

57
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:30,776
at that point.

58
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:35,037
And this is the first character that we designed for the game, which is probably a bad idea.

59
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:36,977
I'll tell you later why that's a bad idea.

60
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,118
So this is what he looked like. So we put him in the game and we started animating him.

61
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:45,359
And he had a real big head as you can see.

62
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:52,842
you know? And we put more of the characters in the game and as the style started kind

63
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:59,251
of becoming a thing together, like a cohesive style, he became more and more weird looking,

64
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:03,836
you know? And ultimately when we focus grouped it...

65
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,690
again. So then we went back and kind of started thinking about like what would

66
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,072
be like really what he's about you know like he's really serious about the

67
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:21,554
Psychonauts and the Psychonauts were always something that you like you get

68
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:24,876
comic books for and you'd send away for like special goggles and the decoder

69
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:28,678
ring and stuff so he's like a real fan but he's also serious so maybe he would

70
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:31,880
have some of those elements but then he would also be wanting to be like one of

71
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,761
the most popular Psychonauts which is this guy Sasha Nein.

72
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:39,055
So he would maybe start dressing like him, wanting to be like him a little bit.

73
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:43,619
You know, so that's kind of why we started, maybe he had some of these elements in there,

74
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,903
like some goggles and some things he sent away for that he thinks would help him out,

75
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:49,284
jumping into a mind and stuff.

76
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:52,607
And then, or maybe he starts dressing like Sasha a little bit,

77
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,409
maybe a little bit more Bauhaus-y, gets a little nicer.

78
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:59,292
And I thought I'd put a cast on him, it's like, oh yeah, asymmetry's cool.

79
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,889
And then Tim's like, oh, why has he got a cast?

80
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:04,010
We've got to write a story for that.

81
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,592
We have to, why did he break his arm?

82
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:09,054
And I was like, I wasn't even thinking about why.

83
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:14,618
So we didn't do that.

84
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,200
But ultimately, this was the design that we came up with.

85
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:22,163
And that was like millions, like hundreds and hundreds

86
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:23,544
and hundreds of drawings for this guy.

87
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:25,285
And one of the things that I have.

88
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:31,918
One of the things about, for me, as far as creative blocks and trying to get past certain things,

89
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,120
I blame a lot of stuff on maybe the tools I'm using. I'm very superstitious.

90
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:41,724
So there's times that I'll be drawing with pencil and paper and it's not going anywhere,

91
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:44,326
I can't come up with any good ideas, and I go to Tim, like,

92
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:46,588
this is pretty good, and he's all, eh, pretty good.

93
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:52,032
And I'm like, oh, and then I go back and I'm like, oh man, this pencil sucks, probably.

94
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:56,730
So then I go back and I grab all my markers and I'm like, and I start using markers and I'm like,

95
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,132
oh, right on. And then I get a couple good designs with markers.

96
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:07,616
Moments in the markers and I'm like, okay, I'm going to use paper bag and draw on paper bag for a while.

97
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:11,058
So in the beginning, I was doing a blaming that for a lot of stuff.

98
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:18,242
So that's why ultimately, I, after this, after I got this guy on paper bag, I was down paper bag for a while.

99
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:20,383
So.

100
00:06:21,777 --> 00:06:27,539
And you know, and you gotta try out like drawing the characters in all the different positions and like not just drawing them in a pose

101
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:33,441
but then like trying them out like doing some of the things that you want them to do and see how the character works

102
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:37,062
and if it tells the story of who that person is. Like, this is She-

103
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:51,338
As you can see, I wasn't very organized with my character sheets there.

104
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:56,399
And then other times, certain characters are inspired by actual people.

105
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,240
Like Sasha was inspired by Kyle MacLachlan.

106
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,741
And Bobby Zilch was the bully in the game.

107
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:05,381
And he was inspired by Farkas.

108
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:07,722
So it was really angles.

109
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,882
But it was inspired by.

110
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:10,923
You pull the vibes from these guys.

111
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:11,723
You're not copying them.

112
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,764
You're pulling the energy from these dudes.

113
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:15,104
So he's a lot of weird angles.

114
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,485
That doesn't look like Farkas, really.

115
00:07:17,643 --> 00:07:22,625
Anyways, and this is another one of the orderlies,

116
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:24,226
and he was inspired by Steve Buscemi.

117
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,608
And he put little notes on there to make sure they know

118
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:30,428
that he has very greasy hair.

119
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:34,810
Because you've got to give the modelers a lot of...

120
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:41,833
so maybe you can work together on shaping how the character is and stuff.

121
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,614
And if the programmer needs to have greasy hair tech,

122
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:45,634
then that's what needs to be done.

123
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:51,793
Okay. So here's the next game we're going to talk about.

124
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:53,594
Brutal Legend.

125
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:58,977
I wonder how many...

126
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:02,118
Okay, you guys are great. I'm really excited you're here.

127
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:18,407
So basically, Brutal Legend was a story of a roadie that's pulled back in time to the age of metal.

128
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,010
Which is, basically, it's a very...

129
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:25,215
It doesn't look like how it does in... Which is, of course, the Middle Ages, right?

130
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:31,603
But it's not how we think Middle Ages look. It's basically what all the album covers look like.

131
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:34,366
That's what the Middle Ages look like. Like, chrome volcanoes...

132
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,383
It's grown out the environments and stuff. It's just nuts because that's what's on on these covers and stuff. So

133
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:54,287
So that was so the elements that we need to pull from from this was a very different style so

134
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:58,310
so we definitely were looking at like current Frank Frazetta and

135
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,753
Just hot rod culture itself and just you know rock stars and all that all that jazz

136
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:06,715
tough jazz actually not jazz but

137
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:11,048
So these are all the things that we were kind of pulling from.

138
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:21,201
And in the beginning of a project, you want to surround yourself with as much reference as you can, like in the world.

139
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:25,787
I mean, I'm super addicted to the reference to the point where maybe it's a procrastination tool for me.

140
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,808
So we have a room at Double Fine where it's in the back

141
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:33,269
and we just cover the walls

142
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:34,870
with whatever we're getting pumped on.

143
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,951
And so in the pre-production phase for this,

144
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,152
we just cover the walls with,

145
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,633
Tim brought in his record collection,

146
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:44,676
we put in all these images from Nordic landscapes

147
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:46,797
and Frank Frazetta and all these barbarian things

148
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,259
and just amazing hot rod stuff we found.

149
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,260
And kind of just thought of what would be

150
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:53,661
in the heavy metal game

151
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:55,022
and just surrounded ourself with it.

152
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:56,303
Just surrounded every square inch.

153
00:09:57,109 --> 00:09:58,010
And you sit in it.

154
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,231
And you take it in.

155
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:02,311
You take in this amazing room you created.

156
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:03,812
And this amazing world that you kind of...

157
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:06,433
And then you start kind of maybe making lists.

158
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,074
Because I start with making lots of lists.

159
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:12,076
And we all make lots of lists of just stuff that you would see in a crazy world like this.

160
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:12,416
You know?

161
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:14,157
So...

162
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:15,698
And then we had the basic...

163
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:17,458
The basic rule of putting...

164
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,260
If you design something like...

165
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:26,436
Yeah, it's a cool alligator or whatever, but what makes it specific to this world?

166
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:27,757
What makes it unique to this world?

167
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:32,841
And we had a blueprint of stuff because of this heavy metal and this amazing backstory that Tim wrote.

168
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:36,503
This huge, huge lore that starts from the beginning of time

169
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:39,165
when it's just a world covered in mud and writhing creatures.

170
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,587
That's like epic backstory.

171
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:44,749
That's not just like, my mom grew up here, you know?

172
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,910
It's crazy.

173
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:50,834
So he had all the reasons why this world was how it was, and why the world was growing

174
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:54,459
exhaust pipes, and why it had oil that you could, you know...

175
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,841
Well, actually, I guess we have oil we could mine.

176
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,531
don't we, fossil fuel?

177
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:04,013
Anyways, there's more badass versions of that in this world.

178
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:07,794
So the test was always, you put it on a heavy metal cover,

179
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:10,536
and if it will be cool enough for Motorhead

180
00:11:10,556 --> 00:11:14,477
to put on their record cover or something, then it's cool.

181
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:16,578
If you don't think those guys are going to like it

182
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:18,099
on their record, then it's not a good design.

183
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,020
It's one of our rules, you guys.

184
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,661
So in the beginning, we kind of just threw out a lot of drawings,

185
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:26,362
and it just existed.

186
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:30,023
I didn't do this cartoony one here. This is Raz Madeline, who's amazing.

187
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:36,727
In the beginning, we were trying to go the extreme of figuring out which, what style we want to push, like these characters and everything.

188
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:39,728
So we were just drawing tons of crazy stuff.

189
00:11:39,788 --> 00:11:43,130
And one of the lessons that we learned with Psychonauts was you don't start with the main dude.

190
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:49,553
You start with the cast of dudes and the cast of ladies and kind of get your style there and get your world there,

191
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:53,035
and then see who would work as a charismatic lead, you know?

192
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,176
So that's what we did here.

193
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,949
came up with all these creatures and put them together in groups and we're like,

194
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,230
okay, this is gonna be great, we're gonna,

195
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,932
this is gonna be how the world is gonna be, you know?

196
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:04,354
And then we're like, okay, now who's gonna be a good leader

197
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:06,055
in this group? And

198
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:07,577
the roadie

199
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:08,658
himself,

200
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:11,039
that character, Tim was always basing it

201
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,641
on this fellow right here.

202
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:14,782
Which, his name is Lemmy.

203
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:23,369
He's, he was based on him because he's the most respected dude in metal, he's like...

204
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,497
a real legit dude. Because he started out as a roadie

205
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:32,478
and then he became a rockstar after that. So he's just very respected, people are like,

206
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:32,778
dude,

207
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,319
he knows everything about everything. You're like, dude, well I don't know if he knows everything about everything, but

208
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,160
you trust him to take care of you, man, because he knows his stuff.

209
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,061
Because look at him. He's cool, right? And he always wears the same outfits.

210
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:47,942
Because he knows those are cool outfits.

211
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:54,209
So in the beginning we were kind of trying to have it be inspired, the main character inspired by Lemmy, you know.

212
00:12:54,609 --> 00:13:00,973
So, and we were trying to pushing the proportions and see how stylish we wanted it, how realistic we wanted it.

213
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:06,596
And I did a lot of design work in meetings and stuff, so that's why there's a lot of binder paper ones.

214
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:12,820
And we kind of were trying him out in the things that we'd need him to do, you know, the situations.

215
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,502
Like he would need to be a respected roadie, on one hand.

216
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:18,443
You know, tell him dudes what to do.

217
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:22,249
And then he'd need to command demon armies with his demon wings.

218
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,571
Also. So he has to be able to do both those things, you guys.

219
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,033
And he looks pretty badass, right? Doing this?

220
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:34,535
These paintings are cool. Yeah, nice.

221
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:37,736
Let's take him in for a sec, you guys.

222
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:40,918
Okay.

223
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:47,521
But as we were kind of trying to figure out how the game would work and how you'd tell the story...

224
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:50,643
you kind of like, you're thinking like,

225
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:53,703
the main character comes back to this world,

226
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,944
it's like, you as a character,

227
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:57,764
you as a player, want to play this person.

228
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,485
You have to want to play this main character

229
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:00,625
experiencing this new world.

230
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,445
This is a new world that's amazing.

231
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,886
This is a fantasy world for any metalhead,

232
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:06,446
you know, any fan of metal.

233
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,487
But we kept on thinking, the more we were kind of,

234
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,767
we wanted to be, there should be a little bit of emotion

235
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:12,287
in this guy, the main character.

236
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:14,868
And as much as we wanted it to be like Lemmy,

237
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,708
he just looked like he's almost too cool.

238
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,136
to experience it like we would all experience it.

239
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:25,238
Like if he saw a volcano running down a monster back that's like,

240
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:26,319
you know, has

241
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,960
metal shards pouring out of his insides,

242
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,721
like he'd be like, dope.

243
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:33,522
Like we'd be like, that's crazy.

244
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:36,083
But it seems like he'd be like, oh yeah,

245
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:39,664
yeah, that's what's happening there, I know that, that's real.

246
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:41,225
And it's like...

247
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:45,020
And that's like no fun to play a guy like that, really, you know?

248
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,921
Because you want to kind of get excited.

249
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:48,962
That's kind of why Harry Potter is so rad.

250
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:51,463
I'm a fan of Harry Potter.

251
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:57,245
Because he goes into this magical world,

252
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,687
and you as a reader, you're reading along with him.

253
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:01,427
Everything he sees is crazy,

254
00:15:01,627 --> 00:15:03,168
and he's getting excited about everything,

255
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:04,609
and you as a player want to feel that.

256
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,651
So it's like, and not only that, but he's the most important dude in that world.

257
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:10,151
That's like Fantasyland, you know?

258
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:11,692
And the same with Luke Skywalker.

259
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:14,932
You know that guy?

260
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:16,633
So anyways, so that's kind of like what we wanted.

261
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:19,954
So then we started looking more at Jack Black,

262
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:23,135
just because he would get pumped on it.

263
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,236
But he would kind of try to hold it in,

264
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:27,497
but he would also show that he knows his stuff.

265
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:28,958
He's a connoisseur of metal,

266
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:31,199
and he's actually badass at metal.

267
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:32,679
At playing it, performing it.

268
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:34,800
So we kind of went back towards that kind of vibe.

269
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,542
So that's kind of where we went more towards that,

270
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:40,082
and then kind of...

271
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:43,886
came up with this dude. Threw a little Danzig in there with him.

272
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:46,247
And he made him a little buffer than Jack Black.

273
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,191
And that's cool. We tried him out with some other characters.

274
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,554
He worked out pretty good with some of these other guys hanging out.

275
00:15:56,554 --> 00:16:00,357
And then we put them, we did these these paintings to show off like how the

276
00:16:00,397 --> 00:16:03,079
gameplay might work and what situations you might work in.

277
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,000
And it works good. There he is, riding that dude.

278
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:10,649
Let me see how...

279
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:12,950
I've got my trusty thing here.

280
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:13,710
Oh.

281
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:17,452
Okay.

282
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:18,592
What?

283
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:21,213
Okay. Sorry, you guys.

284
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,594
Back behind the scenes.

285
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:24,635
Um...

286
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:26,756
So I think we need to...

287
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:29,877
I need to kind of get... move on pretty quick.

288
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,238
I'll go by this really quick.

289
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:33,519
So one of the... some of the other characters in Brutal Legend that were...

290
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:34,919
were like, uh...

291
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,340
We're actually... what time...

292
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,281
What time do we got?

293
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:41,681
Forty minutes.

294
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:45,624
Fantastic. Okay, then we'll just skip this stuff.

295
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:48,986
Hey, I'm doing some rambling, you guys. I didn't see my thing here.

296
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:53,349
But anyways, this is another character, Ophelia.

297
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:53,769
She was...

298
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:58,112
Anyways, we'll skip Ophelia.

299
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:00,613
Here's some of the drawings of Ophelia, you guys.

300
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:08,448
I mean, basically, we were trying to make her gothy, and she sacrifices herself in the

301
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:10,490
Sea of Black Tears, and she rises up again as a phoenix.

302
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,492
So she would need to fly and command armies, too.

303
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:18,396
So we were trying all these elements on her, and then we decided that the sea itself would

304
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,638
kind of create her outfit, rather than create all these nice outfits.

305
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,199
That was the special thing there.

306
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,865
And then for the hair metal dude, he had to also fly, and it would make sense to have

307
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:31,606
his hair, because it's such a big part of his character.

308
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:34,750
That's the big part of flying.

309
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:37,454
Okay, so really quick, I'm going to go through this really quick.

310
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:39,736
Because we've got to get to drawing.

311
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,139
So this is how I work.

312
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,621
So I gather lots of reference.

313
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,663
By the way, this is one of the characters from our new game.

314
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,295
yeah, a broken age, you guys, where I would just collect like

315
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:54,920
photos and just crafts

316
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,764
and any paintings and anything that would make me feel a certain way and feel really good

317
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:02,950
and relax to start drawing and coming up with ideas and stuff. Because I just want to relax myself

318
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,231
as much as possible.

319
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,549
this is not from that game, but

320
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,751
this is what, typically what, like

321
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:11,612
how I come up with ideas, I just make

322
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:13,613
lots of lists, and I just jot down

323
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,415
stuff, and I just kind of let things flow

324
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,756
however, you know, the list could be about anything, whatever

325
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:19,638
you know, as long as I'm able to relax

326
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,199
myself, and I use Xerox paper

327
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:23,180
in order to kind of relax myself, because I

328
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,702
sketchbooks kind of stress the quality of it, it makes

329
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:27,724
it, makes me relax a little bit more, so

330
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:29,765
so I do, so I do this

331
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:31,726
sort of thing, and just kind of let it go, let it go

332
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:32,107
and then

333
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:34,283
Gestures out of like how?

334
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:38,204
Shapes might work and I don't know like I try to just pump a million of these out

335
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:40,585
So not one of them is really important

336
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:45,308
You know like you're kind of just trying to get get the just ideas and the feelings out

337
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:50,070
So so these are just kind of ideas for this main character. She's she's in this village

338
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,071
These are also doubles villagers at this point. Yeah

339
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:58,196
And then we start to close in on some of the some of the characters and then

340
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:04,059
scanning them in and just putting some value in there and some letters so people can kind of point out the ones that they

341
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:09,442
Like and how what elements they like and then we could start to mix and match and put them together in other ways

342
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,724
And then start putting them in situations

343
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:17,366
you know like that they'd be in the game maybe and see how they'd work and

344
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:20,228
Narrow them down to a few and do some color ruffs

345
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:23,810
And this is when you kind of maybe I put a little bit more time into it, you know

346
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,250
And then we choose them, and then we choose one.

347
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,331
And then we kind of push that a little bit more, you guys.

348
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,891
And then I make a character sheet.

349
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:35,292
As you see, it's a really rough character sheet,

350
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:36,592
but you just get an idea, you guys.

351
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:39,793
Just get the gestures, because they're making it, right?

352
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:42,033
Some head stuff.

353
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:43,833
And this is how she turns out.

354
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:45,914
This is what she is like in the game.

355
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:47,074
All right.

356
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:53,575
So that's the talk portion.

357
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:58,299
Now we're going to do some drawing together, you guys.

358
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,021
And I have these three assignments for us.

359
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:04,663
And by the way, we'll do questions at the end.

360
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:06,444
I think I was supposed to say something else.

361
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:10,547
Oh yeah, turn off your cell phones.

362
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:15,870
You're going to get an email evaluation after the panel, so just, you know, give me lots

363
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,490
of good feedback.

364
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:17,311
Cool.

365
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,660
And for Q&A, we'll just come up to these mics, but we'll go to that later.

366
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,541
Okay, let's go back to the assignment.

367
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,423
Get out your drawing materials, everybody.

368
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:28,624
I've never done this before, but I think it'll be fun, right?

369
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,565
Woo!

370
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,006
It will be so fun.

371
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,408
So, these are the three assignments.

372
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:39,130
So, the first one is draw a sad creature that lives under a rock or in a hole.

373
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:43,273
The creature helps the player get past a raging river, somehow.

374
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:45,374
The creature has a weapon.

375
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:50,411
Sometimes this is as much information as you get, guys, on a character.

376
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:52,832
Number two, draw a scientist.

377
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:56,614
A scientist that is discovering an amazing, earth-shattering thing.

378
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:58,135
A very excitable person.

379
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:00,256
Longs for the world to experience the new thing.

380
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:01,958
Oh man, so excited.

381
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,280
Okay, and the third one is draw a sneaky golem.

382
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:10,663
An old, ugly dude that has no friends except for his collection of rocks.

383
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,965
And I've taken it upon myself to...

384
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:16,687
Gather a little bit of reference for each one.

385
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:20,488
This is my reference for the sad creature in their zone.

386
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:22,829
This is the scientist's reference.

387
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,710
And this is the golem reference.

388
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:30,472
So, who would like to do number one?

389
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:32,272
This guy here, sad creature.

390
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:37,474
Who would like to do the scientist?

391
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,556
Oh boy, this is going to be a close one.

392
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:43,536
And who wants to do the golem?

393
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:48,115
I might need some help figuring this out.

394
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:50,476
Please, dude, help me figure this out.

395
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:52,657
I can't figure...

396
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:53,257
Cheer.

397
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:54,538
Cheer?

398
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:54,638
Yeah.

399
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:56,859
Oh, that's a good way to get pumped, right?

400
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:00,660
Who wants to do this one?

401
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:01,941
The sad creature?

402
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:06,743
Sounds good.

403
00:22:07,263 --> 00:22:08,364
Who wants to do the scientist?

404
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:12,525
So far, that's winning.

405
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:14,006
Who wants to do the golem?

406
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:18,407
Sounds like gong?

407
00:22:20,108 --> 00:22:20,869
Yeah, that's hard too.

408
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:21,389
All right.

409
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,310
Let's do the gong, you guys.

410
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,013
So here's my drawing materials.

411
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:27,753
Oh wait, let me switch.

412
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:32,136
Oops.

413
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:35,858
Move over here, guy.

414
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:45,165
Move over here.

415
00:22:47,562 --> 00:22:48,422
Oh, this is my spot.

416
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:51,503
So we're going to go back to this.

417
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:56,665
Here's my drawing utensils.

418
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,386
I usually just use this one though, you guys.

419
00:23:01,766 --> 00:23:05,467
Right now. This is my feeling good one.

420
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:07,888
This is my 6B pencil.

421
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:10,209
Okay.

422
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:12,829
Let's get pumped.

423
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:16,089
Maybe I'll, okay, yeah, let's put on some music for us

424
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:16,849
to relax to.

425
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:19,810
Not so quiet.

426
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,291
Eh, eh.

427
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:28,271
Okay, okay.

428
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:28,852
Oh.

429
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:29,632
Oh.

430
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,192
Oh.

431
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:30,892
Oh.

432
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:31,092
Oh.

433
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:31,292
Oh.

434
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:31,492
Oh.

435
00:23:31,572 --> 00:23:31,792
Oh.

436
00:23:31,852 --> 00:23:32,012
Oh.

437
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:32,092
Oh.

438
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:32,312
Oh.

439
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:32,452
Oh.

440
00:23:32,572 --> 00:23:32,672
Oh.

441
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:35,953
Oh.

442
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:36,073
Oh.

443
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:55,307
Join!

444
00:23:58,507 --> 00:24:05,509
You guys are awesome.

445
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:09,390
Play my music...

446
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:18,512
If you don't like this music, that's too bad.

447
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:37,889
So I have this weird thing, see this is why I'm superstitious you guys, I have this old sketchbook from when I used to work at Lucas, 15 years ago or so.

448
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:40,750
And for some reason I like to draw on top of it.

449
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:44,012
Instead of the table.

450
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:48,455
Okay, let's get started here.

451
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,458
So we're doing the Golem right? Is that what we're doing?

452
00:24:57,377 --> 00:25:00,298
Okay guys, I'm gonna go back and forth. This is how we're doing it.

453
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,739
This is what the reference looks like.

454
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,520
And this is me drawing.

455
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:07,401
Boy, am I procrastinating right now.

456
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:09,122
Okay.

457
00:25:13,284 --> 00:25:14,685
So, there's this guy.

458
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:19,047
By the way, you guys are welcome to talk amongst yourselves too.

459
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:21,588
It's okay, that's what happens in the studio.

460
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:24,069
This is the biggest studio of all time.

461
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:30,542
So, SneakyGone, he's an ugly dude, and he has no friends but his rocks.

462
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:34,686
I decided he's going to be a rock dude already.

463
00:25:36,487 --> 00:25:41,451
First thing I do, is do some copying.

464
00:25:43,913 --> 00:25:45,073
So I can relax a little bit.

465
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:48,796
Oh, is this the mic?

466
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:12,814
This is a sad guy.

467
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:16,438
I don't know if this dude in the corner...

468
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,621
Oh, you can't even see him.

469
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,884
The dude in the corner seems like kind of a weird...

470
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:24,186
kind of a weird bearded golem.

471
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:32,674
I don't know, he doesn't really strike me as a golem, but I'm enjoying him anyways.

472
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:35,757
So, okay.

473
00:26:43,157 --> 00:26:46,297
Maybe these are some of the rocks he can dig.

474
00:26:46,317 --> 00:26:46,957
Some other stuff.

475
00:26:46,997 --> 00:26:49,918
Probably put in lots of geodes.

476
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:52,619
Those are cool, man.

477
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:54,799
That's where you put your little pew direction figures in.

478
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:00,661
This is a geode.

479
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:06,262
Maybe, maybe he lives in it.

480
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:09,063
That's pretty cute.

481
00:27:11,928 --> 00:27:14,010
He's sad, but he wouldn't mind a visitor.

482
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:19,253
Yeah, I know.

483
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:24,156
Just because he's gotten new friends and he's sneaky doesn't mean he's a bad guy.

484
00:27:24,216 --> 00:27:26,538
Yeah, he can be sneaky and a good guy.

485
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:28,679
Right? Right, everybody?

486
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:31,401
Maybe he's in his jailed.

487
00:27:34,262 --> 00:27:36,124
He likes crystals too. Maybe not.

488
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,706
He seems like more of a stone dude.

489
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:55,598
The light works.

490
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:01,443
That's how it goes.

491
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:03,465
It's just the idea of phase.

492
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:06,107
Sometimes, maybe in this world, light works different.

493
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,790
We don't know. We don't know, you guys.

494
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:12,493
Is that a dude?

495
00:28:12,513 --> 00:28:15,435
It's made of rock.

496
00:28:19,318 --> 00:28:19,439
See?

497
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:25,714
I'm just kidding, I'll probably scan all this in and try to use some of it.

498
00:28:25,734 --> 00:28:36,844
I usually just scan this stuff in and if I like how a drawing looks, or a dude looks,

499
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:39,506
sometimes it's hard to reproduce it, I'll just scan it in and trace it.

500
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:41,548
I'll blow it up.

501
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:54,123
That looks a little...

502
00:28:58,284 --> 00:28:59,384
Maybe that's him.

503
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:11,367
This is Rock. This guy likes crystals.

504
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:14,147
There's also this guy.

505
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,472
You guys know the dude on the top right, right?

506
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:19,873
From that movie Gollum?

507
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:21,896
Derek Gollum, I think it's called.

508
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,277
It's that silent film.

509
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:25,519
It's cool.

510
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:27,321
Check it out.

511
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:28,342
What I always think of that dude,

512
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:30,504
and he has this amazing shaped head

513
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:38,713
that I'm not going to rip off.

514
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:50,222
Oh man, I'm glad you guys chose Gollum. This guy's cool.

515
00:29:50,302 --> 00:30:00,667
But he's sneaky though, so maybe he's...

516
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,071
You guys drawing? Who's drawing?

517
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:09,932
Yes!

518
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,053
Who's excited about it?

519
00:30:18,262 --> 00:30:21,466
You guys are good at cutting off exactly the right moment.

520
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,372
By the way, I don't wanna get your guys' hopes up.

521
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,574
We're not gonna see a finished, amazing character today.

522
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,097
We're just gonna get some ideas out.

523
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,240
Because usually I would probably just scan it in

524
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,122
and try to make it amazing.

525
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:38,164
But you know what?

526
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:39,925
Why sell myself short?

527
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:40,886
Maybe it's gonna be amazing.

528
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,661
I'd love to see the ones you guys do later.

529
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,822
Also, if we can figure out how to do that.

530
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:58,203
This is how you know he's made of stone.

531
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,864
You gotta put the stone stuff.

532
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:00,284
Cracks.

533
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,544
Otherwise he's just a gnome.

534
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:06,405
Okay.

535
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:16,248
Yeah, cause he's sneaky.

536
00:31:20,852 --> 00:31:21,052
Hm.

537
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,033
Music's nice.

538
00:31:23,694 --> 00:31:25,015
Let that music relax you guys.

539
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:43,308
How do you do that on top?

540
00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:43,729
Cool.

541
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:47,151
Music.

542
00:31:49,393 --> 00:31:50,294
This guy seems sneaky.

543
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:07,791
Okay.

544
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:12,733
I'll let you guys look at this for a bit.

545
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:14,294
Checking you guys out.

546
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:14,834
Alright.

547
00:32:14,994 --> 00:32:17,615
I'll let you guys look at this for a bit.

548
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:19,456
Checking you guys out.

549
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,231
Heaven is in your eyes

550
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,291
Brighter than stars you're under

551
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:44,072
Right, I'm gonna switch it back.

552
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:50,393
I'm doing the list, again.

553
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:52,513
Just places you might be hanging out.

554
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:21,179
Over the night, forget it

555
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,059
I'm in the mood

556
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,011
What I like to do sometimes is make a list of just things that...

557
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:54,573
just kind of riff on words that might remind me of the other word in a way.

558
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:57,054
Because then that could... it's like an improv thing.

559
00:33:57,134 --> 00:33:58,414
I do improv as well, you guys.

560
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:03,116
Which is a really good thing, tool, creative tool for people to write and illustrate.

561
00:34:03,736 --> 00:34:04,936
But, um, if you...

562
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:09,954
If you let yourself stream of consciousness,

563
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:12,576
like write down words, and start with some that,

564
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:14,357
and some of them might have something to do

565
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:15,098
with what you're designing,

566
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,819
and some of them might not have anything to do with it,

567
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,880
but you're just kind of flowing,

568
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,682
because you don't know what this list might bring you to.

569
00:34:20,702 --> 00:34:21,402
You know what I mean?

570
00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:23,984
Like it might bring you to an idea

571
00:34:24,024 --> 00:34:25,545
that might be cool or something.

572
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:27,787
Or to keep in mind these elements

573
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:29,548
as you're drawing a dude, you know?

574
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,491
That's works for me at least, you guys.

575
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:35,472
Might not work for you.

576
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,967
I'm just gonna write that word for me to feel good.

577
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:44,468
Okay.

578
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:21,663
I'm really stuck on giving him rocks to hold for some reason.

579
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:21,964
What is?

580
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:29,110
So this guy might have been a boy that was turned into a rock, I'll call him, and he's cursed.

581
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,230
Hmm.

582
00:35:46,928 --> 00:35:50,629
That's all there's about to lose here.

583
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:52,869
Maybe a skin.

584
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:03,772
So what's the deal with golems again?

585
00:36:03,812 --> 00:36:07,773
Wait, are golems like a cursed dude or is it a dude like a Frankenstein?

586
00:36:07,953 --> 00:36:11,174
It's like Frankenstein, right?

587
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:12,454
Made out of clay.

588
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:16,175
Dude, interesting. I should research that one.

589
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:19,073
What?

590
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:22,293
Yeah, man. That's good. So they're made out of clay...

591
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,214
And they're like a Frankenstein dude.

592
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:28,035
Okay. I was going more with made out of rock than with cursed.

593
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:29,615
Hey, that's cool.

594
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:33,836
Teaches his own right in the world of Gollum's.

595
00:36:34,196 --> 00:36:36,577
I like it. Do some chatting.

596
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:48,523
Five minutes trying? Okay.

597
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:54,290
As you can see, this is all just coming up with ideas, you guys. That's all.

598
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,927
I keep getting all the same things.

599
00:37:11,947 --> 00:37:14,788
I don't know what to think about that.

600
00:37:15,048 --> 00:37:21,811
Oh, it's from that? I don't know if it's from that.

601
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:27,974
I know these guys are really sneaky though.

602
00:37:28,014 --> 00:37:30,455
Maybe he's wearing an algae shirt.

603
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,980
Because I wrote that down.

604
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:36,822
On a list.

605
00:37:37,062 --> 00:37:42,525
Does that give me much more than that?

606
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:46,268
It gives me so much more.

607
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:08,386
Maybe he's wearing a rock hat.

608
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:14,610
Where's his collection?

609
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:21,454
He's wearing it.

610
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:29,880
Alright, well it's not an amazing design you guys, but hey, it gives an idea.

611
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,881
I don't know what I'm reading right now, okay.

612
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:40,820
So this is considered just the first pass, you guys.

613
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,485
First pass, if you get like an assignment like this,

614
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:49,948
this is how you just kind of get in the zone.

615
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,430
And you scan all these in.

616
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,252
See, I'm just, I'm quantiting up quality at this point.

617
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:58,836
Because it doesn't matter, just like, we're just trying to get some stuff out.

618
00:38:58,856 --> 00:38:59,796
Oh, here's what this guy looks like.

619
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:01,218
Um.

620
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,624
And then you kind of do that pass and you scan these in and kind of try to arrange them nicely.

621
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:15,470
And maybe put a little bit of shading in there so people can think I put a lot more work into it.

622
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,752
And then send it to them and just kind of bombard them with stuff.

623
00:39:19,113 --> 00:39:29,581
And then there's a second pass, third pass, fourth pass, fifth pass, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, maybe twenty-five thousand passes.

624
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:32,923
Perhaps. That's how it works sometimes.

625
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:34,884
And sometimes, maybe just once.

626
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:35,905
But almost never.

627
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,531
I have only nailed a character once in my life.

628
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:46,532
Right away.

629
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:49,094
Do you know who that is?

630
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:51,615
It was because it was the first...

631
00:39:51,735 --> 00:39:52,276
Only because we...

632
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:54,457
Tim wrote a character based on this guy.

633
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:56,779
It was one of the first drawings I ever drew.

634
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,780
When I started at Double Frame.

635
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:03,538
working at Cyclone Ops, the first character I ever...

636
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,841
only one that nailed in the first drawing was Dogen.

637
00:40:07,941 --> 00:40:11,584
I drew a character that looked like this character, Dogen.

638
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:12,825
This guy with a cap on his head.

639
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:14,546
That was like one of the first drawings I drew.

640
00:40:15,527 --> 00:40:17,568
And he made it into the game exactly like that.

641
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,813
Only time in my life that a character is the first drawing.

642
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:26,095
I think.

643
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:39,035
This dude's probably blind, right?

644
00:40:42,198 --> 00:40:43,879
Yeah, maybe he has a tail, I don't know.

645
00:40:48,723 --> 00:40:49,364
Looking good.

646
00:41:05,677 --> 00:41:11,522
All right, we'll do a couple more sketches and then we'll do some questions and chatting

647
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:11,982
together.

648
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:38,361
Continuing through the North, South and South subscribing to slavery.

649
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:42,764
Fatality is the biggest crime in history.

650
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:50,109
To get out of depression and go into sex work is detrimental.

651
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:53,351
For more UN videos visit www.un.org

652
00:42:02,932 --> 00:42:05,194
I don't know what that is.

653
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:07,275
Maybe he's a...

654
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:41,282
There he is, he's moving along.

655
00:42:41,622 --> 00:42:45,665
Hi you guys.

656
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:51,570
I guess this GOM I'll just make this GOM be him.

657
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,133
Give him some algae.

658
00:42:56,674 --> 00:43:02,939
Um, anyways you guys, I think, I think we'll uh, oh here's the full thing.

659
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:04,780
I think we will...

660
00:43:06,202 --> 00:43:10,314
Conclude this part and then maybe have some questions. What do you think?

661
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,741
That sound good?

662
00:43:12,862 --> 00:43:13,724
How good is it sound?

663
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:18,286
Nice.

664
00:43:19,186 --> 00:43:20,187
Most exciting one ever.

665
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:23,390
Okay, so thanks you guys for hanging out.

666
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:25,152
We'll do some questions now.

667
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:27,914
If you guys can, like, cruise up to these two mics,

668
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:31,217
and we'll just go back and forth or whatever.

669
00:43:31,638 --> 00:43:34,340
Probably the easiest, and then everyone can hear your questions and stuff.

670
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,603
So, feel free to make your way up there whenever you want.

671
00:43:39,425 --> 00:43:40,305
At your leisure.

672
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,047
And you can give a question about anything.

673
00:43:43,448 --> 00:43:44,729
About drawing, how you do it.

674
00:43:52,825 --> 00:43:52,905
Hi.

675
00:43:52,945 --> 00:43:53,645
I'm Elise.

676
00:43:53,665 --> 00:44:05,074
I guess that also involves a little bit of creative block.

677
00:44:05,134 --> 00:44:05,635
I'm sorry, say again?

678
00:44:05,695 --> 00:44:06,876
Maybe speak a little bit into the microphone.

679
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:07,096
Sorry.

680
00:44:07,116 --> 00:44:07,436
I'm Elise.

681
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:07,877
I'm Elise.

682
00:44:07,897 --> 00:44:08,157
I'm Elise.

683
00:44:08,177 --> 00:44:08,357
I'm Elise.

684
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:08,697
I'm Elise.

685
00:44:08,717 --> 00:44:08,917
I'm Elise.

686
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:09,138
I'm Elise.

687
00:44:09,158 --> 00:44:09,338
I'm Elise.

688
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:09,598
I'm Elise.

689
00:44:09,618 --> 00:44:09,878
I'm Elise.

690
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:10,098
I'm Elise.

691
00:44:10,118 --> 00:44:10,539
I'm Elise.

692
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:10,739
I'm Elise.

693
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:14,805
I'm talking to a lot of people. Hi!

694
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:16,386
Thanks for being the first one. You're the best.

695
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:16,486
Yeah.

696
00:44:16,766 --> 00:44:21,167
Oh wait, here's a consolation prize. You can have one of these for being the first person.

697
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:22,147
Oh, thanks.

698
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:29,608
So you briefly talked about creator's block and how you tried different materials and one of them was the paper bag.

699
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:30,448
Yeah.

700
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:34,349
I was also wondering if you could talk about further from that, like, discouragement.

701
00:44:34,689 --> 00:44:37,810
Like, you're really working hard and you just can't get further.

702
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,490
You know what? It's weird. I think, like...

703
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:44,182
Let me turn off this music. I don't think we need this anymore.

704
00:44:45,243 --> 00:44:49,566
Okay, I think... I don't think anyone really knows.

705
00:44:49,626 --> 00:44:54,671
I think everyone hits writer's block and everyone struggles through it and no one knows exactly how, but you just try different things.

706
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:58,692
Sometimes if I'm hitting a block on a character

707
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:00,894
and I can't get past it and I find myself drawing

708
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:02,495
the same shapes and the same things

709
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:04,156
and I'm just getting so frustrated

710
00:45:04,497 --> 00:45:06,118
because there's elements that I want to keep

711
00:45:06,598 --> 00:45:08,580
that was approved other times and stuff,

712
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,122
sometimes I'll just get away from it

713
00:45:11,582 --> 00:45:12,963
and come at it completely different.

714
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:14,564
I draw a completely different design,

715
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:15,845
think about it completely differently

716
00:45:15,905 --> 00:45:17,867
just to shake my mind away

717
00:45:17,987 --> 00:45:19,468
from that other thing that I'm married to.

718
00:45:20,068 --> 00:45:22,270
Like that's something that oftentimes helps me out.

719
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,972
And then other times you just have to keep the faith, kind of.

720
00:45:26,512 --> 00:45:28,273
Because you're just going to, sometimes you're just going to get...

721
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,094
I've had many times where I get pretty depressed

722
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,996
trying to design a character and it's not going well.

723
00:45:34,636 --> 00:45:35,376
And then you're just kind of...

724
00:45:35,877 --> 00:45:38,798
But then when you finally get something that's awesome, then it's good.

725
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:39,599
So...

726
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:41,280
Yeah, thank you.

727
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,761
Oh, wait, here, you can have one of these drawings.

728
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:45,102
Have one of these drawings.

729
00:45:45,122 --> 00:45:48,483
Go ahead and choose one.

730
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:50,492
Oh wait, choose one, choose one.

731
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:52,933
You gotta choose one.

732
00:45:53,354 --> 00:45:54,834
Just in case I want to give, just choose one.

733
00:45:55,015 --> 00:45:57,656
Oh, just pick one. Oh, okay.

734
00:45:57,696 --> 00:45:59,237
Whichever one you want.

735
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:02,058
Can I make lists, too?

736
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:03,219
Yes.

737
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:04,460
Hi, my name is Rebecca.

738
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,461
Thank you so much for this talk, it was really inspirational.

739
00:46:09,402 --> 00:46:11,243
I had a similar question, so I came up with another.

740
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:19,545
Have you ever been in a situation where you've had to draw something completely outside of your usual style?

741
00:46:19,565 --> 00:46:23,588
How do you find the motivation to switch styles?

742
00:46:23,888 --> 00:46:29,053
Maybe not necessarily on the fly, but having to do something that's outside of your usual scope?

743
00:46:30,274 --> 00:46:37,119
I think that's why in school, you're supposed to really study all types of drawing and be able to draw realistic.

744
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:41,163
I went to school to draw X-Men. That's what I wanted to do.

745
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,961
and draw fantasy paintings like Frank Frazetta and stuff.

746
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,224
So I was really into drawing realistic and really sticking to that.

747
00:46:50,805 --> 00:46:53,446
But after that, being exposed to different art through friends,

748
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:57,728
I kind of enjoyed seeing how other people interpret stuff.

749
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,490
So I guess it's getting the basics down and then seeing,

750
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,351
just being really versatile, you know, being able to do it.

751
00:47:03,651 --> 00:47:06,813
Like after Psychonauts, that was basically like my style

752
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:08,454
that I'd normally work in, but...

753
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:14,486
Fruital Legend, like everyone had to switch to that very Frazetta style.

754
00:47:15,146 --> 00:47:18,688
And when you're working in a game company or a film company, you have to be able to,

755
00:47:18,928 --> 00:47:20,089
you just have to be able to do it.

756
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:24,070
So, and if you're not pumped on it, you just, you gotta find what makes you pumped about it.

757
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,371
Because there's gotta be something about it.

758
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:30,113
Something. You put a little, little, little logo in there.

759
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:30,493
A little touch-up.

760
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:31,294
Put your initials, I don't know.

761
00:47:31,314 --> 00:47:32,994
Yeah. Alright, thank you so much.

762
00:47:33,515 --> 00:47:33,835
You're welcome.

763
00:47:38,237 --> 00:47:40,979
My name's Byron, and the question that I have is,

764
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,761
when you run into a specific problem,

765
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:45,583
like something that your training hasn't covered,

766
00:47:46,123 --> 00:47:47,705
and you need a technique to get around it,

767
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,067
where do you look to find the answers?

768
00:47:51,008 --> 00:47:51,968
I'm sorry, say again?

769
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:54,571
So, like, let's say you run into a material

770
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:56,773
that you need to render that you've never done before,

771
00:47:57,293 --> 00:48:00,176
so, like, a building made out of glass

772
00:48:00,236 --> 00:48:00,956
or something like that.

773
00:48:01,557 --> 00:48:03,819
Where would you look to find the techniques

774
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:04,759
to achieve that goal?

775
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:08,186
to achieve a design for something I don't know much about?

776
00:48:11,623 --> 00:48:18,146
I mean, that's always what I do before I do any drawing at all, is just start to do tons of research and stuff.

777
00:48:18,586 --> 00:48:25,389
I mean, I get, I pull a lot from Google image, you know, search, and then like sometimes those will take you to other web pages,

778
00:48:25,409 --> 00:48:28,151
and you can find more images, and you can read about it and stuff.

779
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:34,193
So, I mean, I, there's, sometimes I do it for a whole like three, four, five days before I start any drawing.

780
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:36,955
I'll just do that for a while to kind of get a feel for it.

781
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,576
Is that one, In Cold Blood, where Truman Capote spent like...

782
00:48:41,694 --> 00:48:43,737
nine months before writing a word or something like that.

783
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,721
Like he spent nine months just researching and getting ready

784
00:48:46,741 --> 00:48:47,682
and his publisher's always like,

785
00:48:47,702 --> 00:48:48,563
do you have anything to show for it?

786
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,085
He's like, I'm still getting, you know,

787
00:48:50,105 --> 00:48:52,008
I'm getting and taking it in, you know?

788
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:55,392
So sometimes when you got a deadline though,

789
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:56,714
then you need to kind of speed that up.

790
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:59,177
Thank you.

791
00:48:59,718 --> 00:48:59,998
No problem.

792
00:49:04,314 --> 00:49:04,775
Hey, how's it going?

793
00:49:04,995 --> 00:49:06,636
There's some other people over here too, just saying.

794
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:06,977
Say again?

795
00:49:07,117 --> 00:49:08,298
Oh, there's some other people over here.

796
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:10,260
Oh, dude, sorry.

797
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,361
You can take her first.

798
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:12,341
I'll go back and forth.

799
00:49:12,381 --> 00:49:13,182
Yeah, you guys, okay.

800
00:49:13,603 --> 00:49:14,323
Okay, you wanna go?

801
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:15,164
I can.

802
00:49:15,644 --> 00:49:16,966
Hi, Scott, my name is Fiona.

803
00:49:17,386 --> 00:49:17,706
Hi, Fiona.

804
00:49:17,927 --> 00:49:20,108
Hi, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit

805
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:22,290
about the process of working with a director

806
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:23,271
to create a character.

807
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:24,953
Working with a director?

808
00:49:25,313 --> 00:49:26,194
Mm-hmm.

809
00:49:26,855 --> 00:49:27,375
Yeah, okay, sure.

810
00:49:28,438 --> 00:49:33,001
I was fortunate enough to work mostly with Tim Schafer on these things, and he's just

811
00:49:33,021 --> 00:49:37,684
the most amazing person ever to work for on that, because he cares so much about the character

812
00:49:38,364 --> 00:49:46,570
and the backstory and just the overall character arcs of these characters. And he has great

813
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:53,114
taste. He has great taste in visual things as well. And I was kind of fortunate enough

814
00:49:53,154 --> 00:49:55,916
to work with him, because we jived a lot, and we were able to...

815
00:49:56,637 --> 00:49:58,159
you know, make each other laugh and have a good time.

816
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:02,663
So I guess in that sense, but whenever I found myself

817
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:06,547
like wanting to make him feel good and laugh at my drawings

818
00:50:06,608 --> 00:50:08,990
or get pumped or punch the air or something.

819
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:10,251
And it's the sort of thing.

820
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:15,912
There are certain assignments that suck. There are certain assignments that you kind of have to like go for it.

821
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:18,753
And I would just go into his office and be like, oh dude, look at this.

822
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:24,516
And if he's ever like kind of lukewarm on it, then it's like you could use that.

823
00:50:24,616 --> 00:50:26,697
But you know that he's just not going to be pumped on it.

824
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:30,739
So I just want to – I love the editing process. I love redrawing things.

825
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:31,800
And to a point.

826
00:50:32,982 --> 00:50:34,282
I love redrawing things, and I love,

827
00:50:34,302 --> 00:50:35,723
because I want it to make it good, you know?

828
00:50:35,743 --> 00:50:37,724
I want to make it, I want everyone to enjoy it,

829
00:50:37,804 --> 00:50:40,265
and I want to reshape things and make it really good, so.

830
00:50:40,786 --> 00:50:42,667
And that works well with kids' books and stuff, too,

831
00:50:42,687 --> 00:50:44,387
because the editing process,

832
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:46,288
a lot of artists go in just from art,

833
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:47,929
and they're like, dude, this is what I draw.

834
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:48,870
This is what I do.

835
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,111
You know, you don't tell me what I'm awesome at, you know?

836
00:50:52,692 --> 00:50:54,433
And they don't take editing process well,

837
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:57,514
and that's kind of what is exciting to me, I don't know.

838
00:50:57,694 --> 00:51:00,356
So I love working with directors, personally.

839
00:51:00,976 --> 00:51:01,276
Thank you.

840
00:51:05,348 --> 00:51:05,748
Oh, okay.

841
00:51:06,068 --> 00:51:06,248
Hey.

842
00:51:06,748 --> 00:51:07,008
Hey.

843
00:51:07,228 --> 00:51:07,508
Sup, man.

844
00:51:07,528 --> 00:51:07,909
Super weird.

845
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:09,529
So my name is Vincent.

846
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:10,449
Thanks for the talk, Scott.

847
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,070
I'm just wondering because your work's really humorous

848
00:51:14,211 --> 00:51:16,271
and always really funny, and I was just wondering,

849
00:51:16,391 --> 00:51:19,532
like, do you use that, like, the humor lens to, like,

850
00:51:20,032 --> 00:51:22,513
when you're designing something that's not really funny

851
00:51:22,573 --> 00:51:24,834
or serious, like, is it more of a challenge for you

852
00:51:24,894 --> 00:51:26,894
to design something like, maybe some of the stuff

853
00:51:26,934 --> 00:51:28,635
on Brutal Legend, or even things like props

854
00:51:28,675 --> 00:51:30,475
that aren't really, don't really have character.

855
00:51:30,615 --> 00:51:32,096
Like, how do you use that in your work?

856
00:51:33,377 --> 00:51:34,898
Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know, I guess, um,

857
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,579
I guess there's always a little bit of humor in there,

858
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:39,420
but there were times in Brutal Legend that it was,

859
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,961
I was researching some pretty terrifying stuff,

860
00:51:42,221 --> 00:51:44,142
and drawing some pretty terrifying stuff.

861
00:51:44,923 --> 00:51:47,124
Um, I felt like during that time,

862
00:51:47,144 --> 00:51:48,805
my outside work, my paintings,

863
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:50,405
got cuter and cuter,

864
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:53,607
the more deeper I got into this terrifying world a little bit.

865
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:57,028
So, it's just like, finding ways to balance that stuff, you know?

866
00:51:57,629 --> 00:52:01,070
Um, but I think, I don't know.

867
00:52:15,942 --> 00:52:20,165
I like scary movies. I don't like sad movies though, I'll be honest.

868
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:23,366
Cool, thanks. Thanks man.

869
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:30,751
Hi. Oh, there's one over there too? I'm sorry.

870
00:52:32,492 --> 00:52:37,675
Maybe you guys, if you want to come to these two, maybe you can make it easier on me, but let's do this one now.

871
00:52:39,360 --> 00:53:01,196
I'm doing good. Psychonauts is one of my favorite all-time games, and part of it is because the visuals and the story just combine wonderfully together. I feel like if you change the element of either the tone of the story or the visual graphics, it just wouldn't have meshed quite as well. So how much did you work with the narrative team on creating that game, and how did that work out?

872
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,479
That was art director on Psychonauts.

873
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:09,672
So I was just, and the,

874
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:11,953
so I was working very closely with Tim,

875
00:53:12,033 --> 00:53:15,455
but Tim creates a really amazing environment

876
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:17,897
where he could like, where he kind of welcomes everyone

877
00:53:17,937 --> 00:53:19,098
to kind of brainstorm together.

878
00:53:19,338 --> 00:53:22,820
And so the, you know, the designers and the game designers

879
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,722
and the artists and himself and the programmers,

880
00:53:25,762 --> 00:53:27,343
even everybody kind of gets involved

881
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:29,684
and kind of get to have ideas to throw around

882
00:53:29,744 --> 00:53:31,345
and just kind of, it's like a think tank there.

883
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:38,062
So it was in tandem. It wasn't like you created the characters and then somebody else was creating the dialogue for that character.

884
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:39,843
It was all kind of happening at the same time.

885
00:53:42,006 --> 00:53:47,471
It usually starts with like a little snippet of information that Tim has or the game design people have.

886
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:52,256
Like for, we need a character like this here, you know. And then I'll start doing some drawings.

887
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,739
And then Tim might start writing a story around it or he'll write a story.

888
00:54:00,548 --> 00:54:05,356
Some of you guys might know the story of how the camp kids were created the opposite direction.

889
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:09,101
Because Tim and I would always go to each other and be like, dude, like, you know, write

890
00:54:09,141 --> 00:54:09,702
something first.

891
00:54:10,003 --> 00:54:11,004
And he's like, no, just draw something.

892
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:11,825
And I'll write something to that.

893
00:54:11,845 --> 00:54:14,349
Like, there's like a little bit of like back and forth that kind of sometimes.

894
00:54:22,232 --> 00:54:27,135
kids in this camp, a whole bunch of different kids, and he was creating kind of their backstory,

895
00:54:27,195 --> 00:54:31,878
and what he decided for that is, like, he, I just drew a bunch of kids, and he laid them

896
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:36,460
out, and he was like, one of his deliverables he had to come up with, like, a way to write

897
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,623
all these characters out, and he was getting frustrated doing his stuff, he's procrastinating

898
00:54:41,263 --> 00:54:46,546
by going on Friendster back in the day, Friendster is the thing, and, and what he just, what

899
00:54:46,586 --> 00:54:50,288
he, what he figured out was a way to use that to his advantage, and he put all the camp

900
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,168
kids into Friendster.

901
00:54:52,428 --> 00:54:54,070
and then he wrote their personalities

902
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,312
and he had them comment on each other's posts

903
00:54:57,132 --> 00:55:00,595
in a way that kind of let their characters rise up

904
00:55:00,996 --> 00:55:02,637
and become more apparent and stuff.

905
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,318
So it really goes back and forth.

906
00:55:04,378 --> 00:55:06,760
I mean, that process is really a back and forth thing

907
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,562
and you never know when the story element

908
00:55:08,582 --> 00:55:10,864
will come out of drawing something and vice versa.

909
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:12,425
Okay, thank you.

910
00:55:12,845 --> 00:55:14,106
Yeah, thank you, you're welcome.

911
00:55:14,126 --> 00:55:14,407
Thank you.

912
00:55:16,228 --> 00:55:16,568
Okay.

913
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,809
That was totally my question too.

914
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:19,971
Wait, that was your question?

915
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:21,132
Oh, sweet.

916
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:23,870
Thanks for coming up here.

917
00:55:44,938 --> 00:55:50,802
But I feel like I worked that, I mean, I feel like one of my first lessons I learned in the entertainment industry

918
00:55:50,902 --> 00:55:53,624
was I started working at Lucas Learning, which is like a small

919
00:55:54,604 --> 00:55:56,906
part of LucasArts, and our first game

920
00:55:58,747 --> 00:56:01,189
that I worked on, I was excited. It was a Star Wars game, it was great,

921
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:07,232
and I was just like, my first job, and it was only a year process for this game, and two weeks before it ended,

922
00:56:07,252 --> 00:56:07,893
they canceled it.

923
00:56:09,434 --> 00:56:09,774
And I was like,

924
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:13,531
totally heartbroken. I was like, dude, I put so much energy into this. This is crazy, you know?

925
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:16,852
And then that was just like the first lesson on how things sometimes go.

926
00:56:17,032 --> 00:56:19,453
You can't be married to something that much, you know?

927
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:23,194
And sometimes you might love something, but then it's just not exactly right.

928
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:28,435
It's not exactly right for what the situation calls for in the movie or the game or whatever, you know?

929
00:56:28,455 --> 00:56:31,456
It's just, you know, so even though you love it,

930
00:56:31,676 --> 00:56:36,217
maybe you could use that to inspire a slightly different design or use it somewhere else or something.

931
00:56:36,297 --> 00:56:38,318
But like, you kind of just have to...

932
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,101
roll with those punches.

933
00:56:41,161 --> 00:56:45,926
Have you ever felt like it was really right and that the other person was wrong and

934
00:56:45,966 --> 00:56:47,987
you just kind of swallow it?

935
00:56:48,368 --> 00:56:52,371
If I'm the art director and I think it's the best and it's someone maybe that is like

936
00:56:53,692 --> 00:56:58,216
if it's Tim deciding that, then yeah, Tim makes that decision. But maybe I can make a few more decisions

937
00:56:58,877 --> 00:56:59,517
as art director.

938
00:57:00,738 --> 00:57:03,681
But if I'm just designing something, you're designing something for

939
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:05,502
the greater good, you guys.

940
00:57:06,511 --> 00:57:07,712
You can't get too married to that stuff.

941
00:57:07,732 --> 00:57:08,993
Because, you know what?

942
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:10,834
You're going to draw amazing stuff all the time.

943
00:57:10,854 --> 00:57:17,018
In an hour, you can't be married to this one thing.

944
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,719
Like, this is my crown jewel thing.

945
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,101
I shall never create anything as amazing.

946
00:57:22,222 --> 00:57:23,683
It's not going to happen, you know?

947
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:26,645
And it's kind of not a good way of thinking about that.

948
00:57:27,466 --> 00:57:27,726
Thank you.

949
00:57:27,746 --> 00:57:28,526
No problem.

950
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:30,147
Thank you, man.

951
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:33,190
Oh, I didn't catch your guys' names.

952
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:37,586
Say your name too so I can hear you.

953
00:57:37,806 --> 00:57:44,012
Hi, my name is Samantha. I was just asking about like you said you use a lot of reference and you gather a lot of reference.

954
00:57:44,092 --> 00:57:48,136
Have you ever gotten an idea during creating a character that you go outside of your reference?

955
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:51,459
Say again?

956
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,283
Oh, well you gather a lot of reference when you make a character.

957
00:57:55,423 --> 00:58:01,569
Has there ever been a point where in any of your character designs that you go outside of the reference that you gathered for like a good idea?

958
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:06,206
Well, I guess gathering references is an ongoing thing.

959
00:58:06,427 --> 00:58:07,727
I guess it comes from anything.

960
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:14,249
I mean, you gather it from the internet, but you might be working on it and then you watch

961
00:58:14,269 --> 00:58:19,551
a movie and you're like, damn, that kind of inspires you.

962
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,832
So you kind of just keep adding to the pile of stuff all the time.

963
00:58:22,872 --> 00:58:26,653
It's not like it's a set time, like this day is my reference day.

964
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:29,672
after this day, no more reference.

965
00:58:29,732 --> 00:58:31,674
Just keep adding to it.

966
00:58:32,214 --> 00:58:34,036
Keep adding to it and have more stuff,

967
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:35,918
whatever works for you.

968
00:58:36,658 --> 00:58:37,839
Thank you.

969
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:38,460
Thanks.

970
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,443
Hi, I'm Adam.

971
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,084
Great talk. Thank you.

972
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:46,167
I was just going to ask you about your process

973
00:58:47,008 --> 00:58:48,289
when you're designing characters

974
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:49,110
in the initial phase.

975
00:58:49,843 --> 00:59:00,529
Do you find that when you're drawing you find one character or design that you really really like and you instantly know or is it a process that requires a lot of deliberation to land on the right one?

976
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:11,595
Most times, yeah. I rarely am just like, this is the one. And if I do, it's just like, you know, I'm not married to it. As we've discussed.

977
00:59:13,536 --> 00:59:15,077
That's my experience as well. Thank you.

978
00:59:15,157 --> 00:59:15,877
Oh, cool, man. Good.

979
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:18,251
All right.

980
00:59:19,593 --> 00:59:20,194
We're at time?

981
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:20,494
Yeah.

982
00:59:20,634 --> 00:59:20,955
Right now?

983
00:59:20,995 --> 00:59:22,237
We were trying to go over.

984
00:59:22,457 --> 00:59:23,599
But if you want to ask more questions.

985
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:23,739
Okay.

986
00:59:23,759 --> 00:59:27,144
You guys.

987
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:27,685
Sorry about that.

988
00:59:27,805 --> 00:59:28,105
And thank you.

989
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:28,225
Okay.

990
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:28,606
Thank you.
