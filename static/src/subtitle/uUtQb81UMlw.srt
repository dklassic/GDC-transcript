1
00:00:08,168 --> 00:00:12,952
All right, hello everyone and welcome to our talk about how to make things pop.

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,945
This talk is going to be about how audio and visuals can be used to enhance the experience of a video game.

3
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:32,470
It's a dive into our thinking and methods when working towards the common goal.

4
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:34,656
She is Inna Hansen.

5
00:00:35,176 --> 00:00:36,357
And this is Martin Kvala.

6
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:39,439
And together we have worked on these four games together.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,964
We are also currently both ending up working on a new super secret project that we are in talks about and can't share.

8
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:51,348
But however, today we are here to talk about mixing up the disciplines together with you.

9
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:55,221
Almost a year ago, we did talks back to back at Nordic Game Jam.

10
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:58,223
Strangely, the points we were making were the same ones.

11
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:04,849
My talk was about color psychology and Martin's was on how to choose the right sound style.

12
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:12,556
So we decided to get started journey where we could talk about the same things from the respective points of our views together here.

13
00:01:14,963 --> 00:01:21,208
It's also kind of funny as a sound designer, because I sometimes quite often get the whole thing of like, could you make this sound more green?

14
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,151
Or could you make this rain sound more yellow?

15
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:29,155
So I've always been curious about, maybe Ina has these secrets to be explaining to me.

16
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:30,516
So that's my ulterior motive.

17
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:33,890
So we are the bread in the sandwich.

18
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:38,895
We come from two completely different disciplines with tools that don't overlap at all.

19
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:44,240
We are in many ways a metaphorical bread in the metaphorical sandwich.

20
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:48,565
You start with art and you finish with sound.

21
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,847
And we all hold it together with carbs.

22
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,089
Delicious carbs.

23
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:55,252
In this talk,

24
00:01:57,946 --> 00:01:59,267
We will talk about these things.

25
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:03,190
So why should you care about great audio and art?

26
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,732
Which is a bit about the benefits of prioritizing this for your game.

27
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:08,414
How to make it stand out.

28
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:10,796
How to cut through the noise.

29
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:12,397
How do we work?

30
00:02:13,157 --> 00:02:16,440
And we'll go through our processes and how we address the same concepts and goals.

31
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,103
How to make the pop stick.

32
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:27,851
making memorable experiences by playing of vibes, associations and making patterns and shared language.

33
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,253
This is a little bit of how and why you should talk to each other.

34
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:36,917
At the end of this talk, you will be able to identify how to bring out the best in your project.

35
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:42,962
We'll get into the way we think when creating visuals and audio, and we hope that you sincerely can take something away from this.

36
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,892
Audio person, talk to your artists.

37
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,853
Artists, involve an audio person early on.

38
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:51,794
And solo dev, go talk to the artists and audio people.

39
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:53,054
Talk to each other.

40
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:54,175
We hope you want to.

41
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:58,316
Making video games is a collaborative project for the most part.

42
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:02,917
And we think we gain more from connecting all the dots early on.

43
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:07,919
We also have to say that mostly we come from an indie background.

44
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:19,886
None of us have really done much work on AAA, which means that we don't know much about them, but judging from their output, their power does seem to lie in impressive craftsmanship and the band's big budgets.

45
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:30,692
However, as indies, we mostly feel that the cool thing that we can do is affording to try the big, weird, spiky and cranky ideas, which we also want to argue is our strength in this talk.

46
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,657
Okay, indulge us in a little experiment here.

47
00:03:34,737 --> 00:03:37,037
We'd like some participation from you guys.

48
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:43,679
So, before we start going into our points, let's try to do a yellow clap.

49
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,079
That's a tiny, slow clap, like this.

50
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,840
Yes, careful.

51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,440
And then, an applause.

52
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,661
That's an orange clap.

53
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:54,261
It's like this.

54
00:03:58,602 --> 00:03:59,182
But in a...

55
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,202
What comes in between of these two?

56
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:04,243
Can we try it?

57
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:04,964
Let's try it.

58
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:05,464
Yeah.

59
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:06,906
Tiny clap again.

60
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:15,633
Yes.

61
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:25,982
Okay.

62
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:26,523
Perfect.

63
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,264
That's really good.

64
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:27,684
Thank you.

65
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:37,336
So, why should you care about having good audio and art for your game?

66
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:46,960
Let's get into the problems that we all have to deal with because every day, especially I like, for instance, on Steam, there's about 50 games being released and it's very hard to break through this noise.

67
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,482
And even when it captures someone's attention, how do you leave them with a good impression?

68
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:54,763
Sad, sad clip.

69
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:01,664
So, how do you make an impression in the world of so many impressions?

70
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,665
We're consuming so many things every single day.

71
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:08,167
It's not just games, it's also series, apps, social media, etc.

72
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:11,709
Yeah, and we're all trying to make our project as best as we can.

73
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,513
We want to make the case for how our graphics and sound can capture and hold people's attention through this all.

74
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:20,534
So, how to make your game stand out?

75
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:26,378
We also have many opinions about this part, and there are many ways of thinking about this topic, so listen to our take coming now.

76
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,866
First of all, make a good game.

77
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:33,468
We don't really have a lot of say in this normally.

78
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:39,532
And you can definitely make a great game without caring about audio or art.

79
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:42,633
But if this is you, you're free to leave now.

80
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:43,954
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

81
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:47,556
We'll be waiting for two minutes while everyone leaves the room.

82
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:49,032
Identity.

83
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:51,893
The essence of the game is communicated and formulated through its identity.

84
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:55,454
Finding the direction of it all is establishing palettes, and that means both for sound and for color.

85
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:23,473
A screenshot should look like... Every screenshot in your game should look like your game.

86
00:06:24,913 --> 00:06:29,474
Although this is not a marketing talk, this can be a super handy tool for marketing as well.

87
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:33,695
You can clearly see that this is The Simpsons.

88
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:39,077
This is not even a screenshot, but you can still recognize them from a few LEGO blocks.

89
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:41,197
And this is South Park characters.

90
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:51,766
The IPs are using character design for the most part to have their identity be associated with them really strongly.

91
00:06:52,406 --> 00:06:53,467
This is a game example.

92
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:57,611
Limbo is very striking with its filmatic grayscale look and eerie atmosphere.

93
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:03,916
And the eyes of the protagonist is little creepy, glowy eyes.

94
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,978
Firewatch is not...

95
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:20,843
very stylized in its graphics but it keeps repeating this gradient throughout the game by utilizing light and color grading to make it look like fire or a sunset.

96
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,723
Then we have Matrix.

97
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:28,945
Matrix is very green and all of the movies are super green and you can always see it from any screenshots.

98
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,030
And that used to be the color of tech.

99
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,511
It's not anymore, but it used to be.

100
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:40,196
And they used the green and black in their digital reign, which I would argue is still iconic to this day.

101
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:40,597
Yeah.

102
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:46,301
Crafting through this philosophy, it makes you know what decisions benefit this direction and which do not.

103
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:51,688
To make indecisions, basically, we'll have a framework further down the line.

104
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:55,192
In the same way, we could say every clip should sound like a game.

105
00:07:55,492 --> 00:08:01,399
If you hear something like half a second from a trailer somewhere, it's really nice if you can go like, that is that game, I do know it.

106
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,726
And of course, since audio takes time to show, we're just going to show three quick clips I hope you all have heard before.

107
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:22,138
So games are pretty much often fully imagined worlds completely created by a team of quite competent creators.

108
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,383
The sounds should also be every bit as tailor-made and unique as anything else in this.

109
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:34,893
We're going to talk a little bit about how we make the decisions and what kind of decisions that we make.

110
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:42,044
For instance, with sound, with recognizable sound, personally I like to work out of two different constraints.

111
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:49,927
First of all, knowing the intentions behind the thing, what is it supposed to be doing, both in the game in the figurative sense, like what are you actually doing, but also what it's trying to convey.

112
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:54,789
But I'm also finding it really nice to have a set of rules and limitations.

113
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:57,130
And this is a good example of a limitation that I like.

114
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:11,812
So Hidden Folks is a hidden object game with only mouth sounds, which is very practical.

115
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:24,379
Basically, if you're having a mouth, if you have a microphone, it's quite simple that most teams could even kind of mostly get a decent result by just using this rule without even having a sound design on the team.

116
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,822
It's just a very good kind of limitation for its kind.

117
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,385
Then we have something like this, which is a more conceptual imitation.

118
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:37,788
And Among the Sleep is a narrative-driven horror-adventure game in which you have to play as a two-year-old child.

119
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:41,750
Here, the audio needs to get the player to feel really small and scared.

120
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,173
So, like, for instance, the sound needs to enhance this emotion due to the player.

121
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:49,904
Dragging a chair needs to feel like you're dragging an even bigger chair.

122
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:55,147
Like you're seeing this chair is three meters tall for you, but it needs to feel like you're dragging something which is like 10 meters long.

123
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:55,747
It's huge.

124
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,989
Seeing your mother lash out while drunk, it needs to feel incomprehensible and frightening.

125
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,770
As a limitation, this is a more open in a practical sense.

126
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:11,273
More things are allowed in that sense, but it does need to provide this way more importantly to drive home the narrative elements of it.

127
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:15,135
So, how do you pick the color and how do you pick the sound?

128
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:25,741
As we found out that our ways of working shared a lot of similarities, not while we did the Nordic Game Jam talks, we started delving further into our processes.

129
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:29,443
How do I pick my colors?

130
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,284
How does Martin pick his sounds?

131
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:34,666
And there we have a little demonstration of an example.

132
00:10:52,991 --> 00:11:06,584
This is Gunner 2, a game we both worked on and we focused on maintaining a little bit and elaborating the existing identity of the first game, pushing further the candy-like quality of the color palettes and the dark backgrounds makes everything glow in a

133
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:20,949
Yes, and alongside with the candy we want to give players something savory to listen to, so I like to think of the audio as popcorn.

134
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:27,812
It's kind of like you bring a scoop of a hand down in a bucket and you take a big swig of it, or you know, a bite I guess.

135
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:36,938
And you just want to continue and have more because it's salty, it's delightful, it's many many small things and maybe it doesn't really have to make sense, but it's all part of the kind of whole of it.

136
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:44,134
I'm

137
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:06,050
So, in the game Sunlight, we created the forest as a metaphor for humanity.

138
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,335
The harmony of the trees are speaking in unison, so each tree is a part of the story yet distinct its own.

139
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:17,359
Together they represent the narrative to you, the player, in a calm, serene pace as you walk around.

140
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:26,570
The serenity of the forest is underlined through its earthy greens and greens, creating a relaxing harmony in the colors.

141
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,631
The sunlight, of course, being at the center of attention, bringing it some warmth.

142
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:33,852
Another example.

143
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:40,374
Exploring the world with the wind in your whiskers.

144
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:50,013
Discovering new ingredients and flavors to make the best dishes ever.

145
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,783
Customizing your truck to your heart's desire.

146
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:10,416
So in the game Fruit Bus, it's a bright and whimsical game, and the fruits and the foods are at its core.

147
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:17,043
We explored how to make everything look delicious, and that bright color palette came out of that.

148
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:22,767
And from these visual choices, we went for a tasty blend of realism and abstract sounds.

149
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:25,709
And the reason for this is the game is quite a tangible game.

150
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:26,989
Everything in there has a purpose.

151
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:30,411
Like, for instance, if you drive a car, you better remember your handbrake, right?

152
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:37,073
So to give the player this idea that this world is tangible, we used realistic sounds to ground that.

153
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:39,955
And we used abstract sound to keep it feeling really good to interact with.

154
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:44,177
Oh, thank you.

155
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,037
Thank you so much.

156
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:45,377
Thank you.

157
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:46,558
We're not done, though.

158
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:46,998
We're not done.

159
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,209
So how do you find the essence?

160
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:59,175
You just find your themes, and this can be really abstract, and sometimes it can be really concrete, as we just talked about.

161
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:00,916
And then you just run with it.

162
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:03,778
Yeah, and keep reinforcing your own rules.

163
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:09,843
Essentially, if you keep repeating a concept of the rules you set throughout the process, you're doing it right.

164
00:14:09,943 --> 00:14:14,846
Remember the vision, and as everyone who's ever played everything knows, consistency trumps quality.

165
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,368
Consistency is quality, essentially.

166
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:19,257
Iterate.

167
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:19,737
Iterate.

168
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:20,217
Iterate.

169
00:14:20,597 --> 00:14:24,078
This is probably the only slide we haven't changed, which is kind of funny, but it is spot on.

170
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:28,319
So personal style and essence.

171
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,580
It is very important to know your taste.

172
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,181
Also for when choosing who to work with.

173
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:43,823
So when you're hiring or partnering up with somebody, it's much easier to work with them if they understand why the thing you're trying to make is really, really cool than not.

174
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:47,827
Here are some examples from my own style.

175
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:53,073
I don't really have a personal style per se, but I do have a taste and a color philosophy.

176
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:59,220
So you can see that you will get some sort of version of the bisexual color palette.

177
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,662
I think similar to Inna, I also have more of a process maybe than a style.

178
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:20,965
I do like to work quickly, destructively and exploratory, which means I seldom know what I'm doing, but I like doing it.

179
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:25,427
It also kind of ends up sometimes being something that is a bit...

180
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:34,756
Sometimes ends up standing a little bit beside the game not necessarily in it But kind of fits with the game in a way in again in a spike away, right?

181
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:44,686
So even though I might have a disregard of some of somewhat overall direction I might have my own idea of a direction that I keep and maintain and this keeps things feeling quite consistent in the end

182
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,298
So, making the pop stick.

183
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:15,413
So if you're working within the found essence, well, for using the identity to guide your decisions, how do we take this further, the next few steps?

184
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:22,197
If you make a memorable experience by applying with vibes, association and patterns, we think you're on a good course of something right.

185
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:27,043
In audio as well maybe, however I don't really quite know.

186
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,984
However, with audio, which I quite like, I often quite see it as a sort of player whisperer.

187
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:52,367
It tells the player a lot of things that they don't really necessarily think about.

188
00:16:52,807 --> 00:17:07,960
And even though I think quite a lot of people understand how music treats them and influences them, for instance with audio, I think that if you have something like a gun in a game, you can have a lot of information to the player by making the gun feel more or less powerful than the enemies around you.

189
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:17,065
If you're basically having a more powerful gun, you'll maybe have a little bit of a gun power fantasy, and maybe that will act... enforce how you behave in the game.

190
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:31,573
The other way, if you're doing it a more European, realistic, or like darker way, you're probably gonna feel more weak, and the gun is gonna be like, pew pew pew, feel like a peashooter, and that kind of influences you maybe crawling around to creeping a little bit more, maybe you're a bit more aware of the ammunition.

191
00:17:32,434 --> 00:17:40,726
In essence, it's a lot of these kind of things that I really geek out about when it comes to audio, which I hope most people don't notice because that also means I'm doing my job just right.

192
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:44,043
You can do similar things with colors.

193
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:49,484
You can use colors to enhance the feelings of your game.

194
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:58,126
You can easily underline a feeling by desaturating or intensifying a color, like low-key, while the player doesn't need to pay attention to it, they still feel it.

195
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:02,107
So you're guiding the player into their emotions.

196
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:17,326
So when designing Fruit Bus, we wanted to push the associations of delicious foods, while the agenda became making the game really comfortable and cozy.

197
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:21,010
And the game also has a little bit of surreal nature to it.

198
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:26,615
It's reflected in the colors and stuff, but it's also reflected in the environments.

199
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,901
Yes, and the delicious foods, darlings, it also is served with a hot plate of sounds.

200
00:18:31,482 --> 00:18:36,751
They complement the visuals by juicing up the interaction of cutting, slicing, cooking, goosing and flusing.

201
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:53,270
I'd like to explain a little bit about what's going on with the psychology of it all.

202
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:57,375
You've probably heard of bottom-up and top-down processing.

203
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:06,506
When you're doing bottom-up processing, you're seeing a bunch of things that are laid out in front of you, and you're trying to make...

204
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,248
Everything makes sense.

205
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:09,910
You're trying to make patterns within your brain.

206
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:18,019
And if it's top-down processing, you already have an idea about what's going on, and you are projecting that on whatever is in front of you.

207
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:19,561
And these, of course, play back and forth.

208
00:19:21,673 --> 00:19:28,836
Top-down processing can be playing of perceived expectations, like shorthand communication.

209
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:33,779
Color coding is a good example of this, color coding of rarity items.

210
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:45,124
Although there are some slight variations of these systems, it's very obvious for a player who plays within a genre to understand what is going on at the screen, and you get a lot for free.

211
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:49,754
Another example is how to convey that a door is locked.

212
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:51,716
It's quite simple with sound.

213
00:19:54,038 --> 00:20:01,363
A good little door knob rattle makes it go and work 100% of the time, conveying a sound without having to do much more.

214
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:07,468
And you can also set up expectations by making a pattern.

215
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:18,658
making the player rely on information that is being presented to them, making the stuff in-game pop a little bit, and this is an interplay between sound and vision.

216
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:22,760
Here comes a little example of a thing from Goner 2 again.

217
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:41,569
I really like that snake.

218
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,511
The snake is the exit and entrance to each level.

219
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:50,653
So you can easily spot its vivid body.

220
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:52,073
It stands out quite a lot.

221
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:58,396
And the color, it's coded to be like everything that is good and helpful within the game.

222
00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:03,278
And it also serves as a little pause in between levels.

223
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:15,523
Yeah, and the same thing in the sound is kind of helping out here is being that it goes from chaotic, it goes from like quite a multitude of things into like a very calm thing, everything stops, nothing plays anymore, and the music gets muted.

224
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:17,624
You can kind of hear... Oh yeah, never mind.

225
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:27,251
Our next point is that patterns of repetition works quite a lot.

226
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:34,546
And we know that because repetition works.

227
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:40,771
Repetition works.

228
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:48,779
This is Martin's joke, you don't have to... But it leads us into a really fun topic, which is...

229
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:52,891
Subverting expectations.

230
00:21:53,652 --> 00:22:01,501
So, another little example from Gunner 2 is the blue-toned, turquoise-toned grandma Death.

231
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:05,045
And I mean, she's Death, so she's a little bit intimidating.

232
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:09,470
But all in all, she is related to everything that is good in the world, because she's

233
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:19,153
turquoise and blue, and like, ammo flowers or the tree where you get the skulls from, which is a good thing in the game.

234
00:22:20,593 --> 00:22:23,394
Grandma Death is associated with a safe hub space.

235
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:27,035
And the enemies are generally coated with warm reds.

236
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:38,577
So, at the end, and this is a huge spoiler, I'm sorry, she appears as the last boss in the game, and it should feel a little bit like fighting your own granny.

237
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:43,365
Same thing with the game, usually upgrades are fun.

238
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:47,089
You get fun heads, you get fun guns.

239
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:53,335
However, we have a little joke which is the poop heads, which some players like, but essentially it's a game that gives you almost no health.

240
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:59,522
It makes you shoot bigger bullets and it kind of sounds a bit crummy when you do it, which makes that each sound is a little bit of a punchline.

241
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:06,985
This is another game that I worked on called Dead Pets Unleashed.

242
00:23:07,426 --> 00:23:15,316
And in the world, both the world and the protagonist are coded in purple and pink colors.

243
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,420
So this becomes a pattern throughout the game.

244
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:32,440
When you go into this environment, you can feel how out of place the character is without anybody saying anything because, well, this is very devoid of color.

245
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,502
Except for the little uplifting notes, which are pink.

246
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:41,843
Very subversive.

247
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:47,505
Mmm, subversive.

248
00:23:55,026 --> 00:24:00,730
Yes, because game direction is audio and art direction.

249
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:06,995
In theory, there is one person, one team that ensures that audio and visuals support each other and support the overall direction.

250
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:14,161
But in reality, it's sometimes not the case, at least in small indie teams where we're all wearing a bunch of different hats each day.

251
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:18,124
But it is up to us to talk together and figure this out, and this is how we suggest approaching this.

252
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:26,069
We came up with this talk from discovering how often we talk about the same stuff from two different angles.

253
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:28,971
And this talk itself is a result of communication.

254
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:35,615
Figure out what people on the team have strong opinions and wishes about for the projects.

255
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:39,258
How do they differ or concur from yours?

256
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:40,019
Yes.

257
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:44,682
In any case, we wish we talked together earlier in all cases, pretty much.

258
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,743
So please, please, please reach out to each other.

259
00:24:47,304 --> 00:24:48,665
And we're all working towards a common goal.

260
00:24:51,104 --> 00:24:55,965
So, in summary on this talk, remember to find your essence.

261
00:24:57,685 --> 00:24:59,665
Yes, the thing that makes your game special.

262
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,546
Practice making rules and limitations.

263
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:07,227
Remember to stick with it, repeat, stick with it, repeat, stick with it, repeat, and enhance.

264
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:08,607
Make it pop.

265
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:11,087
It popped.

266
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:14,008
Be yourself.

267
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:15,348
Remember your tastes.

268
00:25:15,668 --> 00:25:16,348
They're what you want.

269
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,969
They're also what other people want from you.

270
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:19,789
Make patterns happen.

271
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:24,407
It can be powerful to know when to subvert them.

272
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:26,389
Get talking early on.

273
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:27,410
Yes, talk.

274
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:28,511
It's very nice.

275
00:25:29,172 --> 00:25:30,573
And involve art and audio.

276
00:25:30,954 --> 00:25:34,697
Me and Inna make them communicate, make them write the talk together.

277
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:35,538
It's pretty funny.

278
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:39,142
And also, I guess this is also how you make something sound yellow.

279
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:50,824
It's also how you trick people into giving you an applause.

280
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:54,988
I hope we made a good impression.

281
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:59,012
And more than anything, we hope we stood out to you in a memorable way.

282
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:10,482
All right.

283
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:12,564
I believe we have four minutes maybe for Q&A.

284
00:26:12,624 --> 00:26:12,765
Yeah.

285
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:20,468
So if anyone has a question, please come up to the microphone now or be forever quiet unless you see us in the park outside at some point.

286
00:26:24,512 --> 00:26:35,822
What are some tools for the sound creation side that you recommend for people that like don't have the resources or could, it's like a luxury to have like a sound designer on their team.

287
00:26:35,842 --> 00:26:39,385
So like wearing many hats kind of thing, like what tools do you recommend?

288
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:42,277
Oh yeah, I think this is a question we often get.

289
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:52,626
In essentially like for small teams you mean that doesn't really have a sound designer how to be able to do it.

290
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:58,511
I think trying to figure out interesting limitations, sticking to like single piece of gears.

291
00:26:59,512 --> 00:27:01,554
There's for instance cheap synthesizers that are free.

292
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:11,864
There's online tools that runs on Chrome for instance that you can like spam coin sound and it will create you like 15 variations of that that you can download and use for your game.

293
00:27:11,984 --> 00:27:15,868
I always say that of course if you find something fun that you can do.

294
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:20,951
It's kind of the best, especially if it's something you do yourself.

295
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:24,053
For instance, running around like crazy with a mobile phone.

296
00:27:25,334 --> 00:27:28,235
In general, you can end up with a lot of fun sounds.

297
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,938
And you can find some free software to cut it up.

298
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:35,399
You can put it into your game, and it's going to be fine.

299
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,381
I think the main thing is just mostly about balance.

300
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:45,605
If you really, really, really take the audio volume down low when you test things, you can hear if it's really sticking out too loud or too low.

301
00:27:46,385 --> 00:27:50,188
And the rest is just gonna be make sure you have fun with it, make sure you spend enough time with it.

302
00:27:50,508 --> 00:27:51,349
It really is about time.

303
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,449
Thank you.

304
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:52,990
Thank you.

305
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:55,151
Hello, Tess.

306
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:55,532
Okay, good.

307
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:58,614
I have a question about like communicating in general.

308
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:00,916
I'm a programmer by trade.

309
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:06,239
So I often like to talk to my, with my like artists and sound designers.

310
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,382
And we often like try to communicate from different ends.

311
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:13,345
So it's like we often end up these metaphorical question like, I want this

312
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:20,428
like the scene to feel more like dark and gloomy and atmospheric, but I don't know exactly how to describe it at times.

313
00:28:20,848 --> 00:28:24,510
What do you think is like very helpful in terms like when describing more concretely?

314
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,552
I always recommend using references.

315
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:32,755
So if you have something very specific in mind, try to find that reference.

316
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:36,136
Don't be afraid to like riff off something that already exists.

317
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:38,678
You will make it you, like it doesn't really matter.

318
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:41,359
Do you have something on the sound side?

319
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:42,420
Exactly what Ines is saying.

320
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,804
For audio, it helps quite often to just go to YouTube, find a video, find a reference saying like, this is kind of what I want.

321
00:28:48,924 --> 00:28:51,506
If you give them three different things, they will kind of triangulate that.

322
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,467
That's the job, basically.

323
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,768
Also, please let us know when it's the last question.

324
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:56,450
I think we have time for at least one more.

325
00:28:58,851 --> 00:28:59,051
Okay.

326
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:02,073
Okay.

327
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:03,274
Thank you.

328
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:03,895
Thanks so much.

329
00:29:07,357 --> 00:29:08,858
Okay, we'll be in the wrap-up area.

330
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:11,060
Thank you so much again, and see you in the park.
