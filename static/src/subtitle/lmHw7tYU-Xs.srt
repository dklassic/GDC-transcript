Hi, I'm Joan. And I'm Tom.

2
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:04,891
We are documentary filmmakers and VR creators.

3
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:11,273
We've been working on a VR documentary that's about a very personal, emotional, and non-easy subject.

4
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:13,774
Part of it is shooting interviews with people.

5
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:17,635
We chose for it initially this technique, volumetric capture,

6
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:21,115
but pretty quickly we discovered that it's not enough for us.

7
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:24,076
What we found is that it wasn't lifelike enough.

8
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:25,657
So we've had to develop a...

9
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:32,208
technique to combine 3D cinematography with volumetric video and we'll be talking about it as a part of our presentation.

10
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:39,473
Our presentation is part of the VR Entertainment track at GDC and it will be on Monday 440 p.m.

11
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,354
Rome Tow to South Hall.

12
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:45,557
We also have time at the Canada booth on Wednesday at 2 p.m.

13
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:51,621
So you'll be able to see a demo there. So please come to our talk. We would love to see you all. See you at GDC!
