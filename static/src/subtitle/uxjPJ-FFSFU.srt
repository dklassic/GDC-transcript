1
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:09,646
So about this talk, not to flatter myself or anything,

2
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:13,028
but if this is not the most important talk you will hear,

3
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:17,070
if this is not the most important talk you're

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,671
going to hear at this conference,

5
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:20,071
this is certainly the most relevant.

6
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:23,733
There is not a single aspect of game development

7
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:25,173
that does not touch an IP.

8
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:30,156
So to that extent, here we go.

9
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:32,056
So as far as who I am.

10
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,522
I work with Interactive Entertainment Law Group.

11
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:39,763
We are based out of El Segundo, California, which is quite nearby.

12
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:45,086
And we represent game developers almost exclusively.

13
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:49,627
Almost all of our clients are interactive entertainment clients.

14
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:55,029
independent developers, we have publishers, we have

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,691
you know, just designers in and of themselves, but we represent

16
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:03,892
all aspects of the game development community, whether it be mobile, console,

17
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:06,713
digital sales, straight to PC.

18
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:10,994
So this is what we do. This is our stock and trade, and

19
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:16,016
almost everything that we do involves IP transactions.

20
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:19,437
So that includes licensing, which is something that we're going to go into quite a bit here.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,181
So this is just to give you an idea of what we are going to cover.

22
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:28,962
First I'm going to give you kind of a summary of what intellectual property is.

23
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:34,183
I'm going to try to let the slides speak for themselves and just harp on the points that

24
00:01:34,223 --> 00:01:35,584
you need to take away from this.

25
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:41,685
Otherwise this talk could go on for about five or six hours and nobody wants to deal

26
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:42,025
with that.

27
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:48,347
So after that we're going to talk about how to protect your IP and what your IP portfolio

28
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:48,847
actually is.

29
00:01:49,147 --> 00:01:51,348
So you have an idea of what it is you're trying to protect.

30
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:59,482
So the first thing that we have to take into consideration

31
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:02,388
is going to be, what are intellectual property rights?

32
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:03,851
What are these rights that we're talking about?

33
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:07,073
And the one thing that you really

34
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:10,375
need to take away from this is that there

35
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:12,096
is no straightforward answer when

36
00:02:12,136 --> 00:02:13,477
it comes to intellectual property.

37
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:16,019
It's something that you can't really touch.

38
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:17,499
You can't really get your hands on.

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,621
And quite frankly, neither can the law.

40
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:24,024
So there are a lot of different considerations

41
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:25,825
that come into play whenever we're

42
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,486
talking about intellectual property.

43
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:29,947
And the most common answer you will ever

44
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,389
hear to any question you ask any lawyer is going to be,

45
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:33,950
it depends.

46
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:35,878
I'm sorry, it depends.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,924
There is no yes or no when it comes to intellectual property

48
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:40,165
law.

49
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:43,069
So everything is going to be on a case by case basis.

50
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:49,508
There are certain types of IP, obviously.

51
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,690
I think most people are probably pretty familiar

52
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,292
with the big three, which is copyright, trademark, patent.

53
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:56,294
These are the ones that we always hear about.

54
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:57,635
It's part of the TRIPS agreement.

55
00:02:57,695 --> 00:03:00,137
It's something that you see talked about every day

56
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:02,598
when we hear about, you know, trademark issues

57
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:05,981
in the King case, patent trolls, things like that.

58
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:10,284
But there are also a lot of non-federal IP issues

59
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,625
that come into play, and, you know.

60
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:21,018
So the ones that don't really get talked about as much, although there has been some issues recently with the whole Oculus Rift trade secret issue.

61
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,703
By and large, they don't really get as much attention as they should.

62
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:29,249
And that's kind of a problem because when it comes down to cases, literally...

63
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:36,718
A common law case for a name and likeness or defamation issue is going to be just as costly

64
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:38,760
and troublesome as a copyright claim.

65
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:43,964
So it's important to bear in mind that the entire body of intellectual property law is something

66
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:45,265
that you need to be mindful of.

67
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:50,629
So first question is, what is copyright?

68
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:55,973
You have the textbook explanation here, which is why I want to briefly look it over.

69
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,132
The one thing that you really need to pay attention to here is that original does not necessarily mean unique.

70
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:09,233
Just because it's something that you've created originally, there is something called independent origin,

71
00:04:09,273 --> 00:04:16,375
which means that two people can create identical works so long as neither one has access to one another.

72
00:04:16,415 --> 00:04:17,875
There is no copyright infringement.

73
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:21,396
So that's something to bear in mind. Original does not mean unique.

74
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:29,053
And the other thing that you absolutely have to pay attention to with this is it has to be fixed.

75
00:04:29,113 --> 00:04:31,735
It actually has to be in some sort of physical medium.

76
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:38,118
You have to be able to physically touch it or see it or have some record of your work.

77
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,061
So what are copyrights?

78
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:47,863
This is kind of the plain English version of what copyrights are.

79
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:49,764
It goes beyond Eureka.

80
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,092
One of the most dangerous things,

81
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:53,633
a thing that I hear all too often,

82
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,694
one of the most dangerous things a developer can say is,

83
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:58,615
let me tell you my game idea,

84
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:00,556
whenever they haven't done anything with it.

85
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:02,057
And the reason that is,

86
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:05,038
is because there is no protection for your idea,

87
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:07,319
especially if you're broadcasting it.

88
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,680
There is no copyright protection,

89
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,761
there is no trademark protection.

90
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:15,228
But you don't have any real protections for your ideas.

91
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,730
So let me tell you about my game idea.

92
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,471
It's not something that you ever want to say as a developer.

93
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:27,795
As far as the methods of fixation, as you can see,

94
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:29,155
you have books, saved documents.

95
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:33,678
It's so long as you have some record

96
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:35,418
of your copyrighted work, something

97
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:37,399
that you can submit to the copyright office

98
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,420
if you decide to register.

99
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,921
you will be protected so long as it's obviously not infringing.

100
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:44,421
It has to be for a legal purpose.

101
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,582
So that's another thing to keep in mind.

102
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:49,743
If your work is in and of itself infringing,

103
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:54,745
you're probably not going to obtain the types of protections

104
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:55,325
that you want.

105
00:05:58,277 --> 00:05:59,697
So what copyright is not?

106
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:01,058
As I said, it's not your idea.

107
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,098
This is an issue that I have to harp on a lot,

108
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:08,099
because this is the most common area where people get confused.

109
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,159
Like, this is my idea.

110
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,299
They stole my idea.

111
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,060
Isn't it protected by copyright?

112
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,100
Well, no, it's not, unless you've actually

113
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
done something with it.

114
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,681
And even a treatment, things like that.

115
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:20,161
And what I mean by treatment, if you're not quite familiar,

116
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:25,302
it's basically like a summary or a design document,

117
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:26,642
a good example.

118
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:30,965
Something like that can give you the requisite copyright protection that you need.

119
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:36,569
But until you've taken your work or your idea to that stage, you're not going to be entitled

120
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:38,531
to the type of protection that you probably want.

121
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:46,796
As far as what else it is, it can't be something that you can use.

122
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,518
It can't be useful.

123
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:55,802
It can't be a product or service, for example.

124
00:06:56,547 --> 00:07:01,910
It has to be something that is purely creative and useless,

125
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:08,573
in the simplest way to put it.

126
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:12,935
And I don't want people to get confused by this.

127
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:17,837
What I mean by that is that you can have creative components in a useful product.

128
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:19,738
For example...

129
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:24,549
The Coke bottle is a good example of a lot of things.

130
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:34,493
And one of the ways is the actual design of the Coke bottle itself is separable from the function of the Coke bottle.

131
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:43,477
So to a certain extent, maybe not copyright, but there are going to be certain protections to that design itself that you're going to want to,

132
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,978
that you need to take into consideration whenever.

133
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:52,787
So another thing, it's not perpetual.

134
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:58,391
You do have a limited term. So 90 years from the life of the author.

135
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:00,213
120 years from publication.

136
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:06,338
Oh, what I was going to say about the usefulness.

137
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:10,481
A good example, probably the best example that we can talk about here

138
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:13,563
is game mechanics versus the creative content of a game.

139
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:17,026
So the mechanics themselves are going to be considered

140
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:21,879
I'll talk about software patents later,

141
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,381
but there's always going to be an issue.

142
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:26,122
Mechanics are never going to be copyrightable

143
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:29,585
because they are a method, they are a process,

144
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,306
they are something that is useful.

145
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:36,731
But the creative elements, the characters, your story,

146
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,813
the world you create, the music that you use,

147
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:42,255
these are things that are going to be copyrightable

148
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:45,238
and they kind of make your work distinct.

149
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,741
and they give you the copyright protection that you want.

150
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:57,143
So what is copyright infringement? There are a few forms of infringement, and the requirements

151
00:08:57,163 --> 00:09:01,785
that I have here are for direct infringement. But you also have contributory and vicarious

152
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:07,287
infringement. A vicarious infringement typically revolves around having a financial stake in

153
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,869
that infringement, and contributory infringement involves actively facilitating that infringement.

154
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:16,270
So it's a slightly different standard from direct.

155
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:19,844
The direct infringer is the one who's actually doing the copying.

156
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:25,068
The vicarious and contributory infringers, I'm sure you guys have probably heard of Napster

157
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:25,789
and Grokster.

158
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:27,690
That's where we hear about these things.

159
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:33,435
That's where you're going to have your vicarious and contributory infringement.

160
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:41,140
So what are the rights you get whenever you get a copyright?

161
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,481
Because it's not something, it's not a property right.

162
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:44,121
Well, it is.

163
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:46,542
But it's not a physical property right.

164
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,442
It's not like you get a deed or a title.

165
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:51,984
It's not something that you can physically take a hold

166
00:09:52,044 --> 00:09:52,984
of and carry with you.

167
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:58,386
It's intangible, which is a problem in a lot of cases.

168
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,326
Because unless you have some record

169
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:05,468
of that intellectual property, it's difficult to prove.

170
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:12,625
So as far as the rights that you get, obviously the right to reproduce, the one thing that

171
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:16,326
I really want you to take away here, apart from derivative works, just be mindful of

172
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:20,188
what a derivative work is, is moral rights and author's rights.

173
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:25,230
And I say that because they are not commercial and they tie directly to the author.

174
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,452
So even if you have a work for hire agreement, for instance, if you're outsourcing to a

175
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:37,950
another company to do some work product for you, or if you are contracting with an independent

176
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:46,773
contractor based out of Europe, there are going to be a body of rights that those individuals

177
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,334
have that even if they have a work for hire agreement with you, which is something that

178
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:57,536
we go into in licensing, you can't get rid of those rights. They're difficult to...

179
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:01,290
to wave away, they're difficult to push away in any way.

180
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,494
So you need to have some sort of workaround in your agreements

181
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:11,578
that deals with those rights and how to address them

182
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,641
so that they can't come back later on and tell you, OK,

183
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:19,484
well, we want you to pull this because we feel that it does not

184
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,947
adequately represent what we wanted to create.

185
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,531
So a couple of notes.

186
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:29,972
Defenses.

187
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:34,835
I don't harp a lot on this because at the end of the day,

188
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,397
you have to bear in mind that it's a defense, which means

189
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:38,778
that somebody has to sue you first.

190
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,860
And ideally, if you're a developer, you don't want it

191
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,181
to ever get to that point.

192
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:47,164
You never want to be the target of a lawsuit.

193
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:50,606
But as far as what defenses can be raised, as I said

194
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,447
before, independent origin is a big one.

195
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:56,070
Senate fair is kind of another thing that.

196
00:11:56,489 --> 00:12:01,430
you need to take into consideration. And that's something that's really, really common. It's

197
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:07,972
kind of common to a genre. So the example that you might want to say is like a zombie

198
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:14,214
horror flick and the way that zombies move and things like that can be considered

199
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:21,336
Santa Fe. And that will take it outside of the scope of copyright protection.

200
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:26,477
nominally uses whenever a use is so minuscule that it's not really an issue.

201
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:29,058
And there are also exceptions.

202
00:12:29,138 --> 00:12:34,920
And every few years, the Copyright Office re-evaluates these exceptions and adds new

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,100
ones.

204
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,121
And the most recent ones this year happen to be parity and private copies.

205
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:44,303
Note that these were not in the actual DMCA until this year.

206
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:50,545
So while these usually fell under the purview of fair use and could be raised as a defense,

207
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,002
Now they fall squarely within the copyright exceptions,

208
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:56,704
which means that you can't really bring a claim even

209
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,228
if it qualifies as a parody or if it qualifies

210
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:02,008
as a private copy.

211
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,850
Now the problem with that is that what is a parody?

212
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:10,775
And this is something that is highly disputed

213
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:15,118
and it varies from country to country,

214
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,620
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, circuit to circuit.

215
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:22,955
the EU standard of parodies is going to be very different from the

216
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:26,556
United States standard of parodies because we have very different senses of humor.

217
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:31,498
But, yeah, so

218
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:35,559
again, this is where I have to say it depends. You don't know

219
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,480
until it gets litigated.

220
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:45,203
But it is a clearly stated exception now, so it's something that you can

221
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:51,381
you know, take to the bank with you if you do plan on implementing parities and the way

222
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:54,843
that you market your product or any way that you execute your product.

223
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,446
Moving on, we've got trademarks.

224
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:02,389
This is again the legal definition.

225
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:03,490
I'm not going to recite it.

226
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:07,953
The easiest way to understand trademarks

227
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:15,114
said it is your brand. It is how you market yourself. It is how people identify you in

228
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:22,677
the marketplace. It is your logo. It is the way that your goodwill is reflected on the

229
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:30,100
world. And you have some examples here. Some really interesting examples are going to be

230
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,621
things like sound marks, and those are really fun. I did a talk on that pretty recently,

231
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:35,282
actually.

232
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:42,501
It's interesting how much audio plays a role in how we recognize things.

233
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:45,644
I had some examples like the Lord of the Rings music.

234
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:47,766
Like, da, da, da, da, da, da.

235
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:52,110
Things like that can qualify you for trademark protection.

236
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,013
Some other things that are pretty useful are trade dress.

237
00:14:56,885 --> 00:15:00,406
And the cool thing about TradeDress, as far as your IP portfolio goes,

238
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:02,467
is that it can cover a lot of things.

239
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,708
It can cover the look and feel of your product,

240
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,589
the types of colors that you use, like your color scheme,

241
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:11,210
which may not be original enough to qualify for copyright protection.

242
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:13,771
It can qualify you for TradeDress.

243
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:18,413
So I have... I represent a lot of app developers.

244
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,534
I spent a lot of time representing app developers when I started out.

245
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:26,503
A lot of apps are really, really simple.

246
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:28,324
Like, stupidly simple.

247
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,765
But they're a lot of fun and people like them.

248
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:33,887
And they are very easy to infringe upon.

249
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,749
And you can't always claim copyright protection

250
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:38,389
to some of this stuff.

251
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,710
Because sometimes the only thing they seem to claim

252
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,392
are going to be the mechanics and maybe

253
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:47,214
some of the look and feel elements, like the UI.

254
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:53,905
Trade dress is a very good idea, and trademark and unfair competition law is a very good

255
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:59,729
way to protect those particular elements that fall outside of copyright protection, but

256
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:02,851
you still want to be able to send a cease and desist letter out for.

257
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:13,297
So what is the trademark infringement standard? I also want to point out that trademarks don't

258
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:17,180
really have a term. They exist for as long as you use them.

259
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,850
Now they can be abandoned.

260
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,192
And the typical term for abandonment is three to five

261
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:23,532
years.

262
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:25,512
And I'm not saying this just for the US.

263
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,233
That is internationally.

264
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,214
Egypt, I think, is five years.

265
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:33,235
But most other countries are about three to five.

266
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:38,397
So abandonment just means that you're not using it

267
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:39,057
in commerce.

268
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,718
And token uses don't qualify.

269
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:44,059
So you actually have to be actively using your brand

270
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,920
in commerce for it to qualify for trademark protection.

271
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:55,027
It's actually something that is going back as far as what it is.

272
00:16:56,588 --> 00:17:02,533
The really important thing to note about trademarks is that you actually have to be using it in

273
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:03,213
commerce.

274
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:08,177
And whether that means you're using it to market your product, you have to be selling

275
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:09,819
something under it, essentially.

276
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,403
And that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to earn a profit.

277
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:17,283
A lot of people don't.

278
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:19,823
It also doesn't mean that it doesn't apply to non-profits

279
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:20,564
and things like that.

280
00:17:21,784 --> 00:17:23,125
When I say selling, it means that it

281
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:25,345
has to be generating some kind of goodwill.

282
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,327
That's how I like to think about it in terms of actually

283
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:31,668
procuring trademark protection.

284
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:35,269
Even if you're not receiving income from it right now,

285
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:38,870
so long as you are marketing a product or service that

286
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,411
is generating goodwill and that is generating

287
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:50,927
connection with your product or the thing that you're doing, that can qualify you for

288
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:57,611
trademark protection. So just registering your logo without actually using it or without

289
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:02,674
actually creating that brand and marketing and creating that affiliation between your

290
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:07,577
product and the logo isn't going to be sufficient. And I'll talk about registration here in a

291
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:14,681
bit. So what is trademark infringement? Like copyright infringement, it does kind of have

292
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:16,442
a strict liability element to it.

293
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:19,785
And that is the likelihood of confusion standard.

294
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:24,047
So even if you're not intending to infringe on somebody's mark,

295
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:30,071
you can still be prohibited from using your own mark in commerce

296
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:33,573
because it creates that likelihood of confusion.

297
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,954
And what that typically means is,

298
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:40,176
would the ordinary consumer look at those two brands,

299
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,838
like look at two competing brands or two brands that are

300
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:48,798
in a related marketplace or competitors,

301
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:50,259
would they be confused?

302
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,880
And this kind of, it is not related,

303
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,201
it is not limited to strictly competing marks, right?

304
00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:02,584
Anything that qualifies as like a related class

305
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:03,964
can create that problem.

306
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,505
And now when we're talking about famous marks,

307
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,206
when we're talking about Sony,

308
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,047
when we're talking about Coca-Cola,

309
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:11,667
when we're talking about Pepsi.

310
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:16,871
you have this other element of dilution and tarnishment.

311
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:20,153
And dilution comes into play whenever,

312
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:22,535
even if it's not in a related market,

313
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:25,898
if you use the brand name, it can be prohibited.

314
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,361
And tarnishment is obviously, you know,

315
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:31,923
certain kinds of disparagement or associating a product,

316
00:19:32,324 --> 00:19:34,846
associating a brand with a product

317
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:38,409
that might create some kind of disparagement

318
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,330
to that product or to that brand.

319
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,298
Trademark law is not limited to just trademarks.

320
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:46,458
It's part of the Lanham Act.

321
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,802
And so it also implies certain levels of unfair competition.

322
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:57,124
Unfair competition is exactly what it sounds like.

323
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:09,551
It is some kind of fraud, some kind of implicitly wrong act.

324
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:11,992
And while there are legal standards to this,

325
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,706
It is kind of vague.

326
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,507
It is kind of somewhat open-ended as far

327
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:18,588
as what constitutes as unfair.

328
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:20,748
There are obviously some standards.

329
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:24,070
It can't just be ordinarily, like the things that

330
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,331
happen during the ordinary course of business

331
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,971
and ordinary course of competition.

332
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:30,092
It has to be kind of a step up above that,

333
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:35,534
whether it be openly disparaging your competitor in a way

334
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:38,995
that is untruthful.

335
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:43,761
For example, any kind of fraud is obviously going to implicate unfair competition.

336
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:47,223
And then obviously, counterfeiting goods, counterfeiting marks.

337
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:52,246
And I raise unfair competition because the Trademark Act only applies to registered marks.

338
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,688
So you don't get full trademark protection unless you've registered.

339
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:02,493
Now moving on to patents.

340
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:04,774
There are three different types of patents.

341
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:09,479
the only ones that we really pay attention to are utility and design because plant patents

342
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,121
literally mean physical plants. I don't know, well, plants versus zombies would not apply.

343
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:23,743
But utility and design patents are very, very relevant to the games industry. We see a lot

344
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:31,005
of litigation coming out from various big names concerning utility patents, controllers,

345
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:32,685
any kind of hardware that people develop.

346
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:38,633
Design patents less so. A lot of people don't go in for design patents because there is

347
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:43,975
considerable overlap between design patents and copyright and trademark. It kind of protects

348
00:21:43,995 --> 00:21:52,318
some of the same elements and some of the same infringement standards are used. So trademark

349
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:59,921
protection and design patents do tend to overlap a lot. Not many patent attorneys that I know

350
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:00,442
generally

351
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:05,014
go into recommending design patents unless there is a pressing reason to do so.

352
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:15,660
Utility patents, on the other hand, are very important, not just if you decide to go into

353
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,863
the business or if you are in the business of developing hardware, but also if you are

354
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:25,026
licensing hardware or if you are in the business of manufacturing such things.

355
00:22:28,742 --> 00:22:29,682
It has to be useful.

356
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:33,185
Business methods actually are patentable.

357
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:36,408
So are, to some extent, software patents.

358
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,949
And I'm going to go into that here in a bit.

359
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,592
But the key elements is that it has to be new.

360
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:45,875
It can't be something that's been created before.

361
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:49,878
It has to be non-obvious to a person in that field.

362
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:51,139
And it has to be useful.

363
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,363
So anything that is patentable is not

364
00:22:55,403 --> 00:22:56,764
copyrightable, and vice versa.

365
00:22:57,589 --> 00:22:59,291
Those two are mutually exclusive.

366
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:06,944
And I don't think the term for utility patents has changed.

367
00:23:07,024 --> 00:23:09,268
The term for design patents has, however.

368
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:10,570
It used to be.

369
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:16,604
14 years. It was 14 years for quite some time, and just recently they added a year.

370
00:23:16,784 --> 00:23:21,847
And I could not begin to tell you why. Just a heads up, we don't do a lot of patent work.

371
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:27,650
I have a sociology, social psychology double major, so I never will unless I go back to school.

372
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:32,913
But you have to have a scientific background in order to do that.

373
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:42,058
But I do have enough understanding to tell you when you might need a patent and when

374
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:50,284
patent infringement might be an issue.

375
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:56,789
There are some differences, at least as far as copyright goes, for a design patent.

376
00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:01,913
A lot like trademark, it is strict liability, but also it doesn't require access, which

377
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:03,655
is another element of the trademark thing.

378
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,817
They more overlap with trademark than with patent.

379
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:22,194
Copyright. I'll give you some time to read this because it's kind of dense.

380
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:33,779
This is probably the most contentious issue for patent law in our industry. Software problems

381
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,620
are kind of problematic.

382
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:43,503
And it's not always easy to tell when a software patent applies.

383
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:47,827
I don't really want to spend a lot of time talking about this, because this in and of

384
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:49,568
itself is worth a talk.

385
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:54,232
And I just don't have time to start going down this road.

386
00:24:54,432 --> 00:25:01,798
But if you do have questions about the software patent issue, obviously after the talk, whenever

387
00:25:01,838 --> 00:25:03,700
we have some questions, you can raise those.

388
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,579
So what is patent infringement?

389
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:11,059
Again, you kind of have the strict liability thing.

390
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:15,020
What I mean by strict liability is that it's not intentional.

391
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,601
A lot of federal, a lot of criminal claims,

392
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:24,622
a lot of tortious claims, all of those require intent.

393
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:28,003
You have to have a certain mindfulness to do that.

394
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:29,843
Now, mindfulness does come into play,

395
00:25:29,943 --> 00:25:32,644
or being aware of the infringement

396
00:25:32,684 --> 00:25:34,344
does come into play whenever.

397
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:41,769
you know what you're doing is wrong and you're doing it, you know, you're doing it in bad

398
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:47,710
faith because it plays into damages. A lot of courts are obviously going to award punitive

399
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:54,751
damages in the event that you are acting in bad faith. You can limit your, while it is

400
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:59,472
a strict liability tort and you know you can get injunctions imposed against you from doing

401
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:04,433
it, you can limit the harm to yourself by showing that you know it was an accident.

402
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:07,205
officer I didn't mean to just be that.

403
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:15,447
Okay, so moving on.

404
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,128
Personality rights.

405
00:26:20,468 --> 00:26:20,908
This is

406
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:26,550
kind of a fun area of the law because again it is kind of a

407
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,871
it depends thing it literally changes from state to state

408
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:32,211
and not just

409
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:37,234
I mean, just the names of whether or not,

410
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:38,954
like name and likeness and appropriation,

411
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:40,215
totally interchangeable.

412
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,475
Depends on the state you're in.

413
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,536
Right of privacy less so.

414
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:48,397
Intrusion is kind of self-explanatory.

415
00:26:50,297 --> 00:26:53,918
There are a few overlaps, but actually very careful

416
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:57,019
distinctions between things like public disclosure

417
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,699
of private facts and false light, defamation.

418
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:04,380
A lot of it comes down to whether there is economic harm.

419
00:27:05,803 --> 00:27:10,165
A lot of it comes down to whether it is more injury to the individual from a psychological

420
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:10,725
standpoint.

421
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:16,428
And that's kind of the difference between publicity rights and privacy rights in general.

422
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:19,890
Publicity rights are almost exclusively economic and commercial.

423
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:26,494
Privacy rights are almost exclusively, you should really hurt my feelings and you know,

424
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:33,358
you caused me a lot of personal harm, caused me a lot of psychological damage.

425
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:40,329
As far as publicity rights go, when I say it's commercial, I mean that the person,

426
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:43,230
their stock and trade is their name.

427
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,051
You have like celebrities are a great example where a name and likeness issue comes up.

428
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:55,393
I actually was speaking with somebody yesterday about the Lindsay Lohanhan GTA case

429
00:27:55,513 --> 00:28:01,095
where she's claiming that her name and likeness is being used in that game.

430
00:28:03,735 --> 00:28:05,196
As far as raising the defamation...

431
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:11,021
issue, there's always defamation-proof characters and we have an example of one right there.

432
00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:24,126
But what is defamation? The biggest thing I want you to take away from defamation is

433
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:30,868
one, it has to actually be published. It's not something that you say to that person.

434
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:34,850
It has to be something that you share with third parties. It has to be something that

435
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,430
you publish.

436
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:42,215
Another thing is, it has to be stated as a fact, so it can't just be your opinion.

437
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:47,397
You can have a really negative opinion about somebody, you can say some horrendous things

438
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:55,361
about another human being, provided you don't move into the threat category.

439
00:28:57,425 --> 00:28:59,647
you can say some terrible things about another person,

440
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:04,389
and so long as it's couched in the form of an opinion,

441
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:06,490
there's very little anybody can do about it.

442
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:11,433
Now, if you imply anything that even touches on a possible fact

443
00:29:11,953 --> 00:29:13,534
or assumes that something is true,

444
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:15,275
then you trigger defamation.

445
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,316
So that's something that you need to be careful of.

446
00:29:17,816 --> 00:29:21,138
And this isn't limited to just how you say it,

447
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,799
because this isn't just limited to words.

448
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:24,640
It's how you portray people.

449
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,341
So if you're using a...

450
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:32,306
a particular likeness of somebody in your game and you are portraying that likeness

451
00:29:32,366 --> 00:29:42,535
or that parody of a person in a way that implies that that person is actually like that to

452
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:48,921
an extent that it is disparaging, it can create some kind of commercial or psychological harm,

453
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:54,206
you run the risk of being the target of a defamation suit.

454
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:58,835
Honestly, the threshold issue is if they are pissed off enough

455
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:00,936
to bring a legal claim against you,

456
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:03,277
it's already kind of a problem.

457
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:06,439
As I said, while you can't always be risk averse,

458
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,601
to the extent that you can limit creating

459
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:14,603
these issues for yourself, you should.

460
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:17,725
There are defenses, obviously.

461
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,387
Truth, to that extent, the whole defamation proof thing

462
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:22,147
comes up.

463
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,488
If somebody really is a horrible person.

464
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:27,524
And they have done horrible things, and you can show that.

465
00:30:28,385 --> 00:30:29,965
Well, not much you can do about it.

466
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,227
Also, consent.

467
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:34,868
Consent is kind of a tricky issue,

468
00:30:34,908 --> 00:30:37,349
because what constitutes consent?

469
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:43,052
If somebody gives you a license to use their name and likeness,

470
00:30:43,652 --> 00:30:47,934
how far can you go with that as far as a defamation claim is

471
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:48,435
concerned?

472
00:30:48,855 --> 00:30:51,196
So that's something that you need to take into consideration

473
00:30:51,256 --> 00:30:51,716
as well.

474
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:54,798
Accident.

475
00:30:56,412 --> 00:30:58,874
Kind of a trickier issue in and of itself,

476
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:01,737
just because how do you prove that it's an accident?

477
00:31:01,797 --> 00:31:04,659
I mean, you're saying, how do you

478
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:10,564
show that you did not know that it was false, right?

479
00:31:11,545 --> 00:31:12,786
How do you show goodwill?

480
00:31:15,048 --> 00:31:15,788
And then privilege.

481
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:18,450
People like me can pretty much get away

482
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,052
with it whenever we're dealing with a court proceeding.

483
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:22,233
But otherwise, privilege is pretty limited.

484
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,932
So trade secrets.

485
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:31,893
Whenever I was talking about the worst thing a developer

486
00:31:31,913 --> 00:31:35,175
can do is let me tell you my idea, this is where this kind

487
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:35,815
of comes in.

488
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:40,937
You can do that if you have something that is creating a

489
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:43,879
trust between people as far as confidentiality.

490
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:46,880
So if you say, let me tell you my idea, but first sign this

491
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,301
NDA, all good.

492
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:52,909
What is a trade secret?

493
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,692
The key takeaway here is it has to have economic value,

494
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,293
and it has to be something that you're actually

495
00:31:58,353 --> 00:32:00,294
keeping secret, which means that you're actually

496
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:03,836
taking reasonable steps to keep it from being

497
00:32:03,876 --> 00:32:04,796
disclosed to the public.

498
00:32:16,063 --> 00:32:17,303
Another thing to take away is that it

499
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:18,324
doesn't have to be fixed.

500
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:20,185
It doesn't have the same standards of.

501
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:24,605
the same requirements that you have for copyright and things like that.

502
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,746
And that's kind of why trade secrets are attractive.

503
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:27,807
That's kind of why they're sexy.

504
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:32,311
Because it's a lot cheaper than a patent, because patents can run you, you know,

505
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:36,054
anything from 25 to 40 grand just to apply.

506
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:39,377
And that has nothing to do with enforcement.

507
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,583
But trade secrets, all you have to do is just keep it secret and try

508
00:32:46,603 --> 00:32:48,005
to keep other people from talking about it.

509
00:32:54,344 --> 00:32:57,987
So what is trade secret infringement?

510
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:08,555
In every contract I've ever drafted,

511
00:33:08,635 --> 00:33:11,237
and almost every single one has to contain a confidentiality

512
00:33:11,317 --> 00:33:15,920
provision or NDA, you have a thing that triggers.

513
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,042
And you have this with a lot of different provisions.

514
00:33:19,002 --> 00:33:21,304
If you have a work for hire issue,

515
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:22,665
if you have a work for hire provision,

516
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:23,686
you also want to have an assignment.

517
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:26,195
Whenever you have a confidentiality provision,

518
00:33:26,415 --> 00:33:27,935
you also have to have the exceptions.

519
00:33:28,555 --> 00:33:33,636
And the exceptions are basically what will not

520
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,756
constitute infringement.

521
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:38,697
And that's things that have to be disclosed for court reasons,

522
00:33:38,937 --> 00:33:41,518
like if there's a judicial reason for it.

523
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:44,999
Things that are disclosed by third parties

524
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,819
are things that you already knew about prior to engaging

525
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:50,280
or developing this trust.

526
00:33:55,427 --> 00:33:56,787
things that are known by third parties

527
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:02,509
are disclosed to you through that channel so long as they are not also bound by

528
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:03,429
confidentiality.

529
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,791
There are certain exceptions that are going to apply whenever

530
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:08,551
we're talking about

531
00:34:09,992 --> 00:34:10,972
trademark infringement.

532
00:34:12,773 --> 00:34:15,734
One of the big things to bear in mind is it has to be wrongful.

533
00:34:16,374 --> 00:34:17,935
It has to actually be, you know,

534
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:21,916
doxing is a good example. Any kind of hacking, things like that, is going to

535
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:22,156
create that.

536
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:26,633
that improper behavior thing.

537
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:28,074
We've been hearing a lot about that lately,

538
00:34:28,114 --> 00:34:29,235
so it's something to keep in mind.

539
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:33,718
And there's also, you know, that obligation of trust.

540
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,120
There's that if you are subject to an NDA and you need

541
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,661
to check your employment agreements,

542
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:40,142
you need to check your independent contractor

543
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,924
agreements, master services agreements.

544
00:34:42,324 --> 00:34:45,706
All of these things are going to possibly create that level

545
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:49,168
of trust that is going to expose you to risk if you decide

546
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:50,930
to disclose this information improperly.

547
00:34:54,664 --> 00:35:02,568
So moving on to the part that we have fun with, because this is pretty much what we do.

548
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:11,573
Everything concerning my practice touches on your IP portfolio to some extent.

549
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:16,396
So what is your IP portfolio?

550
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:19,318
It is not just the IP that you have.

551
00:35:19,338 --> 00:35:22,239
It is not just the IP that you may be infringing on.

552
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,800
It's all of your licenses.

553
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:30,350
It's all of your documents relating to your licenses,

554
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,411
all of your documents relating to your registration.

555
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,732
It's your paper trail, to a certain extent.

556
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,013
It's also the intangible aspects of it.

557
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,253
It's those rights that attach to those little pieces of

558
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:41,934
paper that tell you, you own this.

559
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:46,075
It is your bread and butter.

560
00:35:46,636 --> 00:35:47,616
And this is why it's important.

561
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:52,338
Because at the end of the day, your IP is all you really have

562
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:53,378
as a game developer.

563
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,964
It is the, it's your stock and trade.

564
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:01,866
You may put out physical products,

565
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:06,230
but at the end of the day, what you're really making money off

566
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,311
of is your IP.

567
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:10,374
And that's why I said, it's not the most important.

568
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,097
I would still say that this talk is probably the most important.

569
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:20,103
Yeah, another thing that this last point about work

570
00:36:20,123 --> 00:36:20,944
for hire agreements.

571
00:36:22,712 --> 00:36:30,834
Bear in mind that it's not like whenever we hear about work for hire, you know, you hear about all of the ownership transfers to the employer

572
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:37,996
or the person who's commissioning the work, but that's not 100% true because there's,

573
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:45,138
they're going, even as somebody who only does work for hire work, it doesn't mean that you don't have IP.

574
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:46,759
I mean, you're still going to have IP.

575
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:50,500
How else do you do business if you don't have a trademark, if you don't have.

576
00:36:51,288 --> 00:36:53,710
goodwill generated by the work that you're producing.

577
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,271
So that's an intangible asset.

578
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:58,833
That makes it proprietary. That makes it IP.

579
00:37:03,036 --> 00:37:06,838
So this is, again, like, what is your IP portfolio?

580
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,520
You obviously have the IP that you own,

581
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,522
the things that you create, your trademarks,

582
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:16,825
trade desk, all of those things, all of those intangible...

583
00:37:18,257 --> 00:37:24,662
components that become a part of your business, and also your licenses. And not just the licenses

584
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:29,607
that you have from third parties, but the licenses you put out are going to be a big

585
00:37:29,687 --> 00:37:35,672
issue. And why I say that is because it limits the value of your assets. So we're talking

586
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:42,218
about IP portfolios. You want to think of it as kind of like a registry of what you're

587
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:42,498
worth.

588
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:48,269
And a lot of that is going to be determined by what rights do you still have a hold of.

589
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,489
Because all of these rights are separable.

590
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:56,411
Like, whenever you assign a copyright or whenever you give a license for a copyright,

591
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:59,732
that doesn't necessarily mean that it's to all of your copyrights.

592
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:02,333
I mean, they were enumerated before.

593
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:07,055
It, you can just assign the right to publicly display it.

594
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:11,736
You can just license non-exclusively.

595
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,961
the right to reproduce it and distribute it,

596
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:19,843
but not the right to make derivative works.

597
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:25,465
So where your value lies is what you still hold on to,

598
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:28,847
how much what you're licensing out is worth,

599
00:38:29,547 --> 00:38:30,708
and how much you're getting back from it.

600
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:34,990
And also your third party licenses.

601
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,171
Whenever you have an exclusive license to something,

602
00:38:38,431 --> 00:38:40,752
it means you have the right to exclude others from doing it.

603
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:44,254
So if you get a license to make a Frozen game for the iPhone.

604
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:49,166
and it's exclusive, you are the only one who has the right to do that, which means that

605
00:38:49,206 --> 00:38:59,169
you won't have, you should not have competitors for that same IP. And if you do, that's the

606
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:07,851
area where we talk, that's when we talk about protection. So let's look at some of the licensing

607
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:08,892
models that we have here.

608
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,073
Work for hire versus a licensee are not the same.

609
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,794
Actually, they're kind of mutually exclusive.

610
00:39:15,195 --> 00:39:18,037
Work for hire is not an assignment.

611
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:21,541
A work for hire implies that ownership originally

612
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:26,305
lies with the person commissioning the work

613
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:28,627
or employing you to create this work.

614
00:39:29,548 --> 00:39:34,273
So it is a default in employment relationships.

615
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:36,254
And it is.

616
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:42,343
a common provision in a lot of independent contractor agreements you may be required

617
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:42,783
to sign.

618
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:49,607
As I said before, the moral rights issue does come into play whenever we're talking about

619
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:54,609
work for hire because those moral rights are separable from the commercial rights that

620
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,570
are owned by the company.

621
00:40:00,412 --> 00:40:02,133
At least in some cases that's not always true.

622
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:05,975
There are some workarounds to that, but by and large it's good to assume that

623
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:08,921
the moral rights will always lie with the individual who's

624
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:09,662
created the work.

625
00:40:13,606 --> 00:40:17,249
Any time you see a work for hire deal or a work for hire

626
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,271
provision, as I said, whenever I was

627
00:40:19,311 --> 00:40:21,813
talking about confidentiality, you have those triggers, right?

628
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,035
The trigger that you're going to find with a work for hire

629
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,716
is going to be an assignment, because there

630
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,699
are going to be cases where work for hire will not apply.

631
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,942
There's a pretty.

632
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:38,355
Actually, work for hire is very, very limited according to the scope of copyright.

633
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:47,118
And while collective works are included in that, which kind of covers, in a lot of cases, video games and things like that,

634
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:54,581
it's not conclusive. So for work for hire provisions, if you are the one, you know, for example, procuring this,

635
00:40:56,041 --> 00:41:01,423
you want to have an assignment in there saying that even if it doesn't qualify as work for hire,

636
00:41:02,748 --> 00:41:04,208
you still have those rights assigned to you.

637
00:41:04,648 --> 00:41:06,129
You're still the person who owns the rights.

638
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:06,909
You own the property.

639
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:10,910
If you are the one who is being hired,

640
00:41:11,851 --> 00:41:13,911
if they don't have it in there, you just want to be quiet.

641
00:41:14,992 --> 00:41:16,192
So you can come back for it later on

642
00:41:16,232 --> 00:41:17,633
if they decide not to pay you.

643
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:20,854
This happened several times.

644
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:26,135
There are a lot more benefits to a license, however,

645
00:41:26,155 --> 00:41:29,717
at least from the standpoint of the contractor.

646
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:34,093
or the IP owner, the person who's creating the work.

647
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:36,355
A license gives you a lot more flexibility.

648
00:41:37,276 --> 00:41:40,257
It enables you to sever rights, as I said,

649
00:41:40,818 --> 00:41:43,139
or parcel out certain properties.

650
00:41:45,181 --> 00:41:48,583
Work-for-hire, from a statutory perspective,

651
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:50,584
really only applies to copyright.

652
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:56,728
There are some trademark and patent considerations for that as well.

653
00:41:57,068 --> 00:41:59,090
The actual term of art work-for-hire

654
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,228
it originally comes from copyright. I think it's been co-opted by

655
00:42:03,828 --> 00:42:08,010
some other areas of intellectual property, but it originates with copyright.

656
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,850
You have a lot of different license types.

657
00:42:12,511 --> 00:42:16,092
Obviously exclusive, non-exclusive, whether or not somebody else can use the work.

658
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:19,473
In addition to, you know, other people.

659
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:23,594
The thing about licenses is that you can handicap people. You can totally handcuff them from

660
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:27,295
their ownership rights.

661
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,221
To the extent that a license is exclusive,

662
00:42:31,602 --> 00:42:33,662
that means that even you don't have the right to use it

663
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,343
once you exclusively license something.

664
00:42:40,664 --> 00:42:43,005
So why is portfolio management important?

665
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:47,986
First and foremost, you need a paper trail.

666
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:51,027
You need to document everything.

667
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:54,027
And this is going to be important from a business audit

668
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:54,588
standpoint.

669
00:42:56,622 --> 00:43:00,303
Any time, I mean, just like doing your taxes, this is something that you need information

670
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:05,565
on because it directly relates to your company's value, right?

671
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:07,606
It directs to your profit margins.

672
00:43:07,646 --> 00:43:09,366
It directs to your budget.

673
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:16,149
Having these assets and having a record of these assets is mandatory.

674
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:20,830
As I said, it's your primary asset.

675
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,331
This is what you are.

676
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:26,380
building your trade on. This is what you're building your game around.

677
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,701
And there are times whenever you absolutely need to show ownership.

678
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:35,241
You are going to find this a lot in whenever you're getting venture capital

679
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:36,822
or trying to get funding for your game.

680
00:43:37,742 --> 00:43:40,982
You're going to find this whenever you hopefully, or maybe not hopefully,

681
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:42,683
a lot of people are against this concept.

682
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:47,804
But if you are in the luxurious position of getting bought out,

683
00:43:48,204 --> 00:43:49,524
we've had quite a few deals where...

684
00:43:50,711 --> 00:44:00,178
A good part of R.D. diligence relates specifically to your IP assets and what licenses are where,

685
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:02,499
what you've licensed out, what you have licenses to.

686
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:06,762
You know, all of your registrations have to be in place.

687
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,623
Chain of title becomes important.

688
00:44:09,424 --> 00:44:14,407
Typically you hear the term of our chain of title whenever we're talking about real property.

689
00:44:14,828 --> 00:44:16,949
It also applies to intellectual property.

690
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:18,830
And that is the chain of ownership.

691
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:23,021
and any kind of third-party IP that you have a right to,

692
00:44:23,501 --> 00:44:26,443
as well as any IP that you've developed

693
00:44:26,503 --> 00:44:27,844
and who you've licensed it out to.

694
00:44:28,184 --> 00:44:30,045
So chain of title becomes very important.

695
00:44:31,426 --> 00:44:33,808
Also, if you get errors and omissions insurance,

696
00:44:34,168 --> 00:44:37,650
which I actually highly recommend if you are putting out a game

697
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,652
and it's seeing some kind of economic success,

698
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:44,595
it will cover you for most IP claims,

699
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:47,157
which may not always be covered

700
00:44:47,177 --> 00:44:49,138
by your typical commercial insurance standard.

701
00:44:52,209 --> 00:45:06,097
So it's something to keep in mind, and if you are going to get that insurance, you need to have records of ownership for your IP, for your portfolio, because that's what's going to be protected.

702
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:12,881
Anything that you don't have a record of, anything that you don't have in writing, falls outside of the insurance scope, which is a problem.

703
00:45:15,383 --> 00:45:19,405
So how do you protect it? It's fairly simple with copyright, because it costs like $35, right?

704
00:45:20,723 --> 00:45:27,745
And then if you have an attorney do it, because it can be kind of confusing at times, you know,

705
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:30,186
it takes like an hour, a couple hours' work if that.

706
00:45:30,826 --> 00:45:33,987
So, and we ship it off to a paralegal.

707
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:38,748
It's not a difficult process to get your copyright registered, so you have no excuse

708
00:45:39,268 --> 00:45:40,909
for failing to register your copyright.

709
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:44,510
And what's more, it gives you that paper trail that you need.

710
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,651
I would also recommend if you do license out works.

711
00:45:50,186 --> 00:45:55,808
or if you do procure a license, an exclusive license, you register that with the copyright

712
00:45:55,848 --> 00:46:00,090
office as well, because that also shows your chain of title. It also shows a record for

713
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:06,792
that. And you don't just register the copyright in and of itself. You can register those additional

714
00:46:06,812 --> 00:46:10,593
documents, and you can do that with trademark, patent, copyright, all of them.

715
00:46:14,248 --> 00:46:24,032
So some of the benefits of copyright protection, it does entitle you to money damages that you wouldn't get if there is no actual financial harm or if they didn't see a profit from the infringement.

716
00:46:27,673 --> 00:46:30,654
And you also cannot sue anybody until you're registered.

717
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:36,997
But by and large I still say having a paper trail in general and having that in writing is really important.

718
00:46:41,535 --> 00:46:42,576
protecting your trademark.

719
00:46:43,298 --> 00:46:44,459
You don't have, as I said before,

720
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:45,902
you don't have trademark protection

721
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:46,763
until it's registered.

722
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:49,407
You have unfair competition protection,

723
00:46:49,608 --> 00:46:53,794
to a certain extent, but that is vastly less secure

724
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:55,697
than what you're going to find under the Trademark Act.

725
00:46:56,323 --> 00:47:00,406
So the only way to get trademark protection is by registering.

726
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:04,728
Certain states also have trademark protection

727
00:47:04,828 --> 00:47:06,669
to a limited extent, so you can register

728
00:47:06,709 --> 00:47:07,789
with the state as well.

729
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:13,392
But for the real, you know, meaty trademark issues,

730
00:47:13,452 --> 00:47:15,993
you want to register with the USPTO.

731
00:47:16,994 --> 00:47:20,436
Some of the benefits is three times statutory damages

732
00:47:20,576 --> 00:47:21,936
if somebody counterfeits your work,

733
00:47:22,136 --> 00:47:23,637
and if you can show that it's in bad faith.

734
00:47:24,638 --> 00:47:25,978
This is something that I like to threaten.

735
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,259
with whenever I send out cease and desist based on those apps

736
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,380
that I was mentioning before.

737
00:47:31,401 --> 00:47:33,563
If it was like a really, really popular app

738
00:47:33,663 --> 00:47:36,365
and it's pretty obvious that somebody just directly ripped

739
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:37,746
it off and changed the color scheme,

740
00:47:38,928 --> 00:47:41,870
just say it's a counterfeit and therefore entitled

741
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,714
to three times monetary damages for any potential loss

742
00:47:45,774 --> 00:47:47,996
profits or any profits that they've made from it.

743
00:47:54,582 --> 00:47:58,946
Also, if you have a registered mark, it becomes incontestable.

744
00:47:58,986 --> 00:48:01,448
And what this means is that I think it's like after five years

745
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:06,431
of being registered, it becomes very difficult for somebody

746
00:48:06,471 --> 00:48:10,615
to come after you for infringement based on your trademark

747
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:11,916
or for likelihood of confusion.

748
00:48:12,316 --> 00:48:16,419
At that point, you have obtained enough of a position

749
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:18,941
in commerce, provided you've used it continuously

750
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:20,542
and provided you can show that use.

751
00:48:21,663 --> 00:48:22,904
You have achieved that.

752
00:48:24,285 --> 00:48:30,730
level of protection where if somebody comes after you based on your registration, it's

753
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:36,254
going to be pretty much ignored. It's going to be very difficult to push. The burden shifts

754
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:43,539
entirely on the plaintiff. Also, anybody who's going to be registering a mark, or typically

755
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:48,582
anybody who's going to be coming after you for trademark infringement, they're going

756
00:48:48,622 --> 00:48:51,284
to have access to the pto.gov website.

757
00:48:56,422 --> 00:48:58,263
This kind of puts them on notice.

758
00:48:58,283 --> 00:49:04,026
Doing a USPTO.gov search is extraordinarily

759
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,268
simple. You just type in the mark. Not that hard.

760
00:49:07,688 --> 00:49:11,970
So it will pull up identical marks. There are other search parameters that

761
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,631
obviously come into play whenever you're actually trying to register a mark.

762
00:49:15,572 --> 00:49:17,133
Google is also a good resource for this.

763
00:49:18,573 --> 00:49:24,016
But for the registration itself, for

764
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:24,957
protection purposes.

765
00:49:25,313 --> 00:49:28,094
it does put people on notice that you are the rightful owner.

766
00:49:30,236 --> 00:49:35,119
Protecting your patents like trademarks is the only way to have protection.

767
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:39,141
There is no such thing as an unregistered patent.

768
00:49:40,682 --> 00:49:43,743
You can have an applied patent, which can give you some limited protection as far as

769
00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:44,204
patent pending.

770
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,844
a patent that has not even been applied for doesn't exist. You have trade secrets for that.

771
00:50:03,108 --> 00:50:09,073
And speaking of which, how do you protect your trade secrets? Confidentiality provisions,

772
00:50:09,113 --> 00:50:16,579
as I mentioned before, non-disclosure agreements are part for the course. The biggest thing

773
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:20,602
though is, because all of these things are kind of worth the paper they're written on,

774
00:50:21,443 --> 00:50:22,584
the big issue is going to be...

775
00:50:24,145 --> 00:50:26,306
what are you doing to protect that information?

776
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:27,967
What are you doing to protect your information?

777
00:50:28,047 --> 00:50:30,007
Obviously, creating these relationships,

778
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:34,049
we're creating that confidential relationship

779
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:35,269
is very, very important.

780
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,831
But you need to also make sure that people cannot

781
00:50:40,391 --> 00:50:42,072
improperly get that information.

782
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:43,953
You have to do what you can to prevent people

783
00:50:44,013 --> 00:50:45,453
from being able to dox that information.

784
00:50:45,473 --> 00:50:47,754
You have to keep it from being published.

785
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:51,375
And doing that, it typically involves

786
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:53,076
taking proper security measures.

787
00:50:54,525 --> 00:50:57,666
password protecting things, making sure certain things are

788
00:50:57,686 --> 00:51:00,688
under lock and key, not telling your employees about it

789
00:51:00,728 --> 00:51:02,569
unless they absolutely need to know about it.

790
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:03,890
And these are things that you're also

791
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,491
going to want to include in your confidentiality provisions.

792
00:51:06,791 --> 00:51:08,792
You need to be very specific about what

793
00:51:09,272 --> 00:51:12,094
is protected under your trade secrets, which

794
00:51:12,594 --> 00:51:14,655
seems counterproductive because you actually

795
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:19,158
need to provide a list of what is covered under trade secret,

796
00:51:19,198 --> 00:51:20,839
what you are treating as a trade secret.

797
00:51:23,485 --> 00:51:26,566
because that makes it that much clearer that that relationship exists.

798
00:51:26,806 --> 00:51:28,066
This is what it applies to.

799
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:40,169
So as far as, you know, the trade secret issue and the documents that you need,

800
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,350
your licenses must always be in writing.

801
00:51:47,429 --> 00:51:50,611
There are lots of clip licenses and things like that where people say,

802
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:51,411
oh yeah, sure, go ahead.

803
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,473
A really good example of this is the King's Quest

804
00:51:56,234 --> 00:52:01,036
Activision issue with Silver Lining, if you guys are familiar with that title.

805
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:05,018
It was an independent title for the King's Quest series. If you guys don't know what

806
00:52:05,058 --> 00:52:08,760
King's Quest is, I'm very, very sad and I'm going to feel very, very old.

807
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,942
But it is one of the best games ever.

808
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:15,223
Best series ever, as far as I'm concerned.

809
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:21,630
But so originally, basically what it comes down to is

810
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:24,732
Activision just kept waffling on whether or not these guys

811
00:52:24,752 --> 00:52:25,452
had the right to do it.

812
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:28,653
And the problem is that the company never really got

813
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:29,494
anything in writing.

814
00:52:32,335 --> 00:52:37,078
So this is why stuff like this is important.

815
00:52:37,998 --> 00:52:41,280
If you do get permission, you need to make sure that you can

816
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,000
prove that you have permission to do it.

817
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:45,082
That includes non-exclusive licenses.

818
00:52:47,901 --> 00:52:52,525
Obviously, if you guys are not sure what a master services agreement is, it's kind of

819
00:52:52,585 --> 00:53:01,752
like an independent contractor agreement except it covers all of your work and not just one

820
00:53:01,873 --> 00:53:02,693
statement of work.

821
00:53:02,793 --> 00:53:05,535
It covers all future work orders, things like that.

822
00:53:05,556 --> 00:53:10,259
It's kind of like a parent contract to all of the future work that you do for that client.

823
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:15,043
You obviously want to make sure that you have a pretty...

824
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:18,976
straightforward employee policy, like employee handbook,

825
00:53:19,336 --> 00:53:21,318
that stipulates what is confidential,

826
00:53:21,758 --> 00:53:24,040
how confidential information is treated.

827
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,521
Also, intellectual property in general.

828
00:53:27,022 --> 00:53:28,763
What they can take home with them,

829
00:53:28,803 --> 00:53:31,385
or what they can consider their own IP,

830
00:53:31,425 --> 00:53:32,386
and what's protected there,

831
00:53:32,826 --> 00:53:35,308
what kind of work they can do outside of the workplace

832
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:37,489
that does not belong to you, and vice versa.

833
00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:38,710
If you're an employee,

834
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,431
if you're contracting with this other company,

835
00:53:40,812 --> 00:53:41,832
you need to kind of know,

836
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:44,795
if you are working for multiple clients,

837
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:48,151
Is there going to be any bleed through between those agreements, right?

838
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:54,892
Like is the work that you're doing for one client going to fall under the ownership claims of another?

839
00:53:54,912 --> 00:54:02,113
So these are things that you kind of need to pay attention to and why having something in writing

840
00:54:02,153 --> 00:54:05,034
and why understanding what's in writing is really, really important.

841
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:12,155
And with that, I have four minutes, five minutes for questions.

842
00:54:12,595 --> 00:54:14,115
So if you guys have any questions.

843
00:54:15,537 --> 00:54:24,260
Do you have to patent a game? Because someone said copyrighted game

844
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,081
and then patent. Does that take two years to get approved?

845
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:28,842
Okay, he's asking if you have to patent a game. No.

846
00:54:28,862 --> 00:54:31,243
Now, there are, as I said, there are software patents and things like that.

847
00:54:31,883 --> 00:54:35,584
Absolutely not mandatory. There's a lot of questions as to whether software

848
00:54:35,985 --> 00:54:39,486
patents should even exist. A lot of people are really against it.

849
00:54:40,426 --> 00:54:41,407
Patenting your game is...

850
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:47,210
very rarely even an option, unless we're talking about mechanics and rule sets,

851
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,351
because so much of a game is going to be creative, right? It's going to be

852
00:54:51,471 --> 00:54:54,712
entertainment. Your story cannot be patented.

853
00:54:55,152 --> 00:54:59,253
Your characters cannot be patented. The music that you have cannot be patented.

854
00:54:59,293 --> 00:55:02,754
Your color scheme, well, unless we have a design patent, cannot be patented.

855
00:55:04,729 --> 00:55:10,514
So no, copyright will generally protect you with regard to the actual game itself.

856
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,817
You would register typically, either you can register the literary work,

857
00:55:14,918 --> 00:55:20,702
which would be a portion of your code, it's like 25, the first and last 25 pages of your code,

858
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,386
or audio-visual work, which is a copy of the physical game itself.

859
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:27,988
Yes?

860
00:55:32,974 --> 00:55:49,138
Okay. So he's asking what happens whenever a studio shuts down. And actually this is

861
00:55:49,238 --> 00:55:56,020
typically handled in the winding up provision of your, if you have an operating, it depends

862
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:01,222
on if you're an LLC you would have an operating agreement. If you are a studio.

863
00:56:01,595 --> 00:56:05,977
a C-Corp or an S-Corp, you'd have bylaws. That's something that would be handled in

864
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:11,320
the winding up provision of your agreement. If it's not, it should be. And essentially,

865
00:56:12,341 --> 00:56:23,007
you can either cut your losses, try to sell off that IP and sell it to third parties,

866
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:28,690
or you can have it transferred to the individual owners. That IP is always going to exist.

867
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,652
Someone is always going to own it.

868
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:34,045
And when it comes down to winding up,

869
00:56:35,185 --> 00:56:38,786
whatever your operating agreement says about assets

870
00:56:39,306 --> 00:56:43,666
will apply to your IP if it's not expressly handled

871
00:56:43,686 --> 00:56:44,527
in the agreement itself.

872
00:56:47,707 --> 00:56:48,927
Does that answer your question?

873
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:55,509
I'll get your part.

874
00:56:55,529 --> 00:56:55,569
OK.

875
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,989
Sounds good.

876
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:57,149
Yeah, again, it depends.

877
00:56:58,049 --> 00:57:00,070
It's very much an it depends situation.

878
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:09,103
There's no real solid answer I can give you except for the default depends on your agreement.

879
00:57:10,763 --> 00:57:17,447
Other questions?

880
00:57:17,507 --> 00:57:21,589
If you have any specific questions, because that seems to be what typically happens when

881
00:57:21,629 --> 00:57:25,771
I give a talk, by all means do approach me after the conference.

882
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,032
I'll be in the winding up room.

883
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:29,873
That's it for me.

884
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:30,313
Thank you.

885
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:42,819
You
