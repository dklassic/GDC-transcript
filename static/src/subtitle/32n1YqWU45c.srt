00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,265
Hello. I'm going to talk to you today about escape room designs

2
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:17,469
and how that applies to the world of VR. But before we get

3
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:20,992
into that, I'm going to show you one of my favorite videos from

4
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:32,082
the internet. So I'm going to show you a video that I made

5
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:58,058
And I just love this video so much, because to me,

6
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,941
it's a really great example of pure play.

7
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:03,764
You know, that dog is thinking of nothing

8
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:06,146
except how good it feels to roll down that hill

9
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:08,428
and how quickly it can get back up there to do it again.

10
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:12,191
And the reason that I think that's so cool

11
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:15,053
as an example of play is that humans get to feel that way,

12
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:16,935
too, when we are engaging in play.

13
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:18,857
It's kind of a magical feeling, right?

14
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:20,458
And humans love magic.

15
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:28,816
Another dimension of fun that also feels like creating and experiencing magic comes from storytelling

16
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:35,718
Storytelling lets you get carried away. You can forget yourself and become a different person in a different place

17
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:41,480
It excites you it makes you feel things in short stories transport people

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,622
And we're inevitably going to tell stories using whatever technology we have on hand to do it

19
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:55,688
As much as popular media, though, likes to warn us against a future where we're all in cubicles,

20
00:01:55,868 --> 00:02:00,988
operating little digital facsimiles of ourselves, the truth is that a side effect of our relationship

21
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:05,189
with screen-based entertainment is that the value of in-person experience begins to rise.

22
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,470
That's something you can see in the increasing popularity of board games, people who are

23
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:15,351
returning to RPGs as a way to spend time with their friends, and media that reflects that

24
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:18,692
with podcasts of Dungeons & Dragons games and so on.

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,241
But really this is nothing new.

26
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:27,363
People always have and always will crave experiences

27
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:29,205
no matter where they're coming from, right?

28
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:31,826
Because you want to feel that sense of magic,

29
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:34,348
transportation, connection with other people.

30
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:36,910
It's all of the things that make our experience

31
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,251
as human beings pleasurable.

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,641
As video game designers and filmmakers,

33
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:44,342
we're very familiar with the mental side of that, right?

34
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:46,744
The language and mechanics that go into

35
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:49,125
constructing stories for people to consume.

36
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:52,787
There's another field as well, known as experience design,

37
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:55,449
that focuses on designing for the physical,

38
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:58,451
real world side of things, which includes theme parks,

39
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:00,572
haunted houses, immersive theater,

40
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:02,233
and most recently, escape rooms.

41
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:06,057
They're all disciplines that explore the use of space,

42
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:09,562
human agency, the interaction between viewer and story.

43
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,904
They're all things where people are physically moving

44
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:15,489
through a space and being told a narrative of some kind

45
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:17,231
and absorbing information as they do so.

46
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:21,707
Here you can see some of the best examples in that field.

47
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:27,351
The kind of noted best dark ride is at Tokyo Disney.

48
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:31,715
The best, in my opinion, immersive theater performance

49
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:32,835
is Sleep No More in New York,

50
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:35,057
and then that's my escape room on the side.

51
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:36,819
I'm just teasing, I'm teasing.

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,063
VR, though, has the potential, oops, excuse me,

53
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:45,025
to contribute, to combine both of those worlds.

54
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:47,856
And we're really just at the start of understanding

55
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:48,497
where that can go.

56
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:53,700
Even more exciting, we can use VR to make a new language

57
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,361
that takes into account the physical body,

58
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:58,582
the cognitive processes of the brain,

59
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:01,484
and the new methods of design that must emerge

60
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:04,986
when we begin to take into account the human subconscious.

61
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:09,008
When that is working, we can make magic happen for people,

62
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:11,610
and people will always and have always wanted that thing.

63
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:16,407
I'm Laura Hall.

64
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:19,869
I live in Portland, Oregon, and I currently

65
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,250
design escape room games.

66
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,992
You might have guessed from the session title.

67
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,414
But before that, I was really, really interested

68
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:29,895
in alternate reality games, known as ARGs.

69
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,178
Those are sort of interactive real-time stories

70
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:35,299
that played out online.

71
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,280
They usually involved a lot of puzzles.

72
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,522
You would interact with characters.

73
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:41,463
There's like a whole writing team behind the scenes,

74
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:43,205
and so it was all happening in real time.

75
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:44,686
You'd send an email to a character,

76
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:45,947
one would come back,

77
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:48,929
and the story would end up changing around you

78
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:51,211
as the characters interacted with the players.

79
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:52,792
So it was this really cool

80
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,213
ephemeral thing happening as well.

81
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,351
Even before that, I was really interested in MUDs,

82
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,732
multi-user dungeons, which are just like

83
00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:03,253
multiplayer text-based adventure games.

84
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:06,515
The one that I played was very interested

85
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:08,936
in facilitating culture and politics.

86
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,078
And so it ended up being, for me as a high schooler,

87
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,799
basically like a four-year-long

88
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,740
real-time interactive novel

89
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,281
where all of my friends also hung out.

90
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:22,591
So now, you know, those have sort of phased out.

91
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:25,913
And I'm now interested in escape room games

92
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:27,153
and immersive theater and so on.

93
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:29,735
But I like to think about what it was that drew me

94
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:31,296
to all of these experiences.

95
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:34,818
Because to me, they actually clearly share

96
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:35,959
a lot of the same DNA.

97
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,761
And it's that magic stuff that I was talking about.

98
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,923
The transportation, the sense of connection

99
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:46,205
with other people, the ability to sort of forget yourself

100
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,206
and become truly immersed in some other world.

101
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:52,992
And right now, again, I'm super interested in escape rooms,

102
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:56,437
but I'm also really, really thinking about VR,

103
00:05:56,677 --> 00:05:58,840
because I think that the same sort of appeal is there.

104
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,344
It has really incredible potential

105
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:03,406
to speak to those same fundamental desires.

106
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,958
all of those games that I used to play also shared another thing in common which was puzzles.

107
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,726
Puzzles are fun, they're challenging, sometimes it's just as much about you versus the

108
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:21,573
puzzle as it is you versus your own cleverness. I love this quote, people solve puzzles

109
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:23,976
because they like pain, they like being released from pain.

110
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:28,600
and they like most of all that they find within themselves the power to release themselves from

111
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,243
their own pain. So that's kind of incorporating all of these things that I really think are

112
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:37,506
relevant to spatial design. It's the physical, it's the cognitive,

113
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:42,290
and it's, you know, the player's sense of agency within that context.

114
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:47,235
and puzzles and games really do have a long history together.

115
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:51,279
Escape room games are a very specific type of puzzle meets

116
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,443
environment. But puzzles can be almost anything. It can be

117
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:58,526
falling blocks, it can be logic puzzles, obstacle courses,

118
00:06:58,747 --> 00:06:59,107
plumbing.

119
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:06,649
If you want to look at it a little more abstractly, lots of games use mechanics of withholding or gating information or access,

120
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,110
asking players to work toward opening up whatever that avenue is.

121
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:15,071
It could be as simple as collecting objects for a quest to unlock a dungeon door.

122
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:19,052
It can be much, much more elaborate, but that's a puzzle in a way.

123
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:25,054
Long story short, puzzles are a very useful technique for moving people forward in gameplay.

124
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:41,456
In the early 90s, we kind of entered a golden age of puzzles and games as technology was really available to facilitate these sort of things, including Myst, Secret of Monkey Island, Return to Zork.

125
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:50,063
And if you're familiar with any of those, you'll know that the puzzles in those tend to have a fairly distinctive flavor of the era, I guess.

126
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:54,222
often means trying to pair every object together

127
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:56,002
to see what works.

128
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:59,823
It's not always necessarily with a real world logic,

129
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:03,044
which might tell you what to do with what other thing,

130
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:04,605
which can make it hard to guess,

131
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:06,705
but it ends up being funny as a result

132
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:08,426
of the sort of absurdity of it.

133
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:19,946
Then in the late double aughts, you started to see a new sort of puzzle game emerge

134
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,707
as Flash started proliferating around the web.

135
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:30,390
The one shown here is the first or maybe the most famous digital escape the room game of that time.

136
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,231
It's called Crimson Room by Toshimitsu Takagi from 2004.

137
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:41,957
Locked rooms as puzzle sort of scenarios have always existed in like detective stories, right?

138
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:46,880
It's impossible mysteries based on who had or didn't have access to that space

139
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:53,525
But these games actually place you in the room itself rather than on the outside looking in and trying to deduce what was going on

140
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:59,709
In crimson room, you can see you click around you turn over the edges of pillows you shake the curtains

141
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,754
In a sequence that eventually allows you to escape from that locked room. There's a you know, a few in this series

142
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:07,555
and many imitators.

143
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:11,078
Then somebody had the very brilliant idea

144
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,980
of actually building one of these in real life.

145
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:17,824
And that's when escape games began to come onto the scene.

146
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:23,158
As you might imagine from seeing that flash version, escape room

147
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:25,660
games are real life games which players are locked inside a

148
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,063
room and that's almost the only sort of constraint that there

149
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,865
is. It can be anything beyond that. Generally they have to

150
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,568
investigate, poke around, uncover clues, solve puzzles,

151
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:40,791
sometimes even physically escape from restraints, usually while

152
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:41,692
racing against a clock.

153
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:44,456
They started out in Europe and Asia.

154
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,337
Scrap Entertainment, which has a huge branch here

155
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,158
and is really fun.

156
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:52,460
They opened in Japan, though, in the sort of mid-double aughts

157
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,700
and then in the US in 2012.

158
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,542
And as I said, these have a lot in common design-wise

159
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:01,704
with theater, haunted houses, museums, theme parks.

160
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:04,245
There are established best practices

161
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,906
that we can see there, as well as in things

162
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:08,207
like video game level design.

163
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:08,867
Anything?

164
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,548
where you're moving people forward in a narrative,

165
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:12,888
directing their attention.

166
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,228
One distinguishing factor for escape room games

167
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:17,449
is the use of puzzles of course,

168
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,749
but also specifically the time constraint.

169
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:23,210
In a haunted house, your experience is usually very brief

170
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,910
because they're trying to move people through

171
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,491
while balancing the number of people

172
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:29,071
that are actually in that space at one time.

173
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:30,471
It's supposed to never,

174
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:32,092
you're never supposed to have the line of sight

175
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,072
of another patron.

176
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:36,312
And theme parks obviously are very tightly timed,

177
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:38,773
but you are not aware of the time constraint yourself.

178
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:44,403
These real-world builds are physical manifestations

179
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,504
of what had previously been 2D,

180
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:49,506
in the case of these suddenly new escape room games.

181
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,529
And the challenge that escape room designers face

182
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,871
is often in translating puzzles and components

183
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:59,733
that had been entirely digital into the physical realm.

184
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:02,635
Also, for an audience that was probably more used

185
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:05,277
to those digital versions than the now physical ones.

186
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:09,647
So I want to talk to you about puzzles for a minute

187
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,068
before we get deeper into stuff

188
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:12,109
so that you sort of understand

189
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,389
the fundamental building blocks

190
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:14,610
of what that experience is like.

191
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,171
Ideally, a well-designed physical puzzle

192
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,352
is a combination of bodily interaction

193
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,773
with whatever the puzzle object is,

194
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:23,214
there's the cognitive challenge,

195
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:25,435
and there's also the subconscious design cues

196
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:28,196
of the object itself that tell you how to work on it,

197
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:29,756
how to solve it, how to interact with it.

198
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:36,604
So to understand how to design one, I'd like to show you first how players approach solving them.

199
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:41,046
Puzzle solving is an exercise in observation first and foremost.

200
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,827
You have to assess exactly what information you have at any given time, how it might work

201
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:49,188
together with other pieces of info you've uncovered, and continue from there.

202
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:54,634
This is a clip of Curtis Chen, puzzle designer, founder of Puzzle Pint, which is an

203
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,958
awesome monthly puzzle solving event that's in a lot of cities all around the world now.

204
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:02,442
It's from a talk about how to solve any puzzle in under 47 minutes.

205
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:10,588
And so for context, players were given an envelope that contained a huge pile of postage stamps, and that was it.

206
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:14,811
There was no instructions, there's no guidelines, no labeling of any kind.

207
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:18,333
The players of this game knew that it would be self-contained.

208
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:22,816
All the information they needed would be in or on those stamps somehow.

209
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:27,138
So here is how an experienced puzzler would approach that challenge.

210
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:35,655
four stamps in 16 different denominations from half a cent up to 29 cents and they're

211
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:41,660
all cancelled with a postmark. So let's start by grouping them by denominations, by the

212
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,344
stack pattern. And one thing we notice is that no group has any more than four stamps in it.

213
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,446
Now, the next thing, if you look at the designs,

214
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:52,408
every design tells you what year the stamp was issued.

215
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:56,010
It's either an anniversary of something, or a commemorative, or an Olympics.

216
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,591
So we can order the stamps within each group.

217
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,632
Now, some of them don't have years,

218
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:04,114
but that's actually not going to matter, as we'll see in just a few seconds.

219
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:05,375
So, let's...

220
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:12,507
This is just the last few groups, and let's take a closer look at those top two rows, the 15 and 20 cent stamps.

221
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,790
Now, they've been ordered, so we've used some of the information already.

222
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,791
So what's left? Well, we've got the postmarks.

223
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:21,914
And there are two different kinds of postmarks here.

224
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,096
There are the circular ones and the wavy lines.

225
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,477
We have circles and lines.

226
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:31,540
Dots and dashes. More scope.

227
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:35,195
Morse code, right?

228
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,558
That's so cool, like you would have no idea

229
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:40,000
just looking at that thing on the left

230
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,322
that that was actually a true message,

231
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:44,004
which was the thing that's revealed on the right.

232
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:46,867
So that solution when it was translated

233
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:49,349
gave those puzzlers the next location to go

234
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,731
to pick up the next puzzle in that challenge.

235
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:55,938
And that's a pretty great example of steps that a player should be going through,

236
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,083
how they're mentally and physically engaging with the game pieces in order to solve it.

237
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:03,768
You assess, you organize, you look for patterns,

238
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:07,293
determine what information has or has not been used, and then assess again.

239
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,041
And then as well, a good puzzle tells you inherently

240
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:13,263
in its design how it should be solved.

241
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:17,004
I should also note that puzzle difficulty is adjusted

242
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:19,345
upward or downward by how much information

243
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,906
is given to the player at one time.

244
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,168
This is a very difficult puzzle because there's no context,

245
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:25,688
there's no instructions whatsoever.

246
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,390
But you could make it a little bit more easy

247
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,191
by, I don't know, grouping them already into small groups

248
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:32,371
or,

249
00:14:34,444 --> 00:14:37,246
providing some sort of instruction as to the order.

250
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,847
It's just a matter of nudging people

251
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:42,008
as much as they need to based on their ability.

252
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,711
So knowing that's how a player approaches the solve,

253
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:48,972
I'll show you how one is constructed.

254
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:52,534
I'll walk you through a puzzle I designed

255
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:53,975
for an athletic shoe company.

256
00:14:55,277 --> 00:15:07,191
The puzzles for this needed to be physical, to incorporate teamwork and cooperation, to speak to the brand messaging, and also ideally to utilize physical components of the shoes and other exercise equipment.

257
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:14,459
So for context of this one, there were a variety of puzzle types in the room that players had never encountered before.

258
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,441
Some of them required physical tasks,

259
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:18,742
some were connecting the dots,

260
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:20,764
some needed them to use their phone

261
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:22,725
to look up information on the internet,

262
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:24,287
some were based on visual perspective.

263
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,368
So there's meant to be a sort of balance

264
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,689
of skills being used.

265
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,811
Because this was for a party

266
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:31,112
that people had been invited to

267
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:33,314
without being told what they were going to encounter

268
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:34,035
when they arrived.

269
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:37,922
Probably also none of them had done a puzzle room before.

270
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:42,166
That was just not really the audience.

271
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:43,908
So they needed to be simple enough

272
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:45,850
that they didn't require a ton of instruction

273
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,672
but also still be fun.

274
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,315
And that's a kind of tough challenge.

275
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:54,159
The way that I approached that solution incidentally

276
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,501
is by making it a speed run challenge

277
00:15:56,642 --> 00:15:57,763
rather than a countdown clock.

278
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:03,990
So for this puzzle, players encountered a huge peg board with colored pegs.

279
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,872
They get these stretchy resistance bands from a different puzzle in that room.

280
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:11,294
Some are already arranged on the board itself when they first encounter it.

281
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:16,478
And to make it clear, the color of the bands matches the color of the pegs.

282
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:21,001
Also in the room are these two boxes, buttons.

283
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:23,142
They all have a variety of words written on them.

284
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,377
which inside the room looks like this.

285
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:29,098
Pegboard on the left, the buttons are on the right

286
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,339
to either side of the door.

287
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,502
The solution for that puzzle is to get the keyword

288
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,644
from that pegboard, which is on one button box,

289
00:16:37,184 --> 00:16:38,445
and a keyword from another puzzle,

290
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:39,766
which is on the other button box.

291
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:42,788
Pushing both buttons at once requires coordinating

292
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,170
with your team, and that's what opens the final door.

293
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:45,891
It's the last step.

294
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:49,733
So as I said, when players encounter that board,

295
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:52,335
you can kind of see there, it already has some shapes

296
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:53,696
of the letters on it.

297
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,687
That's because if we didn't provide any information at all,

298
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:57,869
it would look like this.

299
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,877
Colored pegs only, no context whatsoever,

300
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:04,001
and impossible to actually solve

301
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,686
because there's no true letter shapes in there.

302
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,826
And technically that's not exactly true,

303
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:13,587
because you can sort of make out the shape of a Y on the end.

304
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,089
The solution word for this, by the way, is energy.

305
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,631
There's only one button on any of those boxes

306
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:21,431
that ends in a Y.

307
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:23,112
So if you were really, really stuck,

308
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:24,713
and also really, really observant,

309
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:28,294
you could maybe make that connection, but that's not fun.

310
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,837
So here's the arrangement that people actually encountered

311
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:34,437
when they came into the room for the first time.

312
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:38,153
It's suggestive of some of the more complicated letters

313
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:39,874
like the R, but if you're in a hurry

314
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:41,375
and not paying super close attention,

315
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,415
it's not very revealing.

316
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:45,897
And this is a different example

317
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:47,458
of how the board could have been arranged

318
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:49,759
to make it a degree of difficulty further,

319
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,120
because the R here is arranged on the yellow pegs

320
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:54,181
using a yellow band.

321
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:56,642
You're telling them in the design to match colors.

322
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,751
But by putting wrong colored bands on pegs,

323
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:01,232
like the I and the T,

324
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:03,634
you're throwing them off in a pretty serious way.

325
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:05,475
To arrange it in this way

326
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:07,236
suggests an alternate six letter word,

327
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:09,578
which maybe it's spirit or something like that.

328
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:11,579
But you're priming them from the beginning

329
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:12,840
to see only that one word.

330
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:14,542
Even if they remove them,

331
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:16,083
it would be really pretty difficult

332
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,704
to sort of circle back and come to the correct solution.

333
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:23,418
So since this room was built for people who'd never encountered a puzzle room before,

334
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:27,860
and again, who came to that event really not knowing what they were about to get themselves into,

335
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,382
it couldn't have this many layers of encoding.

336
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:32,183
Because in that context, it wouldn't be fun.

337
00:18:32,843 --> 00:18:36,685
But in a different room situation, I think I would really enjoy inflicting this on some players.

338
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:46,190
So that's just one thing to keep in mind if you're introducing puzzles or anything like that into your game design.

339
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:49,491
Keep in mind what the player knows, what's reasonable for

340
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:52,433
them to know. That stamps puzzle, for example, requires

341
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:56,957
you to be able to recognize Morse code. I wouldn't expect

342
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:59,720
somebody off the street to be able to just make that leap, but

343
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,903
for the people who enjoy playing those sort of lengthy games,

344
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,706
that's a pretty straightforward and almost basic level solve.

345
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:11,316
Part of this, though, is an inherent understanding

346
00:19:11,496 --> 00:19:14,058
of how interactions with the objects are supposed to work.

347
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,740
Like in Monkey Island, it's pretty hilarious

348
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,002
to try X with Y until you finally figure out

349
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,143
how everything fits together,

350
00:19:20,263 --> 00:19:21,784
and it makes sense with the comedic tone,

351
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:24,667
but in a situation where you're racing against a clock,

352
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:27,889
suddenly being stumped that way is much less appealing.

353
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:31,169
In our escape room, we always tell people

354
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:32,551
that having fun is the goal.

355
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:34,732
Nothing in there is meant to thwart you

356
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:36,814
or prove somehow that you're bad at puzzles.

357
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:39,477
Because to me, it's very, very important

358
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,298
to always be building an experience

359
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:43,700
that lets people challenge themselves first and foremost.

360
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:48,324
But there's actually a very long way to go

361
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:50,265
before we reach that point in any design,

362
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:51,505
physical or digital.

363
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,466
When we're designing any kind of experience,

364
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,907
there are a lot of questions we have

365
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,067
to ask ourselves up front.

366
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:59,848
One of which is, what are we actually asking

367
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:00,548
the player to do?

368
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:02,769
Because in a real life space,

369
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,690
it's not quite as simple as run through this level.

370
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,011
Because they might literally be running.

371
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:10,752
And in a real life escape the room game,

372
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:12,392
you're usually standing the whole time.

373
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:15,776
So there's actually a major physical demand

374
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:16,937
when you're in a real space.

375
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:20,460
And the same applies to VR, room-scale VR in particular.

376
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,703
But you may be asking people to stand, crouch, crawl,

377
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,164
wave their arms around.

378
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:30,207
Even just standing for an hour is really pretty tiring,

379
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:32,649
especially if you're giving a talk while you're doing it.

380
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,612
But in escape rooms, we have to be really mindful

381
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:38,093
of the physical strain on the player.

382
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:39,914
We often will put a chair in there

383
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:41,115
in case people need to rest.

384
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,122
So this is the first lesson for VR as well.

385
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:47,287
Even though we're working within a world

386
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:49,190
that has infinite design possibilities

387
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,431
when that headset is on,

388
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:53,396
there are true limitations to the physical realities

389
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:55,439
of what we can ask the human body to perform.

390
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:01,358
The movie Minority Report is one of the best and most obvious examples of this.

391
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:08,200
There's tons of writing about the way that it's like poorly ergonomically designed and bad UI.

392
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,962
But in the film, Tom Cruise needs to comb through lots of evidence of a crime.

393
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:16,483
So he throws it up onto a huge transparent screen,

394
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:19,524
he controls it with a series of complicated hand gestures,

395
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:22,625
and it looks like he's conducting an orchestra while he's doing it.

396
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:23,845
It's really very beautiful.

397
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,990
but it's not real and frankly should never be real.

398
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:31,574
On that movie set, it was rumored

399
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:34,317
that he had to constantly rest between takes.

400
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:36,519
And if a man is professionally fit,

401
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,022
as Tom Cruise gets tired doing that,

402
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:40,664
there's really no hope for the rest of us.

403
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:46,915
That fatigued condition of interacting with a screen that's in front of you is known as

404
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:52,383
gorilla arm by the way. It's why you generally only encounter vertical touch screens without

405
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:57,029
like a physical support like a table for interactions that are short term like a map at an

406
00:21:57,069 --> 00:21:58,531
airport or at an ATM.

407
00:22:01,326 --> 00:22:04,107
In my own case, when the Valve Lab stuff came out,

408
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:07,429
I spent a really, really long time playing

409
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:09,090
the archery and spaceship arcade games.

410
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,970
They're super fun.

411
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,091
But when I came out of those sessions,

412
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:16,313
my arms really hurt because I was having so much fun in it

413
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:18,294
that I really didn't actually know

414
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:21,256
that I was doing hours worth of arm exercise.

415
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:23,937
I forgot the demands on my own body.

416
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:26,538
It was only after, when I emerged,

417
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:29,160
taking off the headset, that I was reminded of that

418
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,080
in a very real way.

419
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:35,276
But I actually think that's kind of cool, too.

420
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:39,177
Something really special happens to people's bodies

421
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:41,098
when they set foot into an escape room

422
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:42,718
or any other physical kind of build.

423
00:22:43,398 --> 00:22:44,919
It's something that you see in other fields

424
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,099
of experience design,

425
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:48,800
especially haunted houses and immersive theater.

426
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,661
The lights are dark, players go into it

427
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:53,601
not knowing what to expect.

428
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:56,922
In that situation, you're kind of entering survival mode.

429
00:22:57,898 --> 00:23:00,020
like your heartbeat increases, your adrenaline rises,

430
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,701
and your focus gets very, very narrow

431
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:05,943
along with the selective attention that comes with that.

432
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:07,764
And you're essentially entering into

433
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:09,025
what we call the flow state.

434
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:15,353
In a non-game context, inducing the flow state from scratch,

435
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:17,215
like when you sit down at your desk

436
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,816
and try and make yourself be creative,

437
00:23:18,956 --> 00:23:20,477
is really, really difficult.

438
00:23:21,077 --> 00:23:22,698
And it's the same for professional athletes.

439
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:25,800
It requires a lot of skill and training

440
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,582
and showing up at the same time every day

441
00:23:27,662 --> 00:23:30,484
and a lot of drudgery to be able to get to that point

442
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:33,325
where as soon as you need to call upon it, you can.

443
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:37,868
Most people don't have that sort of patience and training.

444
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:41,609
It's actually very difficult.

445
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,730
As any creative person knows,

446
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,991
sometimes it just doesn't happen.

447
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:48,232
Being able to induce that feeling for novices

448
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:50,273
through environment and gameplay, I think,

449
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,554
in a way, is a gift to them.

450
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:55,295
But there's another side to this as well.

451
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,697
Emergency responders will work in pairs

452
00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,557
when they're in the field,

453
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:02,738
because it's very, very easy for everything around them

454
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:05,420
to sort of fall away completely as they're working,

455
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,840
which can put them in danger,

456
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,081
like they might not notice a building about to fall on them.

457
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:12,263
They just, you know, they're so intensely focused

458
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:13,943
on dealing with whatever is at hand

459
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:15,704
that they can't concentrate on that.

460
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:17,345
So you always have a second pair of eyes.

461
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:20,626
Or sometimes they'll work themselves into a state of

462
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:22,948
exhaustion because they don't notice the time is passing.

463
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:27,690
So that's known as time dilation and it's also a super

464
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,211
real and potentially dangerous problem for VR experience as

465
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:38,034
well. This is a quote from the Voices of VR podcast by Kent

466
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:40,556
Bai which is awesome and I highly recommend everybody

467
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:40,976
listen to.

468
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,731
I've had some really weird experiences where I've gone

469
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:47,951
into VR and thought I played for three hours,

470
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:50,992
then came out and realized I had been in there for 12 hours.

471
00:24:51,472 --> 00:24:53,252
I've had that happen a couple of times.

472
00:24:56,113 --> 00:24:59,273
That person who's speaking is a member of the VR community.

473
00:24:59,534 --> 00:25:01,094
He's an early adopter of technology,

474
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:03,114
he understands the tech and the design of it,

475
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:04,995
and even for somebody like that,

476
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:07,775
he can lose time in such a significant way,

477
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:08,515
which just,

478
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:13,602
actually is a little scary. He specifically mentions that it's a tower defense game, which is

479
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:19,569
designed to keep you playing. So perhaps not the best match for that medium for this exact

480
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:24,996
reason. In escape room games and all of these other sort of experiences, you have a timer or

481
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:27,479
you're entering into the experience knowing how long you'll be there.

482
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:31,281
But in VR headsets, you often have no external cues

483
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:32,961
to indicate how much time is passing.

484
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:36,263
So we really need to be good stewards of the flow state

485
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:38,724
when we're working to deliberately induce it

486
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:39,884
in people through our design.

487
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:45,078
However, that narrowed focus from the flow state

488
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:47,840
can be useful and positive when it comes to design as well.

489
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,562
Other elements of the human brain

490
00:25:50,642 --> 00:25:52,143
are less about the responsibility

491
00:25:52,203 --> 00:25:53,484
that you have for the player's body,

492
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,805
their physical needs, their limitations,

493
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:58,207
and more about manipulating them for fun.

494
00:25:59,428 --> 00:26:00,889
That's your fun and theirs as well.

495
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,531
So I want to talk for a minute

496
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:05,312
about what's happening to players mentally

497
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:06,513
when they're in an escape room.

498
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:11,101
They know they're in survival mode, they're excited,

499
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:12,622
we've used lighting cues in design

500
00:26:12,642 --> 00:26:14,204
to sort of bring them into that flow state.

501
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:16,205
So what does it mean to design

502
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:17,666
for that state of their brain?

503
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:19,948
I'm gonna show you a video.

504
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:22,430
It's very important that you follow the instructions

505
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,530
on the screen carefully.

506
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:28,934
Maybe.

507
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:34,178
This is an awareness test.

508
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:39,674
How many passes does the team in white make?

509
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:41,815
Go!

510
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:44,117
The answer is 13.

511
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:46,078
But did you see that?

512
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:08,717
Go!

513
00:27:24,832 --> 00:27:28,115
So that's more generally known as the invisible gorilla experiment.

514
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:35,423
And it's a very good example of how brains and bodies do really weird things in concert when you're in a stressful situation.

515
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:37,885
Like being asked to concentrate on something specifically.

516
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:39,547
And it's that survival mode thing.

517
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:43,190
You see this play out in escape rooms all the time.

518
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:47,253
In ours, we have a hint screen that has a siren that blares

519
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:48,854
any time we send a message through.

520
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:50,635
It's very, very loud.

521
00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:54,037
It's like pretty prominently placed in the room.

522
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:55,859
And you would think it would be very hard to miss,

523
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,600
but it really, people miss it all the time.

524
00:27:59,181 --> 00:28:01,302
They're so deeply engrossed in whatever's going on

525
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:03,444
that there's somebody sitting behind the scenes

526
00:28:03,844 --> 00:28:05,325
jamming a button constantly

527
00:28:05,365 --> 00:28:06,906
until somebody sort of sticks their head up

528
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:08,046
and turns over to look at it.

529
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:16,400
Another funny lizard brain survival mode thing is that we love to look for patterns.

530
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,301
So does this sink look worried to you?

531
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:21,182
Yeah, me too.

532
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:26,345
Also playing is something known as the Heider Simmel illusion, which is a demonstration

533
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:30,167
of how people will come up for a narrative for something simply because it's so easy

534
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:30,948
to read into it.

535
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:35,264
Oh no.

536
00:28:36,386 --> 00:28:40,313
The long story short is that we love to read too much into things.

537
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:43,559
I think that circle is in trouble.

538
00:28:49,304 --> 00:28:51,744
So basically, in situations like this,

539
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:53,405
we're so focused on stuff

540
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:55,025
that we're actually very distracted.

541
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:58,226
We're processing so much information so quickly

542
00:28:58,246 --> 00:29:00,026
that we're seeing things that aren't there,

543
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,087
which is actually really exhausting,

544
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:04,327
not physically, but in your mind.

545
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,428
It's a real thing called brain fatigue.

546
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:08,688
We only have so much processing power in there

547
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:10,609
before we need to sort of recharge our batteries.

548
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:13,770
That power is being spent very, very quickly

549
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,330
when you're throwing a lot of stuff at people

550
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,551
or asking them to engage as deeply as you do

551
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:18,892
in puzzle situations.

552
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:22,353
It's also why, when you're purchasing a car,

553
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:24,533
you're sometimes given lots and lots and lots

554
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:26,814
of customization options right up front.

555
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,255
All the stuff that's expensive by default

556
00:29:29,295 --> 00:29:30,495
comes later in that process

557
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,236
when you're too tired to fight it off anymore.

558
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:37,316
So yeah, what's happening inside people's brains?

559
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:39,559
They're deeply focused to the exclusion

560
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:41,621
of other information, they're quickly searching

561
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:43,463
and processing to try and make connections,

562
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:45,325
and they're getting mentally exhausted

563
00:29:45,345 --> 00:29:46,346
by what they're seeing and doing,

564
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:48,829
but most importantly, they're probably not noticing

565
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:49,590
that that's happening.

566
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:52,533
Luckily for all of us, there's a huge world

567
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:54,815
of design principles and best practices

568
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:56,878
to help us deal with these quirks of the brain.

569
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:02,113
They also help us to answer another larger question,

570
00:30:02,193 --> 00:30:04,115
which is what do we want people to feel?

571
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:07,758
For me, it's very important that they feel enjoyment,

572
00:30:08,758 --> 00:30:11,000
but also a sense of engagement, a mental immersion,

573
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,321
in whatever the experience is,

574
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:14,563
because my particular interest is in narrative stuff.

575
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,485
I like for them to feel a spatial presence,

576
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:21,388
and as well, the transportation, the losing of oneself,

577
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,029
the sense of oneself, your identity.

578
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,152
That's not necessarily inhabiting another character,

579
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:27,393
but it can be.

580
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,231
And something to keep in mind as well,

581
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:36,333
our brains are always searching for reasons

582
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:38,635
to identify something as strange or out of place,

583
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:39,916
another survival mechanism.

584
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:42,359
So you have to play with the level

585
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:45,301
of the suspension of disbelief that you're willing to provide

586
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:46,983
and that people are willing to give to you,

587
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:49,445
as well as speak to them unconsciously

588
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:51,026
in how your environment is set up

589
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:52,067
and how they're performing in it.

590
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,321
Building real life stuff's actually really hard.

591
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,241
But even though we're instinctively searching

592
00:30:58,281 --> 00:30:59,082
for odd things out,

593
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:01,582
people fundamentally want to be entertained.

594
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:03,303
So they're very, very forgiving.

595
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:05,463
They want to be drawn into the illusion.

596
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:09,524
Now this is a great quote from a theme park designer

597
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:11,524
discussing the suspension of disbelief

598
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:12,565
that happens in a theater.

599
00:31:12,665 --> 00:31:14,965
And it's because you're so familiar with the context

600
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:17,466
when as soon as you walk in and you sit down,

601
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:19,866
you know what to expect and you sort of slip into that mode.

602
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:21,387
Happens in a movie theater,

603
00:31:21,427 --> 00:31:23,147
happens in a theater with actors.

604
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:26,749
We are primed by the environment to know what to expect.

605
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,691
So in this context, understanding cognition

606
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:35,092
and processing load guided us in our escape room design,

607
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:37,573
the first one that we made, about the environment

608
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:38,793
and what was gonna be placed in it,

609
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:40,474
with the ultimate goal of never breaking

610
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:41,534
the illusion for people.

611
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:45,456
World building, diegesis, and internal logic

612
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:47,477
is a very good way to ground people

613
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:49,978
when their cognition and physical capabilities

614
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:51,238
are being overloaded.

615
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:56,619
Because you're relying on the players

616
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:58,340
to build a mental model of the world,

617
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,402
as reflected in this quote,

618
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:03,144
you're providing as much indication of that world

619
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:05,586
as possible externally and in your design.

620
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,648
So what are they familiar with?

621
00:32:08,408 --> 00:32:10,470
This is where looking to other media,

622
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,531
physical and otherwise,

623
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:14,093
that shares quality with escape rooms comes into play.

624
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:16,975
Haunted houses, theatrical design, and so on.

625
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:22,598
But cinema and television in particular have a language that we're all very familiar with,

626
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:26,720
the use of high or low camera angles to convey power or weakness, for example.

627
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:32,043
But the backgrounds of these, dressed by set decorators and production designers,

628
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:38,326
consistently convey specific notions of time, location, space, quality, and character.

629
00:32:39,235 --> 00:32:44,385
the way a person has folded their clothes neatly or kicked them under their bed reveals a lot about

630
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:50,015
that person. Ideally nothing is placed in a movie frame by accident because people are absorbing it

631
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:50,796
all all the time.

632
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,470
So I wanna ask you, what does an office look like

633
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:56,831
when you say an office?

634
00:32:56,951 --> 00:32:59,113
What picture do you have in your mind, right?

635
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:02,835
Maybe fluorescent lights, messy desk, filing cabinets,

636
00:33:03,435 --> 00:33:04,455
probably not too pleasant.

637
00:33:05,496 --> 00:33:07,857
Might be better designed, you could have a cool desk,

638
00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:10,919
a plant, or maybe dogs work in your office or hang out.

639
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,761
But it's still a place where work is happening,

640
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:16,042
so there's a lot of utilitarian stuff going on,

641
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:18,683
like messes of cables, piled up mail,

642
00:33:18,924 --> 00:33:20,745
inboxes, that kind of stuff, kind of stressful.

643
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,554
Offices in film and television are often the same.

644
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:27,658
The workers in the show, the office,

645
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:29,602
have small beige desks that are cluttered

646
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:32,648
to sort of convey how dreary their jobs are.

647
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:37,657
And you can compare that to offices in films

648
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:39,498
that we had looked at for design inspiration,

649
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:41,498
which represented some of the story themes

650
00:33:41,538 --> 00:33:44,159
we wanted to exemplify about paranoia

651
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:47,440
and sort of dystopian environments.

652
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,601
Here we have Brazil, which often has desks

653
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:52,842
placed into massive, massive group areas,

654
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:54,462
the open office plan that we all dread.

655
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,045
but 10 times worse, they have magnifying screens

656
00:33:58,165 --> 00:34:01,628
because their actual physical technology is too small.

657
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,990
You can see here he's sharing a desk

658
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,051
with somebody through the wall,

659
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:06,432
so they have this tug of war going.

660
00:34:08,153 --> 00:34:09,494
Next is the lives of others,

661
00:34:09,654 --> 00:34:13,037
which is about a Stasi officer who's eavesdropping on people.

662
00:34:13,937 --> 00:34:17,359
So you can see still like very utilitarian and minimalist,

663
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:19,079
but quite stylized.

664
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,121
And then also an actual Stasi office

665
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,142
with a kind of light color palette

666
00:34:25,222 --> 00:34:26,782
in a sort of surprising way

667
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:28,223
from what my mental picture had been.

668
00:34:30,845 --> 00:34:34,170
So based on looking at those inspirations, this is what we sort of came out with.

669
00:34:34,631 --> 00:34:41,561
Sparse furnishings, theatrical directed lighting, propaganda posters, bonus ducts as a reference

670
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:43,724
to Brazil, banks of technology.

671
00:34:44,738 --> 00:34:46,419
And we knew that these were the sort of things

672
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,900
you would expect to find in an office of that type

673
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,641
and use that expectation to deliberately evoke

674
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:53,721
a sense of otherworldliness, oppression,

675
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:56,922
a distance in time with the use of older technology,

676
00:34:57,383 --> 00:34:58,903
maybe an economical sparseness,

677
00:34:59,203 --> 00:35:01,304
without ever explicitly stating anything

678
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:02,824
about that world in words.

679
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:09,109
The color palettes of the films that were on the previous slide also dictated the choices that we made

680
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,793
in that and other sort of visual design. We used mostly greens and yellows.

681
00:35:14,394 --> 00:35:18,717
You can see a little bit of red here in the environment and in the poster, but in the entire room

682
00:35:19,138 --> 00:35:24,122
there's only one object that's red, which is indicative of a puzzle solution, and by isolating it in that way

683
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:27,104
it meant that the design intent was clear for the solution.

684
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:33,971
And we were kind of pleasantly validated by a film that came out after we had created our room called The Double,

685
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:41,376
which is set in a similarly dystopian sort of world, and used almost the exact same colors, lighting, and mood. That was nice.

686
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:51,422
One other thing that we adhered to for efficiency of communication was the diegesis of puzzles, things that emerge from the world of the room

687
00:35:52,023 --> 00:35:54,784
without coming from the outside, without indicating that they

688
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,706
were created by somebody not within that world.

689
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:01,069
When the world has an internal logic like that,

690
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:05,015
objects and reasons for encoding emerge naturally from it.

691
00:36:05,636 --> 00:36:08,120
And again, good puzzles tell you in their design

692
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,902
how to solve themselves, so it makes sense.

693
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:12,886
I'll walk you through this one pretty quick.

694
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,594
In one of the puzzles, you break into a locked bookshelf,

695
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:16,514
finding a set of books.

696
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:19,236
What information do you have about them immediately?

697
00:36:19,256 --> 00:36:23,238
They were locked behind a sort of censoring unit,

698
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:24,239
and not on their covers.

699
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:26,580
It says they've been taken from the Argovian Library.

700
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:28,521
But they all have titles.

701
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:30,923
You don't actually need to know the titles

702
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:33,304
to solve the puzzle, which you don't know at that time.

703
00:36:33,764 --> 00:36:34,745
But if you look, there are all books

704
00:36:34,765 --> 00:36:36,526
that are among the most frequently banned books

705
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:38,507
in our own society, and have themes relating

706
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,128
to the overarching themes of our room.

707
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:43,556
So maybe try ordering them alphabetically.

708
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:44,697
But that doesn't work.

709
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:47,840
However, you start to see other details emerging.

710
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:50,842
You can look at the Dewey Decimal labels,

711
00:36:50,903 --> 00:36:52,024
the little tabs on the side.

712
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,326
Those are not in alphabetical order

713
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:55,447
when the titles are aligned,

714
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:57,369
but you can see that they have the beginning

715
00:36:57,409 --> 00:36:58,269
and ends of a sentence.

716
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,252
So placing them in that order reveals the code,

717
00:37:01,392 --> 00:37:02,513
the jungle, page 237.

718
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:11,244
In the actual puzzle room you turn to that page in the book and there's a marking on the page a sort of faint indentation

719
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,731
which is the place where you would put a library card

720
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:17,871
with cutouts over the words.

721
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,331
This is spoilers as well,

722
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:20,672
in case you're ever planning to visit.

723
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:23,233
But if you haven't found it already,

724
00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:25,654
in the jacket of the book is the library card.

725
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:27,174
All of the books have that pocket,

726
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:28,875
but only one is holding the card.

727
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:31,455
And knowing that it's a library book

728
00:37:31,556 --> 00:37:33,216
suggests the presence of that card.

729
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:36,697
However, actually, this is kind of a funny thing,

730
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:38,238
but it's becoming an issue

731
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:40,679
because fewer and fewer people who are playing the room

732
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:43,259
use the Dewey Decimal System in libraries.

733
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,142
Same goes for the typewriter and cassette player in the room.

734
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:52,006
The audience is totally aging out of it and sometimes just straight up does not know how

735
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:52,447
to use it.

736
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:58,111
So yeah, you put the card on there, it aligns with a number solution.

737
00:37:59,192 --> 00:38:02,655
Within that room there's only one place to enter a four digit number so you immediately

738
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:04,016
know where it goes.

739
00:38:04,677 --> 00:38:08,120
Or in searching, it becomes obvious as soon as you've found the four digit hole.

740
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:12,644
This is also the first instance of censorship in that world that you encounter.

741
00:38:13,545 --> 00:38:17,829
So in this one puzzle it set you up to understand the nature of the world, why people might be

742
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:22,933
paranoid enough to hide puzzles all around their propaganda office, that kind of stuff. The

743
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:27,496
solution for this gives you access to another higher security level. So you keep opening up

744
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:31,880
deeper and deeper secrets as you progress. So as a player you're gaining dominance over that

745
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,763
world and when it's done right you don't even question that this is the right and just

746
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:37,865
arrangement of the world because you're the star of it.

747
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:47,762
So I'll say, one of the things that we really tried hard to do was make it so that people never had to read anything.

748
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,845
We did a lot of work setting up the world to make it feel like it had its own inherent logic,

749
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:57,687
so we never had to state any of that stuff in words. We wanted to convey as much as possible

750
00:38:57,727 --> 00:39:01,388
without distracting people from the sense of presence in the room and their urgency in working

751
00:39:01,428 --> 00:39:06,170
against the timer. So that meant designing something cohesive with a complicated backstory

752
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:11,552
that informed our design choices without actually putting that backstory in. We made sure that all

753
00:39:11,572 --> 00:39:15,213
of the puzzles were moving the action forward and giving you a sense of progression, because

754
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:15,793
you are the hero.

755
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:21,897
and we designed character interactions to change the game state in very specific ways with minimal dialogue.

756
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:27,521
That's because in these kind of situations, people remember how they felt, not words that they've heard,

757
00:39:27,781 --> 00:39:29,362
and especially not words that they've read.

758
00:39:30,343 --> 00:39:33,085
So interacting with a human makes it very much more real,

759
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:37,968
even more so because they're in that flow state where the efficiency of information becomes really important.

760
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:40,990
You're speaking directly to the brain by putting a human face on it.

761
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:44,357
We reduced all of the character interaction

762
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:46,718
to essentially one line every 15 minutes,

763
00:39:46,738 --> 00:39:48,159
the entire hour that you're in there.

764
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:50,660
And so I'll sort of talk through it.

765
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,100
When you first enter the room,

766
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,421
you know that you're investigating

767
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:57,062
a character who's gone missing.

768
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:00,923
It's their office, you've been sent in as a secret agent.

769
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:02,183
They were deep undercover,

770
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:04,824
working to sabotage propaganda from within.

771
00:40:05,124 --> 00:40:06,485
So that's all the information that you're given.

772
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:13,314
As soon as you get in, your first task unlocks an audio recording found in a locked desk drawer,

773
00:40:14,116 --> 00:40:18,523
which teaches you maybe about the characters' paranoia, the technology that this world is using,

774
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:21,428
their possessions that are in their desks, that kind of stuff.

775
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,710
Then your first interaction with that character comes a few

776
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,272
steps later. You change the security level clearance on a

777
00:40:29,312 --> 00:40:32,313
key card which you send to a prearranged hiding spot that was

778
00:40:32,373 --> 00:40:35,655
indicated in that recording. That alerts that character to

779
00:40:35,675 --> 00:40:38,737
your presence. Obviously this is not somebody reacting in real

780
00:40:38,777 --> 00:40:42,019
time. It's all set up in advance. But story wise they

781
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:44,520
suddenly become aware that you're in their office and you're

782
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,120
there to help them.

783
00:40:46,396 --> 00:40:49,023
So they send back a handwritten note asking for your help

784
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:51,348
escaping the building, along with a coded puzzle

785
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:52,531
that uses the typewriter.

786
00:40:54,097 --> 00:40:55,917
That also teaches you more about technology,

787
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:58,078
about encoding and spy craft, that kind of thing.

788
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:02,100
That puzzle gives you access to a security system,

789
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,141
which you use to trace a guard's path through the space.

790
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:06,842
And this is told through video.

791
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:09,363
Entering the solution sends the path

792
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:11,063
to the character that you're helping,

793
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:13,524
who uses that information to sneak out and avoid the guard.

794
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:15,085
You watch this is happening on a screen

795
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,026
that's totally silent.

796
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:19,586
But then at that point, the character betrays you.

797
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:22,266
They're gonna get themselves out of the building,

798
00:41:22,286 --> 00:41:23,087
but you're on your own.

799
00:41:23,687 --> 00:41:24,888
And so they tell you directly,

800
00:41:24,948 --> 00:41:26,909
the first time that they're actually speaking to you,

801
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:29,050
and this is told via video

802
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,431
with an audio recording that plays,

803
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:33,413
that they've left an electromagnetic pulse device

804
00:41:33,473 --> 00:41:34,313
hidden in their office.

805
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:36,775
So now it's up to you to activate it,

806
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,356
escape the building, and get out.

807
00:41:39,356 --> 00:41:40,677
So with each step of the story,

808
00:41:41,037 --> 00:41:43,138
your goals change, you learn more about the world,

809
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:44,459
and the stakes are raised.

810
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,361
And that was done with really only a couple hundred

811
00:41:47,401 --> 00:41:48,381
written or spoken words.

812
00:41:50,937 --> 00:41:52,297
So how does that affect us in VR?

813
00:41:53,538 --> 00:41:55,820
In some cases, it's the difference of what can be done

814
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,261
only physically versus in a digital environment.

815
00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:01,103
Padlocks are a fantastic example of this.

816
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:05,126
These are things that are extremely limited

817
00:42:05,186 --> 00:42:07,547
by physical realities because there's really

818
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:09,508
only so many types of padlocks in the world

819
00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:12,630
and a lot of them are very, very easy to break.

820
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:18,793
This one specifically is a sliding one and to reset it you have to click it twice.

821
00:42:19,654 --> 00:42:24,596
So there's a sort of debate that we had when we were trying to figure out whether to introduce

822
00:42:24,616 --> 00:42:25,376
this into our room.

823
00:42:26,597 --> 00:42:31,239
Do you put something in there that tells people how to reset it for when they mess it up when

824
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:33,039
they're actually in the game playing it?

825
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:34,620
Because that's a little weird, right?

826
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,841
If it's your own office you don't need instructions to open your own padlock.

827
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:43,874
Or do you pull it out at the beginning, say, okay, you're going to encounter this padlock,

828
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,676
here's how it operates, hoping that they remember when they actually encounter it,

829
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:52,478
but removing the sort of moment of joy of realization when they figure out the sliding

830
00:42:52,518 --> 00:42:57,880
mechanism, how it connects to the puzzle, and so on. Because, again, the joy of the puzzle,

831
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,182
the difficulty of it, is based on how much information you have about it to begin with.

832
00:43:03,022 --> 00:43:06,364
So if you know that you're going to encounter this, you're going to be looking for what it applies to.

833
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:11,519
And of course, in VR, padlocks can be anything

834
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:12,361
because it's magic.

835
00:43:13,484 --> 00:43:15,729
But there's also a technological benefit to this.

836
00:43:17,627 --> 00:43:20,408
If you're letting people fill in the blanks design wise,

837
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:22,730
if you're making it so that it's not super complicated,

838
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,992
if you're using an emotional reaction

839
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:26,372
to carry the weight of a story,

840
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:28,534
you don't have to make as much stuff.

841
00:43:29,014 --> 00:43:31,276
And in VR that means less stuff to model,

842
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:32,797
less environments to design.

843
00:43:32,817 --> 00:43:35,078
So you can use these principles

844
00:43:35,158 --> 00:43:36,979
to make dev time more efficient

845
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,560
and a more positive experience

846
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:39,941
for the people who are actually in there

847
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:41,683
because they're not laid in with too much stuff.

848
00:43:43,745 --> 00:43:48,709
Playing with the imagination in this way is something you see a lot in black box theater, for example.

849
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:53,393
People really don't need a full set to enjoy what they're seeing or for it to be real to them.

850
00:43:54,614 --> 00:44:02,120
There's a Nicole Kidman film called Dogville where it's set on a stage where houses, the outlines are taped out.

851
00:44:02,921 --> 00:44:07,503
It becomes this really interesting extra dimension of communication when you can see into the

852
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:11,526
house next to you and people are pretending to not see the terrible things that are happening,

853
00:44:11,886 --> 00:44:14,027
but everything is totally visible all at the same time.

854
00:44:14,547 --> 00:44:17,349
Of course, that's done without ever instructing people on how that works.

855
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:18,149
People just get it.

856
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:22,372
This is tapping directly into the imagination.

857
00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:26,754
We don't really need hyperrealism because we have that kind of magic.

858
00:44:27,035 --> 00:44:28,936
It's engaging directly with the mind's eye.

859
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:32,209
And so a lot of that comes down to reducing

860
00:44:32,249 --> 00:44:35,031
the already overloaded cognitive burden of the players

861
00:44:35,471 --> 00:44:38,374
by suggesting information and speaking to the subconscious

862
00:44:38,454 --> 00:44:40,175
rather than putting it all up in their faces.

863
00:44:43,398 --> 00:44:46,000
So here's a question that I ask myself a lot.

864
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:47,542
Does this matter?

865
00:44:47,562 --> 00:44:49,383
And will people even notice

866
00:44:49,483 --> 00:44:51,345
if you're trying these kind of design techniques?

867
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,718
I use this example because it's from Args.

868
00:44:56,198 --> 00:44:57,880
There's always somebody behind the curtain

869
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,003
in any sort of designed experience, right?

870
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:02,245
Sometimes people really badly wanna look

871
00:45:02,365 --> 00:45:04,107
behind that curtain, it's kind of inevitable.

872
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,390
But it's our job as entertainers to sort of try

873
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,092
and prevent that from happening generally

874
00:45:09,553 --> 00:45:11,034
because it takes people out of that immersion.

875
00:45:13,048 --> 00:45:15,870
When it's done right, it's completely invisible to people,

876
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,071
and that's because it's working.

877
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:19,433
So that sometimes makes people believe

878
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:20,453
that it's not important,

879
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:22,695
and it often makes people believe that it's easy,

880
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:23,836
but it really isn't.

881
00:45:25,817 --> 00:45:26,637
So why should we care?

882
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,499
Why should we put in the effort for that?

883
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,681
VR's been around a long time,

884
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:34,663
but really only recently has the technology

885
00:45:34,703 --> 00:45:36,324
kind of caught up to our imaginations.

886
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:41,700
We have a really interesting opportunity to engage with the mind's eye in a language that

887
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:48,048
actually doesn't exist yet, which I think is super exciting. Anything that we make now is going to

888
00:45:48,088 --> 00:45:52,574
set the standard for everything that comes later. So we need to be working to make the foundations

889
00:45:52,594 --> 00:45:54,477
of the kind of work we wish to see in the future.

890
00:45:56,218 --> 00:45:57,698
Right now there's a lot of VR stuff

891
00:45:57,719 --> 00:45:59,339
that speaks directly to the lizard brain.

892
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:02,501
Stuff that plays on claustrophobia, the startle response,

893
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:04,121
your sort of sense of vertigo.

894
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:06,562
And it's really fun to explore that.

895
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,863
But it's resulting in an image of VR

896
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:11,244
that looks to people on the outside of the industry,

897
00:46:11,344 --> 00:46:12,045
kind of like this.

898
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:21,621
One of the most common questions that we get for escape rooms,

899
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:23,822
and that I see with people interacting with VR,

900
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:25,023
is, is it scary?

901
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:26,864
And being scary is fine.

902
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:27,945
I love scary.

903
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:28,865
Scary is really fun.

904
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:31,947
The middle gif is of Erika Ishii,

905
00:46:31,987 --> 00:46:33,648
who has an awesome show called Scaredy Cats,

906
00:46:33,688 --> 00:46:34,849
where she plays scary games.

907
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,131
So I'm sorry for using that gif as the example

908
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:40,032
of people being scared in VR.

909
00:46:41,253 --> 00:46:42,994
But the human brain is such an amazing

910
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:44,755
and complicated and beautiful thing.

911
00:46:45,075 --> 00:46:47,397
And scary is such a small part of that.

912
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:51,796
When we talk about VR as a medium of infinite possibility,

913
00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:54,361
and when we do that, we're talking about feeling

914
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:56,625
and experiencing those infinite things.

915
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:59,230
Speaking in the language of the brain

916
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,033
is what gives us such an incredible palette.

917
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:07,377
So how do we best take care of the people inside our experiences?

918
00:47:08,218 --> 00:47:12,063
How do we show them respect? How do we transport them, entertain them,

919
00:47:12,523 --> 00:47:15,066
give them magic in a way that's never been experienced before?

920
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:19,291
These are the questions that it's our responsibility to find answers for,

921
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:21,013
and it's what we've been tasked with.

922
00:47:22,074 --> 00:47:28,179
With the rise of industrial automation and self-driving cars, we can expect increased leisure time and demand for entertainment

923
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:35,364
The answers that we find for this right now that we prioritize and that we decide to pursue are what are going to influence future

924
00:47:35,404 --> 00:47:36,605
generations of makers

925
00:47:37,746 --> 00:47:40,167
So together let's work and make magic happen

926
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:41,408
Thank you

927
00:47:51,475 --> 00:47:57,381
I don't know if there are questions or if people just want

928
00:47:57,401 --> 00:48:00,604
to come and meet in the wrap up lounge across the way and chat

929
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:04,207
about this kind of stuff. I can go over there. Yeah.

930
00:48:04,227 --> 00:48:07,450
Do you want to go first? You can go first. Okay. Great. Hey.

931
00:48:09,986 --> 00:48:12,667
what do you think about the intersection,

932
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:15,749
or the possible intersection of interactive theater,

933
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:19,511
like Sleep No More, and puzzle-oriented things

934
00:48:19,531 --> 00:48:20,351
like Room Escape?

935
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,692
You could make an argument that they would go together great,

936
00:48:23,073 --> 00:48:25,134
or you could see them as being incompatible

937
00:48:25,154 --> 00:48:26,454
in some fundamental way.

938
00:48:26,474 --> 00:48:27,915
And I'm curious what your viewpoint is on that.

939
00:48:28,215 --> 00:48:36,880
Sure. So the question is, can interactive theater like Sleep No More integrate lessons from puzzle design or maybe puzzle experiences?

940
00:48:38,061 --> 00:48:45,165
Actually, Sleep No More tried an interactive sort of thing. I think it was a collaboration with the MIT Media Lab or Game Lab, I could be wrong.

941
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:50,648
But they had a thing where the mask that you wear throughout the entire experience had an RFID.

942
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:55,954
unit in it that would interact with the environment. So as you move through the space,

943
00:48:55,994 --> 00:49:00,699
which is totally open, it takes place in a six-story warehouse, and there's no stage.

944
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:04,563
The entire space is the stage. The characters are continually present in that space.

945
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:08,467
And the show loops three times, so you're following them around that whole time.

946
00:49:09,308 --> 00:49:12,269
So there was a second layer with people who had those special masks.

947
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,210
Books would fly off the shelf and you could interact with a typewriter and stuff.

948
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:20,752
But it was a completely curated thing. You were just following a set path.

949
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:27,374
And I think that one of the main reasons they ended up not implementing it is because people wanted more agency within that.

950
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:32,536
Sleep No More, the way that that set is designed, everything in it is real.

951
00:49:32,596 --> 00:49:37,957
So if there's like a jacket hanging up, you can look in the pocket and there's like a letter in there that's from the world of Macbeth.

952
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:38,838
It's all real.

953
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:45,039
Which is really fun, because I'm an exploring type game player, so I just want to poke around.

954
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:46,280
I want to look in every drawer.

955
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,283
It takes me a really long time to play games like Genmu, because I want to look inside

956
00:49:50,343 --> 00:49:50,864
every cabinet.

957
00:49:52,465 --> 00:49:56,749
But I would find that frustrating, because the story that they had chosen was about saving

958
00:49:56,789 --> 00:50:01,713
somebody who is not saved in the end, and so that was a bad experience for people.

959
00:50:01,753 --> 00:50:02,934
They wanted to have more choice.

960
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:06,757
So it's possible, but maybe not in that context.

961
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:15,371
I was wondering if you had any insight on bad escape room design. I play a lot of video

962
00:50:15,391 --> 00:50:20,014
games. I think after playing 20 years of games you know that things like respawning enemies

963
00:50:20,074 --> 00:50:26,600
are typically not great. But I was at an escape room in Wisconsin and there was a puzzle that

964
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:32,745
dealt with these keys that were colored and they were laid out on the counter and basically

965
00:50:33,065 --> 00:50:36,926
like we could pick up and move these keys and we had forgotten what order they were originally in

966
00:50:37,366 --> 00:50:42,428
and then later on like 30 minutes later in the puzzle like right, the timer was counting down

967
00:50:42,888 --> 00:50:48,550
it, the final puzzle relied on those keys, their original position and we ended up not being able

968
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:52,531
to solve it. So I was wondering if, we thought that was bad design but I mean we're not. But

969
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:54,551
anyway I was just curious what you think about stuff like that.

970
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:58,232
No, I think that, yeah, that's poorly designed

971
00:50:58,272 --> 00:50:59,953
because you noticed it, right?

972
00:50:59,993 --> 00:51:01,515
You were frustrated by it.

973
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,297
There's a certain level of frustration

974
00:51:03,317 --> 00:51:05,019
that can be expected in those environments,

975
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,963
which is fun, but past a certain point, it's no longer fun.

976
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:12,327
And so, actually, I'll share something

977
00:51:12,347 --> 00:51:13,368
that's just happened this week.

978
00:51:13,648 --> 00:51:16,711
I designed the Resident Evil room that's currently on tour.

979
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:23,595
in collaboration with IM8Bit. So I was in Portland where the first one was and I worked

980
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:27,676
really closely with getting that one set up. But I have not been involved in the running of

981
00:51:27,716 --> 00:51:34,738
the other sites. Another one that just launched in a different city, I wasn't involved, I

982
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:38,959
wasn't there to say fix this or fix this. And on their opening night a lot of stuff was

983
00:51:38,999 --> 00:51:41,400
broken. That's when all of the reviewers came through.

984
00:51:43,053 --> 00:51:44,073
Yeah, great, right?

985
00:51:45,494 --> 00:51:46,535
But you know, that's fair.

986
00:51:46,775 --> 00:51:49,756
When the design, when the environment doesn't speak to you,

987
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:51,697
when it's broken down, that's the game.

988
00:51:51,797 --> 00:51:52,597
That's the whole game.

989
00:51:52,678 --> 00:51:54,298
And it becomes a bad game in that case.

990
00:51:55,339 --> 00:51:56,659
And one of the things in there

991
00:51:56,699 --> 00:51:58,160
is exactly that same sort of stuff.

992
00:52:01,102 --> 00:52:04,403
I'm assuming that nobody here is gonna go play,

993
00:52:04,743 --> 00:52:06,064
but if you are, cover your ears.

994
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:08,605
One of the puzzles involves removing

995
00:52:08,905 --> 00:52:09,866
picture frames from a wall.

996
00:52:10,575 --> 00:52:14,298
And there needed to be something in there that indicated which wall that had come from.

997
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,700
And so each of the walls has a different artistic theme.

998
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,363
Oh yeah, I see you covering. Sorry, keep, keep, almost done.

999
00:52:20,743 --> 00:52:24,606
Yeah, so when you pull that off, if you weren't paying attention in that moment,

1000
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:26,568
you can sort of match it back with the theme.

1001
00:52:27,028 --> 00:52:30,051
And I think even that as a sort of basic level is kind of essential.

1002
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:31,472
Yeah.

1003
00:52:33,857 --> 00:52:34,938
Hi, thanks for the talk.

1004
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,698
That was awesome.

1005
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:38,458
I am curious.

1006
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:40,679
So I feel like when we're talking about taking care of

1007
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:43,060
our players in an experience like this that's very

1008
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,521
collaborative, one of the ways that it's easy to feel not

1009
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:49,441
taken care of maybe is socially, like that maybe your

1010
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:51,402
teammates are solving the puzzles and you're getting

1011
00:52:51,442 --> 00:52:51,942
left behind.

1012
00:52:52,022 --> 00:52:54,303
And I'm wondering what your approach is to facilitating a

1013
00:52:54,983 --> 00:52:56,823
good collaborative experience in escape rooms.

1014
00:52:57,977 --> 00:53:03,242
So the question is about, as a player you mean, as teammates, is that right?

1015
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:04,143
Yeah.

1016
00:53:04,343 --> 00:53:07,366
So as a team person, as a player within it with other people,

1017
00:53:07,607 --> 00:53:09,428
how can it be a good collaborative experience?

1018
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:14,093
Because I do competitive puzzle stuff for fun,

1019
00:53:14,293 --> 00:53:16,636
I've had a lot of training as a group.

1020
00:53:17,797 --> 00:53:19,638
There's a lot of sort of natural inclinations

1021
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:21,159
that you have to learn to overcome.

1022
00:53:21,959 --> 00:53:24,101
Like as an example, sometimes there will be

1023
00:53:24,141 --> 00:53:25,662
like a Sudoku puzzle or something.

1024
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:27,743
You only need to solve just a little bit of it

1025
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:29,825
in order to get the solution to get to the next thing.

1026
00:53:30,525 --> 00:53:32,607
Your natural reaction to that is to want to solve

1027
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:33,908
the entire Sudoku, right?

1028
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:35,489
But you don't need to.

1029
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:38,671
So to be able to sort of train yourself to skip over that

1030
00:53:38,831 --> 00:53:39,972
is like a major part of it.

1031
00:53:39,992 --> 00:53:43,254
And in that same way, knowing the strengths and weaknesses

1032
00:53:43,294 --> 00:53:44,895
of your other teammates is very important.

1033
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:48,497
Often you need somebody to be able to step back

1034
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:50,338
and watch and see what's going on,

1035
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:53,700
to notice when something's been found on that other side

1036
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,781
that goes over there, that kind of stuff.

1037
00:53:56,702 --> 00:53:58,263
We do a lot of corporate team building

1038
00:53:58,303 --> 00:54:00,984
and it's extremely revealing about the sort of places

1039
00:54:01,024 --> 00:54:02,145
you would or would not want to work.

1040
00:54:06,008 --> 00:54:07,009
Hey, thanks for your talk.

1041
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:11,391
So you were talking about preparing the players

1042
00:54:11,411 --> 00:54:12,611
for suspension of disbelief.

1043
00:54:13,932 --> 00:54:16,473
And I noticed that sometimes escape rooms

1044
00:54:16,493 --> 00:54:19,695
will use something like a pre-speel or a movie

1045
00:54:20,155 --> 00:54:22,476
to set up the whole theming for that.

1046
00:54:23,436 --> 00:54:25,057
I was wondering if you had any best practices

1047
00:54:25,117 --> 00:54:26,238
for that in escape rooms

1048
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:28,679
and how that might relate to a VR player

1049
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,760
who's going into a virtual experience for the first time.

1050
00:54:32,488 --> 00:54:32,729
Sure.

1051
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:35,730
So the question is sort of about priming people

1052
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,571
for the experience with a video or whatever else.

1053
00:54:39,111 --> 00:54:41,031
And I think it's gonna be a little bit different

1054
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:43,212
for a physical thing versus a virtual one.

1055
00:54:44,753 --> 00:54:46,313
Best practices for escape rooms.

1056
00:54:47,554 --> 00:54:49,334
Again, my preference is going to always be

1057
00:54:49,554 --> 00:54:50,975
heavily on the narrative side.

1058
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:52,736
So I don't want to just be told,

1059
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:54,856
hey, welcome to this place, here's the deal.

1060
00:54:55,757 --> 00:54:58,920
I want it to be in character, revealing enough

1061
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,682
that it seems mysterious, but really intriguing.

1062
00:55:01,722 --> 00:55:03,844
You need to be given a sort of purpose or mission.

1063
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:07,327
I think it's gonna be very different in VR though

1064
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:09,068
because of directed attention.

1065
00:55:09,549 --> 00:55:11,631
It's kind of easier when you're not just sort of

1066
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:12,972
like standing, shuffling around,

1067
00:55:13,032 --> 00:55:14,293
when there's like obvious cues

1068
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:15,634
that will draw you into stuff.

1069
00:55:16,555 --> 00:55:18,176
But I mean, the setup should be the same.

1070
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:20,499
Like you should know where you are

1071
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:23,902
and what you're doing at least, that kind of stuff, yeah.

1072
00:55:28,503 --> 00:55:35,190
So I have a question that you you touched briefly on immersive theater in addition to competitive escape rooms

1073
00:55:37,272 --> 00:55:41,196
Because you don't see this as much in the competitive thing, but I'm wondering with the

1074
00:55:42,317 --> 00:55:46,662
Things like you know players getting into a flow state players getting into survival mode, etc

1075
00:55:48,964 --> 00:55:50,426
Do you have any thoughts about how

1076
00:55:51,517 --> 00:55:54,959
getting players to perform in like a role play capacity,

1077
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,322
like if everyone goes into a room and you're Professor Plum,

1078
00:55:58,362 --> 00:55:59,522
you're Miss Peacock, et cetera,

1079
00:56:01,303 --> 00:56:03,825
how do players react to that, I guess?

1080
00:56:05,419 --> 00:56:08,560
So the question basically is how do you make people role play?

1081
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:10,141
Basically.

1082
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:14,443
I personally really don't enjoy role playing.

1083
00:56:15,183 --> 00:56:16,083
I'm not a performer.

1084
00:56:16,603 --> 00:56:18,524
This kind of stuff makes me feel really awkward.

1085
00:56:19,424 --> 00:56:21,445
So I try and avoid it at all costs, generally.

1086
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:23,586
But often in a group, there will be

1087
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,987
somebody who is totally all about that.

1088
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,268
And so we just sort of will push them forward into it.

1089
00:56:29,368 --> 00:56:32,089
If I know that that's what I'm going to engage in beforehand

1090
00:56:32,129 --> 00:56:33,230
and I have some preparation.

1091
00:56:33,988 --> 00:56:35,569
that makes it much, much easier for me.

1092
00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:38,570
If you go over to SFMOMA for the exhibition

1093
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,370
that they have right there,

1094
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,171
there's a game running right now called Bad News,

1095
00:56:42,771 --> 00:56:46,353
which is you interacting with an actor who's improvising

1096
00:56:46,673 --> 00:56:48,473
based on characters in a town

1097
00:56:48,513 --> 00:56:50,214
that you choose your sort of path through it.

1098
00:56:51,234 --> 00:56:52,615
You say, I'm gonna speak to this person,

1099
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,635
the curtain comes back, it's the actor.

1100
00:56:55,075 --> 00:56:57,096
They talk to you, you get information from them,

1101
00:56:57,416 --> 00:56:58,136
the curtain closes.

1102
00:56:58,837 --> 00:57:01,197
So that's about the right level of role play for me.

1103
00:57:02,257 --> 00:57:05,038
I had to come up with my occupation

1104
00:57:05,118 --> 00:57:07,019
and a set sort of cover story,

1105
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:09,359
but because I was being coached through it

1106
00:57:09,399 --> 00:57:10,899
and because I knew what it was going in,

1107
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,180
I was comfortable enough to at least do that level.

1108
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,221
So I think it's just about preparation.

1109
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:18,561
And part of that, sorry, just to clarify,

1110
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,802
was that you got there and then they had you

1111
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:23,482
come up with an occupation and things

1112
00:57:23,502 --> 00:57:24,863
as part of the experience to prime you?

1113
00:57:26,564 --> 00:57:31,466
So the premise of it is that you're delivering the bad news of someone's death to somebody in the town

1114
00:57:32,466 --> 00:57:33,887
And that's all that I knew when I came in

1115
00:57:34,387 --> 00:57:37,969
You're actually you're a mortician's assistant or part of the city morgue

1116
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:43,431
And they said you're going to encounter a lot of people some of them might be reluctant to speak to you

1117
00:57:43,491 --> 00:57:45,552
so what are you going to tell them and

1118
00:57:46,192 --> 00:57:50,233
You know, you kind of have to weave something together. They suggested things to you though because I was like

1119
00:57:51,514 --> 00:57:53,615
You know, I'm not that's not my thing. So

1120
00:57:54,475 --> 00:57:55,135
Thank you. Thanks

1121
00:57:56,538 --> 00:57:58,605
So I think that's all of the time for questions,

1122
00:57:58,665 --> 00:58:00,652
but I'm gonna go over to the little wrap-up lounge

1123
00:58:00,692 --> 00:58:02,238
in case anybody wants to chat further.

1124
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:03,482
Thank you so much for coming.
