00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:10,953
Hello, everyone. I'm Guy Constantine from Skydings. This

2
00:00:10,993 --> 00:00:11,893
is Chris Bussey.

3
00:00:12,393 --> 00:00:12,734
Hello.

4
00:00:12,754 --> 00:00:16,315
We're here to talk to you about the Walking Dead Saints and

5
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:20,256
Sinners and sort of like the journey from creation to market.

6
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:24,257
It's been a wild ride. So hopefully you'll have a great

7
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:27,578
time. I'm the head of marketing. So take everything I say with a

8
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:31,560
grain of salt. And Chris is the head of production. So he's

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,440
going to be telling you about a whole bunch of stuff you can't

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:33,540
get.

11
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:39,926
So we are Skydance Interactive,

12
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:41,667
members of the Skydance family.

13
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,089
You may have seen some of our stuff.

14
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:47,031
We put out Archangel, Archangel Hellfire,

15
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:48,572
Saints and Sinners on the game side.

16
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:51,654
On the TV side, we've done stuff like Foundation,

17
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:55,317
that's coming up soon, Jet Cry and Altered Carbon.

18
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,659
On the film side, things like Mission Impossible,

19
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,181
the upcoming Top Gun and The Old Guard on Netflix.

20
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:03,862
And we also have a nascent animation division

21
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:06,324
that recently announced that they're working on a title.

22
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:13,684
So we do a lot of things, but the people that you're talking to now are the ones that are really focused on the game side of things.

23
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:23,807
We've been working on VR gaming and before that just sort of the edge of what technology would allow gaming for quite some time.

24
00:01:23,827 --> 00:01:26,207
So hopefully you'll find this interesting.

25
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:27,348
Yep.

26
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,108
I'm going to hand it off to Chris to talk about the game.

27
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:35,059
Yeah, so we're here to talk about Saints and Sinners.

28
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:41,583
And this is the third VR game that we ended up making

29
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:45,025
and really learned lessons from each of them.

30
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:47,026
Go ahead and give me the next slide.

31
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:52,329
We began knowing that we wanted to make a VR title

32
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:55,290
and we knew that we had The Walking Dead

33
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,452
and so we wanted to live in that world.

34
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:00,313
And one of the great things that VR does

35
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:01,174
is really let you...

36
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:10,676
inhabit not just the world, but a character. And we wanted to put you in that world. In fact,

37
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:16,958
one of our early, you know, ideas about what the, the, you know, tagline of the game might be is

38
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:21,959
live the walking dead. And so all of our choices were really centered around that wanting the

39
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:27,800
player to feel like that, what would they do if they were in this world? Right? And

40
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:33,847
So, you know, really wanted to focus in on kind of giving player a huge amount of choice in what

41
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:38,113
they do at any time. Anytime you're talking to anybody, you can, you know, mess with them and

42
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:43,219
interact with them and do various different things. So we wanted those choices to really be there.

43
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,221
And we wanted that world to be...

44
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:47,965
you know, expansive and feel real.

45
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:51,029
We wanted to kind of go beyond that kind of entry level,

46
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,853
you know, VR experience that, you know, we had been exploring as well

47
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:57,096
as we got more used to kind of VR as a medium.

48
00:02:57,136 --> 00:03:00,921
We wanted to really push the limits and bring that full kind of game

49
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:04,866
experience to that everybody's looking for, you know, with combat and exploration.

50
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:12,110
you know, letting your weapons and stuff degrade. And that's, you know, where we kind of came at it

51
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,913
from and ended up discovering these pillars, right? You know, the visceral brutality and the,

52
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:21,936
you know, anxiety inducing. And really that anxiety inducing is the secret sauce that we're

53
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:29,580
going to talk about here next. The tension engine. This is the engine that runs the whole thing.

54
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:34,254
creates this kind of vicious loop, right?

55
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:37,075
So you have dwindling supplies

56
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,096
and you have your weapons degrading

57
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:42,497
and you're trying to kind of move through the world.

58
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:44,938
But as these things are degrading,

59
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:48,700
that forces you to go out and explore and find new supplies

60
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,161
and upgrade your weapons and find new weapons.

61
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:56,903
And of course, when you do that, that puts you in contact with other people and walkers.

62
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:01,625
And now all of a sudden you're going to end up in combat and maybe you'll get injured,

63
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:05,087
which forces you to go and find medicine and bandage yourself,

64
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:08,788
which leads you back to the crafting.

65
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,129
And so it becomes this kind of.

66
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:15,130
tightening cycle that we put you in pressure at all times.

67
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,571
And so the world is just a little bit too big to casually explore.

68
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,831
And your time is a little bit too short or, you know, zombies come,

69
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:25,512
you know, just as you're kind of hoping for a little respite and stuff like that.

70
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:29,112
And so we've got this just beautiful cycle where, you know,

71
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:32,773
if you're playing really well, things seem to be going fine.

72
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:35,794
But when, you know, you make the small mistakes,

73
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:39,414
we're there to just kind of put you into a bit of stress and a bit of tension.

74
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:40,455
And.

75
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:45,627
you know, this is very much in line with the walking dead, right? You see a walker,

76
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:51,229
they're shuffling around a little slowly, you think you got it, right? And then you turn a

77
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:56,811
corner and all of a sudden the situation turned to shit and you don't know how to handle it.

78
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:02,813
So, the tension engine is predicated on the concept of fragility, player fragility,

79
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:09,696
like you're constantly sort of trying to survive. And you think just when you think that you have

80
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:10,456
it under control.

81
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:16,590
Things fall apart. You drop a gun in an alley in the middle of a confrontation, all of a sudden your firearm is gone.

82
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,332
You only have a melee weapon. The melee weapon falls apart.

83
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:26,956
So it's again, it's this kind of ebb and flow between healing control and the loss of control that powers this.

84
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:30,298
Yeah, it's definitely not intended to be a hero's journey.

85
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,661
So let's talk a little bit about what that...

86
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:41,530
daily, the average day of a survivor in a post-apocalyptic New Orleans, which is the setting for the game.

87
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:48,875
So you wake up, you're going to be at a hub where you have your supplies, a little bit of safety or perceived safety.

88
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:56,380
And you're going to have the ability to gear up to prepare yourself for whatever quest you're on or whatever objective you have.

89
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,702
Maybe you need some medicine because you're sick and your health has been deteriorating,

90
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:05,005
or maybe you're actually going after one of the tasks that somebody in the world assigned to you.

91
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:08,137
And so you get ready, you go out, you take your skiff.

92
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,438
Since New Orleans is semi-flooded,

93
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:12,679
you kind of make your way out into the city.

94
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,140
And you find that the house that you're meant to go to

95
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,160
is fortified.

96
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,602
There's humans, which are the major enemies

97
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,282
in the Walking Dead franchise.

98
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:25,123
And they're there.

99
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:27,304
They're just kind of, they don't want to let you in.

100
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:30,045
So you have a couple of approaches that you can take.

101
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:33,906
You may decide a full frontal assault is the way to go.

102
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,711
It doesn't look like you're going to be doing that hot though, because you have, you know,

103
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,992
a six shooter and a knife and they have ARs.

104
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:45,873
So you can look around, there's a crack under the foundation of the house, maybe you can

105
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,414
sneak in by going under the house.

106
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,355
Maybe you can climb to get up from a higher level.

107
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:56,856
As you make your way in the house, you search room to room trying to find the objective.

108
00:06:57,857 --> 00:07:01,258
And you get ambushed by some walkers because they cracked into the house, there was some

109
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:03,578
fire, and all of a sudden.

110
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,930
that your time is dwindling.

111
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,611
People are shooting everywhere.

112
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:08,811
You have to make your way out.

113
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:10,952
You lucked out this time around.

114
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:12,433
You were able to get your objective.

115
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,774
You kind of noticed it from the corner of your eye

116
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,054
and just quickly grabbed it up.

117
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:18,015
And so you hear the bells,

118
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:19,736
the bells are sort of our alarm system

119
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,396
that tells you that the tower,

120
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,557
the dominant faction is going to flood the area with walkers.

121
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:26,378
And so you just got to book it out of there

122
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:28,259
if you don't want to have to survive through a herd.

123
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:32,498
And so that's sort of a day in the life, right?

124
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,301
This is kind of a session, a gameplay session.

125
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:38,645
We wanted to make it sort of digestible in a short chunk

126
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:43,912
and simultaneously, you know, giving you that hit of anxiety

127
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:45,554
that the game is really known for.

128
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:50,354
Absolutely. And those layers of choices go throughout, you know, guy mentions, you know,

129
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:53,735
you didn't necessarily have to crawl under the house, you could have climbed a pipe or done a

130
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:57,656
frontal assault. But even a step back from that, you didn't even have to necessarily pick this

131
00:07:57,756 --> 00:08:02,237
mission, you've got a bunch of missions on your map that you could go to. And so really kind of

132
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:08,139
leaning into that idea that, you know, these sandboxes allow for player expression on how

133
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:13,660
they want to take things on. And even the world itself allows you to, you know, go in in a bunch

134
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,400
of different ways. And

135
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:17,164
whatever kind of suits the way that you like to play.

136
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:22,614
So, yeah, these gifts are are.

137
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:29,069
indicating, you know, kind of the melee brutality, but really, this is an extension of that whole

138
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:33,572
VRness that we wanted to bring the presence that we wanted to have there, right? You know,

139
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:38,155
you're pulling your axe off of your back, you're pulling your backpack out, you're rifling through

140
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:42,058
putting things into, you know, sorting through your backpack, grabbing stuff out of your slots.

141
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:46,321
And, and it's one of the real strengths of VR is, is bringing that

142
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:53,027
that just sense of presence the entire time. And we really wanted that to come into the combat

143
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:57,891
itself as well. And, you know, whether you're, you know, swinging an axe or, you know, one of our,

144
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,794
you know, handmade signs that, you know, turned into a knife or using your firearms, you know,

145
00:09:02,814 --> 00:09:08,199
we want to feel the reload of the gun, the aiming, the, you know, sinking the knife really

146
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:11,261
into the walker's head and having to, you know, drive it all the way home to.

147
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:17,183
to deal with them, but it's all part of this kind of

148
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,784
physicality and presence that we wanted to be there.

149
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:22,265
And this is why it became kind of one of our central pillars

150
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:26,566
was just the there-ness that you felt

151
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:27,406
as you played the game.

152
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:31,167
We knew it was really difficult in VR

153
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:34,208
to sort of nail the concept of melee combat.

154
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,729
And we also simultaneously knew that VR

155
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:40,470
was one of those places where melee could feel

156
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:46,592
the best you've ever felt it. And so the team put so much time into making every contact

157
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:53,621
with the walkers, various appendages, feel realistic because it just levels up that

158
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:55,203
anxiety that we were talking about earlier.

159
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,730
And this, again, leaning into,

160
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,892
there are other key pillar is just that,

161
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:05,073
and that whole tension engine is really looking

162
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:09,075
for those opportunities for win and creating them

163
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:12,777
for the players to make mistakes, right?

164
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,578
You know, in the left one there,

165
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,979
you're searching through the house

166
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,061
and you're trying to get into a new room with your ax,

167
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:20,041
chopping through some wood.

168
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,542
And of course, right, as you kind of,

169
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:26,184
are making that noise you turn and of course a walkers coming because they're attracted by the

170
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:30,687
sound and suddenly you've got to deal with not getting into that room but dealing with this

171
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:35,809
walker and then the other one you know you've got this guy he's obviously got himself into the spot

172
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:38,010
of trouble with a whole herd coming after him.

173
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,852
and he's bandaging himself and pulling out his gun feeling,

174
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:42,493
all right, I've totally got this,

175
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:45,734
but maybe he doesn't have totally have this, right?

176
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,336
That's a, as Guy likes to point out,

177
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:52,118
that's a two shot shotgun that he's got going on there.

178
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:54,659
So, he's feeling totally confident, boom,

179
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:56,380
you see he gets the first shot off

180
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,921
and then he's just about to get the second shot off

181
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:58,701
and then what?

182
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,562
He's gonna have to fumble and reload

183
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:02,824
or grab another weapon out of his pack

184
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:04,585
or out of his holster or something like that

185
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:05,525
or hope that he's got.

186
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,086
you know, his katana ready.

187
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:12,890
You know, these are all opportunities to really find that area

188
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,811
for putting the player under real stress.

189
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:17,913
And we really wanted you to feel that stress yourself. Right.

190
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:18,653
It's intentional.

191
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:23,076
Now, you will learn a lot about yourself trying to survive in this game.

192
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:25,617
You'll learn about your preferences and weapons.

193
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,860
You'll learn that a two handed weapon isn't always as cool as it looks.

194
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:33,402
So it's something that we feel pretty happy about.

195
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:41,939
And yeah, as Guy alluded to, this is a huge part of the Walking Dead IP, the human angle of it.

196
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,524
You know, the great quote I love that maybe Kirkman himself, he said, you know, the walkers are the weather.

197
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:55,570
You deal with them as they come. But the real issue, what you're really dealing with is people.

198
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,934
both the people that you meet and interact with, but also yourself, how you interact and deal with it.

199
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:08,058
We wanted to really kind of explore what you would do when there were no rules.

200
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:13,561
How would you react? What would you do when the consequences, even within the game themselves, are just...

201
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:15,422
how you feel about it, right?

202
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:19,024
You know, we do some, you know, consequence building,

203
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:24,026
but it's mostly about exploring how you would deal

204
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:27,128
with all of this kind of stress and possibilities

205
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:30,849
and wanting to kind of let people live that experience.

206
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:36,392
And the, yeah, the inventory and exploration, this is...

207
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:54,335
you know, more of that kind of VRness is really wanted to lean into that, you know, physicality of it there, you know, from the wrapping the bandages around yourself to, you know, the climbing and stuff like that, you know, and even the map exploration, you know, physically picking up the map and stuff like that. We wanted that presence to be there, but

208
00:12:54,735 --> 00:13:00,899
There were also again opportunities for you to, you know, not play perfectly and, you know,

209
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:02,360
allow that tension engine to come in.

210
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,742
You know, you make a misstep while you're climbing and you might fall into the pack

211
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:11,085
of zombies that are down there or, you know, you grab the wrong bandage or you run out of bandages.

212
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,187
You forget that you didn't have a bandage in your pack and suddenly now

213
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,308
when you're really net health it's not there for you.

214
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:20,290
These are all just more aspects that lean into those kind

215
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,271
of key pillars that we were driving towards.

216
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,294
I think the sentence I used to always use is, now it's a problem.

217
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:31,516
You know, because it's that problem that you haven't anticipated that sneaks up on you,

218
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:33,558
and all of a sudden you have to improvise.

219
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,061
And that's sort of what makes this part of it, like, I credit the game team enormously

220
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:44,204
because even every small interaction in the game, they took a lot of care in making sure

221
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:45,425
that it could be manipulated.

222
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:49,648
There's this part in the game, without spoiling it, that you have to manipulate.

223
00:13:50,519 --> 00:14:03,223
And the fact that you have to assemble it and manipulate it in order to progress the game just makes it for such a more compelling experience because all of a sudden, you're not just clicking a button, you're actually having to work the object within the environment.

224
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:04,984
Yep.

225
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:20,114
And, you know, this is kind of the postmortem that's always, you know, a part of looking at back on a interest retrospective, I call it the two big VR ones there obviously ones I'll talk about beyond that but.

226
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:26,077
VR is a new medium and the instincts and experience

227
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,878
that you've gained as a game developer

228
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:32,480
might not apply quite as much as you would like.

229
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,581
And so a big win for us was bringing people in

230
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:37,902
all of the time, multiple times a week,

231
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:41,464
we would have one to four people in the office

232
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:44,486
playing through whatever our latest section is

233
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:45,946
or a section that we had reworked.

234
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:59,212
And we would learn, you know, sit there and watch the video or watch them live and just understand like, oh, that didn't play out exactly as we wanted to, or, oh, that was, you know, either more or less than intense than we than we wanted it to.

235
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:00,092
And so it was a real

236
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:06,737
key part of what we wanted to do was we didn't have that kind of gut to rely on.

237
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:11,721
And so we had to kind of go to real world testing to find out exactly where we're at.

238
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:15,144
And to that, that brings me to the second point, which is that iteration,

239
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:20,328
it's going to be longer and more than what you may normally be used to.

240
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:24,091
And you should really make sure that you've allotted additional time for that.

241
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:27,974
It's important to really get to those highest highs.

242
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:34,036
you know, other traditional ones that we always have, you know, which are exacerbated again

243
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:37,857
by the fact this is kind of a new medium is, you know, making sure that your team is the

244
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:42,498
right size for the portion that you're in, you know, and you don't want to be too large

245
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:47,179
and pre pro nor too small as you're kind of, you know, entering into production and not

246
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:51,420
really keeping a close track on where you are in your production cycle so that you're

247
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,281
making sure that your team is the right size for the thing so you don't have overruns or

248
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,061
that you're, you know, running late and stuff like that.

249
00:15:58,101 --> 00:15:58,542
Those are all.

250
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,382
you know, key things that we had to kind of tackle

251
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:03,923
and, you know, had various successes on each of them,

252
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:06,763
plus and minus for that.

253
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:09,584
And the team that worked on

254
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:11,044
The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners

255
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,765
has shipped a lot of titles over the years.

256
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:17,625
And so when Chris says, take more time than usual

257
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:20,166
in iterating around the schedule,

258
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:25,287
he really means it because the team has worked on a lot of

259
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:26,187
sort of 2D games.

260
00:16:27,414 --> 00:16:30,296
And a lot of lessons have been learned in the decades

261
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,797
that 2D games have been around.

262
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:35,459
In VR, you'll run into some stuff that you really need

263
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,640
to kind of like build yourself from scratch.

264
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,681
And so it's important to account for that.

265
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:40,802
Yep.

266
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:46,004
So we're gonna get into what I like to call

267
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:48,686
our brief timeline of screenshots,

268
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:52,388
which shows you sort of like where we were in February 2019.

269
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:54,709
This is a year out from launch.

270
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:55,630
As you can tell,

271
00:16:57,803 --> 00:17:04,088
The models are not completely built, textures are temp, there's not, there aren't any textures in some of this.

272
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:12,495
And so this is sort of like the beginning of the game working systems being kind of proven out and getting ready to be fully built out.

273
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:19,401
And you'll see that already we have some of the mechanics there, but the walkers don't even have teeth.

274
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:22,686
So you know that the game is not quite there yet.

275
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:25,428
Yeah, this is like a month into production here, right?

276
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:29,592
You know, we've got some of the buildings built out from our pre-pro.

277
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:32,315
You know, we've started to kind of build the bus.

278
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:37,220
We've got, you know, really early examples of what the walkers are going to look like.

279
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,063
But you'll see here on the next slide just a few months later.

280
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:44,778
The hub and bus area is looking very much

281
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,139
like it's gonna be when it ships

282
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,001
who are already kind of really cruising along.

283
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:52,223
Whereas the other areas are less built out

284
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,628
and even the walkers are fairly similar looking.

285
00:17:58,448 --> 00:17:59,789
And even the ones in the lower right,

286
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,792
those weren't even models that we ended up shipping.

287
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:04,953
So we're still kind of iterating a little bit

288
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:06,234
on kind of the walker stuff

289
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,816
as we roll in in production here.

290
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:10,638
Yeah, you got the player has the measles.

291
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:14,173
You got a whole bunch of like naked old men coming at you.

292
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:15,895
Pretty unsettling.

293
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,479
I credit our QA staff with a lot for putting up with this.

294
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,849
And then yeah, here we are, you know, a few months later

295
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,331
and just a few months before we end up shipping.

296
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:29,853
And you can see that a lot of stuff has really come online.

297
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:31,294
The hub and the crafting is there,

298
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:34,237
the journal and the UI are really starting

299
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:37,439
to approach final lighting and effects.

300
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:39,301
The details on all kind of the weapons

301
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,002
and stuff are really coming together.

302
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:43,944
This is, you know, we're nearing the end of production

303
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:45,705
at this point and starting to go into pre-pro

304
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,886
for the final push.

305
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:52,125
And then these are our release, you know, screenshots.

306
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:53,946
You can see that, you know,

307
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,346
the blood doesn't look like measles.

308
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:57,027
It looks, you know, final and excellent.

309
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:59,088
The details on all of the weapons is there.

310
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:02,669
The walkers look amazing and grotesque, you know,

311
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:06,951
signage and all the kind of lighting and details

312
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,752
and atmospheres is in the world.

313
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:11,532
So it's, you know, it's feeling really good.

314
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:15,834
And this is where Guy gets to talk.

315
00:19:16,774 --> 00:19:18,015
That's right.

316
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,229
As that was sort of the production timeline,

317
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,050
when it came to marketing this game,

318
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,091
there's a lot of challenges

319
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:27,333
because the market was just not quite there yet.

320
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:28,894
So there's a lot to figure out.

321
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:30,675
How do you find VR players?

322
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,417
Where do you approach them?

323
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:34,438
I think that we spent a lot of time

324
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,820
sort of doing preliminary research

325
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,141
in the various ways in which we could reach players.

326
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,864
Because again, being in a VR ecosystem,

327
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:44,245
your budgets are restricted.

328
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,186
You gotta be a little smarter with all your spend buckets.

329
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:53,738
So a lot of what we ended up doing is sort of approaching it from the get go to come

330
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:59,181
out with one core tagline that we could all rally around.

331
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:04,823
And as Chris was talking about, you know, the idea that this was the first Walking Dead

332
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:09,085
game where you weren't playing a character but you were playing as yourself was really

333
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:09,626
appealing.

334
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:15,668
So we came out with Who Are You, which is sort of like our call to action to say come

335
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:16,068
find out.

336
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,652
I think you guys really nailed it with that one, by the way.

337
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:20,933
I just loved it when we fell upon that one.

338
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:26,437
We we thought we had the opportunity finally to say, you know what?

339
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:29,058
Step through the screen and take matters into your own hands.

340
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:30,839
And so that's what we did.

341
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,542
Oh, I know why you've come here.

342
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:40,305
I know what you're looking for.

343
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:49,934
But what I still have to ask, tourist...

344
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:54,516
...is who are you?

345
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:59,078
Now that the dead live forever...

346
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:02,240
...that every scrap counts...

347
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:05,842
...that everybody's just in it for themselves...

348
00:21:06,522 --> 00:21:08,624
...do you hide in dark places?

349
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:11,385
Do you kill from afar?

350
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:26,673
And there's no one left to tell us what to do.

351
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,374
So tell me, tourist.

352
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,720
Who are you?

353
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,541
If I didn't do it, someone else would have.

354
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,682
There was no preventing her exile.

355
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:50,582
Do it already!

356
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,623
Finish the fucker!

357
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,120
Please.

358
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,760
Not here!

359
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,721
Not like this!

360
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:57,401
In him now!

361
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:13,846
That thing still gives me chills, man.

362
00:22:13,886 --> 00:22:14,487
I love that thing.

363
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,307
I still get goosebumps.

364
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,928
JB is something else.

365
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,949
That was our gameplay announced trailer, where we really

366
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:23,610
sort of finally.

367
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:28,609
opened up about what the game was going to look like, what it was going to play like,

368
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:34,110
an important step, something that thankfully everybody seemed to like.

369
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:40,772
And it was really sort of meant a lot to the team to finally see it all come together,

370
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:46,114
because you sort of get, when you're really close to the product, the changes are incremental,

371
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:51,476
but when you finally see a video that sort of brings it all together and presents the parts

372
00:22:51,516 --> 00:22:52,116
of the game that.

373
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,602
are objectively the ones that are most interesting.

374
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:58,923
It really kind of motivated the team for the final sprint.

375
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:08,545
And as you may have seen, if you have looked us up on YouTube, we were watched way more than

376
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:13,666
we were played. Like way more people enjoyed watching our content than people had VR headsets.

377
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:21,687
And the thing that we think made this possible is really that sort of feeling of freedom.

378
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,034
that the game allows it affords you.

379
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:26,475
If you look at Josh Dubb's top video,

380
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:28,495
it's the top video of our game.

381
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:29,496
It's not even about our game.

382
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:31,536
It's just some crazy,

383
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:35,138
the ravings of a lunatic is the way I would summarize it.

384
00:23:35,158 --> 00:23:36,698
I think you'd probably take that as a compliment,

385
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,620
but it's a fantastic example of how the freedom

386
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,101
of expression granted to you by the sandbox

387
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:46,781
can be so powerful in getting the word out.

388
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,142
It helped us a ton.

389
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:49,923
It helped us keep the momentum going

390
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:50,803
throughout the lane.

391
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:52,670
of the marketing campaign.

392
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,132
And it was really important because one thing

393
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:57,813
that we understood from the very beginning

394
00:23:57,893 --> 00:24:01,435
is go after the entire audience that we wanted to tackle.

395
00:24:01,735 --> 00:24:02,595
It's going to take time.

396
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,336
It's going to be a marathon, not a sprint.

397
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:08,479
And we started from the sort of Walking Dead fandom,

398
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:10,920
but we realized that a lot of Walking Dead fans

399
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,341
didn't have VR headsets.

400
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,962
And even if there were survival horror players,

401
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:17,484
only a subset of those were VR players.

402
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:19,024
So we sort of looked at the VR market

403
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,725
and started our Google adjustable warranty.

404
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,260
We thought that if you could stomach the violence,

405
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,281
then you had a VR headset, you were going to play this game.

406
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,562
And so we sort of went about it that way.

407
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:33,803
But again, within that core, we sought out

408
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:39,504
people that loved a deeper experience of gameplay in VR

409
00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:41,625
and that sort of had their VR legs already.

410
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:48,206
So to give you an idea, this is what our self-timeline

411
00:24:48,226 --> 00:24:48,606
looks like.

412
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:51,827
We started in January, we're now in February.

413
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:53,808
If you notice, this is sort of like,

414
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:57,669
it sort of shows the trajectory of growth.

415
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,450
And the reason that I ended up working this way

416
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:03,692
is because we had to stagger launches for our platforms.

417
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:05,333
And what we did, we turned that,

418
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:08,214
we ideally wanted to sim ship in January.

419
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:11,115
However, you know, game development being

420
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,136
a creative endeavor,

421
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:16,797
we got to a point where we just wanted to go

422
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:19,238
to each platform in the best way possible.

423
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,060
And so we took our time, and timing ended up favoring us.

424
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,340
And it also made sure that throughout the year

425
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,421
we had positive reminders that this game was out there.

426
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:33,181
One thing that I credit the team enormously with

427
00:25:34,142 --> 00:25:36,862
is that they really took their time

428
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,363
creating a game experience on PSVR and on Quest

429
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:45,223
that was very specifically customized to the platform.

430
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:48,144
And I think players have told us

431
00:25:48,164 --> 00:25:49,124
that they really enjoyed that.

432
00:25:49,825 --> 00:25:51,706
They definitely have shown to us through sales,

433
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:54,949
where you look at this timeline,

434
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:56,470
you're like, all right, this looks great.

435
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:59,032
But this is the way we look at this timeline.

436
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:02,515
It's like half or a third of our eventual timeline.

437
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,277
And the reason for that is because VR is very different

438
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:07,539
in sort of like your AAA, even your indie space.

439
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,220
You have a lot more time.

440
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,922
Some of the advantages of marketing a VR game

441
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:14,424
is that there's just not as much competition.

442
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:17,106
Some of the disadvantages is that

443
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:18,847
there's fewer people in the market.

444
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:23,725
So you have to kind of make the right decisions when it comes to spend, when it comes to the

445
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:26,648
message that you're going to put out there, the windows that you have to get that message

446
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:26,988
out there.

447
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:31,432
There's quite a few lessons that we learned that I want to share with you.

448
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:37,076
One of the things that is obviously, this is true of any business, but like adapt to

449
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:42,161
your circumstance, I guess, is the first lesson, turn sort of the challenge into an advantage.

450
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:48,366
It required extra investment to do so, but we approached it from a standpoint of we can

451
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:50,348
have three launches in a year.

452
00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:51,892
And if we do it the right way,

453
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:55,602
we can get a benefit from this sort of staggered release.

454
00:26:56,106 --> 00:26:59,087
And that was really to what Guy was saying earlier,

455
00:26:59,107 --> 00:27:01,928
you know, we recognized that the VR market

456
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:03,489
was a smaller market.

457
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:06,230
And so we really wanted to make sure we were capturing

458
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,731
as much of that small market as we could.

459
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:12,353
And so we couldn't, we wanted to lean into that PSVR

460
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:15,534
and the Quest ports because we wanted to make sure that,

461
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:17,515
and even Pimax, right?

462
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,616
You know, when we first launched and realized that we,

463
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:20,776
you know, we weren't supporting that,

464
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:22,177
it was important that we,

465
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:27,681
you know, whatever corner of the VR market a player might approach from, we wanted to make

466
00:27:27,741 --> 00:27:33,485
sure that, you know, we were giving them the best experience possible on that.

467
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:40,871
Yeah, you'll always get the person that's playing on Shadow PC through a virtual desktop and also

468
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:47,555
bought like an Index and real or is using a Vive with the knuckles and that has to work, right?

469
00:27:47,856 --> 00:27:52,199
And so there's a bunch of combinations. We really like paid a lot of attention.

470
00:27:52,688 --> 00:27:57,869
the game team reacted very rapidly post each one of those launches with any issues that were creeping up.

471
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:04,451
And given the really technical nature of the game, they had to respond very rapidly,

472
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:09,692
so a lot of time was allocated for doing so. We over-indexed on communication across

473
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:14,534
our social channels but funneled it all into Discord because it was just an easier place

474
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:19,975
to have a more casual conversation with our hyper-engaged fans. And then on top of that,

475
00:28:21,112 --> 00:28:27,456
we partner very closely with platforms. One of the advantages of VR is the platforms are much

476
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:31,679
friendlier with one another because they're not a this like dire competition that the

477
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,902
more established market is in. They're all just trying to like make cool experiences happen in VR

478
00:28:36,942 --> 00:28:43,286
so the guys at Sony were great, the guys at Oculus were great, Valve was awesome. They helped us

479
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:48,030
really get the message out once the game was proven and that's a lot of what

480
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:52,031
you know, once it's all these gates that you have to work through as a marketer.

481
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:56,935
And we were fortunate enough to be able to kind of like power through each one of them.

482
00:28:57,835 --> 00:29:00,758
And, yeah, last but not least, a lot of people bought Quest, too.

483
00:29:00,918 --> 00:29:02,699
So, you know, keep that in mind.

484
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:08,824
So in other words, we collected some heads, it was pretty good.

485
00:29:08,844 --> 00:29:12,647
We put them up in our bus and have been looking at them ever since.

486
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:17,851
And I think Chris has some final lessons for us before we go.

487
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:25,315
Yeah, I mean, I think the if you listen to Zuckerberg five or six years ago when he,

488
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:28,918
you know, acquired Oculus, that kind of got everybody excited, like, oh, my God,

489
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:33,441
VR is here. But at the time, he said, look, this is going to be five to 10 years out.

490
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:37,784
And here we are about five years later and realizing, hey, Mark, he's a pretty smart

491
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:41,887
guy. The good news is the market is growing both.

492
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,890
You know, the hardware is getting better.

493
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,431
There are more players out there.

494
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:53,094
But at the same time, you know, the, we as game developers are starting to kind of understand what the verbs are more and more.

495
00:29:53,134 --> 00:30:03,260
And so there's actually a really big opportunity there to make a non-small size investment and get a good return on it.

496
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,282
So, you know, obviously you've got to be careful and make sure that you're managing things well.

497
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:11,784
and that you're offering something that, you know,

498
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:15,226
excites players and brings them in with, you know,

499
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:21,389
newness or, you know, uniqueness, but it's there.

500
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:22,450
The opportunity is there.

501
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:27,052
And I would totally encourage people to go and explore VR.

502
00:30:27,112 --> 00:30:29,933
I think that the biggest problem we have

503
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:31,494
is getting people in headset.

504
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,696
We're huge fans of VR and, you know, this,

505
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:37,998
The Walking Dead and VR, we're not done with it.

506
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:42,160
you know, we're going to continue to explore a future here.

507
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,542
It's it's it's too exciting not to.

508
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:47,844
Yeah, I think that there's a lot of things that you can do

509
00:30:47,864 --> 00:30:53,387
in this space that you that allow you for that experimentation.

510
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:58,430
It's definitely when when you go down that rabbit hole,

511
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,652
I'd say figure out what the things that you made that are great are

512
00:31:02,053 --> 00:31:06,515
and then sort of stick to a couple of them for the messaging around your title.

513
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:10,417
But definitely you can experiment a lot more.

514
00:31:10,858 --> 00:31:13,619
And to be fair, like, oh, there are people experimenting

515
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,340
on games on all platforms,

516
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,542
but I think that you'll find this platform really interesting

517
00:31:18,582 --> 00:31:20,043
if you take a dive.

518
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:25,066
So yeah, that's the Walking Dead Saints and Sinners.

519
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:27,227
We wanted to take a quick opportunity

520
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:29,989
to kind of walk you through some of the development

521
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:32,550
and marketing aspects of the title.

522
00:31:33,411 --> 00:31:33,951
Thank you for coming.

523
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:34,331
All right, guys.

524
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:35,652
Take care.

525
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:36,986
See ya.
