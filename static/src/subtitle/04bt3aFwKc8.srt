1
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:10,015
Howdy, my name is Mason Smith, and I'm a game developer.

2
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:12,536
And on the internet, I'm known as Airdorf.

3
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:16,437
And welcome to my GDC talk, Mortis 101,

4
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:19,738
Faith's Horror Design Toolkit.

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,960
So I spoke at GDC in 2019, and I gave a shorter talk

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,741
on the art style or visual design of faith.

7
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:32,143
And I really enjoyed it, and I'm really happy to be back.

8
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:35,418
and recording and reaching out to you all virtually.

9
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:38,619
This is a virtual conference, but you should still

10
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,860
probably silence your cell phones,

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,022
you know, be polite while you're sitting there

12
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:45,122
watching me, I guess.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,562
So bear with me, I'm still nervous,

14
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:50,403
even though this is just a virtual conference

15
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:52,464
and I'm literally in my home office

16
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:54,466
talking to myself as I usually do.

17
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:56,667
And so I'm still a little nervous.

18
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:59,489
So bear with me, but we're gonna get through it.

19
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,072
So right, Mortis 101, Faith's Horror Design Toolkit.

20
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:08,655
So I've been involved in the indie horror game space

21
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:13,179
developers, designers, fans, since like 2015.

22
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,480
That's when I really started getting into it.

23
00:01:16,637 --> 00:01:18,599
And these are some of the games that I've made.

24
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,302
You probably recognize the Faith series.

25
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:22,683
Probably why you're here.

26
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:25,787
I also did several other titles that were smaller.

27
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:28,850
And these are just some games that I've been involved in.

28
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:34,667
And just for reference to kind of get to know me better if you don't know me yet,

29
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:36,928
so these are some of my favorite games of all time,

30
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,689
starting with Link's Awakening for the Game Boy.

31
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,129
That was my very first video game.

32
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:42,470
That was all mine.

33
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,390
Taught me a lot about what games could be.

34
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,671
And so here are just some of my favorites.

35
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:52,093
So you can kind of get a gauge for the type of person I am, I guess.

36
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:58,775
And this is Faith trailer, if you haven't seen it yet.

37
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:08,093
My nightmares are getting worse.

38
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:14,480
I have to finish what I started.

39
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:22,488
What I am about to do cannot be approved automatically.

40
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,021
More at dis!

41
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:02,837
All right.

42
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,740
So that was the official trailer for Faith.

43
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,582
So I started out with chapter one,

44
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,803
which I released in October 2017.

45
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,825
And then 2019, I did chapter two.

46
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:14,767
And for chapter three,

47
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:16,648
I've partnered with New Blood Interactive

48
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:17,909
to be my publisher.

49
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,551
So we're gonna bundle all three chapters

50
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:24,635
into a Steam package and release it soon.

51
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:25,776
We don't have a release date yet.

52
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:32,648
So a lot of y'all who know me and have heard me on interviews and stuff already know this,

53
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,035
but just to kind of reiterate what my vision was going into creating Faith was,

54
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:44,241
can I deliver an effective horror game experience using just basic graphics?

55
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,510
That's kind of how Faith came to be.

56
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,031
Faith is a retro-inspired pixel horror game.

57
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,032
I like to call them pixelated nightmares.

58
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:59,554
And it's based on the retro era of the 1980s,

59
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:03,516
of the 8-bit generation of games, classic games,

60
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,917
and also the satanic scare of the 1980s.

61
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:08,798
So that was kind of the narrative backdrop for Faith.

62
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:13,334
Oh, there's going to be spoilers ahead.

63
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:16,976
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to demonstrate how I went about executing

64
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:19,218
on that design vision, on that design challenge

65
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:22,960
and the specific design tools that I used for faith.

66
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:27,463
So there's going to be spoilers for chapters one, two and three.

67
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:28,884
So be warned.

68
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:31,381
So you might be thinking to yourself, so what?

69
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:33,563
Who is this guy? You know, why should I care?

70
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:37,646
So Faith just crossed over 100,000 downloads,

71
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:42,850
and it was included in IGN's 2017 Best Horror Games of 2017

72
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:44,592
and Best Indie Games You Might Have Missed.

73
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,635
And it's in the top 10 most wish listed horror games during Steam festivals.

74
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,158
It's been played by big name YouTubers and accumulated a lot of views.

75
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:57,163
And it actually has a cult following that constantly sends me messages.

76
00:04:58,107 --> 00:05:01,893
begging for chapter three to be released or at least getting a release date but you're not going

77
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:07,481
to get it yet it's not ready so sorry for me those are big accomplishments because i literally made

78
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:12,869
faith on a shoestring budget in my spare time i was just one person working on it

79
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:25,556
And I think that a lot of stuff came together at once to get it noticed early on, like its art style, which I discussed in my previous talk, and also how I marketed it and who I marketed it to.

80
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:30,499
But it also had a consistent design vision with how I designed its horror.

81
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,800
which I believe also contributed to its success.

82
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,341
So in the interest of helping other developers who

83
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:40,683
are interested in this retro-inspired horror game

84
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:42,904
space, I'd like to share the design tools

85
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,324
that I use in Faith's development.

86
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:52,087
OK, so this brings, before I go into the toolkit,

87
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:55,208
I want to go over my personal design philosophy.

88
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,850
And it starts with three very important components.

89
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:02,287
So number one is narrative.

90
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,612
So all games tell a story.

91
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:06,897
That's at least what I think.

92
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:15,385
And it can be in-game, like Mario must get to Bowser's castle and save the princess.

93
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:19,386
That's the story of the game in the game having to do with the characters.

94
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,427
It can be a little more complex than that.

95
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:25,728
It can be like a monster slayer for hire, has to race against time

96
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:30,189
to protect the people he cares about from this otherworldly invasion

97
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:33,670
of apocalyptic proportions in the midst of a brutal war

98
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,890
between two nations of the Witcher 3, right?

99
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:39,252
So it can be very complex or it can be very simple.

100
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,814
So you've got to ask yourself, what's the story?

101
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:45,036
But this is important. This is something I personally believe,

102
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,857
is that you can include the player in that story.

103
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:50,059
So when you talk about your game's narrative,

104
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,361
it can be the player's narrative or the player's story.

105
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:56,663
So an example of that is I got the high score.

106
00:06:56,863 --> 00:07:00,265
That's my story playing Galaga when I was 10 years old.

107
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:01,566
I'm still really proud of that.

108
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:06,891
Or, I died. That's the classic one, right? So that's the player's story.

109
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:11,615
Or, I lost my queen, you know, and then it was all over.

110
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:13,417
So that can be a narrative there.

111
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:19,943
But, you know, having a player say, that scared the crap out of me, that's the gold right there.

112
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:24,928
That's the narrative you want. That's the story, player story that you want when you're designing a horror game.

113
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,661
That's what I seek after, that's what I'm going for.

114
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:29,963
So you gotta ask yourself,

115
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:33,046
what do you want the player's story to be?

116
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:36,130
So your game's design should help shape that experience.

117
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:42,324
And there can be small narratives nested within the main or the meta narrative for the story,

118
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:47,568
and that can go for in-game, you know, diegetic, or it can be the player's story.

119
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:51,610
And within those small narratives can be even smaller narratives,

120
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:57,334
if you get where I'm going with this. So that's very important. So what is the story?

121
00:07:57,374 --> 00:08:00,376
What is the narrative? Number two is your mechanics. So

122
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,383
I'm not going to go over what exactly game mechanics are, because I'm assuming

123
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:07,887
you are all at the level to where you understand what game mechanics are.

124
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:12,151
Usually there are opportunities to learn or use or practice and then

125
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:16,856
master the game mechanics that are, and they're afforded by the level design.

126
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,299
So for me, mechanics and level design are

127
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:23,402
very like co-related. Super Mario Brothers.

128
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:27,065
World 1, Stage 1, so 1-1.

129
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:35,050
That's the classic example that we often talk about as a game level or a level that is designed to afford

130
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,112
all the mechanics that you need to beat Super Mario Bros.

131
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:42,515
And it teaches you them pretty naturally and pretty smoothly.

132
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:48,479
And it gives the player a chance to kind of try new techniques and master them.

133
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:49,920
So that's a great example.

134
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:53,040
One recent example that I really like is Doom Eternal.

135
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,502
And it's great for me.

136
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:58,044
It's a good example of a game kind of introducing

137
00:08:58,864 --> 00:09:02,767
more and more complex techniques and mechanics

138
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:06,670
and then level design that supports it, forces the player to know them,

139
00:09:06,731 --> 00:09:08,592
learn them and in some cases master them.

140
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:12,235
And it can be very, very challenging, but it kind of.

141
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,122
introduces them in increments so it doesn't overwhelm the player.

142
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:20,424
By the end of Doom Eternal, you need to be using all the in-game mechanics in order to survive,

143
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:26,027
and I love that. Many games, unfortunately, they introduce mechanics only to abandon them later,

144
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:30,829
or they leave them underdeveloped or under-challenged. Oops, sorry. Almost spoiled my

145
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:31,430
slide there. So...

146
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,591
Since we sometimes have this tendency or this habit

147
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:39,334
to introduce mechanics and then just kind of forget them,

148
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:42,176
or they get kind of overlapped or depreciated

149
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:45,640
by cooler, more advanced mechanics or upgrades,

150
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,321
why not start small?

151
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:49,363
So why not start simple?

152
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:51,966
A huge variety of gameplay can come

153
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:53,547
from just a few simple mechanics.

154
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,389
Again, look at Super Mario Brothers.

155
00:09:59,092 --> 00:09:59,853
Moving on.

156
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:08,580
to affect. So not affect with an E, but affect with an A. So in human computer interaction

157
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:15,287
research, affect is a term for the feeling or the emotion. Affect can be positive or negative.

158
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:20,745
Sometimes designers will start with cool mechanics,

159
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:22,946
like the rules, you know, the magic circle, all that.

160
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:24,667
Sometimes they'll start with a really cool story

161
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,188
that they want to tell,

162
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,149
and they'll kind of form a game around that.

163
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,571
And then there's affect,

164
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:35,094
and the affect or the feeling or the emotional experience

165
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:38,156
is what I personally almost always start with

166
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,498
when I'm doing a new game project.

167
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:46,261
And more often than not, the feeling is fear, but not just fear.

168
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:49,523
I go specifically into things like dread.

169
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:56,726
paranoia. To me, dread, and this is just me personally, dread is more important than shock

170
00:10:57,306 --> 00:11:04,512
or disgust, which some psychologists or scholars on the horror genre, they insist that

171
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:11,857
horror is this feeling of disgust. To me, and this might overlap with terror theory and supernatural

172
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:15,120
literature, to me it's that dread. It's that

173
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:24,544
aching, growing, kind of pulsing feeling that has got you so frightened that you can't take

174
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:25,905
another step forward in the game.

175
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:31,570
I've had experiences like that and I chase after those experiences in how I play games,

176
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,611
the games that I play and also the games that I create.

177
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:39,156
So affix, you ask yourself, what do I want the player to feel?

178
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:46,335
And this can be basic emotions, you know, joy, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, surprise.

179
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:48,618
Very famous games like The Legend of Zelda.

180
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:51,802
They create this feeling and emotion of adventure of of.

181
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,727
of kind of freedom, I guess.

182
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,809
Or it can be an experience.

183
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,911
And I word this experience this way, it like

184
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:04,775
one part of the effect of your game can be, I feel like I'm an elite assassin

185
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:08,939
in ancient Greece, or I feel like I have complete freedom

186
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:12,042
to explore this vast underwater environment,

187
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:15,125
or I feel like something could jump out at me at any time.

188
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:24,255
And the question I constantly ask myself when making a horror game is, is this scary?

189
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:27,276
Is this going to create that feeling of dread?

190
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:33,339
Is this going to make the player feel like they are not safe, like something is out to

191
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:37,020
get them, like something could pop out at them at any moment?

192
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:40,275
It helps to know what scares me, right?

193
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:41,858
Know thyself.

194
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,546
So I personally am not scared by things like zombies.

195
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,330
I feel like I'd know how to handle one

196
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,653
if one walked up to me.

197
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:55,691
shambled up to me more like. Things like werewolves and vampires, it takes a lot,

198
00:12:56,232 --> 00:13:01,894
you know, their form has to be a specific way to scare me, but there are specific things that scare

199
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:10,298
me a lot, like the supernatural, like the paranormal, ghosts, spirits, kind of that spiritual spirituality.

200
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:18,378
you know, kind of religious kind of, kind of esoteric stuff.

201
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,798
That's what creeps me out.

202
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:22,860
Cryptids, things like disappearances, urban legends,

203
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,021
anything that's, you know, thought to be a true story,

204
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,582
things like found footage, that stuff really scares me.

205
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:32,084
And you also have to know what scares your audience.

206
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:36,366
So in my marketing efforts and when I first started,

207
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,457
uh, formulating ideas for faith and started getting into his design.

208
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:46,704
I had specific targets in mind, so I had specific, I actually had it down to

209
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,386
specific people that I want to scare.

210
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:51,430
So I've been subscribed to Markiplier on YouTube.

211
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,413
Some of y'all may know him.

212
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:56,476
There's like 29 million subscribers on YouTube.

213
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,061
And I have been subscribed to him.

214
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:02,563
He's the first YouTuber that I ever subscribed to.

215
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:06,365
And I've been following him since the amnesia days

216
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:08,106
when he was playing Amnesia, the Dark Descent.

217
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,348
And I followed him through Slenderman.

218
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:12,789
I followed him through Five Nights at Freddy's and beyond.

219
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,251
And he's changed a lot.

220
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,553
But from watching him, especially in those early years,

221
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:19,854
I kind of got a feel for.

222
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:24,959
what will get a big reaction out of streamers and YouTubers.

223
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,001
And when I saw the number that he was putting,

224
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:29,644
that he was doing on his YouTube channel,

225
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:32,506
and just the mind-boggling amount of views

226
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:34,989
that you can get from kind of tapping

227
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,651
into streamers and YouTubers,

228
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:40,074
that's what I went for in my marketing is.

229
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,292
But that's probably for another talk.

230
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:45,093
But I specifically went for YouTubers and streamers.

231
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:49,134
And it might sound creepy, but there

232
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:50,914
are parts of Faith's horror design

233
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:54,175
that were crafted especially to scare Markiplier.

234
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:57,176
I don't know if that sounds psychotic or not.

235
00:14:58,997 --> 00:14:59,597
Like mannequins.

236
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:00,577
He really doesn't like mannequins.

237
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:03,738
So I put a mannequin scare in Faith, and I created it.

238
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:08,087
based on his behavior during his streams.

239
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:10,469
I thought that if he would like a game enough,

240
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:12,510
it would kind of get popular with his YouTube channel

241
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,811
and that would give me free views.

242
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,894
So it helps to know what scares your audience.

243
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:22,198
So these three components,

244
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:26,642
narrative, mechanics, and affect, you identify them.

245
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:33,738
and basically every design decision in your game needs to directly support your chosen narrative,

246
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:38,524
mechanics, and affect. If there is a design decision that you're thinking about that does

247
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:44,791
not support them, then throw it out. Trust me. So that's what I personally did for Faith.

248
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:51,363
is I identified the game's narrative mechanics and affect and then I kind of divided the structure,

249
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:55,325
the design structure of the game into these chunks. You can call them, you can call them

250
00:15:55,345 --> 00:16:02,807
chunks if you want, but you could also call them moments or vignettes, I suppose. Adam,

251
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:07,348
my advisor for this talk, kind of gave me that idea that kind of calling it vignettes.

252
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,872
And so I take these chunks or moments or vignettes and they overlap,

253
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:16,033
but they each have their own way of

254
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:21,236
supporting the overarching narrative of the game

255
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:25,017
or the overarching feeling that I want the game to have

256
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,200
and mechanics that I want to introduce or test or have the player master.

257
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,601
It all kind of overlaps and they have their own mini narratives

258
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:36,423
and mini mechanics and mini emotive moments.

259
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:43,744
So everything that I put in Faith, or my games,

260
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:49,067
has to directly go into the narrative, the mechanics,

261
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:49,908
and the affect.

262
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:51,349
Y'all are going to be tired of me saying this

263
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:54,651
by the end of the talk, but that's basically what I do.

264
00:16:56,372 --> 00:17:03,777
So this slide is an example of kind of how I go about the creative ideation of these

265
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:04,918
moments or these vignettes.

266
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:10,122
It's very tightly tied to the level design of faith.

267
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:14,788
And so I like to personally just get a notepad out

268
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:16,790
or a sketch pad and do a pen.

269
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,470
I don't like pencils,

270
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,672
because then I get caught up in erasing mistakes.

271
00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:23,573
So I just go for it with a kind of a permanent marker pen.

272
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,195
And this is kind of what'll happen.

273
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:27,716
So these are areas where...

274
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:37,008
the player or the main character John Ward is trying to collect keys and bring them back to this giant statue that opens up with three keys.

275
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:44,951
So we got three keys, three cool little opportunities to scare the player and introduce some cool tasks that test mechanics,

276
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:48,213
and they all kind of have their own feeling to them and their own little mini story.

277
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:51,034
And so this is kind of how I do it.

278
00:17:54,436 --> 00:17:57,317
Okay, so enough about this kind of introduction.

279
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,002
Check my time real quick. Okay, I'm doing it.

280
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:09,007
With that in mind, so let's launch right into the Faith Horror Design Toolkit.

281
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:17,213
So number one is to know what you want each design decision to accomplish in terms of narrative, mechanic, and affect.

282
00:18:17,854 --> 00:18:25,279
There it is again. So how does this support my design vision, which I define as your narrative, your mechanics, and your affect?

283
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:28,606
For me, design choices typically come

284
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:32,491
in the form of crafting those overlapping moments or vignettes

285
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:33,672
throughout the game.

286
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:40,821
So this is kind of how I go about it.

287
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:43,185
Let's see.

288
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,406
I'm trying to get these GIFs to play.

289
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:44,646
Oops.

290
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:47,308
Okay, I guess I have to click on him.

291
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:51,070
So I think of kind of one of these moments or vignettes

292
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,991
and or, you know, upscale to the whole game.

293
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:57,793
So I think to myself, if a player was telling a friend about this part of the game,

294
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,073
what would they say?

295
00:18:59,453 --> 00:19:00,714
What would they express?

296
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:01,694
What were their emotions?

297
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,715
What would what are their feelings about it?

298
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:08,999
you know, maybe they're telling them, oh, you do this and then this happens, or you do this and

299
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:16,945
all of a sudden this happens, you know, and it's so crazy and creepy because this. So be conscious

300
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:23,670
of what you want the outcome to be in terms of the player's story, in terms of the player's feelings,

301
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:30,055
in terms of what they do. So here's the kind of the forest section of the first Faith game.

302
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:38,929
And here the protagonist, John Ward, is navigating these woods and there's a demon after him.

303
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:46,678
And I specifically designed this area as like a grid, but it has these Pac-Man style wraparound

304
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,018
warps.

305
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,763
So you'll go off to the right of one screen and you'll warp to the other side of the map

306
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:52,584
on the left side.

307
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:56,520
and they have randomized layouts for certain scenes.

308
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,400
So when you come back to the screen,

309
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,381
you came back to the layout actually randomizes again.

310
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,462
So that was to make the player feel

311
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:04,862
like they're lost in the woods.

312
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:09,003
So there's the affect and it kind of mimics

313
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:11,244
the disoriented kind of isolated state

314
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:14,825
that I wanted to bring into this horror narrative.

315
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:22,452
and also the overall feeling of paranoia and being lost and isolated in the 1980s,

316
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:28,998
no cell phones, and having to do with the satanic panic where there was a lot of paranoia, mistrust.

317
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:32,782
So there's again the affect and you have to navigate these screens.

318
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:35,544
There's your mechanics in order to progress.

319
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:41,827
Of course, you transition to going into the house where there was a failed exorcism, you

320
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:43,887
come back to the house to try to finish what you started.

321
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,128
And the mood changes.

322
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:51,410
I crafted this area to seem like a safe haven, like you don't have to deal with the demon

323
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,250
outside anymore.

324
00:20:53,131 --> 00:20:59,293
And it's supposed to feel good, you know, being one step closer to reaching the ultimate

325
00:20:59,313 --> 00:20:59,953
goal in the game.

326
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:06,347
I wanted the player to feel like they were safe and then not feel like they were safe.

327
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:09,551
This sounds so sadistic, but it is a horror game.

328
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:12,215
And as all as all as we'll talk about another slide,

329
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:15,679
there's this playful dynamic that I firmly believe

330
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:19,164
the game designer should have with the player in all their design decisions.

331
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:19,844
So the panic.

332
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:24,596
that the player experiences outside dealing with Michael, the demon in the woods.

333
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:26,537
It subsides for a little bit.

334
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:28,958
You get this like fun jingle for when you come into the house,

335
00:21:28,998 --> 00:21:31,099
but then the jingle stops and there's silence.

336
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,660
No background music.

337
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,661
And based on playthroughs, based on watching people.

338
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:44,235
play the game and just general observations. This is a very popular kind of scary dreadful moment

339
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:50,938
in the game where the music stops. You can't rely on the music to kind of be a respite from

340
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:55,679
the horror that's going on and it's really interesting to see players reactions to this.

341
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:02,681
Now they have to navigate the house which is a little bit smaller, a little more compact,

342
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:03,861
maybe a little claustrophobic.

343
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:08,663
looking for clues, which is the mechanic that gets introduced here.

344
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:15,486
This is chapter two, this is the very end. So the usual mechanics of moving to avoid demons and

345
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:20,049
using your cross to fight demons, they kind of get remixed because now you have Father Garcia

346
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:26,992
to, it's basically you have to escort him through this ritual that he is conducting to exercise

347
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:31,614
this demon. So now the movement mechanics are

348
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,532
are kind of reappropriated to protect another character.

349
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:39,733
And throughout chapter two, it plays off of John's guilt.

350
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,355
So it makes you feel guilty for things that

351
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,375
happened in the first game.

352
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:45,696
So there's your affect and your narrative.

353
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:51,579
And so the player now is in this kind of heightened tension

354
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:55,380
mode or emotion trying to protect Father Garcia.

355
00:22:57,727 --> 00:23:01,149
All of a sudden, every act you make is not just to survive and save your own skin,

356
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:03,551
but also to save another person, another character.

357
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:09,316
So here's number two, embrace minimalism, AKA keep it simple.

358
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,711
So I have a very bare bones form follows function approach to the Faith series,

359
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:15,111
at least.

360
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:19,253
And I firmly believe in having a consistent voice and executing on it.

361
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:22,794
I think the greatest content is always made with the most consistent voice.

362
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,636
Can I sell this moment or vignette more elegantly?

363
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:29,777
So minimalism for me isn't just about, you know,

364
00:23:29,837 --> 00:23:32,998
kind of an Apple store aesthetic, very sparse stuff.

365
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:36,479
You can have a full screen of detailed stuff like here in PT,

366
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,981
one of my favorite horror game, probably my favorite horror game of all time.

367
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:47,908
And I really like how it is an example of minimalism, the story, the mechanics, very simple.

368
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:51,051
So FACE started with a very simple premise.

369
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:58,638
I'm going to bring up some images that I think exemplify its minimalistic design.

370
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:03,968
So in chapter one, the premise is really simple.

371
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:07,131
And note that the presentation of the narrative is simple.

372
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:10,714
Faith has kind of a sort of complex lore backstory,

373
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:13,617
but it's pieced together by the player and they can go as deep as they want,

374
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:16,000
you know, thinking about it after the game.

375
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,984
I want them to be thinking about it long afterwards. But.

376
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:24,714
in order to kind of push the fear of the unknown kind of dynamic,

377
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:27,855
and also to keep everything mysterious and let the player fill in the blanks.

378
00:24:27,895 --> 00:24:29,915
It has a very minimal presentation of the story.

379
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:32,796
Chapter one is get inside the house, finish the exorcism.

380
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:36,557
Chapter two is it literally says a young priest

381
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:38,838
ascends into a new nightmare, so it gives very little.

382
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:43,079
Chapter three is find the twins, stop Gary from summoning Malthus,

383
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,580
this powerful demon, and save the day.

384
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:50,094
So, and Faith has very few mechanics.

385
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:52,255
John Ward, the main character, he can walk,

386
00:24:52,295 --> 00:24:54,635
he can use his cross to either fight demons

387
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:58,096
or cleanse objects of their corruption, I guess.

388
00:24:58,616 --> 00:25:00,757
He can collect items, he can use items,

389
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,978
and he can examine, or he can take a closer look

390
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:06,479
at certain things.

391
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:09,360
And examples of that are kind of strewn around in this slide.

392
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:12,122
And it has this very simple presentation.

393
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:15,766
As you see, Faith is pretty well known for its chunky pixel,

394
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:16,866
minimal detail look.

395
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:21,330
And it's actually a struggle to not make things more detailed.

396
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:25,154
I often have to go back and make it less detailed, more chunky,

397
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:28,436
because I want to create this fear of the unknown.

398
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:29,537
There's my affect.

399
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:33,901
I want to conjure up that, oh my gosh,

400
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:36,383
what the F was that response from the player.

401
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:38,485
To me, that's the goal.

402
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,078
Simple, unassuming menu.

403
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:42,740
You don't know what you're getting into

404
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,442
when you first boot up the game based on the menu.

405
00:25:46,023 --> 00:25:47,404
A UI that's free of clutter.

406
00:25:47,424 --> 00:25:50,487
I want the player's eyes to be darting around the screen.

407
00:25:51,988 --> 00:25:53,089
Frequently, there's sequences

408
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:55,731
with kind of a simple looping background music

409
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:56,953
or no background music at all.

410
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:00,115
Throughout the design process, I ask myself,

411
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:04,079
can I sell this moment or this character or this environment

412
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,342
or this creature more elegantly with less stuff, less animation frames,

413
00:26:10,283 --> 00:26:13,085
you know, less, less pixels, the more elegant, the better.

414
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:17,427
So that's my kind of simple minimalism with faith.

415
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:19,708
Number three, emphasize.

416
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:23,130
The player character's vulnerability.

417
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,052
So here I have a picture of James Hunderlin, who's the.

418
00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:31,559
main protagonist of Silent Hill 2, one of my all time favorite horror games.

419
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:34,882
And I really like how it's an example of a vulnerable character

420
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:37,865
in more ways than just death, mental and emotionally.

421
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:42,088
James is a very emotional or he's a very vulnerable character

422
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:45,652
and vulnerabilities prolific and horror Resident Evil Village.

423
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:47,633
The main character goes through a lot

424
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:50,476
and then Resident Evil seven, actually.

425
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,658
And that guy's been through a lot, actually.

426
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,837
Faith has a one-hit-kill mechanic.

427
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,019
Love it or hate it, he gets killed

428
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,060
as soon as the demon touch him.

429
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,922
The simple fact that John dies after one hit,

430
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:06,724
it makes demon fights in small rooms very intense.

431
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:11,207
So intense feeling, there's my effect of panic.

432
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:13,829
And anything that looks out of the ordinary

433
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:14,969
is potentially death.

434
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,290
Anything that moves in the game

435
00:27:16,691 --> 00:27:18,252
or anything that's colored differently

436
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:20,493
than the background and the environment.

437
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:26,185
I've seen players in playthroughs and watching my friends play it, they get paranoid just seeing

438
00:27:26,225 --> 00:27:31,127
anything out of the ordinary and for me as a horror game designer, that's great.

439
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:35,369
The consequences of death in horror games, they've historically been

440
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:39,331
you die, you get sent back to the last save point like the typewriter.

441
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:46,074
save up those ink ribbons and or a checkpoint and you have to play back

442
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:50,857
from that point and it's a cycle and it's a weird cycle that in it is

443
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:54,659
revealed this major issue for horror game designers I believe which is

444
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,321
anticipating player death if you choose to put that in your game again that's a

445
00:27:58,361 --> 00:28:03,063
mechanic you can choose to put in there so assuming the player character can die

446
00:28:04,054 --> 00:28:07,716
How do you handle that? How do you handle the pacing of like the retry process?

447
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:15,720
Because when you retry over and over, with very few exceptions, the unknown becomes known again.

448
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,322
And it can be considered punishing the player by sending them too far back. So this is where

449
00:28:20,402 --> 00:28:27,326
QA testing becomes really important because it will help you identify areas where deaths happen.

450
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:34,158
With that, I like to be kind of generous with spawn points,

451
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:38,142
or I try to identify where I need to put

452
00:28:38,162 --> 00:28:41,305
a more closer spawn point to the place

453
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,067
where the player's likely to die again.

454
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:45,430
So these are two examples of environments

455
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,391
where the player goes off and does something.

456
00:28:48,172 --> 00:28:49,434
John goes off into the cemetery

457
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:52,036
and fights a bunch of demons to kind of unlock

458
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,636
you know, this puzzle in this area.

459
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:58,617
And in the right side of the screen,

460
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:01,838
there's a similar kind of item collection task.

461
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:03,998
And so I put a manual save point

462
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,539
right in the middle of the environment,

463
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,320
and the player can choose to save there if you want, if they want.

464
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,821
And so. If they have this vulnerability,

465
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:18,903
if they're highly vulnerable to death, then be more forgiving with the save points.

466
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:24,023
And if possible, I try to respawn at one of Faith's cutscenes.

467
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,345
Or I make manual save points so that the player

468
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:28,726
can save at their own pace.

469
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:32,448
John has other vulnerabilities besides

470
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:34,709
physical vulnerabilities.

471
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:37,911
In Chapter 3, he's susceptible to being possessed himself

472
00:29:37,971 --> 00:29:38,531
by a demon.

473
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:41,633
And he can actually lose control of himself

474
00:29:41,873 --> 00:29:42,973
and hurt other characters.

475
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:46,335
So we're going to kind of take a break between.

476
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,223
tool number three and tool number four with this quote, and it's one that I really like,

477
00:29:55,383 --> 00:30:00,365
and it kind of describes the element of playfulness between the game designer and the

478
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:07,008
player. The most provocative game design possibilities are found where the role of

479
00:30:07,048 --> 00:30:15,211
the designer as an advocate for the player is disrupted. So what that means is that there can

480
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:15,931
be moments.

481
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:19,682
where you as a designer can totally mess with the player,

482
00:30:20,082 --> 00:30:22,884
where you are no longer their advocate.

483
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:26,845
This is no longer going to be an easy time for the player

484
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:29,086
in terms of well,

485
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:32,788
in terms of however you design your scares.

486
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:36,730
And that's by Douglas Wilson and Miguel Sierra.

487
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:41,292
So with that in mind, let's think about those.

488
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:44,684
those moments, those vignettes.

489
00:30:45,265 --> 00:30:47,648
And we'll go into tool number four,

490
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:51,432
which is find a way to turn every mechanic

491
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,235
against the player.

492
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:57,800
How do I make it scary for the player

493
00:30:58,701 --> 00:31:00,644
on the level of the mechanics of the game?

494
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:06,829
So mechanics, you know, the old motto, easy to learn, hard to master.

495
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:08,731
I would add sometimes they may turn on you.

496
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:11,313
Walking might become scary.

497
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:15,257
Doing this mundane task that you're used to doing in this game

498
00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:17,218
might be scary now.

499
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,803
And it's it's kind of a way I discovered.

500
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:27,768
Kind of a fun little way to surprise or panic the player

501
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:30,850
without resorting to a cheap jump scare.

502
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:37,225
I could probably write an entire presentation on how I feel about jump scares, how I think

503
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:42,888
they could be used in a more effective way, but we'll just leave it at that. It's a way

504
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:48,431
to kind of surprise or introduce this kind of oh crap moment with the player without

505
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:52,053
resorting to a cheap jump scare.

506
00:31:53,174 --> 00:31:56,378
In the case of Faith, I asked myself, how can I make walking scary?

507
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:59,281
How can I make reading, picking up a note and reading it scary?

508
00:32:00,162 --> 00:32:03,286
This is this is kind of my way of addressing the like cursed old game

509
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:06,470
that you find at a garage sale, kind of creepypasta

510
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:10,956
trope without the obvious fourth wall breaking stuff.

511
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:18,446
By designing the horror to permeate or infect seemingly innocent mechanics or mundane mechanics

512
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:23,892
that the player has done over and over again, I thought it would feel like the game was

513
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:29,417
aware of the player and reaching out to them without like totally pushing the obvious like

514
00:32:29,437 --> 00:32:31,539
this is a cursed game, it knows who you are.

515
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:37,668
There's an indie horror game, it's on IndieDB, I know that, it's called The Groundskeeper,

516
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:44,980
and the designer knew that when people get scared playing a game, they will, they will,

517
00:32:45,641 --> 00:32:47,824
they tend to pause the game to kind of catch a break.

518
00:32:49,337 --> 00:32:53,219
And so during scary parts where you're being chased by a monster,

519
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,902
if the player pauses the game, they get something really scary

520
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,803
instead of the pause menu like they were expecting.

521
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,986
And as I saw it years ago and I loved it and I wanted to put

522
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,767
I actually put something similar in Faith.

523
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:07,349
So even the pause menu and Faith can scare you

524
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,951
at the right, you know, at the opportune moment.

525
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:20,356
So here in chapter two of faith, this gif that I have on the right side of the screen there,

526
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:27,518
walking and navigating is turned on its head. In the previous room, there's a note that says,

527
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:34,640
when you see it, don't move. And you have to not move at this part. And a demon walks up to you

528
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,861
and examines you and then slowly walks out. And if you make one, you know,

529
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:41,000
if you make one movement, it's mortis for you.

530
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,484
That's a moment that resonates a lot with players.

531
00:33:46,044 --> 00:33:50,268
Here's a moment where cleansing an item

532
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:52,129
that usually gives you a little piece of lore

533
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,031
or a note actually spawns a demon

534
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:54,952
that you have to deal with.

535
00:33:55,853 --> 00:33:58,775
I got that from the Mysterious Murasame Castle game,

536
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:01,397
where you go into the castle and there are fake princesses

537
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,799
that are actually enemies.

538
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,993
So that was that's how I kind of turned to that mechanic against the player

539
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:09,113
in a moment.

540
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:11,475
So here's old Markiplier from from YouTube,

541
00:34:12,156 --> 00:34:17,159
and he is reading a note that you pick up in Faith Chapter two that.

542
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,763
Gets progressively more sinister, and it addresses the reader, John,

543
00:34:23,744 --> 00:34:27,427
and it accuses him of all this horrible stuff, and the note gets

544
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:32,711
more and more sinister, so the player is actually being attacked by

545
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:35,613
the text of a note that should be innocent.

546
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:40,615
Here you can see that the player gets gets pretty, pretty upset and distressed

547
00:34:42,255 --> 00:34:42,995
reading the note

548
00:34:44,676 --> 00:34:46,736
until you have to close the note at the end.

549
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:51,017
And by the end of it, I designed it to where hopefully the player is

550
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:54,598
scared to close that note and find out what happens next.

551
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:58,959
Iconic moment in Chapter two, in my opinion, that I really enjoyed

552
00:34:58,979 --> 00:35:02,300
kind of designing and crafting and players seem to like it as well.

553
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:09,503
And then there's some scares that actually hide behind the UI of the game.

554
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:11,384
So here's an example in Faith Chapter 3,

555
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:14,284
where the closer look or the examine mechanic

556
00:35:15,885 --> 00:35:18,865
gives this this cultist or this this enemy

557
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:22,746
an opportunity to sneak up on the player and surprise them.

558
00:35:27,147 --> 00:35:27,927
Oh, here's a fun one.

559
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:33,568
This is a big one for me, and that is earning the player's trust.

560
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:37,883
so that you can, oops, so that you can shatter that trust.

561
00:35:40,145 --> 00:35:42,206
What parts of the game does the player think,

562
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:44,007
does the player think are safe?

563
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:50,832
And how do you invade that?

564
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:54,674
How do you invade that safe space, so to speak, in the game?

565
00:35:55,215 --> 00:35:56,956
What parts of the game does the player think is safe?

566
00:35:57,116 --> 00:35:58,637
Is it the save room?

567
00:35:58,777 --> 00:36:01,519
Is it a particular corridor or a hallway?

568
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:03,780
Is it a particular part of the game?

569
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:07,490
It can be tempting to never let the player feel safe.

570
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,692
Like they're always in danger.

571
00:36:08,772 --> 00:36:11,616
See, for an example, see Five Nights at Freddy's 2.

572
00:36:12,397 --> 00:36:16,283
But I believe in that playful relationship between designer and player,

573
00:36:16,323 --> 00:36:17,165
especially in horror.

574
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:20,149
And but you have to find those moments, right, those vignettes.

575
00:36:21,024 --> 00:36:22,205
And this is where you kind of,

576
00:36:22,225 --> 00:36:24,226
I'm gonna introduce kind of the hero moment.

577
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:26,507
This is another term that Adam,

578
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:27,648
who my advisor for this talk,

579
00:36:27,928 --> 00:36:31,170
kind of helped me come up with for how to express this.

580
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:33,431
The Resident Evil series is great

581
00:36:33,572 --> 00:36:34,972
at forcing the player to backtrack,

582
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:38,374
but then it recontextualizes

583
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:43,617
the environment of the game to where you'll be backtracking thinking it's just another hallway,

584
00:36:43,657 --> 00:36:46,539
I've already cleared it out, and then boom, something scary will happen like a dog,

585
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:54,163
the classic dog jumping out of the window and shattering the glass. It's a great, great horror

586
00:36:54,223 --> 00:36:59,006
gaming moment. And so the Resident Evil series is really good at doing this, earning the players

587
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:04,509
trust so that they can shatter it. So in Faith Chapter 1, there's the catechismus or the training

588
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:04,729
mode.

589
00:37:05,755 --> 00:37:08,376
where it teaches you how to do the mechanics of the game,

590
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:11,536
but it teaches you as if the game is this kind of arcade,

591
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,117
kind of, you know, get rid of all the demons,

592
00:37:14,157 --> 00:37:15,317
kind of arcade experience.

593
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:17,377
But for anyone who's actually played the game,

594
00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:20,018
when you actually get into it, it's not like that at all.

595
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:23,419
It's actually much worse than your training.

596
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,979
And I wanted to give that feeling, the affect,

597
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:31,100
of being in a situation that you didn't get training for,

598
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,360
that you weren't prepared for.

599
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:39,726
Here's old Markiplier again reacting to this innocent looking tree that transforms into

600
00:37:39,786 --> 00:37:40,787
a demon and runs off.

601
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:45,472
And then in the next screen is filled with trees that are exactly the same.

602
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:47,695
So this was a fun little moment.

603
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:49,557
You never see the tree demon again.

604
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:54,224
But I I really wanted there to just be this random tree demon

605
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:57,445
to make the player not trust anything for the rest of the game.

606
00:37:58,205 --> 00:38:00,586
And I got a good reaction on the market player for that.

607
00:38:00,686 --> 00:38:04,587
And most everyone who plays this moment gets is pretty freaked out.

608
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:06,928
Again, that's the gold for me.

609
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:13,789
In Faith, Chapter three, the elevator is a safe haven until it's not

610
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,410
until enemies start peeking in on you and the doors open.

611
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:22,744
So a place that was supposed to be a safe haven for the player

612
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:25,425
or non-threatening is now threatening.

613
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:32,590
So here's another one, number six.

614
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,072
Tell the player or show them, show or tell,

615
00:38:36,972 --> 00:38:38,994
the player exactly what's going to happen.

616
00:38:39,814 --> 00:38:43,196
How can I create anticipation or apprehension?

617
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:47,759
So giving them.

618
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:55,691
just a little bit of what's going to happen, not telling him how or where or when in the

619
00:38:55,731 --> 00:39:00,814
game something's going to happen, but just showing them this scary, see the scary thing?

620
00:39:01,835 --> 00:39:08,339
It's coming for you. It's a great way to, in my opinion, and I've kind of seen it.

621
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,521
work and faith in some interesting ways.

622
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:14,162
It's a great way to create that apprehension, that anticipation,

623
00:39:14,202 --> 00:39:18,084
which can conjure up the feeling of dread, the jackpot for me.

624
00:39:18,744 --> 00:39:22,825
So in Fatal Frame 2, the build up to the first ghost

625
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:25,966
kind of encounter in Fatal Frame 2 is my opinion.

626
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:27,927
In my opinion, it's I love it.

627
00:39:27,987 --> 00:39:32,509
It's a masterclass of horror design from the very first parts of the game

628
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:34,510
up until maybe 15 minutes in.

629
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,490
You're being fed.

630
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:36,590
This.

631
00:39:39,635 --> 00:39:42,357
this ghost is coming after you and knows you're there.

632
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:46,999
And this is what happens to people who find the ghost and come across it.

633
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:51,001
The player doesn't know when they're going to face the ghost,

634
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:52,141
how they're going to deal with it.

635
00:39:52,982 --> 00:39:54,803
And that anticipation is just so great.

636
00:39:57,944 --> 00:40:01,646
In filmmaking, Alfred Hitchcock had this saying where if you I'm paraphrasing,

637
00:40:02,086 --> 00:40:06,728
if you show a revolver sitting on a table in Act one, then you'd.

638
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:12,565
you better believe that that revolver is going to go off by Act 3 or something like that. So you

639
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:16,488
create this feeling of anticipation. It's not the explosion of the bomb going

640
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:20,090
off, it's the anticipation of it going off. That's the thing.

641
00:40:24,013 --> 00:40:27,875
I made another game called Summer Night for the DreadX Collection,

642
00:40:28,536 --> 00:40:32,178
and the starting screen says, absolutely nothing scary happens in this game.

643
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:35,648
For best results, play in a dark room and wear headphones.

644
00:40:36,108 --> 00:40:38,230
Press escape key to turn back now.

645
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,871
Alt F4 to leave at any time.

646
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:41,292
So it tells you exactly what's going to happen.

647
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:42,693
Something scary is going to happen.

648
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:45,615
The form it takes, the when, the how, the where,

649
00:40:45,635 --> 00:40:46,536
the player doesn't know.

650
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:53,401
Here's an example in Faith chapter one.

651
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:55,302
You've been dealing with Michael, this demon,

652
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:57,523
and you know that he's there

653
00:40:57,563 --> 00:40:58,884
because you see him outside the window.

654
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:02,767
You just don't know from where he's going to come get you.

655
00:41:06,994 --> 00:41:09,756
In chapter two, the demo for chapter two,

656
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:12,718
which is a separate experience from the actual chapter two,

657
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:15,481
there's a note and there's several notes

658
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:16,882
that kind of hype up the basement.

659
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:19,323
Don't go in the basement, says here at the bottom line,

660
00:41:19,384 --> 00:41:21,845
please, for the love of God, don't go down to that basement.

661
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:24,107
You better believe you're going down to that basement.

662
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,250
And so there's this feeling of anticipation and dread there

663
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,852
that I hoped to craft with that moment.

664
00:41:33,015 --> 00:41:35,477
And then there's this note in Faith Chapter 3, you pick up,

665
00:41:35,558 --> 00:41:37,739
Gary lied to us when you see it run.

666
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:41,362
And then the next screen you see a corpse,

667
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:43,024
a trail of blood and a camera,

668
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:45,946
and the corpse had enough time to write, I saw it.

669
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:48,293
they didn't run fast enough.

670
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,476
So this was another one of those moments or vignettes

671
00:41:51,516 --> 00:41:54,659
that overlaps with other moments in the apartments level

672
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,722
that I designed to kind of be this moment

673
00:41:57,742 --> 00:42:00,085
where it's like something is coming after you

674
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:01,306
when you see it run.

675
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:05,450
And the idea that someone didn't run,

676
00:42:06,071 --> 00:42:07,733
you might not run fast enough to avoid it.

677
00:42:11,234 --> 00:42:15,916
Number seven, so put the player in the worst possible situation they could be in.

678
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:20,778
And this idea kind of was taught to me by a mentor of mine when I was studying

679
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:25,760
animation, Steve Hickner, who's the director of Bee Movie and Prince of Egypt.

680
00:42:26,621 --> 00:42:30,702
He would always say, if you want to test a character, put them in the worst

681
00:42:30,742 --> 00:42:33,383
possible position they can, situation they can be in.

682
00:42:33,904 --> 00:42:37,345
So how can I make this situation worse for the player?

683
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,266
That's what I'm interested in.

684
00:42:39,286 --> 00:42:39,326
So.

685
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:48,081
everyone knows that moment of their favorite game or that part that's extremely scary to them.

686
00:42:48,121 --> 00:42:53,067
That's especially like they dread going to it. Like, you know, if you're watching a playthrough,

687
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:57,994
they're like, Oh, I hate this part coming up. Right. So, um, during replay.

688
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:01,265
Players dread getting to that part.

689
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:04,846
There's Fatal Frame 2, you lose your flashlight in one part.

690
00:43:04,906 --> 00:43:06,026
That's that's pretty scary.

691
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:08,267
Alien Isolation, when you go into the hive.

692
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:12,708
And I don't want to spoil it too much, but it gets worse.

693
00:43:13,728 --> 00:43:16,528
The Evil Within, like the very first part of that game

694
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:19,929
is a very, very bad spot to be in for the player character.

695
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:23,350
And then here's a recent example in Resident Evil Village.

696
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,190
This is House Beneviento.

697
00:43:26,594 --> 00:43:30,075
Anyone who's played the game knows what's about to go down in this part of the game.

698
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:38,800
So on the macro level, you can think of maybe one or two hero moments or hero vignettes per game

699
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:46,864
that are that situation, the worst part that the player character can be in. It's like an escalation

700
00:43:47,144 --> 00:43:53,407
of tension, of level design, you know, space that's able to be navigated, the types of enemies

701
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:54,547
that you're encountering.

702
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:57,376
Make it, make a perfect storm.

703
00:43:59,499 --> 00:44:01,280
Try to anticipate what the player's thinking.

704
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:02,462
You know what would make this worse?

705
00:44:02,822 --> 00:44:04,404
I'm really glad that is not happening.

706
00:44:04,464 --> 00:44:06,646
Well, then you design it to happen.

707
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:10,590
But it kind of takes a lot of playthroughs of your own game

708
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,233
and kind of anticipating what you and visualizing what you think

709
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:15,075
the player is going through in a certain part of your game.

710
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:20,595
And on the micro level, you want to craft scares around making the situation worse sometimes.

711
00:44:20,735 --> 00:44:21,076
Try it.

712
00:44:21,196 --> 00:44:25,940
You know, try making the situation worse for the player and see if they can take it.

713
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,924
Lost in Vivo is an indie horror game that I highly respect.

714
00:44:30,164 --> 00:44:33,087
It's I really like it as an example of.

715
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,323
making the situation worse as you progress through a part of the game.

716
00:44:38,363 --> 00:44:42,485
So there are parts where you find keys or switches or something.

717
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:44,486
And every time you find that item,

718
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:49,089
the environment that you just went through and now have to go back through,

719
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:53,471
it gets worse, progressively worse. And I really liked that as an example.

720
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,833
And it can be more creative than, um,

721
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:03,553
then having the player character get captured and lose all their weapons mid-game.

722
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:07,743
That's a trope that we see a lot in horror games and in games in general.

723
00:45:08,825 --> 00:45:11,907
My vision for it is that we can be a little more creative than that, especially with horror.

724
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:17,269
In practice, this means throwing something at the player that they've never seen before,

725
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:21,950
and is also awful, or a situation, or something like that, or a task.

726
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:27,292
And in order to design this effectively, like I said before, you need to be mindful of the

727
00:45:27,332 --> 00:45:30,634
game loop that the player is going through up until this point.

728
00:45:31,074 --> 00:45:33,195
So what would the player's worst nightmare

729
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:37,936
be at this point of the game based on how things are going, based on how the narrative has been

730
00:45:37,976 --> 00:45:43,460
progressing, based on what the player should be feeling in these moments, in these overlapping

731
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:50,304
moments. And mechanics-wise, how can I ramp up that tension, ramp up that challenge, the chance

732
00:45:50,344 --> 00:45:54,807
of failure, the consequence of failure? How can I make it just this perfect storm?

733
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:01,652
And that's all well and good for Faith because it's a very highly handcrafted game.

734
00:46:01,772 --> 00:46:05,493
All the moments and vignettes that I've been talking about in its horror design,

735
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:10,334
there's a high customization for each of those things.

736
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:16,116
And Faith is very much not so much a systems driven game as it is a narrative driven game.

737
00:46:16,596 --> 00:46:19,357
So what if you're in kind of the narrative

738
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:24,675
narrative systems space of game design?

739
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:27,975
Well, the environment or the level can be designed

740
00:46:28,636 --> 00:46:30,276
to be the worst possible setting

741
00:46:31,096 --> 00:46:33,897
for the game under those certain systems.

742
00:46:34,157 --> 00:46:37,398
For example, if the player has been relying

743
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:39,738
on a certain mechanic in order to survive

744
00:46:39,778 --> 00:46:41,899
or get through, get past a certain enemy,

745
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,459
we'll design an environment to where

746
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:46,020
that's not a viable option anymore,

747
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,500
or design an environment to where

748
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,201
it's just the worst type of enemy for that situation.

749
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:55,583
you know, to navigate that space and, you know, try to survive that space and progress.

750
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:05,808
In Chapter 3, the player actually has to give up... let me see if I skipped something. No,

751
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:10,991
I didn't skip it. Anything. In Chapter 3, the player actually has to give up the cross,

752
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:15,293
that is their only means of defense against demons, and then they come across this old camera,

753
00:47:15,854 --> 00:47:17,575
then they pick it up, and the lights go out.

754
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,384
and they have nothing but the flash, the camera flash to light their way for a good chunk of that

755
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:29,590
level. And there are demons that are creeping up on them that they can only see in the camera flash.

756
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:35,015
And that's one of my all-time favorite moments in probably all the Fae series. It's this,

757
00:47:35,596 --> 00:47:36,957
oh crap moment where...

758
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:44,040
I design it to where hopefully the player just feels like this is the worst possible situation.

759
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:48,402
It can't get worse than this with the lighting, you know, and using the camera to light your way.

760
00:47:48,502 --> 00:47:53,324
And then you start seeing you start seeing demons in the camera flash. I love it.

761
00:47:55,004 --> 00:47:59,386
Chapter two has a part where and a lot of this has to do with light not being able to see.

762
00:48:01,919 --> 00:48:07,181
The screen space and the UI of Faith affords the player to be able to see a lot of things at once.

763
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:13,924
It's not like the first-person perspective where your viewing range is actually very limited compared to the entire environment.

764
00:48:14,384 --> 00:48:20,026
In Faith, you can usually see the entire environment of the screen, but once you pick up the flashlight in Chapter 2,

765
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:24,828
then you can only see through this narrow flashlight beam, and then you have to fight a demon with it.

766
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:31,513
I kind of designed and crafted this moment to be really tense because there are actually

767
00:48:31,553 --> 00:48:36,237
hallucinations of Johns that are darting in front of the flashlight beam during this fight

768
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:42,762
and based on player reactions this is a pretty fun moment to watch as a game designer.

769
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,810
Which brings me, this brings me to my last

770
00:48:53,416 --> 00:49:00,980
design tool in the Faith Horror Design Toolkit, which is you want to evaluate and re-evaluate

771
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:12,267
every design choice. Is this scary? Simple as that. Does this moment sell the feeling

772
00:49:12,307 --> 00:49:17,430
that you are being stalked by something that you can't see? Or does this...

773
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:26,213
really truly remix or test or challenge the mechanics that I've introduced in the game so far.

774
00:49:27,513 --> 00:49:33,815
Is this scary? And then ask yourself, am I sure this is scary? What is the point? So

775
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:41,396
figure out the point, you know, the deliberate design based on narrative mechanics and affect

776
00:49:42,217 --> 00:49:46,998
of that specific moment or section or fight or enemy of the game.

777
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:52,409
And be honest with yourself, if it's not supporting

778
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:54,571
or contributing to your design vision,

779
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:56,212
then toss it out.

780
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:57,293
You don't need it.

781
00:49:57,373 --> 00:50:01,797
So Faith Chapter One had a very lengthy flashback

782
00:50:02,097 --> 00:50:05,400
to the first exorcism, the one that went wrong

783
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,822
before the events of the first game.

784
00:50:08,683 --> 00:50:12,847
And I ended up taking it out of Chapter One.

785
00:50:14,085 --> 00:50:16,246
because for me it messed up the pacing,

786
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:18,588
it didn't really fit the ambiguous narrative,

787
00:50:18,608 --> 00:50:23,491
the uncertainty of what actually happened back then.

788
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:27,213
And I wanted to keep the player focused

789
00:50:27,513 --> 00:50:31,916
in the here and now of what was going on in chapter one.

790
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:37,440
And so I didn't really feel it was necessary anymore,

791
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,060
so I tossed it out.

792
00:50:38,976 --> 00:50:42,118
And I'm glad I did it because it was

793
00:50:42,138 --> 00:50:45,500
a part of consistently sticking to my design vision.

794
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:53,986
So we're going to review the entire toolkit and then

795
00:50:54,146 --> 00:50:56,648
some final remarks.

796
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:59,189
So thanks for bearing with me so far.

797
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,612
This is the cheat sheet if you were asleep this whole time.

798
00:51:02,892 --> 00:51:04,793
So we're going to review the entire toolkit.

799
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:07,815
So know what you want each design decision to accomplish.

800
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:10,750
in terms of narrative mechanics and affect.

801
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:13,512
Embrace minimalism.

802
00:51:15,074 --> 00:51:17,856
Emphasize the player character's vulnerability.

803
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,159
What are their vulnerabilities?

804
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,402
Maybe something more than just physical death.

805
00:51:24,462 --> 00:51:26,324
Could it be emotional vulnerabilities?

806
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:28,746
Could it be psychological vulnerabilities?

807
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:32,270
Could be vulnerabilities relative to other characters,

808
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:32,870
things like that.

809
00:51:34,353 --> 00:51:37,376
Number four, find a way to turn every mechanic against the player.

810
00:51:38,117 --> 00:51:40,979
Your game should be scary down to the mechanics.

811
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:47,466
A really, really recent example that I like

812
00:51:47,586 --> 00:51:51,870
was the haunted, the latest haunted PS1 bundle.

813
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:53,211
There's a game about.

814
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:59,537
I'm kind of stalking through this like countryside and he had an old flintlock musket and just

815
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:06,183
a simple act of reloading the musket or the flintlock or the lever action of some sort

816
00:52:06,203 --> 00:52:13,309
of old timey rifle was scary and panicky because you had to take the mouse and literally manipulate

817
00:52:13,389 --> 00:52:16,692
every mechanism in the action of the rifle.

818
00:52:16,732 --> 00:52:19,174
So you had to pull back the hammer, eject the cartridge.

819
00:52:19,775 --> 00:52:23,416
put the new cart, get a click on a cartridge, drag it onto the rifle,

820
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:30,479
then close it again and then cock it and load it. And that made combat really scary

821
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:37,621
and really tense and panicky. And that's a great way to turn just a simple mundane mechanic that

822
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:40,822
we almost always take for granted and turn it into something scary.

823
00:52:43,392 --> 00:52:46,494
Number five, earn the players trust so that you can shatter it.

824
00:52:47,074 --> 00:52:51,718
And this takes and this is something that's kind of interesting for me

825
00:52:51,738 --> 00:52:53,559
because I've been working on faith for so long

826
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:56,261
that parts of the game don't even seem scary to me anymore.

827
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:59,443
So every once in a while, maybe let a trusted friend,

828
00:52:59,903 --> 00:53:02,525
you know, play, play your horror game or play parts of it.

829
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:06,808
If you have a publisher run it by QA team, I do that with new blood all the time.

830
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:08,650
And I try to.

831
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:13,064
kind of reset my expectations for my own game based on their reactions.

832
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:16,706
It kind of reassures me that I am creating a horror experience

833
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,667
that can actually accomplish what I want it to do.

834
00:53:21,968 --> 00:53:27,011
So find those parts where the player could be in a state of trust

835
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:30,052
or could be kind of lulled into a sense of false security

836
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:33,394
and then find ways to shatter it in creative ways.

837
00:53:34,534 --> 00:53:37,656
Number six, tell the player exactly what's going to happen.

838
00:53:37,716 --> 00:53:38,356
Show or tell.

839
00:53:40,026 --> 00:53:46,654
And, you know, get creative, you know, show the show the gun that's going to go off by Act 3.

840
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,480
Hint at the monster that's coming after you.

841
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:58,668
There was an old Source engine game called Nightmare House 2, and it was

842
00:53:59,547 --> 00:54:09,412
Really good at it had these like randomized horror messages that were really funny every now and then you'd go through a hallway and it would trigger a little text prompt at the end and it would say like look behind you or something like that.

843
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:13,934
Speaking of look behind you so PT the Silent Hills demo Lord bless and keep it.

844
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:18,896
i'm still mad that it got canceled, but it will always live in my heart.

845
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:26,640
The iconic look behind you voice line from the radio tell the player exactly what's going to happen.

846
00:54:27,895 --> 00:54:31,556
Number seven, put the player in the worst possible situation

847
00:54:31,596 --> 00:54:32,176
they could be in.

848
00:54:32,556 --> 00:54:35,997
So there's got to be that hero moment, that hero vignette.

849
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:39,658
That is the, it is the, if the player is scared

850
00:54:39,678 --> 00:54:42,018
throughout the whole game, they should be especially scared

851
00:54:42,098 --> 00:54:42,838
during this part.

852
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,619
And that usually involves throwing something different

853
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:48,280
at the player that they'd never seen before.

854
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,981
And then finally evaluate and re-evaluate

855
00:54:53,761 --> 00:54:54,861
every design decision.

856
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:04,103
So conclusions, takeaways, a consistent voice is good.

857
00:55:04,183 --> 00:55:05,184
Consistency is good.

858
00:55:05,244 --> 00:55:10,768
So define your design vision, narrative, mechanics, affect.

859
00:55:11,248 --> 00:55:12,709
That's all I worry about, basically.

860
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,653
So being consistent to that vision is a good thing.

861
00:55:17,673 --> 00:55:19,274
And I believe it really helped me.

862
00:55:20,265 --> 00:55:22,727
kind of craft the horror of design of faith.

863
00:55:23,468 --> 00:55:25,709
But also a little bit of inconsistency is good.

864
00:55:25,729 --> 00:55:29,072
This is going to be kind of contradictory, as you can see just from reading it.

865
00:55:29,152 --> 00:55:34,097
But inconsistent moments that don't fit the mold of your design decision

866
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,959
for the purpose of tripping the player up, making them,

867
00:55:37,299 --> 00:55:38,841
keeping them on their toes, that can be good.

868
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:40,842
Building trust with the player is.

869
00:55:42,192 --> 00:55:45,413
is good. They should get into that flow experience where they're enjoying it.

870
00:55:45,453 --> 00:55:50,916
They're not, they're not experiencing anxiety because the tasks or the fights

871
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:52,256
or the enemies are too difficult,

872
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:56,098
but they should also not be breezing through it to where they're bored.

873
00:55:56,118 --> 00:55:58,259
So keep, keep within that, you know,

874
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:01,700
that infamous flow graph in between challenge and player skill,

875
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:06,202
but also be trained that trust is good. Again, those hero moments,

876
00:56:06,222 --> 00:56:07,383
those vignettes, those little,

877
00:56:08,163 --> 00:56:11,265
little parts where things just just get got worse for the player.

878
00:56:13,414 --> 00:56:15,114
Anticipation of what's coming is good,

879
00:56:15,154 --> 00:56:17,035
but also surprising the player is good.

880
00:56:17,455 --> 00:56:19,956
The way you accomplish that, it seems like an oxymoron.

881
00:56:20,017 --> 00:56:21,717
You should tell the player what's going to happen

882
00:56:21,737 --> 00:56:23,938
and then do it, and it's supposed to be surprising.

883
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,159
You're not spoiling the player.

884
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,500
You're teasing them with something

885
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,641
that's supposed to be really scary,

886
00:56:31,702 --> 00:56:33,383
and they don't know when, they don't know where,

887
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:34,083
and they don't know how.

888
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:35,824
So that's what you play off of.

889
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:41,566
Kind of adhering to this design vision and this toolkit,

890
00:56:42,517 --> 00:56:46,058
was how I managed to A, finish the game,

891
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:51,759
you know, finish creating, finish developing chapters one

892
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:57,160
and two on a shoestring budget and with just one person

893
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,541
in my spare time, basically.

894
00:56:59,341 --> 00:57:01,822
So being consistent and having faith

895
00:57:03,882 --> 00:57:08,643
about my design vision and my design kind of techniques.

896
00:57:09,845 --> 00:57:18,212
That's what got me through it, and that's what I hope will make Faith Chapter 3 into an unforgettable horror experience.

897
00:57:23,096 --> 00:57:27,120
So thanks. Thanks for bearing with me on this talk. I hope that you learned something.

898
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:34,786
And, you know, a disclaimer, I don't claim to be like a game designer or game developer extraordinaire.

899
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,527
This is just what...

900
00:57:36,265 --> 00:57:43,811
worked for me. This is ideas and techniques and design tools that I was able to kind of put together

901
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:49,334
and articulate in this talk that really helped me kind of in my vision for what I wanted Faith to be.

902
00:57:49,895 --> 00:57:54,298
Remember it started with just a simple design challenge. Could I make an effective horror

903
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:57,240
game experience using just basic graphics?

904
00:57:59,332 --> 00:58:02,693
And I think that it's been successful in its vision so far,

905
00:58:03,014 --> 00:58:06,476
and adhering to these techniques really helped me.

906
00:58:06,956 --> 00:58:08,997
So I hope that it'll help developers

907
00:58:09,017 --> 00:58:10,578
who are in a similar situation as me.

908
00:58:11,578 --> 00:58:14,300
So here's my social, you find me on Twitter at Airdorf,

909
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,741
that's actually the best way to contact me.

910
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:18,382
And join the New Blood Discord,

911
00:58:18,402 --> 00:58:20,923
that's where the official Faith Discord channel is.

912
00:58:21,784 --> 00:58:24,966
Come hang out, I'm always hanging around there.

913
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:28,814
and Garylovesyou.com. That is where you will find Faith's

914
00:58:29,455 --> 00:58:32,761
Steam page. I hope to finish it sooner than later.

915
00:58:33,983 --> 00:58:36,888
And always remember that Gary loves you. Thanks.
