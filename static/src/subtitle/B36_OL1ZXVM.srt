1
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:08,612
This is Puzzle Game Magic Secrets.

2
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:09,773
So let's talk about puzzle games.

3
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:13,616
First, who am I?

4
00:00:13,616 --> 00:00:14,617
I am Brett Taylor.

5
00:00:14,617 --> 00:00:16,399
That is my name and my identity.

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,182
I got my master's degree in cognitive studies and education

7
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:20,782
from Columbia.

8
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:24,726
And I've been developing games for, actually,

9
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:26,227
I guess it's over 10 years at this point.

10
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,769
I founded My Dog Zorro, my company, in 2015.

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,733
And my company, My Dog Zorro, made LineLight.

12
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,299
So let's talk about Lionlight briefly.

13
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:37,601
Because this is, actually, quick show of hands.

14
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:39,222
Who's familiar with Lionlight?

15
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:41,764
OK, all right, how about that?

16
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:42,925
All right, cool.

17
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:47,848
All right, so Lionlight, it's My Dog Zorro's first release.

18
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,450
It's a puzzle game, not surprisingly.

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,453
And we released it in 2017 for PlayStation 4, Steam, iOS,

20
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:54,833
and Android.

21
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,255
In 2017 and 2018, after taxes, it earned about $100,000.

22
00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:59,757
So you can do the math of the annual salary of that.

23
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:02,926
It also did pretty well review-wise.

24
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:05,547
There's over 10,000 Google Play reviews, 4.9 stars,

25
00:01:05,547 --> 00:01:06,707
et cetera, et cetera.

26
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:10,649
So here's the trailer so you get an idea of the mechanics

27
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:11,549
if you're not familiar.

28
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,552
All right, so that's the LionLight.

29
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:11,600
Okay, so overview for this talk.

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,342
It's broken up into four main parts.

31
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,365
First, we'll talk about working memory.

32
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:17,387
Then we'll get into some puzzle characteristics

33
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,050
like vocabulary for puzzles.

34
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,093
So we can have better conversations about them.

35
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:24,890
Then the bulk of the talk is the lessons that I learned

36
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,751
from making Limelight.

37
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,332
And there were many lessons.

38
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:30,135
Then we'll end with how I make puzzles,

39
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:32,737
so some actionable takeaways, actionable strategies,

40
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:36,480
like toolboxes strategies that you can use and take home

41
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,121
to make your own puzzles and stuff.

42
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:39,102
All right.

43
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:42,725
But before we get started, this talk prioritizes fun

44
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:45,327
and non-random puzzle games.

45
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:47,109
So you might not want to make a game that

46
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:48,230
is fun for specific reasons.

47
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,871
If it's like an artistic thing, et cetera,

48
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:51,452
this talk sways towards that.

49
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,804
I just figured I'd mention that.

50
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:55,724
And you can also subvert these rules for alternate effects.

51
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:58,005
So if you want to intentionally disorient the player

52
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,886
for some reason, you could do the opposite of what some

53
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:04,007
of these rules that I say are.

54
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:05,888
And also this talk, I cut, I think, like 300% of it.

55
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:11,490
There's so much that I cut from this.

56
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,751
And this is just scratching the surface.

57
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:14,411
There's a lot.

58
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,331
So yeah, all right.

59
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:16,371
OK.

60
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,176
Definition, what makes a puzzle fun?

61
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:23,805
So in this talk, I define fun as any time the player

62
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,810
gets to exhibit mastery skill or wit.

63
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:29,929
This is a theme I'll kind of come back to.

64
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:32,250
Also, it's a definition of mechanics.

65
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,371
When I say mechanics, things like boxes

66
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:37,573
that you can push and pull, enemies, et cetera, et cetera,

67
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:39,294
things like that.

68
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:41,715
So most game developers, when they hear the word mechanic,

69
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:43,856
the first thing they think of is this.

70
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,237
But that's erroneous.

71
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:45,617
No, no, no.

72
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:47,058
Today in this talk, we're thinking

73
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:50,620
about this on the right.

74
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,140
Yeah.

75
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,701
All right.

76
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:55,442
All right, part one, working memory.

77
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:58,759
Working memory.

78
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,220
Human RAM, this slide used to be much larger.

79
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,220
That's basically it.

80
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,141
That's the fastest way I can explain it to people.

81
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:06,942
It's the processing power that you have

82
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:08,302
to hold information in your head

83
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:12,064
and use that information to solve puzzles

84
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:13,985
and do other things in your life.

85
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:15,945
So the way that I sort of, in this talk.

86
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:20,461
The way I picture it is it's, this is like an abstract metaphor of,

87
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,763
if your working memory were a bar from 0 to 100%.

88
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,746
So things that you do occupy your working memory.

89
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:30,189
So let's say if you're solving a puzzle, you're taking up a certain amount,

90
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:31,950
you're talking to a friend, and you're also eating,

91
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,872
each of these things eats into your working memory.

92
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:36,974
So let's say that, you know, if you're juggling or something,

93
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:38,115
it'll be harder to do math problems,

94
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,918
because the juggling activity is occupying your working memory.

95
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,841
And this has big implications in what players are doing in a puzzle game.

96
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:49,182
So who here is familiar with flow?

97
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:49,963
I'll just say flow.

98
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:51,764
OK, so most people.

99
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:55,826
Yeah, so when I found this analogy,

100
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:59,448
I was really excited about this.

101
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:02,230
So with flow, flow is basically, for those of you who don't know

102
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,891
or aren't that familiar, if the player has,

103
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:06,912
like, if the level is too challenging.

104
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:08,613
and the player is not out of skill,

105
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:10,234
then it's overwhelming.

106
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:12,136
And on the opposite side, if they're too skillful

107
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:14,738
and the level is too boring, then it's boring.

108
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:16,039
And that's not fun.

109
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,920
So working memory-wise, we actually kind of like,

110
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,322
there's kind of a sweet spot to keep a player

111
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:21,703
in terms of like how much stuff they're juggling

112
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:23,124
in their head at any given time.

113
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:25,105
And it's sort of like, it's not quite in the middle

114
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:27,006
because the human brain can hold a lot

115
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:29,188
and too much is pretty uncomfortable.

116
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:31,089
But like there's a sweet spot sort of.

117
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,391
I don't know, in that range.

118
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,853
Again, this is super metaphorical.

119
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:36,954
This is not literally this.

120
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:38,254
Obviously, our brains don't work like this.

121
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:43,138
But it's really useful, at least for me, to think of it like this.

122
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:45,700
So how much working memory am I overloading

123
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,761
or am I requiring from my players?

124
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:49,663
All right.

125
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:53,724
After repetition, concepts or ideas in puzzles,

126
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:56,066
they take up less space in a player's working memory.

127
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:58,968
So let's say that rule A initially will take up 40%.

128
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:02,030
Rule B takes up another amount.

129
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,492
And rule C takes up whatever, 20%.

130
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:06,754
As the player gains experience over time,

131
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:08,736
each of these rules takes up less and less space

132
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:09,676
in the player's working memory.

133
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:12,058
And then there's all this freedom space,

134
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:15,201
which naturally is filled with new mechanics.

135
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,903
That's just sort of how games work.

136
00:06:20,353 --> 00:06:22,036
So here's a puzzle from The Witness.

137
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:24,199
For a beginner who is unfamiliar with the mechanics

138
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,825
of this, this would be, let's say, I mean, this is

139
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:29,508
metaphorical, again.

140
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:31,931
But yeah, this is overwhelming for that player.

141
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:33,744
There's too much going on.

142
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:34,905
They don't have enough experience yet.

143
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:36,367
But for somebody who has more experience

144
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:37,628
and has played enough of the game,

145
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:39,910
they can visually parse through each of these components,

146
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,613
takes up less space in that player's working memory.

147
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:44,555
So for an expert, this is much easier to solve.

148
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:47,818
And where they're stimulated working memory wise

149
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:49,800
is in a much more manageable zone.

150
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,062
And that's sort of the sweet spot that keeps them,

151
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:53,663
that's the spot that we,

152
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,065
it's the most fun as a player to be in.

153
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:55,305
All right.

154
00:06:57,937 --> 00:07:03,080
So if an expert, let's say that the purple rule and the yellow

155
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,123
rule only take up that much space, but for a novice it

156
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:10,425
takes up this much space, what is all of this extra space?

157
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:10,805
Great question.

158
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,267
I'm glad you asked.

159
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,208
This is what I consider possibility space.

160
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,970
So possibility space, it's reduced as the player's

161
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,451
experience grows, as I showed in previous slides.

162
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:23,389
So here's an example from The Witness.

163
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:24,790
You don't have to know the mechanics of this,

164
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,751
but an expert who looks at this knows that they must draw

165
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,292
a line through the center of this.

166
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:30,453
It has to be horizontal.

167
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:31,514
That's the only option that they have.

168
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:33,635
But for a beginner who's not quite as well versed

169
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:35,456
with the mechanics of the game, might

170
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,677
think that this is possible.

171
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:40,340
that extra possibility takes up a little bit more space

172
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,021
in their working memory.

173
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:44,564
This could also be possible, and this, and this, and this,

174
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,265
and this, and that, and et cetera.

175
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:50,749
So all of these things add up to the novice's possibility space.

176
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,859
So something that is relatively trivial for an expert,

177
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:57,839
for a novice, it actually would take up much more working

178
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,800
memory because they haven't developed,

179
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,820
they haven't streamlined the neural pathways

180
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,681
that would make them visually parsing it

181
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:08,722
and understanding it more efficient.

182
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,762
And the expert is better at it.

183
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:13,223
Let me drink some water.

184
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:15,383
All right.

185
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:21,885
Moving on, puzzle characteristics.

186
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:24,895
Here's some traits of puzzles.

187
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:31,438
So first off, Braid doesn't equal Sudoku.

188
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:32,658
Revolutionary statement, I know.

189
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:39,261
I know, everybody's very antsy, they want to find out.

190
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:40,522
I'll get to it, please.

191
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:42,522
All right, so the way,

192
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,743
so I sort of put this on a spectrum

193
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:46,264
of handcrafted puzzles versus procedural puzzles.

194
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:49,900
Now, there are other types of puzzles and tons

195
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,381
of other characteristics and components of puzzles.

196
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,623
But the most popular spectrum that I

197
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:57,825
see that is easiest to categorize most of the puzzle

198
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:00,107
games that I see and that are on the market

199
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:03,489
is sort of like somewhere in the handcrafted and procedural

200
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:04,489
realms.

201
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:06,971
So handcrafted puzzles, there's a finite possible amount

202
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:08,992
of puzzles because they're handcrafted.

203
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:11,894
The player is rarely repeating skills.

204
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,110
It's much more novel.

205
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,292
Like, each solution is more novel and surprising.

206
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:18,295
That's why we've got these aha moments that we

207
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:20,357
strive for and talk about.

208
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:21,858
And the content is authored, which

209
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:25,061
is one of the most important parts for the developer,

210
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:28,564
because you are, like, hand crafting each one.

211
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:30,485
And it's a much more fresh and varied experience

212
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:31,126
for the player.

213
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:33,028
That's sort of why they're playing the game,

214
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:34,989
is to see what's, you know, well, one of the reasons

215
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:36,891
is, like, what on earth will happen next?

216
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:40,294
Procedural, on the other hand, is basically the opposite.

217
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:42,856
There are infinitely possible puzzles, for the most part.

218
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:46,159
The player is constantly repeating skills.

219
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,601
So if you can picture playing Sudoku,

220
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:50,063
you're not learning new skills.

221
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:55,488
There's a finite amount of Sudoku skills and strategies

222
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,410
that any one player can have.

223
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,573
And each solution is not that novel, relatively speaking.

224
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:03,355
I've never gone to my roommate and been like,

225
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:05,988
Oh, I had this Sudoku board, and look at the solution.

226
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:06,788
It doesn't really happen.

227
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:09,449
And the puzzles are born from the system.

228
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:11,930
So that's, from the designer's perspective,

229
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,631
you can theoretically make a random generator that would

230
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:15,972
make these types of puzzles.

231
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:18,733
I've worked on lots of puzzles on both ends of the spectrum

232
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:19,393
and in between.

233
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:22,854
And for the player, it's a much more predictable experience.

234
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:25,495
Like if somebody's playing Sudoku or a game like that,

235
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:28,456
that's generally, it's like part of a routine,

236
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:29,637
like maybe a daily routine.

237
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:30,737
When I played Sudoku.

238
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,911
For a while, I'm playing on the subway, on my way to work,

239
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:35,832
et cetera, because I wanted that specific experience.

240
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:40,594
So these are just two different types of experiences.

241
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:44,076
And then there's games like Rush Hour also,

242
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,076
and Flow on the App Store.

243
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:48,738
Those are both great games, or on the procedural end.

244
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:50,699
Then there's tons of stuff in between.

245
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:52,320
The Witness was kind of tricky to categorize,

246
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,661
because it is, by its definition, it's handcrafted.

247
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:58,202
But the system itself lends itself to procedural puzzles.

248
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:00,523
There are points in the game where there are just randomly

249
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,453
randomly generated levels.

250
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,875
This talk leans towards handcrafted puzzles,

251
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,796
or at least, we'll talk a little bit more about that.

252
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:11,217
Because Limelight is in the handcrafted side of it.

253
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:11,417
Noise.

254
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,598
So if you take anything away from this talk,

255
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:16,960
this is like the most important thing.

256
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,661
If I were to give you anything, this would be it.

257
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:22,402
Noise, the way that I define it is

258
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:27,544
it's anything that occupies the player's working memory,

259
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:30,065
but it doesn't contribute to the puzzle.

260
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:35,947
Noise steals working memory from the player.

261
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:39,209
So, briefly, here's a mechanic from LineLight.

262
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,952
These are called flippers and moving streets.

263
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,853
So you move left and right on that little hamburger thing

264
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:44,834
and the street moves up and down.

265
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,907
So here's a level in Lion Lights that is all...

266
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,848
like this level is mostly noise.

267
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:52,429
So the solution to it, the solution to this puzzle is

268
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,549
get three flippers in the right setting to complete a path.

269
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,650
That's like... if I were to describe what the solution is,

270
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,431
that's the solution.

271
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:01,152
But because of all the noise, this level is basically like a big...

272
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,273
it's sort of like a big slipknot.

273
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:04,653
If I pull the slipknot apart,

274
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:06,374
this is all the puzzle really is.

275
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:09,713
You just have to hit these two flippers,

276
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:11,774
and then you've completed the path.

277
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:14,315
But I've added a lot of noise to sort of obfuscate

278
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:16,916
that as the obvious solution.

279
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,857
And this is really in the game.

280
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:20,958
And I use noise pretty sparingly,

281
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,779
but it's a good example of how I use it.

282
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,120
All right.

283
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,821
So here's an example from The Witness.

284
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:32,666
So in this example, the player starts here.

285
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,149
They want to draw a path to the end.

286
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:37,694
They can either end on the top right or the bottom right.

287
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:40,814
And that's it, just draw a path from start to finish.

288
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:43,796
All of these gaps in here, that is just noise.

289
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,958
Those could be replaced with ink blots

290
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,019
because you can't actually pass all the way through them.

291
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,241
They're there to make it more difficult

292
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:53,602
to visually parse that puzzle.

293
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:55,543
Photoshopped out, this is what it actually looks like,

294
00:12:55,543 --> 00:13:00,966
and it's so much easier to see what the solutions would be

295
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:02,107
because there's much less noise.

296
00:13:02,107 --> 00:13:06,490
And mazes in themselves are just like giant slip knots

297
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,330
in the first place.

298
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:07,670
But anyway.

299
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:12,734
So on the left, yeah, let's say that it takes up, theoretically, this much player's working memory.

300
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:16,698
That noise occupies a lot of extra space. But on the right, without it, it's pretty trivial.

301
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:20,282
You can see how to get to the end much more easily.

302
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:23,205
Here's another mechanic from LineLight. These are called cover-ups.

303
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:28,872
If all of them are being touched, then the gate opens up.

304
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:30,239
Here is an example from Lion Light.

305
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,619
This is a level that nobody solves accidentally

306
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:35,700
because there is noise in this level.

307
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,320
In this example, I use noise to prevent the player

308
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,481
from accidentally solving the level.

309
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:44,261
The solution is for the player to back up

310
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:46,681
into these two cover-ups to light them up

311
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:48,962
because they can only control the head of the character.

312
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:53,683
I guess I will just challenge you folks.

313
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:55,863
Where could you see the noise?

314
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:58,083
The solution is to back up into the top area.

315
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:02,148
here to unlock these so you can continue and get those.

316
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:03,529
Any idea where the noise might be?

317
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,911
When you're countering the angle from the left

318
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:14,277
as opposed to the right.

319
00:14:14,277 --> 00:14:15,337
I don't fully understand.

320
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, so the crosshair.

321
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,480
Uh-huh, this one here?

322
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,744
Yeah, maybe if you haven't played the game.

323
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:26,145
Yeah, I mean, it's tough if you haven't played the game.

324
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:35,543
So the answer is, I mean, if you're not as familiar with the game, it's a bit trickier.

325
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:38,244
But the noise is right here. So it's this extra loop right there.

326
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:42,265
Yeah, celebrating that you got that. Very well done.

327
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:46,647
So without that noise, so people basically would go down,

328
00:14:46,647 --> 00:14:50,169
because there's only a few things to do. Like, that's a dead end, why would I go there?

329
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,630
They would go down, and then they would back up, and the puzzle would be solved.

330
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,611
And they didn't realize that they had solved it, or what they had done to solve it.

331
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:58,832
And that completely subverted the point of the puzzle.

332
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,631
because I want them to know what they're doing.

333
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:01,792
Unless you want to...

334
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:04,274
Actually, that would be interesting if you made a puzzle game

335
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:08,998
and the whole thing was just the player accidentally solving each really interesting puzzle.

336
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:10,539
But I don't think that we're here to do that.

337
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:14,703
So anyway, I added noise intentionally here to prevent that.

338
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:17,025
So here's an example from inside.

339
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:21,627
So here, in this example, there is a crate here

340
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:22,547
that you can push to the right.

341
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,229
The goal is to get up this chain here.

342
00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:26,771
The player wants to continue up by climbing that chain.

343
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:28,253
When you push the crate to the right,

344
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:29,574
or sorry, when you pull the crate to the left,

345
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:31,916
the chain goes up, and when you push the crate to the right,

346
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,397
the chain comes down.

347
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:34,498
So this, like that.

348
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:37,241
So if you push it all the way to the right,

349
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:39,783
the chain goes down, but if you push it to the left,

350
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:42,786
the chain goes up.

351
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:44,027
I'll give you a moment to think about

352
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,168
where the noise here might be.

353
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:47,745
You got it.

354
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:50,627
It's the fact that you can jump on this platform here.

355
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:51,348
It's a red herring.

356
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:55,131
This does not, it's not part of the solution to the puzzle.

357
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:55,611
Yeah, you got it?

358
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:55,892
Excellent.

359
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:56,232
I appreciate you.

360
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:56,552
Yeah, yeah.

361
00:15:56,552 --> 00:16:02,097
So it's basically, it's a red herring.

362
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:04,018
It's not involved in the solution.

363
00:16:04,018 --> 00:16:05,780
It does not have to be a part of the puzzle.

364
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,802
It does contribute to the experience,

365
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,643
but it's actually not part of the solution.

366
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:12,806
And by that definition, it is noise.

367
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:18,331
So noise makes puzzles artificially harder. I sort of like to think of it

368
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:22,995
Another metaphor. It's a sort of it's it's like the breading in around general sows chicken

369
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:27,139
Like a little bit is okay, but if it's just all breading if it's all noise

370
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:31,203
And there's no meat. It's like where's the puzzle? You know I like that metaphor

371
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:40,671
And it does it requires diligence to identify it like I've played so many games that have a lot of noise in them and

372
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:45,292
So please take this away and look out for your noise

373
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,613
and remove it.

374
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:49,014
Yeah, if you're not aware of it, noise will pollute your game.

375
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:52,197
I've played so many games that they have noise unintentionally.

376
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:54,379
The developer will understand that it's

377
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,800
making the puzzle more difficult,

378
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:02,205
but the nuance of having it be because it is not

379
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:04,666
contributing to the puzzle, they might be missing out on that.

380
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,608
And that is not a puzzle-solving experience

381
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,290
as much as it is a seeing through noise experience, which

382
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,471
is different from puzzle-solving.

383
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:14,473
And it can be useful, as I mentioned,

384
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:17,077
if used intentionally by deterring accidental solving.

385
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,461
And also using skill to see through it,

386
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:21,364
like in solving a maze or something like that,

387
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:23,968
or in a bullet hell sort of game, that's satisfying.

388
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:43,195
All right.

389
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,837
Seven lessons that I learned from Lionlight.

390
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:46,118
This is the bulk of the talk.

391
00:17:46,118 --> 00:17:46,558
You ready?

392
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:47,840
Let's strap in.

393
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,903
All right, lesson number one, simplify.

394
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:55,427
Less noise leads to cleaner and tighter puzzles.

395
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:56,988
So, what do we want?

396
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,049
Cleaner, tighter puzzles.

397
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,090
How do we get it?

398
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,471
Simplify.

399
00:17:59,471 --> 00:17:59,771
Exactly.

400
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:03,875
Can you repeat what was said?

401
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,155
Simplify.

402
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:04,355
Thank you.

403
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:06,164
Good call.

404
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:09,466
Yeah, so to unpack that, the method that I do

405
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:11,427
is describe the solution of the puzzle

406
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:14,509
and remove anything you didn't mention.

407
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:18,672
I'll let that hang.

408
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,033
Hashtag cut the noise.

409
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,354
This gets easier with practice.

410
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:26,777
I got way better at this as I was developing LineLight.

411
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:27,918
Like, the early levels that I made,

412
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:31,760
which I thought were so cool, I'm just ashamed of at this

413
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,662
point, but yeah, I mean, it takes practice.

414
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,873
Anyway, so, yeah, as I was developing Lionlight,

415
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:39,674
I hacked every level down to the bone

416
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:41,674
until there was really nothing left to remove.

417
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:44,034
There was no further extraneous elements.

418
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:47,295
And then I continued to remove extraneous elements

419
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:48,615
because there were still some.

420
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:49,835
Like I would make things symmetrical,

421
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:51,436
maybe when they weren't, I would streamline this,

422
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:53,816
streamline that, and it's very rewarding, actually.

423
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:58,677
Yeah, and looking back, as I was making this talk,

424
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:00,517
I was like, yeah, I simplified it so much.

425
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:02,878
I could have simplified it so much more.

426
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,363
So my advice is vet every level at least two times.

427
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:08,164
Check are these components necessary?

428
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:10,645
If your goal is to remove noise, which I would say

429
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:11,546
it's a good practice.

430
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:13,707
It's a healthy practice so that noise does not

431
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:15,908
pollute your game.

432
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:17,909
I vetted each of LineLight's levels at least four times.

433
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:19,430
Some of them I did up to a dozen times.

434
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,752
I would continuously just constantly mow in the lawn.

435
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:25,813
And if it doesn't belong, ultimately, it

436
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:27,795
might just be worth cutting, which I did a lot in LineLight's

437
00:19:27,795 --> 00:19:27,955
levels.

438
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:39,970
And it's also, it's just really satisfying to, like, I got kind of addicted to, like, just, like, finding, it's, it was like, I would identify, like, oh, here's noise, and then I would, like, remove it out, and it's just, yeah, it's good, it's fun.

439
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:46,477
So my advice is, if you do want noise, try to start with none, and then add it from there, so that way you're at least doing it mindfully.

440
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:49,715
Because, you know, it can be used for good. It's not all bad.

441
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:56,240
It can enhance the experience, prevent accidental solving, and change up the pace of the game, and so on.

442
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,942
So here's an example on the left. This is what the level used to look like.

443
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:03,745
And I thought that this was super elegant. I was like, what else, what's there left to remove?

444
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,647
On the right, it turns out that there were a bunch of things I could remove.

445
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:10,750
It's the same solution. So describing the solution, they're identical between these two.

446
00:20:11,488 --> 00:20:15,291
Here's another one. So there's about as many components on the left as there are on the right, but the right...

447
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:20,094
the level on the right is symmetrical, which is... it's much more pleasing to look at.

448
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,717
It's much prettier, and it's also easier to visually parse.

449
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:24,618
So that's simplified it there.

450
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:28,594
The one on the left here, I was like, this game is amazing.

451
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,095
I was super excited, at least, about this mechanic

452
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:33,456
that I discovered when I was working on it.

453
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:37,258
But the solution ultimately is just on the right.

454
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:37,678
It's so simple.

455
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:39,879
And it took many iterations.

456
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,860
Eventually, I ended up with the level on the right, which

457
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,141
is fundamentally what the level on the left is trying to be.

458
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,282
But it's obfuscated with a lot of extra components

459
00:20:47,282 --> 00:20:48,783
and clutter, which it doesn't have to be.

460
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:57,306
The level on the left is General Tso's chicken with a ton of breading and the one on the right is mostly just chicken

461
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,248
Yeah, I like the metaphor. I don't know what

462
00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:05,552
Lesson two cut pointless levels this kind of ties into the previous they are there

463
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:06,753
accepted

464
00:21:06,753 --> 00:21:12,057
So for each level ask what is the purpose of this level and if you can't answer that question it is a road to mediocrity

465
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:15,483
Here's some possible purposes of a level.

466
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,484
Maybe it teaches something.

467
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,625
It could be to reinforce a skill,

468
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,025
so some redundancy is okay.

469
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,566
I do that a little bit in Line Light.

470
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:23,567
There's unique identifiable moments,

471
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:28,009
so it's just something that a player hasn't yet experienced.

472
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:30,470
Or it's maybe a palate cleanser or just to break up pacing.

473
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,491
There are some levels in Line Light,

474
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,991
intentionally after a bunch of hard ones

475
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:36,933
where it's just a big open space just to let people exhale.

476
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:38,874
I discovered that those were really important

477
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:39,934
to have in there.

478
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:43,329
Also, here's a side note on the term mediocrity,

479
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:45,070
because I have to say this.

480
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,892
You are good enough always, I promise.

481
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:49,233
That's a vow from me.

482
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,555
And if you don't believe it, come talk to me afterward

483
00:21:51,555 --> 00:21:52,075
and we'll chat a bit.

484
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:55,037
Don't be afraid of not being good enough

485
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:56,038
and make things anyway.

486
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:59,381
Don't be afraid of making things that are mediocre, please.

487
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:03,223
And also, every expert has to pass through mediocrity

488
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:04,464
in the first place.

489
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:07,467
So yeah, don't let that stop you from creating things.

490
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,148
All right, back to pointless levels.

491
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:16,517
It is not easy to admit a level is pointless, especially if you have nothing better to replace it, which is how I dealt with LineLight

492
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:24,462
in the beginning because I was like these levels aren't that great, but there's nothing better to replace them with so I was like

493
00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:26,624
But over time I got better at making them

494
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:31,066
So my advice is that every level, what do we not want?

495
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:32,960
Freeloaders, yeah.

496
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,262
All right, so here's an example of a level that I cut.

497
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:38,604
So this level I cut because it was not educational,

498
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:40,766
interesting, fun, or unique.

499
00:22:40,766 --> 00:22:42,447
Most importantly, it was not fun.

500
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:44,268
It was preceded by these two levels.

501
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:46,570
So this one on the top left explores an idea,

502
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,732
the one on the bottom left unpacks that idea,

503
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:50,253
brings it a little bit further,

504
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:53,495
and then the natural trajectory would be the third level.

505
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:56,177
So I take one concept, I take the next point in that,

506
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:58,139
and then what's the next logical progression of that?

507
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,561
of that level, and it was this, but it was just not fun.

508
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:02,081
It was redundant.

509
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,843
So I ended up cutting it.

510
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:10,427
I love water.

511
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:11,047
It's so much fun.

512
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:16,651
All right, lesson number three, you were the expert player,

513
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:18,512
controls-wise.

514
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:20,533
So I had some complaints about Lionlight,

515
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,395
the timing being too hard.

516
00:23:23,395 --> 00:23:26,817
Even when they had a full 1 and 1 1⁄2 second window

517
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:27,658
to do an action.

518
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,682
And I'm like, come on, it's like the barn door

519
00:23:30,682 --> 00:23:31,544
is all the way open.

520
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,587
And they're like, hey, help me into this door.

521
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:35,609
I'm like, it's right there.

522
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:38,954
However, knowing the solution and not being able

523
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:43,421
to execute it is not a fun experience.

524
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,302
Yeah, so.

525
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:49,136
If people are complaining, listen to them.

526
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,136
My strategy is to play through levels with your feet,

527
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:52,297
with your non-dominant foot.

528
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,438
Try that out.

529
00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:55,859
And if you can't solve it with your feet, make it easier.

530
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:58,380
This is specifically for puzzle games.

531
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,321
Obviously, for action games, this does not apply.

532
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:03,202
But if it's a game where the promise is

533
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:05,743
that people, if they can figure it out,

534
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:08,384
that they should be able to execute it,

535
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:10,125
play with your feet.

536
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:10,845
Foot play testing.

537
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:12,346
I feel like there's a clever term there.

538
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:13,247
I'll come up with it after the talk.

539
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:16,490
All right, new mechanic from Lionlight, lock steps.

540
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:21,333
They move when you move, as you move.

541
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,734
Oh yeah.

542
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:24,335
So, here's me, you know, in 2016,

543
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:27,497
thinking I've logged hundreds of hours playing this game,

544
00:24:27,497 --> 00:24:31,400
so I'm pretty sure I know what the average player can handle,

545
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,001
which was erroneous.

546
00:24:34,462 --> 00:24:35,982
The lesson that I learned from this

547
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:37,383
is that if people are still complaining,

548
00:24:37,383 --> 00:24:38,804
because I made changes, I made it easier,

549
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:40,625
but people were still complaining,

550
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,826
and I thought to myself, I made the changes already,

551
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:44,147
you know, I've catered to the audience,

552
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:45,308
but people were still complaining.

553
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:47,669
They're right, they're still right.

554
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,370
Continue to change it.

555
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,592
It's not them, ultimately, it is you, it's the game.

556
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:53,392
Serve your audience.

557
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,333
It depends, like, if your goal is to serve your audience,

558
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,134
if you're making a game for your players,

559
00:24:57,134 --> 00:25:00,096
don't lose sight of that priority.

560
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:03,658
Lesson number four, keep action and puzzles.

561
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,501
separate.

562
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:08,642
This applies specifically for single solution puzzles.

563
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:10,482
So things where you're building a solution, or if it's

564
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:13,363
like a physics-based Rube Goldberg, maybe,

565
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:16,263
solution that it's inherent in the actual design of it.

566
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:18,884
But for single solution puzzles or few solution puzzles,

567
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:19,724
this is very important.

568
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:21,064
So action or puzzles is great.

569
00:25:21,064 --> 00:25:22,845
Action and puzzles is that frowny face.

570
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:27,546
So you wouldn't tune in ice cream on the same plate.

571
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:31,647
So why would you serve action and puzzle solving

572
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:32,487
in the same moment?

573
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:33,967
So that's a bulletproof argument right there.

574
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:37,420
No, maybe.

575
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,922
So action adds randomness and distractions,

576
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,265
but puzzle solving requires patterns and consistency.

577
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:45,668
The player needs an idea of what they don't yet know.

578
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:47,891
So action subverts the foundation

579
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:51,134
of what the player needs, the stability

580
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:54,297
that they need to actually solve the puzzle,

581
00:25:54,297 --> 00:25:56,560
because you need patterns and consistency.

582
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,781
And action removes that.

583
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:01,106
Yeah, so when a player enters a level,

584
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:02,947
they should know if it requires either action or puzzle skills.

585
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:04,288
Because you can do, like, you know,

586
00:26:04,288 --> 00:26:06,169
LineLight has like action-y moments.

587
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:10,712
But it should be clear, like, are we in puzzle-solving mode

588
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:11,733
or action-solving mode?

589
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:13,474
It does depend what you're going for,

590
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:16,916
but this was a lesson that I didn't realize

591
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:20,338
was as important as it actually is.

592
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:21,259
Yeah.

593
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:22,800
And about 10% of players complained,

594
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,262
and that was too many.

595
00:26:25,262 --> 00:26:26,682
So make action levels optional.

596
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:28,223
That's one obvious thing.

597
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,952
a suggestion to mitigate this.

598
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:35,453
So let's say there's 100% action levels on the left

599
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:36,353
and 100% puzzle on the right.

600
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:39,894
We do not want levels in the murky area.

601
00:26:39,894 --> 00:26:42,975
Basically, if you find that they have components of both

602
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:47,576
and it's a single solution puzzle, push them out.

603
00:26:47,576 --> 00:26:50,036
The ambiguity is, it's no fun.

604
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:50,996
Yeah.

605
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:53,497
Which leads me into lesson number five.

606
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:55,597
Make the solution unambiguous.

607
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:56,458
What's that mean?

608
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:57,218
Let's unpack it.

609
00:26:57,697 --> 00:26:58,997
here are some red flags.

610
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:01,298
The player says, was that right?

611
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:02,078
Or they say, oh, I solved it.

612
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,399
My players sound like that.

613
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:09,041
Or a player is attempting an impossible action repeatedly

614
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,562
because it's not obviously impossible,

615
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,722
and that's just not a fun experience.

616
00:27:12,722 --> 00:27:16,044
I'm sure most people here who have played tested games

617
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:19,865
have seen this happen.

618
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:23,226
If the solution is ambiguous, it damages the player's trust

619
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:23,647
in the game.

620
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:26,608
And that sucks, and you don't want that to happen.

621
00:27:27,322 --> 00:27:29,582
It makes Toby McGuire pretty sad.

622
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:31,403
So we don't want him crying.

623
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:33,984
So here's an example in the line light.

624
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:34,684
So this one was most,

625
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:38,346
like people ended up playing this through trial and error

626
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:39,126
and it was not fun.

627
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:40,026
Here's why.

628
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:42,347
On the left, people would experiment.

629
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:45,268
They would, so the way to solve the puzzle here

630
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:48,529
is to hit, to find one combination of these two switches.

631
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:49,910
So there's four possible combinations.

632
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,130
Each one can be on or off.

633
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:54,923
And then the player would travel all the way through here.

634
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,644
I intentionally wanted that travel space

635
00:27:57,644 --> 00:27:59,946
because I wanted them to stop and think.

636
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:03,007
I didn't want it to be easy to brute force it.

637
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:06,909
To brute force it, so I added all that extra travel space.

638
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:10,310
And then they would experiment up at the top.

639
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,052
But players still brute forced it anyway on the left,

640
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,012
and they kept going back up top.

641
00:28:14,012 --> 00:28:18,074
And it never was obvious, oh, this isn't the correct state.

642
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:20,535
Yes, I feel like this is right.

643
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:23,059
And now I can execute the solution.

644
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:25,361
It was they just continued to brute force

645
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:26,081
until they got the solution.

646
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:28,503
And that wasn't fun, so I ended up cutting this level

647
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:30,004
and several others like it.

648
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:32,226
Here's another example.

649
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:36,048
So, he dies every time in this GIF.

650
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,469
I hope someday he'll make it.

651
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:39,430
Nope, didn't make it that time.

652
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,992
Maybe the next one now, can we make it?

653
00:28:40,992 --> 00:28:41,632
It's so close.

654
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:41,932
Ah, damn.

655
00:28:41,932 --> 00:28:44,374
All right, okay, so I don't think that's possible to make,

656
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:47,416
but it feels like it might be possible to make.

657
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:48,837
What I did to mitigate that,

658
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:51,860
was I expanded this area here.

659
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,801
This is much taller.

660
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:55,822
And I also made this wider on there,

661
00:28:55,822 --> 00:28:57,343
so it's clearer that you can take refuge.

662
00:28:57,343 --> 00:28:59,585
So players no longer attempted to,

663
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:02,526
so if you see the player come down there,

664
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:05,208
they clearly don't have enough time

665
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,029
to hide in the bottom right line.

666
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,250
So that solved that problem.

667
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,292
So one strategy, as in the previous, is get some water.

668
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:13,813
Again, very fun.

669
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:16,974
Come on, water's fun.

670
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:17,495
You all know it.

671
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:19,916
Ever want water skiing?

672
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:20,376
Yeah, sounds fun.

673
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:23,918
So as a previous example, move elements farther apart.

674
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:25,199
That's a great strategy.

675
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,020
That's super easy.

676
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,901
Got extra stuff, cut extraneous elements.

677
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,321
That's like a theme throughout this talk.

678
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:33,083
If you're working on a platformer,

679
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,704
please make all of your jumps obviously possible

680
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:36,565
or impossible.

681
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:39,706
This is one of my pet peeves.

682
00:29:39,706 --> 00:29:40,287
Yeah.

683
00:29:40,287 --> 00:29:43,108
So I was showing somebody.

684
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:47,352
a platformer that I'm casually working on

685
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:51,035
and realized that I had violated this rule very recently.

686
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:53,317
So this is the puzzle here,

687
00:29:53,317 --> 00:29:56,320
and it's not totally clear if that jump is makeable,

688
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,601
if it's possible to wall kick

689
00:29:57,601 --> 00:29:59,823
and then bounce and get up to there.

690
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:02,105
It is possible if you time it like that.

691
00:30:02,105 --> 00:30:03,947
And this is early in the game,

692
00:30:03,947 --> 00:30:05,948
so the player doesn't have quite enough skill

693
00:30:05,948 --> 00:30:11,513
and confidence to feel secure that

694
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,109
they're doing it right.

695
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:14,550
So the feedback that I got was, I

696
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,991
don't know if I should be doing this because I

697
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:18,812
don't know if it's possible.

698
00:30:18,812 --> 00:30:20,392
And that's just not a good experience.

699
00:30:20,392 --> 00:30:22,453
Because is it a puzzle?

700
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,554
Or am I just not good enough?

701
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:25,995
And not knowing that is not great.

702
00:30:25,995 --> 00:30:28,956
You want the player to know either there's

703
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:30,657
something I don't know yet and I have to figure it out,

704
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:33,958
or I'm just not good enough, but I can get better.

705
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,539
If there's ambiguity in between those two,

706
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,740
the player doesn't know what they need to get better at.

707
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,381
And it's a frustrating, unpleasant experience.

708
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:41,002
So the solution?

709
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:47,620
Click, drag, and now way more obvious that you can make it.

710
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,944
Lesson number six.

711
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,157
Player trust.

712
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:54,218
Players assume inherently that there's

713
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,699
no agility needed in puzzle games.

714
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:58,521
That's sort of the promise that most puzzle games will set up

715
00:30:58,521 --> 00:31:02,585
from the beginning with whatever the game promises

716
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:04,046
in the beginning.

717
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:07,108
But if you break this rule once, every puzzle

718
00:31:07,108 --> 00:31:08,989
maybe requires reflexes in the player's head.

719
00:31:08,989 --> 00:31:11,291
It completely transforms every other puzzle.

720
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,513
This is a lesson that I understood conceptually,

721
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:15,794
but I never really accepted.

722
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:20,438
I never really internalized it to like, yeah.

723
00:31:21,374 --> 00:31:22,175
But now I get it.

724
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:23,838
And it's because it was painful.

725
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:25,921
I didn't want to, but I have since.

726
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:30,149
So Lightning players assume that many puzzles required

727
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:33,595
quick timing or quick reflexes because a few of them did.

728
00:31:35,056 --> 00:31:37,117
So their perception of it was that there were a lot of...

729
00:31:37,117 --> 00:31:38,037
Yeah, so like if...

730
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:41,179
Let's say there's two quick timing puzzles in one section of the game.

731
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:45,421
They might assume that 15 of these levels require quick timing.

732
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:46,141
Which they don't.

733
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:48,963
Like, from my perception, I know what they do and don't require,

734
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:50,343
but the player's perception is different.

735
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:53,825
And the player's perception is all that's real.

736
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:57,126
I'll just repeat that a couple of times.

737
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:57,947
Because that...

738
00:31:57,947 --> 00:31:59,288
Yeah, gotcha.

739
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:01,356
Lesson number seven.

740
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:04,497
This is less of a lesson and more of a pick your preference.

741
00:32:04,497 --> 00:32:07,218
So this is an internal battle that I went through

742
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,819
as I was designing LineLight.

743
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:12,020
So exhaustive design versus fun.

744
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,841
So fun, as we defined at the beginning,

745
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:15,982
is when the player gets to exhibit mastery, skill,

746
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:16,402
or wit.

747
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:17,823
And also, I would actually say this doesn't just

748
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:18,523
apply to puzzle games.

749
00:32:18,523 --> 00:32:22,065
I would say this is just like a broad definition of one

750
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:22,545
type of fun.

751
00:32:22,545 --> 00:32:25,346
Exhaustive design, as I would describe it,

752
00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:26,787
is like there's one of every possible thing.

753
00:32:26,787 --> 00:32:27,667
It's about the system.

754
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:30,008
It's like we've explored all the possible avenues of everything

755
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:30,448
that we can do.

756
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:35,166
But sometimes they're incompatible.

757
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,988
And I struggled with this for a year.

758
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:39,008
This was me back in 2016.

759
00:32:39,008 --> 00:32:41,430
I have since grew my hair back.

760
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,092
I could watch this gif all day.

761
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,733
I love this so much.

762
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:50,475
So Braid and the Witness.

763
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:53,537
So Braid was a big inspiration in Lionlight.

764
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:53,778
And

765
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:58,277
It was very much like in the John Blow design school

766
00:32:58,277 --> 00:32:59,238
of thought.

767
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:02,681
And those games are very firmly about exhaustive design.

768
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,943
And The Witness is especially about exhaustive design

769
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:09,446
to the extreme, frequently to the sacrifice of what

770
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,188
would be considered classically fun,

771
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:13,129
because it's about the system.

772
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:15,391
We're exploring all the possible things about the system.

773
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:19,634
It's much more of an art piece in many parts of the game.

774
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:20,815
Ultimately.

775
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:26,670
Fast forward over a year, I decided what I innately wanted.

776
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,450
I went with player fun.

777
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,011
So this is just to bear in mind that this exists.

778
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:35,132
And sort of decide where you want to,

779
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:36,053
what your priorities are.

780
00:33:36,053 --> 00:33:38,293
Then you could experiment too.

781
00:33:38,293 --> 00:33:40,494
But this existed, and I didn't know

782
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:42,494
that I wasn't allowed, like I didn't

783
00:33:42,494 --> 00:33:45,095
know that I was allowed to go towards one or the other.

784
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:46,276
Because I was just very confused.

785
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:47,216
But I figured out all that.

786
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:47,736
It's all good now.

787
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:52,232
And also what's fun for the designer may not actually be fun for the player and that's

788
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:58,559
Frequently true. Yeah, I made a puzzle game last year and it was kind of fun to work on it was fascinating

789
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,524
It was like really really like some really cool design, but it wasn't fun for the player

790
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:07,888
So I was like, oh geez, I guess I guess these don't always go hand in hand

791
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:10,396
All right, so here's an example.

792
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:12,437
So here are a completely different layouts.

793
00:34:12,437 --> 00:34:15,119
They are so unique, demonstrated by the names

794
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,439
of each of the levels.

795
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:18,461
Completely different names.

796
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:21,122
Tons of diversity here.

797
00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:21,803
Sarcasm.

798
00:34:21,803 --> 00:34:26,325
For me, at the time, they were so different.

799
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:27,286
But it's a pattern.

800
00:34:27,286 --> 00:34:28,747
This was like a series.

801
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:30,028
I was exploring a series of concepts.

802
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,549
I started with one thesis, and I continued building.

803
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:34,951
So in this level, there is a one-way street,

804
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:36,211
which is what it sounds like.

805
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:37,612
And then there's a flip around it.

806
00:34:38,582 --> 00:34:39,923
Once you get on the one-way street,

807
00:34:39,923 --> 00:34:41,323
you're going to hit the flipper.

808
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:43,804
So you need to time getting the lockstep down

809
00:34:43,804 --> 00:34:45,165
to the bottom right.

810
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:48,066
So the solution to do that would be just do it

811
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:48,866
in sync with the lockstep.

812
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:49,466
Boom, perfect.

813
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:49,727
Great.

814
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:51,987
The lockstep goes on its own, and you've solved the puzzle.

815
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:54,909
Next iteration of it, just to make sure

816
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,849
that the player understands what they're doing,

817
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:03,352
I made the street much larger and made the moving

818
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:04,132
street much tinier.

819
00:35:04,996 --> 00:35:05,756
So they really have to know it.

820
00:35:05,756 --> 00:35:08,359
And this is actually an example of,

821
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:10,061
this is technically redundant,

822
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:12,083
but I wanted to reinforce that skill.

823
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,645
Here's another example of it

824
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,507
where I mirror flipped the bottom.

825
00:35:16,507 --> 00:35:17,488
Totally, totally new solution.

826
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:21,913
Here's another one.

827
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:23,454
Oh, this is, oh, no, no, no, this one's great.

828
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,635
This one's really different, I promise.

829
00:35:24,952 --> 00:35:28,054
Yeah, because I truncate the line,

830
00:35:28,054 --> 00:35:30,395
so then you have to think, oh, OK, what would the,

831
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:31,616
oh, it's really, oh, it's super cool.

832
00:35:31,616 --> 00:35:33,577
Oh my gosh, oh, how smart I am.

833
00:35:33,577 --> 00:35:34,958
Oh, no, no, this one, no, no, check this one out.

834
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,240
Yeah, see this, OK, so there's like two of them.

835
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,280
And then, oh, no, no, even better, no, no,

836
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,341
this one's even better.

837
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:41,142
OK, so we've got two of them, but the line is like,

838
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:43,944
oh my gosh, this one, the thing moves so, so super fast,

839
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:44,544
and we keep going.

840
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:47,026
All right, players got tired of the same layout.

841
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:48,107
Long story short.

842
00:35:48,107 --> 00:35:52,229
Even though what I thought was a unique concept.

843
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,458
And the boringness was not obvious to me at the time.

844
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,540
Which is funny, looking back at this I can laugh at it.

845
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,883
Because I'm like, wow, these are boring.

846
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:04,104
But making it, I was like, I'm exhausting the design.

847
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:04,945
Like, what if I do this?

848
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:06,066
What if I do this?

849
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:07,867
Then what would it mean if I changed all these other things?

850
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:09,848
And I'm following that natural, logical progression.

851
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:15,353
But the result of it was not a satisfying experience.

852
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:16,614
And I was confused.

853
00:36:16,614 --> 00:36:19,356
I'm like, hmm, but I thought I followed the rules.

854
00:36:19,356 --> 00:36:21,739
It gave me the design.

855
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:24,621
At that point, it was my choice of what I did with it.

856
00:36:24,621 --> 00:36:29,886
So before and after, I probably should have cut this down to three.

857
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:34,790
People told me to continue cutting it down, and I didn't because I was like, no, but they're so unique.

858
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,733
In the future, yeah, I would probably just hack it down to three even.

859
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:37,853
Yeah.

860
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:41,832
Here's another mechanic that did not make it into line light.

861
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,973
So lock steps, some of them can move faster than you,

862
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:46,234
and some of them are about the same speed.

863
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:48,354
And why not have ones that are slower than you?

864
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:49,895
That would be exploring.

865
00:36:49,895 --> 00:36:54,456
Like, you know, there's ones faster, same speed, slower.

866
00:36:54,456 --> 00:36:55,076
Why not explore it?

867
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:55,797
It was just not fun.

868
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,057
You just ran into the back of them.

869
00:36:57,057 --> 00:36:59,058
They were super unpleasant.

870
00:36:59,058 --> 00:37:01,718
All right, time for a strategy.

871
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:22,395
You didn't know there would be performance dancing in this, huh?

872
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:26,579
That's an excerpt from a song I wrote called Eating Flowers, aptly titled.

873
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,042
I thought that was a funny title.

874
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:32,415
All right, so let's polish this off.

875
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:34,798
Let's bring this home with how I make puzzles.

876
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:36,199
Let's talk about some strategies.

877
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,321
First off, a disclaimer.

878
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,883
These are my methods, and I like games, as I mentioned,

879
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:40,864
with handcrafted puzzles.

880
00:37:40,864 --> 00:37:42,246
I've made all sorts of types of games,

881
00:37:42,246 --> 00:37:46,090
but these strategies apply to games like Lionlight

882
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,292
and other handcrafted stuff.

883
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:51,071
And also, I don't know everything.

884
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:53,953
I'm always learning things.

885
00:37:53,953 --> 00:37:56,735
So this is not like the penultimate collection of,

886
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:59,597
it's not the perfect suite of tools, but it's a lot.

887
00:37:59,597 --> 00:38:02,319
And it worked really well for me with making Limelight.

888
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:04,381
And it took a while for me to develop this toolbox.

889
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,763
So people would ask me,

890
00:38:06,763 --> 00:38:08,584
where'd you come up with this level?

891
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:10,286
And I'd be like, put down the surfboard.

892
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:17,369
First I put down the surfboard, and then I'd say, I didn't.

893
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:19,351
The mechanics did, as unpretentiously as I possibly

894
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:19,851
could.

895
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:21,432
I really do mean this.

896
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,354
The mechanics came up with the levels.

897
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:25,515
My strategy is to create the mechanics.

898
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:26,376
That's my rule.

899
00:38:26,376 --> 00:38:28,837
I will invent them, and program them, implement them,

900
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:32,440
use them together, combine them, and then boom, we got puzzles.

901
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,162
And that's the end of my strategies.

902
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:35,542
Just kidding.

903
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:36,203
We'll unpack it.

904
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:41,740
How do we get the mechanics, you all ask in unison.

905
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,803
Experience, intuition, and luck.

906
00:38:43,803 --> 00:38:48,369
Those would be basically the three things that, yeah.

907
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:51,613
And OK, so I like to create mechanics that are diverse.

908
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,355
So they're very different.

909
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:55,258
They could potentially interact in many ways.

910
00:38:56,227 --> 00:38:59,188
And mechanics that excite you, mechanics that you want to work on.

911
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:00,308
It's like, this is cool.

912
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:07,711
I mean, we're making games, so hopefully at least some of it is exciting for you to work on.

913
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:10,712
Ultimately, cut the duds and don't force it.

914
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:17,094
There were many mechanics in Lionlight that just either were redundant, or they just weren't fun,

915
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:18,715
or I couldn't do enough with them.

916
00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:23,356
Like, they had very, there was only like maybe eight or ten puzzles total I could do with all the mechanics,

917
00:39:23,356 --> 00:39:25,877
and they just atrophied and eventually fizzled out.

918
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:29,392
The more you experiment, the more great stuff you come up with.

919
00:39:29,392 --> 00:39:33,433
One of my philosophies creatively is the more darts you throw, the more bullseyes you'll

920
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:36,034
hit, and that applies, of course, as well to mechanics.

921
00:39:36,034 --> 00:39:37,734
And of course, have fun making games, people.

922
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:44,116
There's a dart board so you can remember the dart analogy easier because when we see pictures,

923
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:46,397
we remember things easier, or so I've been told.

924
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:49,656
This is super boring.

925
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:51,557
So we've got mechanic A, it's red, mechanic B,

926
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:54,177
which is like, I don't know, whatever, orange-ish.

927
00:39:54,177 --> 00:39:55,357
And then it's like, oh, super boring.

928
00:39:55,357 --> 00:39:57,258
But wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, what if we took blue?

929
00:39:57,258 --> 00:39:58,338
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ready, ready?

930
00:39:58,338 --> 00:39:59,238
Blue, and then yellow.

931
00:39:59,238 --> 00:40:00,319
What would happen?

932
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:02,219
And then we get green.

933
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:04,820
This is actually what the experience is like.

934
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,020
I'm curious, raise your hands

935
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,381
if anybody relates to feeling this.

936
00:40:09,381 --> 00:40:10,321
All right, yeah, yeah, you know,

937
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:11,781
when you combine things, you're like, wow,

938
00:40:11,781 --> 00:40:13,301
and you're surprised by it, and it's great.

939
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:13,942
It's very satisfying.

940
00:40:14,508 --> 00:40:19,536
So the more diverse the mechanics are, the more surprising things will happen out of them.

941
00:40:21,232 --> 00:40:24,554
So my goal with this specific type of these puzzle games,

942
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:26,355
like Lionlight, is to have very few mechanics

943
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:27,296
that yield many puzzles.

944
00:40:27,296 --> 00:40:31,299
There are other games that can be just a constant new stream

945
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:34,040
of mechanics, but I like to exhaust the possibilities

946
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,220
first.

947
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,723
So I'll start with just a few and do

948
00:40:37,723 --> 00:40:39,003
as much as I can with them.

949
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,285
And this is easier said than done,

950
00:40:42,285 --> 00:40:43,926
because as I was making Lionlight,

951
00:40:43,926 --> 00:40:44,887
I had these ideas for.

952
00:40:45,707 --> 00:40:49,528
Yeah, like I had programmed these really cool ideas that I could not wait to explore.

953
00:40:49,528 --> 00:40:53,889
I was so excited about exploring them, but I realized, like I knew if I started making

954
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:58,330
levels with them, I was going to shoot off to the moon and I was going to kind of forget.

955
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:04,311
I would not have properly finished the logical sequence of puzzles that preceded them without

956
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:05,132
those new mechanics.

957
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:10,373
Basically, like I need to finish milking this cow before I move on to the next.

958
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:11,073
I like metaphors.

959
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:14,078
And also it's a great sign if you're

960
00:41:14,078 --> 00:41:15,580
surprised by your mechanics.

961
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,823
Like there were moments where I was just

962
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:19,826
like kind of floridist and some of the cool stuff that happened.

963
00:41:19,826 --> 00:41:20,948
And that's always exciting.

964
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:21,969
And that's fun as a developer.

965
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:24,733
It's very fun as a designer.

966
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:25,754
Solution sentences.

967
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:26,776
So this is what I call it.

968
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,979
Other designers have talked about this before.

969
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,773
This is not my original idea, but this is how I implement this strategy.

970
00:41:33,773 --> 00:41:36,575
So Lionlight's best puzzles revolve around a single moment.

971
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:40,079
It's not a series of moments, it is one specific moment.

972
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,421
And my goal in developing each level is to make

973
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:48,186
the simplest possible level of used components with that concept as the solution.

974
00:41:48,186 --> 00:41:49,147
So, here's an example.

975
00:41:49,147 --> 00:41:51,989
The solution sentence is,

976
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:53,831
Use length to get locksteps moving clockwise.

977
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,889
The level I ended up with looks like this.

978
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:03,495
It is basically the simplest possible version of this level.

979
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:08,844
I mean, maybe I could just have two of each, but it works.

980
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:09,545
The solution to this is,

981
00:42:09,545 --> 00:42:10,847
you know, one of those bounce.

982
00:42:11,855 --> 00:42:13,176
because they can bounce on your insides.

983
00:42:13,176 --> 00:42:15,217
Nope, they're moving clockwise, beautiful.

984
00:42:15,217 --> 00:42:17,478
You can pick up the key and head through that door.

985
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:18,498
So my goal was to design a level

986
00:42:18,498 --> 00:42:20,799
that had that moment as the solution.

987
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,600
And this is the solution that I came up with.

988
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,200
The moment that the player gets the lock steps

989
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,561
moving clockwise, that's the aha moment.

990
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:27,102
That's like, oh man, okay, I've solved it.

991
00:42:27,102 --> 00:42:28,642
That's where things click.

992
00:42:28,642 --> 00:42:31,383
And it really, it puts the spotlight

993
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:34,285
on what's important in that level.

994
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:34,405
Yeah.

995
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:38,394
With these solution sentences, elegance is inevitable.

996
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:40,935
This is one thing that I, like you could have told me this

997
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:43,017
and I'd be like, okay, sounds about right.

998
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:44,438
But like experiencing it firsthand,

999
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:51,782
I was just so energized by how easy it is

1000
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:56,005
to get elegant levels out of this relatively easy strategy.

1001
00:42:56,005 --> 00:42:57,866
I never really had to clench to get the stuff.

1002
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,427
And as somebody recently told me,

1003
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:02,228
simplicity is intrinsic to elegance.

1004
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:03,709
And that sounded fancy, so I added it in.

1005
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:08,095
Diversity in layout will happen naturally.

1006
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:12,181
That's another thing that I was quite surprised to discover,

1007
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:16,967
is that the layouts will be completely different

1008
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:18,629
whether or not I wanted them to.

1009
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,371
It just happened naturally, which works out perfectly,

1010
00:43:20,371 --> 00:43:22,093
because that's cool.

1011
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,060
That's good.

1012
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,521
So I like to think of each sentence,

1013
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:26,703
it's sort of like the secret to a magic trick.

1014
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:28,845
Like if a player knows the sentence going in,

1015
00:43:28,845 --> 00:43:30,767
if they knew that for the last example,

1016
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:32,909
if they knew that they had to get the lockstep enemies

1017
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:35,351
moving clockwise, then they could do that

1018
00:43:35,351 --> 00:43:37,973
and then the puzzle would be immediately solved.

1019
00:43:37,973 --> 00:43:39,234
But they don't know that,

1020
00:43:39,234 --> 00:43:41,576
that's the step that they're trying to get to.

1021
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:44,019
That's the secret that they're trying to figure out.

1022
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:46,080
And that's where the aha moment comes in.

1023
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,502
Here's some examples that I have from LimeLight.

1024
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:48,222
You can take pictures.

1025
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:49,383
I'm not gonna go through these, but I had.

1026
00:43:49,746 --> 00:43:53,907
a lot of these. Oh, I have even more. I just, I wrote down so many of these. These were,

1027
00:43:53,907 --> 00:43:58,988
it was just a blast to make a lot of these. Here's a cheat to get extra solution sentences.

1028
00:43:58,988 --> 00:44:03,169
So here, echo with the player with length block flipper. Yeah, so there's a pattern here, I'm sure

1029
00:44:03,169 --> 00:44:10,251
that you're seeing. But each level is still a totally unique challenge, which I was also pretty

1030
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:15,432
surprised about. It's mostly because they're scattered, these five levels are scattered

1031
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:18,493
across the entire game. All five of these levels exist in limelight.

1032
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,361
If these were in sequence, the player would probably

1033
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:22,842
pick up on the pattern that they're

1034
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:27,084
using some enemy of sorts, the length of that enemy,

1035
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:27,785
to block a flipper.

1036
00:44:27,785 --> 00:44:30,906
But they didn't because they're coming into a blind.

1037
00:44:30,906 --> 00:44:32,167
They don't know what the solution could be.

1038
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:33,728
It could be anything.

1039
00:44:33,728 --> 00:44:35,989
So we get five unique, quite interesting levels out of it.

1040
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,914
And astonishingly, a small change in the sentence

1041
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:42,376
resulted in a huge change in the layout,

1042
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:44,098
which is another thing that just blew me away.

1043
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,459
I would not have anticipated that.

1044
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:46,680
And I think especially, actually,

1045
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,503
now that I think about it, it's because each of these,

1046
00:44:50,503 --> 00:44:53,906
the mechanics on the left are diverse enough

1047
00:44:53,906 --> 00:44:56,228
that it's like the butterfly effect,

1048
00:44:56,228 --> 00:44:57,729
like one small change in there ripples out.

1049
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,831
So here are the levels, actually,

1050
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,712
from the previous descriptions.

1051
00:45:01,712 --> 00:45:03,253
The only things that these have in common

1052
00:45:03,253 --> 00:45:05,035
are the moving street, the enemy,

1053
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,516
and somewhere there is length.

1054
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:10,865
Um, uh, yeah, but these are like, they're completely different.

1055
00:45:10,865 --> 00:45:13,408
I would not have anticipated that these levels look so different.

1056
00:45:13,408 --> 00:45:17,331
Um, but these are the simplest versions of the levels that I was able to come up with.

1057
00:45:17,331 --> 00:45:17,371
Um,

1058
00:45:18,355 --> 00:45:19,355
Yeah.

1059
00:45:19,355 --> 00:45:21,016
So how do you get those sentences,

1060
00:45:21,016 --> 00:45:24,018
I hear you spiritually ask, ringing in the air?

1061
00:45:24,018 --> 00:45:26,119
Well, there's a couple of ways.

1062
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:27,500
I like to force the mechanics together.

1063
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,762
Just play it again and see what happens.

1064
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:31,042
I've thought of it before as, it's

1065
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:33,604
like I'll just invite them all to a party and just be like,

1066
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:35,165
hey, what are you guys talking about?

1067
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:35,505
What?

1068
00:45:35,505 --> 00:45:37,486
Oh, wait, have you met my friend, this mechanic?

1069
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:38,707
And then the three of them are talking.

1070
00:45:38,707 --> 00:45:41,169
Like, whoa, you guys are doing cool stuff.

1071
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:42,730
I love metaphors.

1072
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:48,353
This is probably the most of the levels I'd say that came out of Lion Light

1073
00:45:48,353 --> 00:45:52,676
would be when I almost saw something as I'm developing a level maybe or a play

1074
00:45:52,676 --> 00:45:56,299
test or try something and I'm like whoa like that could be a solution that could

1075
00:45:56,299 --> 00:46:00,782
have been a solution. This is something that I can't make happen on its own but

1076
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:04,064
I can certainly prepare for it by just writing down that idea of what I almost

1077
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:08,247
saw happen. That is where so many of Lion Light's levels came out of so just you

1078
00:46:08,247 --> 00:46:09,848
know staying open-minded and keeping your eyes open.

1079
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:11,459
Ask, what if?

1080
00:46:11,459 --> 00:46:12,840
Like, what if I combine these?

1081
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,780
What if I do that?

1082
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,122
That's just a general creative, cool strategy.

1083
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:19,783
Ultimately, my advice on this is don't try too hard.

1084
00:46:19,783 --> 00:46:21,684
Don't clench your muscles too hard.

1085
00:46:21,684 --> 00:46:23,525
We want to let the system do the work for you.

1086
00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:26,146
It's not really supposed to be painful,

1087
00:46:26,146 --> 00:46:28,887
because great puzzles will occur naturally with good mechanics.

1088
00:46:30,543 --> 00:46:32,164
Here's another strategy that I used.

1089
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,026
This is a systematic approach where I basically pitted

1090
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:36,628
each of the mechanics against each other

1091
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:38,749
and pointed at, you know, like,

1092
00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:39,990
what if I combine these two things together?

1093
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,831
What would be interesting?

1094
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,532
This is like sort of a map that just gave me

1095
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:45,915
places to look at if I, to make sure that I had like,

1096
00:46:45,915 --> 00:46:48,517
I wanted to make sure that I was milking all of the,

1097
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:49,818
whatever, like 49 udders of this cow.

1098
00:46:49,818 --> 00:46:51,760
And like, which ones have I missed?

1099
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,821
And which ones are probably fruitful?

1100
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:57,244
It's one of four that are fun.

1101
00:46:57,244 --> 00:46:58,045
We all love cows.

1102
00:46:58,045 --> 00:46:58,685
Cows are great.

1103
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:03,678
I was gonna make a pun, I'm gonna hold it back.

1104
00:47:03,678 --> 00:47:05,360
All right, oh, so story time.

1105
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,425
Let's get a drink of water first.

1106
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:10,266
Water is so much fun.

1107
00:47:10,266 --> 00:47:11,868
That's the real theme of this talk,

1108
00:47:11,868 --> 00:47:12,829
that's the real takeaway.

1109
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:13,210
Just kidding.

1110
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,853
So show of hands, who's heard of the game

1111
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:17,715
Steven's Sausage Roll?

1112
00:47:18,848 --> 00:47:20,589
Oh, OK, actually a decent amount of people.

1113
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:22,851
So I played the game Stephen Saucedral,

1114
00:47:22,851 --> 00:47:24,511
and I was absolutely floored.

1115
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,592
I was blown away, and I was confused

1116
00:47:26,592 --> 00:47:30,054
as to how any human mind could come up

1117
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:34,356
with levels this elegant and this tight and this, like,

1118
00:47:34,356 --> 00:47:39,639
just everything felt like it was accounted for.

1119
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:41,640
I was blown away.

1120
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,761
I can't even put it into words, as you

1121
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:47,563
can see, as to how impressed I was by a lot of the design

1122
00:47:47,563 --> 00:47:47,943
in that game.

1123
00:47:48,697 --> 00:47:52,222
Um, and then fast forward, I'm developing line light and people, uh, you know, I

1124
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:54,565
got people asking me like, how did you come up with this idea for this level?

1125
00:47:54,565 --> 00:47:56,588
Like, how did you come up with this?

1126
00:47:56,588 --> 00:47:59,733
And I'm like, well, it was, what?

1127
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,204
And I had a huge epiphany.

1128
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:03,945
I realized for handmade puzzle games,

1129
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:05,046
nobody's brain is big enough.

1130
00:48:05,046 --> 00:48:09,228
The system the designer created thought the puzzles up.

1131
00:48:09,228 --> 00:48:12,890
So it's not the puzzles in Steve and Sauce Control,

1132
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,632
I am fairly confident, as well as the ones in Lionlight

1133
00:48:15,632 --> 00:48:17,053
and probably most puzzle games.

1134
00:48:17,053 --> 00:48:19,814
The designer is not thinking them up from start to finish.

1135
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:20,815
They're creating the mechanics.

1136
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,676
And the effects of those mechanics,

1137
00:48:22,676 --> 00:48:26,138
the weight of the creation of the puzzles, falls on that.

1138
00:48:26,138 --> 00:48:26,978
And that is not on you.

1139
00:48:26,978 --> 00:48:29,320
And that's great, because it's easier to design them that way.

1140
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:32,217
So I like to think of it this way.

1141
00:48:32,217 --> 00:48:34,018
Designers don't give birth to the puzzles.

1142
00:48:34,018 --> 00:48:35,819
Designers deliver the puzzles.

1143
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:39,641
So you want to be on the right here.

1144
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:41,162
So this is you.

1145
00:48:41,162 --> 00:48:43,923
And this is your game on the left.

1146
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:44,704
Please don't show this to John.

1147
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:49,106
Yeah, so if you find yourself, you're like, oh,

1148
00:48:49,106 --> 00:48:49,946
where's the epidural?

1149
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:53,441
Very poor impression of a pregnant person.

1150
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:57,907
Make sure that you hop out of the bed, clean yourself up,

1151
00:48:57,907 --> 00:49:01,632
put on the scrubs, do your job as a designer,

1152
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:06,698
as the OBGYN designer to deliver those puzzles.

1153
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:09,933
So if solving the puzzle takes, let's say,

1154
00:49:09,933 --> 00:49:11,473
like 75% of a player's working memory,

1155
00:49:11,473 --> 00:49:15,054
like a really tough Steven's sausage roll puzzle,

1156
00:49:15,054 --> 00:49:16,974
my mind, like the perceived difficulty,

1157
00:49:16,974 --> 00:49:18,855
like the perceived working memory required

1158
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,875
to solve that puzzle would be like,

1159
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,416
like just an astronomical amount,

1160
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:26,677
like an inhuman amount of working memory capacity

1161
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:29,077
to account for all of these crazy edge cases

1162
00:49:29,077 --> 00:49:31,738
that are somehow neatly all solved.

1163
00:49:32,398 --> 00:49:35,498
But the actual difficulty in creating each one is much easier.

1164
00:49:35,498 --> 00:49:40,719
You basically show up, sit down, do your job, put things together,

1165
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:42,920
and finesse, etc. etc.

1166
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,940
And it's much easier than I thought it was.

1167
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,620
So that's good news.

1168
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,021
All right, recap. First let's stretch.

1169
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:58,742
Do my favorite activity ever.

1170
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:00,823
I haven't done a spit take yet.

1171
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:01,423
I'm not going to.

1172
00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:02,909
Next year, next year.

1173
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:07,371
Spittig, the GTC talk.

1174
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,831
Recap, all right.

1175
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:10,752
So working memory, it's human RAM.

1176
00:50:10,752 --> 00:50:12,633
And it frees up with experience.

1177
00:50:12,633 --> 00:50:15,634
It sort of looks like this, this metaphorical bar.

1178
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:17,035
It's just an easy way to think about it.

1179
00:50:17,035 --> 00:50:20,016
Again, it's metaphorical, obviously not literal.

1180
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,477
But good zone is sort of keeping the player,

1181
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,438
giving them enough but not too, too much stuff

1182
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,438
to hold to juggle in their brain.

1183
00:50:25,438 --> 00:50:28,380
Like let's say if I ask somebody to memorize, for example,

1184
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:28,680
10 digits.

1185
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:34,673
or like, you know, 6 to 10 digits, hold those in their head while they're solving the puzzle,

1186
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:37,075
it would make the puzzle artificially harder because

1187
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:40,618
their working memory is occupied by that extra task.

1188
00:50:40,618 --> 00:50:45,622
So we've got handcrafted puzzles, handcrafted puzzles versus procedural puzzles.

1189
00:50:45,622 --> 00:50:49,805
The differences being the handcrafted ones, there's a finite number of these puzzles,

1190
00:50:49,805 --> 00:50:51,566
and the solutions are pretty novel, and for the player...

1191
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,717
It's a fresh and varied experience.

1192
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:57,860
On the other hand, procedural puzzles, no novel solutions,

1193
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,302
and it's a very predictable experience.

1194
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:01,924
These are just different types of puzzles.

1195
00:51:01,924 --> 00:51:05,848
And this is the most popular spectrum.

1196
00:51:05,848 --> 00:51:08,350
There are other types of characteristics of puzzles,

1197
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:10,252
but this is the easiest to codify.

1198
00:51:10,252 --> 00:51:13,615
Noise is the most important thing

1199
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:15,117
I want people to take away here.

1200
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:18,565
So noise, again, it occupies players' working memory,

1201
00:51:18,565 --> 00:51:19,827
but it doesn't contribute to the puzzle.

1202
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,212
So if you say what the solution of the puzzle is

1203
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,675
and there's something in the level

1204
00:51:23,675 --> 00:51:24,917
that isn't part of that sentence,

1205
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:27,022
that would be considered noise.

1206
00:51:27,391 --> 00:51:29,611
If you're not mindful, it will pollute your game.

1207
00:51:29,611 --> 00:51:30,411
I've seen so much of this.

1208
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:32,472
And I feel like this is like my public service announcement.

1209
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:34,052
Like, you've got to be the janitor.

1210
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:35,712
Clean up that noise in your games.

1211
00:51:35,712 --> 00:51:38,273
Like, you can use it mindfully.

1212
00:51:38,273 --> 00:51:40,173
You can use it intentionally.

1213
00:51:40,173 --> 00:51:43,614
But if you don't check it, it's going to be there.

1214
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:47,895
And it's going to really be at the detriment

1215
00:51:47,895 --> 00:51:49,995
of the quality of your game.

1216
00:51:49,995 --> 00:51:53,556
So make it your practice to find, identify, and then

1217
00:51:53,556 --> 00:51:54,236
eliminate it.

1218
00:51:55,106 --> 00:51:57,468
And it's okay in moderation. It's not all bad.

1219
00:51:57,468 --> 00:52:00,050
My preference, like I personally sway towards less noise,

1220
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,612
especially after making line light, but noise is totally cool.

1221
00:52:02,612 --> 00:52:06,274
Like, the witness is very heavy in noise and obfuscation.

1222
00:52:06,274 --> 00:52:11,238
That's like, it's one of the main features of the game.

1223
00:52:11,238 --> 00:52:12,779
Recap for my methods to create puzzles.

1224
00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:15,241
Homestretch here.

1225
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:17,062
So, taking mechanics, making the mechanics,

1226
00:52:17,062 --> 00:52:18,223
and then combining them together.

1227
00:52:18,223 --> 00:52:20,305
You could do it systematically, like in that spreadsheet,

1228
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:22,567
or organically, like when you see, you know,

1229
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:24,948
something about to happen, or...

1230
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:26,851
et cetera.

1231
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:28,732
Good mechanics will lead to great puzzles,

1232
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:30,153
like garbage in, garbage out, that whole sort of thing.

1233
00:52:30,153 --> 00:52:33,374
And if you're finding that you're not getting great puzzles,

1234
00:52:33,374 --> 00:52:35,075
just keep making new mechanics.

1235
00:52:35,075 --> 00:52:37,416
Practice is what we're doing.

1236
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:38,277
You've got to get better at it.

1237
00:52:38,277 --> 00:52:41,118
And the system births the puzzles.

1238
00:52:41,118 --> 00:52:43,199
The designer delivers them.

1239
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:46,901
So remember, make sure you've got your scrubs on.

1240
00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:48,802
I'm just picturing myself wearing scrubs,

1241
00:52:48,802 --> 00:52:50,083
sitting down to work.

1242
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,523
That's too much.

1243
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:55,519
All right, and have fun, because what are we making here?

1244
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:56,459
We're making games.

1245
00:52:56,459 --> 00:52:58,881
Games are supposed to be fun for the most part.

1246
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:01,804
So yeah, you're going to enjoy yourself.

1247
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:04,806
Thinking fast and slow was a big inspiration for this talk.

1248
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,947
I got a lot of concepts from it.

1249
00:53:05,947 --> 00:53:08,189
And also, another inspiration, every puzzle game

1250
00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:10,350
I've ever played.

1251
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:13,152
Yeah, and that's my talk.

1252
00:53:13,152 --> 00:53:13,593
Thank you.

1253
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,730
You can find these slides online at the link provided below.

1254
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:31,171
So I think we've got time for a couple of questions.

1255
00:53:31,171 --> 00:53:32,232
I've got six minutes.

1256
00:53:32,232 --> 00:53:34,372
All right, so I've got two microphones.

1257
00:53:34,372 --> 00:53:34,912
They hit me.

1258
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:37,493
Anybody wondering things?

1259
00:53:37,493 --> 00:53:42,794
Until somebody asks, I'm just going

1260
00:53:42,794 --> 00:53:46,375
to do my favorite activity.

1261
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:46,815
A question.

1262
00:53:46,815 --> 00:53:47,795
Yes, question.

1263
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:48,395
Hi, Brad.

1264
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,475
I loved your talk.

1265
00:53:49,816 --> 00:53:51,197
Thanks, Heather.

1266
00:53:51,197 --> 00:53:51,997
You're fabulous.

1267
00:53:51,997 --> 00:53:54,678
How do you decide, when you're looking

1268
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:57,839
at all the combinations of mechanics, which ones are

1269
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,420
going to be filler and which ones are

1270
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,061
going to be the ones you keep?

1271
00:54:01,061 --> 00:54:02,321
What do you mean by filler?

1272
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:04,802
Like levels that you're going to throw out,

1273
00:54:04,802 --> 00:54:07,323
because there's too many of them.

1274
00:54:07,323 --> 00:54:09,124
It's only after I've created enough of them.

1275
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:11,845
The beginning process of making LineLight, I didn't know,

1276
00:54:11,845 --> 00:54:14,086
and I didn't have enough content, really,

1277
00:54:14,086 --> 00:54:16,367
to have an educated decision as to what was good enough.

1278
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:18,008
As I made LineLight, I

1279
00:54:18,462 --> 00:54:21,043
I think this might answer your question.

1280
00:54:21,043 --> 00:54:22,143
Let me know if it does.

1281
00:54:22,143 --> 00:54:24,323
As I made Lion Light, I was constantly ripping out

1282
00:54:24,323 --> 00:54:26,204
the bottom 30%, like the worst 30% of levels.

1283
00:54:26,204 --> 00:54:28,624
Once I had a level that was better than the top 60%,

1284
00:54:28,624 --> 00:54:30,404
whatever, it would go in there

1285
00:54:30,404 --> 00:54:32,665
and then another one would get cut.

1286
00:54:32,665 --> 00:54:34,385
It was a very organic way.

1287
00:54:34,385 --> 00:54:36,025
I didn't do this, it was not a one for one trade.

1288
00:54:36,025 --> 00:54:38,046
But I would go through it and I'm like,

1289
00:54:38,046 --> 00:54:39,446
yeah, this one's not good enough anymore.

1290
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,646
The puzzles that I have now are better.

1291
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:42,726
Does that sort of answer?

1292
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:45,767
Did you base it on player response

1293
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:47,707
or your own opinions of whether or not it's fun?

1294
00:54:48,068 --> 00:54:54,407
There are a ton of reasons and it's totally subjective depending on the experience that you want to get across.

1295
00:54:56,195 --> 00:54:58,296
It totally depended through context.

1296
00:54:58,296 --> 00:54:59,617
There was redundancy.

1297
00:54:59,617 --> 00:55:02,079
There was, yeah, I'd say for the most part,

1298
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,399
it was redundancy.

1299
00:55:03,399 --> 00:55:06,501
And the fact, I think most of the levels that I removed

1300
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:08,223
didn't revolve around one moment.

1301
00:55:08,223 --> 00:55:11,024
They were, like the player would kind of

1302
00:55:11,024 --> 00:55:12,265
chip away at the solution,

1303
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:13,366
and it just wasn't satisfying.

1304
00:55:13,366 --> 00:55:14,667
It wasn't a satisfying experience.

1305
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:16,508
And the most satisfying ones revolve around

1306
00:55:16,508 --> 00:55:17,208
that single moment.

1307
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,089
The ones I ended up cutting,

1308
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:20,731
most of them shared that characteristic.

1309
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:22,672
Thank you, great answer.

1310
00:55:22,672 --> 00:55:23,753
Great question.

1311
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:26,963
Yeah, let's go.

1312
00:55:26,963 --> 00:55:33,328
So you mentioned the exhaustive versus fun approach to mechanic exploration.

1313
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:39,293
And so at what point did you see that your mechanics were just kind of bloating?

1314
00:55:39,293 --> 00:55:41,054
Or when was the cutoff point?

1315
00:55:41,054 --> 00:55:43,616
Because there's always room for more mechanics.

1316
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:45,218
There's always room for more fun, quote unquote.

1317
00:55:45,419 --> 00:55:47,000
When did I stop adding mechanics?

1318
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,580
Yeah, like when was that trigger point hit?

1319
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,581
There was a, yeah, that's a great question.

1320
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,961
There was a moment where I was like, this is it.

1321
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:53,801
This is the final mechanic.

1322
00:55:53,801 --> 00:55:55,582
I need to finish the game.

1323
00:55:55,582 --> 00:55:57,763
It was entirely about, like if I had another mechanic,

1324
00:55:57,763 --> 00:55:59,963
I am like, the end is not gonna be in sight.

1325
00:55:59,963 --> 00:56:02,724
I said, okay, it's painful because I have so many ideas

1326
00:56:02,724 --> 00:56:03,584
that I wanna add.

1327
00:56:03,584 --> 00:56:07,105
There were, I had a, I did end up prototyping a couple,

1328
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:09,186
but mindfully knowing that I was not allowed

1329
00:56:09,186 --> 00:56:10,906
to put them into the game,

1330
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:12,667
which is maybe kind of playing with dangerous waters.

1331
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:14,027
Cause what if they were really cool?

1332
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:16,574
And some of them were.

1333
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:20,118
But it was entirely about, I need to finish this game.

1334
00:56:20,118 --> 00:56:22,460
And I'm going to set myself a specific deadline

1335
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,602
as to when to finish it.

1336
00:56:23,602 --> 00:56:24,803
And if I add any more mechanics, I

1337
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:27,206
will not be able to hit that deadline.

1338
00:56:27,206 --> 00:56:28,047
Thank you.

1339
00:56:29,564 --> 00:56:32,625
I'm curious at what point in the design process

1340
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:35,146
you decided to go with three or four platforms instead

1341
00:56:35,146 --> 00:56:38,066
of just one, because one of the big issues we're

1342
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:39,967
having in my business is that we designed

1343
00:56:39,967 --> 00:56:41,587
these puzzles in mini games.

1344
00:56:41,587 --> 00:56:44,508
And we gave it to the designers and said, OK, ignore platform,

1345
00:56:44,508 --> 00:56:45,708
come up with how you want to play it.

1346
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:47,369
And this is kind of the framework.

1347
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:49,590
And one came back with exclusively mobile style

1348
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:53,010
controls, and one came back with exclusively PC-based controls.

1349
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,571
And we couldn't put them back together.

1350
00:56:55,019 --> 00:56:56,460
Was this two different teams working

1351
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,143
on the same types of puzzles, or was two types of puzzles?

1352
00:56:59,143 --> 00:56:59,523
Exactly.

1353
00:56:59,523 --> 00:57:01,625
We said, here's the framework.

1354
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,226
Ignore what console we're going to put it on.

1355
00:57:03,226 --> 00:57:05,968
What do you think will be the most fun solution for this,

1356
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:06,689
or control scheme?

1357
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,070
So I'm just curious how you decided

1358
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:10,692
that we're going to go for three platforms where

1359
00:57:10,692 --> 00:57:12,934
you need to come up with similar controls.

1360
00:57:13,328 --> 00:57:17,470
Yeah, so in my experience, it was originally intended,

1361
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:21,052
I made Line Light for console and for Steam.

1362
00:57:21,052 --> 00:57:23,613
And I released it in January 2017 for console and Steam.

1363
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:24,753
And it's controller recommended,

1364
00:57:24,753 --> 00:57:27,974
because it's much more fun to play with a joystick.

1365
00:57:27,974 --> 00:57:29,615
Enough people kept telling me,

1366
00:57:29,615 --> 00:57:30,836
this should be a mobile game.

1367
00:57:30,836 --> 00:57:32,476
It's not a mobile game.

1368
00:57:32,476 --> 00:57:33,057
I'm like,

1369
00:57:34,056 --> 00:57:36,178
whatever designer in me is like, no, it's not a mobile game.

1370
00:57:36,178 --> 00:57:38,520
Eventually I listened to people and I'm like,

1371
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,921
okay, fine, I'll make it a mobile game.

1372
00:57:39,921 --> 00:57:44,725
And then I added very intelligent virtual joystick controls

1373
00:57:44,725 --> 00:57:47,247
to translate the experience to mobile.

1374
00:57:47,247 --> 00:57:48,869
And I also reworked the entire game.

1375
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:50,830
It took me about six months reforming it,

1376
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,232
all the levels and the feel and the timing and everything

1377
00:57:53,232 --> 00:57:57,055
to make it feel like a natural fit for mobile.

1378
00:57:57,055 --> 00:57:59,297
Does that answer your question directly?

1379
00:57:59,297 --> 00:57:59,537
Oh, it does.

1380
00:57:59,537 --> 00:58:00,078
Excellent.

1381
00:58:01,495 --> 00:58:06,741
So I know this was more about the not procedural side of puzzles, but I was wondering if your approach...

1382
00:58:06,741 --> 00:58:12,227
You said you made both types. I'm wondering if your approach to designing puzzles would change if you wanted a more procedural-based puzzle.

1383
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:17,153
Like if you wanted to be able to generate them, would you still go with mechanics?

1384
00:58:17,153 --> 00:58:19,776
The procedural games that I've worked on...

1385
00:58:22,677 --> 00:58:25,060
Not a comprehensive view of all the types of procedural games

1386
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,540
there could be.

1387
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,503
The ones that I've worked on specifically

1388
00:58:28,503 --> 00:58:30,145
revolve around very, very few mechanics, maybe

1389
00:58:30,145 --> 00:58:34,490
like two or three mechanics at any given time.

1390
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:35,771
I don't know if that's 100% true.

1391
00:58:37,397 --> 00:58:38,938
Can you rephrase that question so I understand?

1392
00:58:38,938 --> 00:58:42,399
I suppose it's just if you were to make a procedural game now,

1393
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:45,400
if you decided you wanted something that you could procedurally generate puzzles,

1394
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,221
like, how would you approach it as opposed to how you approach this?

1395
00:58:48,221 --> 00:58:51,722
Like, would you still try and create mechanics and trial a few

1396
00:58:51,722 --> 00:58:57,103
and then see if you can generate levels or would you try something else?

1397
00:58:57,103 --> 00:58:59,744
That's a good question. If I were to do it today,

1398
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:03,465
which I have done, like, I mean, I made a new one like a month or two ago,

1399
00:59:05,017 --> 00:59:08,197
Each one is its own completely independent idea.

1400
00:59:08,197 --> 00:59:10,478
Because it is procedural.

1401
00:59:10,478 --> 00:59:12,718
If the core mechanic of it doesn't work,

1402
00:59:12,718 --> 00:59:16,179
so let's say one is it's a path drawing.

1403
00:59:16,179 --> 00:59:19,159
If that itself isn't fun, then I will scrap the idea.

1404
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:20,099
I'll move on to something else.

1405
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:22,620
But that's the core of it, of the way

1406
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,660
that you interact with the game.

1407
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,261
From there, if it's working, then I'll

1408
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:30,881
consider adding components and mechanics on top of it.

1409
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:33,542
But your question is, how would I consider

1410
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:34,722
combining mechanics together?

1411
00:59:34,987 --> 00:59:38,733
Yeah, it's just sort of if you wanted something that you could procedurally generate puzzles,

1412
00:59:38,733 --> 00:59:42,700
like would you take the same approach of like having very few mechanics and just seeing if

1413
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:46,107
you could procedurally generate interesting levels out of them or would you try and make

1414
00:59:46,107 --> 00:59:47,830
more mechanics or try something completely different?

1415
00:59:47,937 --> 00:59:50,659
There are two main ways that I could see to do it.

1416
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:55,263
The Witness does it in a specific way, which is in each level is dedicated to one specific concept.

1417
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:58,206
The other way is much more mobile market friendly,

1418
00:59:58,206 --> 01:00:00,988
where it's like that's how most of the casual games on the market are,

1419
01:00:00,988 --> 01:00:02,169
which is it doesn't matter.

1420
01:00:02,169 --> 01:00:04,491
Like there's very few mechanics and it's extremely repetitive.

1421
01:00:04,491 --> 01:00:06,473
And these games are pretty successful.

1422
01:00:06,473 --> 01:00:11,677
So I've been, I mean, it's interesting because I've been learning about

1423
01:00:11,677 --> 01:00:14,459
Sleight of Mane, either one of these.

1424
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,351
I don't have a definitive answer,

1425
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:21,372
because I'm still experimenting with it,

1426
01:00:21,372 --> 01:00:24,453
but I'd say, as advice, just try it out.

1427
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:26,874
Like, what I do is I just, I'll try out

1428
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,896
tons of random different ideas, like little things,

1429
01:00:29,896 --> 01:00:30,896
and if the prototype works out,

1430
01:00:30,896 --> 01:00:33,817
then I'll continue unpacking it.

1431
01:00:33,817 --> 01:00:36,779
I have not made a game that is both procedural

1432
01:00:36,779 --> 01:00:37,519
and is heavy on mechanics.

1433
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:39,300
Cool, thanks very much.

1434
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,700
All right, that's it.

1435
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,642
If anybody wants to talk to me after, I'll be around.

1436
01:00:43,642 --> 01:00:44,942
Okay, thank you.
