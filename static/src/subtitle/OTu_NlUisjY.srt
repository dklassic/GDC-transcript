00:00:09,695 --> 00:00:11,856
Hello everyone and welcome to my talk,

2
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:14,257
Adapting, Working in Games to Chronic Illness.

3
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:18,379
So as you might've read in the session's description,

4
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:19,859
according to the CDC,

5
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,001
six in 10 adults in the U.S. have chronic disease

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,342
and four in 10 adults in the U.S.

7
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,122
have two or more chronic diseases.

8
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:30,084
Because of these rather large ratios,

9
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:32,525
you'll most likely encounter many people

10
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:34,706
living with one or more chronic illness,

11
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:36,627
both inside and outside of work.

12
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:38,868
So you might be thinking.

13
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:44,434
Why is it important to talk about working with chronic illness inside of the game development umbrella?

14
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:50,116
Well, as we sort of all know, working in games can be quite stressful at times,

15
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:56,539
and when you add this on top of dealing with health issues, things can sometimes get a bit dicey.

16
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,901
Especially if you aren't sure how to handle being chronically ill or working with someone who is,

17
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:06,663
while also being super busy or stressed at work.

18
00:01:07,582 --> 00:01:10,043
This can sometimes lead to unwanted conflicts.

19
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:15,324
Today, I hope to give you some ideas of what a person with chronic illness

20
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:19,905
will be going through on a daily basis, along with some ways that people

21
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:23,226
with chronic illness might help make their quality of life a bit better.

22
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:27,526
In addition to all this, I believe that it's important that we have folks

23
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:31,407
with chronic illness and disabilities working in game development.

24
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:35,808
We're making games that will be played by a wide variety of different people

25
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:36,508
and

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:47,364
In order to create the best, most encompassing experiences, we need the best, most diverse group of folks making our games, gaming systems, tools, and hardware.

27
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:59,789
So my name is Victoria Dorn. I've been diagnosed with lupus since my freshman year in college. Kind of weird to say that is the first thing when introducing oneself, but

28
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,850
feels like the right crowd.

29
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:07,954
I'm also a software engineer working on the system side of the PlayStation system, mostly

30
00:02:08,134 --> 00:02:09,114
dealing with audio.

31
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:15,297
For this talk, I wanted to share a bit of my own experiences on working in games with

32
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:15,958
chronic illness.

33
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:20,319
I've sort of debated on giving this talk for a few years now, and I wasn't really sure

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,582
if the information would be useful or even wanted, but this year I decided it was time.

35
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:31,064
So hopefully you all will gain a bit more knowledge of what it's like to work with chronic

36
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:31,444
illness.

37
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:31,865
And

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,102
Maybe be able to help out your fellow co-workers with the subject if ever needed, even in small

39
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:37,342
ways.

40
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:40,803
So the agenda for today.

41
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:43,163
We'll be talking about three main topics.

42
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:46,524
The first is letting the cat out of the bag, or not.

43
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:50,645
Should you tell those you work with that you have chronic illness?

44
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:55,307
Next we'll talk a bit about the work life of a person with chronic illness.

45
00:02:55,947 --> 00:03:00,628
What are some things that they have to do differently and how can non-chronically ill

46
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:01,428
folks help?

47
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:02,643
Most effectively.

48
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:07,925
Finally, we'll be talking a bit about finding support, both inside and outside of work,

49
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:09,146
along with providing support.

50
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:16,028
So quick disclaimer, I'm not a doctor, and I'm not trying to give any sort of medically

51
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:16,809
related advice.

52
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:22,631
I don't know the answers to all situations, and in addition to that, most situations aren't

53
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:23,872
one size fits all.

54
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:29,954
Things will differ with different workplaces or working situations, along with any given

55
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:31,615
chronic illness or disability.

56
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:36,159
Today I'll be speaking mostly on my own personal situations

57
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
and the situations of folks that I know.

58
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,141
So let's begin.

59
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:44,522
So letting the cat out of the bag, do you

60
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:48,163
let the folks who you work with know about your chronic illness

61
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:48,943
or disability?

62
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:50,763
Quick story time on this.

63
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,644
So when I first started in the gaming industry,

64
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:56,585
I started as an intern turned contractor.

65
00:03:56,605 --> 00:04:00,046
I didn't really have a lot of symptoms of my health issues

66
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:00,546
at the time.

67
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:07,737
Maybe some basic fatigue, some pain here and there, but nothing too bad, or at least I thought.

68
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:11,858
I always kind of thought my health condition wouldn't ever get too severe.

69
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:18,199
So I've also felt very junior on my team. The folks I worked with had been in the industry for

70
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:25,081
quite a long time, five, ten plus years, right? I really wanted to show that I was a hard worker

71
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:27,462
and that I could handle anything that was thrown my way.

72
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:30,333
My team is a great team, still on this team.

73
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:31,493
They're awesome, shout out.

74
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:34,755
And I really wanted to be offered a full-time position

75
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:35,975
on this team at some point.

76
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:40,076
I felt that maybe if I told the folks that I worked with

77
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:43,318
about my health condition, they could potentially

78
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:47,119
maybe treat me differently in some subtle or small way.

79
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,240
In addition to this, would I be able to give the impression

80
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,721
that I wanted to give to my co-workers and boss

81
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:55,862
if I told them that my health was a bit flawed?

82
00:04:57,173 --> 00:05:01,794
I really didn't want to be thought of as a less capable person, because usually I am

83
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,815
just as capable as anyone else.

84
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:08,037
I just had some bad days, or maybe some bad patches sometimes.

85
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:14,919
And I really thought about telling folks, especially on bad days, of course, and I always

86
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,600
decided against it, and this, of course, happened many times.

87
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:31,708
So the biggest portion of my hesitation to talk with folks about my condition sort of revolved around the question of how comfortable I felt talking with my coworkers or managers about the topic.

88
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:44,219
And to just kind of talk about gauging comfort levels, you can kind of think about how nervous or relaxed, you might feel when talking about talking with a particular person about a certain topic.

89
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,963
You can do things like trying to run through the conversation with this particular person.

90
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:52,802
In your head and kind of see how you feel and where you kind of land.

91
00:05:54,083 --> 00:06:03,971
When you begin to talk with a given person about your illness you're letting someone know that you're different in some way, and this can potentially lead to lots of unconscious bias.

92
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:12,619
In my case, I wanted to make sure that folks used my health is health information with care and I didn't really want them running off telling everyone.

93
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:18,103
I also didn't want folks to feel sorry for me or look down upon me because my health.

94
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:24,244
of my health condition. I really didn't want folks to think that I was just complaining

95
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:30,008
because my illness itself is quite invisible, at least just passing glance.

96
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:34,230
Generally, if you look at me, I don't really look like I have

97
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,753
any sort of major health conditions, and I didn't want my telling folks

98
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,215
that I have a health condition just feel like a complaint.

99
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,228
So another big question that you might also want to consider,

100
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:51,429
and maybe even more so than the other questions I'll talk about,

101
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,270
is are there things that folks you work with can do

102
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:58,431
to make your work life easier or better or more efficient?

103
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:01,652
If yes, then you should let folks know

104
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:03,173
if you're at least somewhat comfortable.

105
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:07,754
I've generally found folks I work with to be very willing

106
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,615
to help make my working conditions

107
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:12,576
more suitable to my current health state.

108
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:19,210
And we'll talk a bit more about this and some of the potential adjustments to your work life in the next section.

109
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:31,114
So during my struggle with deciding whether or not I should tell folks about my health condition, I got this really rough case of arthritis in my hands and elbows and pretty much all my joints.

110
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:38,336
This sort of flared up after like a really busy week and sinus infection, the kind of the perfect storm type scenario.

111
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:41,177
And since I hadn't really talked with my

112
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:44,710
I'm not going to talk to my boss or many of my coworkers about my health issues yet.

113
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:55,379
I had to suddenly find some time and a good chunk of mental capacity to talk with my boss about it, which kind of brings us to the next thought or question.

114
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:59,883
Could it be necessary to inform folks you work with at some point?

115
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:06,369
Does your health condition potentially fluctuate to where you might need additional assistance or work adjustments?

116
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:12,039
might be better to inform folks before you hit this rough patch.

117
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,224
This can lead to a bit less stress when you need to suddenly let folks know

118
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:20,947
that you need to change something at work or even take time off

119
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,889
because you aren't feeling or doing well.

120
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,714
For me, I personally felt like I waited too long to talk about my health condition

121
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,396
with my co-workers and boss.

122
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,779
I don't know if I would recommend waiting until you're really down.

123
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:39,766
health-wise before letting folks know that you have some health problems that might potentially

124
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:46,227
affect you in a negative way. It's mentally very hard on a person to tell someone that you have

125
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:53,248
health issues when you really don't feel well. And if you can avoid this scenario, I would suggest

126
00:08:53,288 --> 00:09:00,670
doing so if at all possible. In hindsight, I think that if I would have told folks about

127
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,230
my health condition at an earlier date,

128
00:09:03,697 --> 00:09:09,079
I could have avoided some of the stress around telling folks about my health condition when I really wasn't feeling well.

129
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:18,102
My co-workers could have also helped me come up with some workplace adjustments to help alleviate some of the symptoms that I was having sooner as well.

130
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:25,725
Ultimately, though, with all health related topics, this can really depend on your exact scenario.

131
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:30,007
Different workplaces can affect your decision to let folks know.

132
00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:35,506
along with how long you might have been working in a given company or even how senior or junior

133
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:43,108
you feel. In the end, you have to really do what's best for you and your health, if at all possible.

134
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,810
So, what happens if a coworker lets you know that they have a chronic illness or disability?

135
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,310
What are some things you can do to help?

136
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:03,602
So first, when someone confides in you about their health condition, the first thing you want to do is acknowledge it.

137
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:11,444
Let them know that you're there to support them if and when needed. If you can, assure them that you'll treat this information with care.

138
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:24,748
For example, not kind of treat them any differently than you would have before you knew the information. And you can always let the person know to sort of check you on this as well, too. You can let the person with chronic illness

139
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:31,198
Let you know if you're treating them in any sort of different way at any given point.

140
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:41,020
Next, ask. Maybe ask a couple of questions if you or they feel comfortable. Things like,

141
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,301
how does your illness affect your work life? Or are there things that you,

142
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:51,182
the non-chronically ill person, can do to make their work life better or easier?

143
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:55,215
Potentially even do some research on the topic as well, too.

144
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:02,217
You have to be a bit careful here because sometimes online resources are not always as accurate as they should be.

145
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:10,619
In addition to this, folks with a given illness don't necessarily like explaining their condition over and over again. So if you can

146
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:18,860
try to ask your questions once and remember the answers or maybe keep track of them somehow so you don't have to ask them over and over again.

147
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,582
Finally, assist, if they request.

148
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:27,783
Some folks might be okay with asking for

149
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:30,564
or receiving assistance, others might not.

150
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:32,984
Try to be mindful of what works best

151
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,665
for your coworkers with chronic illness.

152
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,746
In addition to this, as I said previously,

153
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:40,866
asking a chronically ill person how they feel

154
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,947
over and over again is maybe not always

155
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,548
the best way to go about this.

156
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:48,508
And again, this sort of depends on the relationship

157
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:49,889
you've built with a given person.

158
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,369
If they know that you're being sincere.

159
00:11:51,873 --> 00:12:00,055
Then maybe this is okay. But yeah, as with a lot of the other things I've said, it kind of depends on the given person and the given scenario that you have.

160
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:15,040
Generally, though, if I'm not feeling well on a given day, I will confide in the people that I know are okay to sort of combine this information and then I will let them know, right. If I'm not feeling well one day, I will probably just tell you, right.

161
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,822
And in addition to this, try to be mindful that if someone does tell you they don't feel well on a given day,

162
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:24,113
They're not really just complaining to complain, right?

163
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:28,715
Just keep in mind that some days folks with chronic illness just really don't feel well

164
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:30,515
and this is unfortunately a feature.

165
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:36,218
Next the work life of a person with chronic illness.

166
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:41,820
So there are a lot of different things that might affect the work life of a person with

167
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,500
chronic illness.

168
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:47,544
Since there are so many and this talk is only about 30 minutes, I'm just going to talk about

169
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:52,086
a few things that I have dealt with personally and that I believe will apply to the most

170
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:52,426
folks.

171
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:57,428
First, we'll talk about more doctor's appointments, and then we'll talk a little bit about the

172
00:12:57,468 --> 00:13:02,310
work environment adjustments I mentioned earlier, and finally we'll talk a bit about varying

173
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,031
energy levels.

174
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:06,452
So doctor's appointments.

175
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:18,641
This might sound like a bit of a no-brainer to some, but folks with chronic illness or disabilities usually have to go to the doctor more often than normal.

176
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:32,214
I believe that it's a good idea, as the person with chronic illness, if you can, to set expectations about having to attend doctor's appointments, potentially with your direct manager, early on if possible.

177
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:43,210
And if you don't feel comfortable telling them why you have to go to the doctor more often than normal, I found that most managers won't really pressure you for a why.

178
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:49,752
And maybe if they do ask, you can either let them know or just say you'd rather not say right now.

179
00:13:52,513 --> 00:14:02,615
Doctors appointments are also almost always during working hours, especially visits with specialists, which is usually the people folks with chronic illness and disabilities have to visit.

180
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:13,562
This means that some days they might, the folks with chronic illness on your team, might need to leave early or arrive late or even work from home to attend these appointments most efficiently.

181
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:21,823
Just some quick tips from my own personal experience about scheduling doctor's appointments during the work day or before or after. I

182
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:26,764
usually try, if possible, to schedule my doctor's appointments at the beginning or the end of the day.

183
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:31,925
And this can reduce the amount of time that you need to take off from work or

184
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,109
Or, you know, meeting schedules and things like that.

185
00:14:37,049 --> 00:15:01,265
In addition to that, if there aren't really appointments available during those times, like if you need to make kind of more of a last minute doctor's appointment, I usually try to work from home on that day. And that might be a good option as well. So if you have an appointment on in the middle of the day, it's sometimes a bit stressful to have to drive from your house to work and then from work to the doctor and then back to work.

186
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,960
So to try to kind of reduce some of that stress load,

187
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,321
I think it's a good idea to try to work from home

188
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:09,202
because doctor's appointments can be stressful.

189
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,123
So my final tip for folks who are working

190
00:15:16,163 --> 00:15:17,784
with chronic illness is if you can,

191
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:20,925
try to keep your manager up to date with your appointments,

192
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:24,606
just to kind of set expectations once again.

193
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:27,306
For myself, I like to try to put them

194
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:28,967
into my work calendar if possible,

195
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:30,247
especially with travel time.

196
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:34,895
And I usually send an email to my manager so that they can kind of flag it.

197
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:45,684
And then the day before, I'll usually send an instant message or something like that to my manager to say, hey, by the way, I'll be gone for, you know, this set of time during the day.

198
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:50,087
And sometimes let my team know as well if it might be a time in which they need to contact me.

199
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,852
So work environment adjustments, depending on.

200
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:07,106
The given chronic illness or disability, there may be a number of different work environment adjustments needed for a given person to do their job as efficiently and productively as possible.

201
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:21,618
Sometimes without adjustments working can become very difficult or impossible, which can lead to a lot of terrible things like becoming disengaged or even leaving a job and we don't want any of these things if possible.

202
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:31,163
Sometimes figuring out the correct adjustments for a given person might require some, or even a lot, of trial and error.

203
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:38,730
As a manager or co-worker, it's important to be open-minded about trying out some of these adjustments for a given person.

204
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:45,916
If these adjustments really help their work life, then they'll be much happier and they'll perform better, which is what we do want.

205
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:54,204
It's also important to not think of these adjustments as treating the person better than other folks on your team.

206
00:16:55,165 --> 00:17:02,150
These adjustments are just trying to give the person a better shot at working in an equal environment as your other co-workers or reports.

207
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:17,240
So a few quick examples that I've encountered myself are first off time of day adjustments for things like meetings or working hours, late meetings and or early meetings.

208
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,764
Sometimes at the same time, can be quite difficult for folks whose health issues cause them to need extra sleep.

209
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:32,268
Working long hours can also be very difficult on folks with certain health conditions, meaning they need to leave at a reasonable hour most work days.

210
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:39,732
It's important to stress that it's okay if folks need to leave at a reasonable hour, especially if they've already worked their eight hours.

211
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:45,896
Another area that might require some work adjustments involves ergonomics.

212
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:55,336
So small things like changing a desk or chair, keyboard and mouse, can greatly improve the comfort level of folks with some health conditions.

213
00:17:55,977 --> 00:18:00,160
And these are usually fairly easy fixes, though they might take some trial and error.

214
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:10,649
So for example, a few summers ago when I was having the arthritis flare up, I was running into a lot of problems working at a keyboard and mouse all day.

215
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:13,712
Because I'm a software engineer and that's kind of what I do.

216
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:21,692
The first thing my manager suggested was trying to switch out my keyboard and mouse for like a new setup, maybe more ergonomic setup.

217
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:30,317
I talked to some of my friends in IT and I talked to a few co-workers to try to see if they had any ideas or if they had any

218
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:41,903
any ergonomic setups that I could borrow and they did. So I borrowed some keyboards and some mice and I tried them out and after about a week or two, I was able to come up with a solution that

219
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:47,586
Helped alleviate a lot of the pain I was having in my hands and especially my wrists.

220
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:54,269
So, yeah, I was very grateful of the help that they provided because I think I,

221
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:59,190
I might have been not very comfortable for a while if I had not found some adjustments.

222
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:05,592
So, again, there's so many different adjustments that can be necessary for different chronic illnesses or disabilities,

223
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:11,434
and it's best, if possible, to talk through options and find the best solution to each problem.

224
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:21,654
Something, something out of manna. So energy levels may vary. Something I personally experience

225
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:27,655
with my chronic illness is a wide array of varying energy levels. Sometimes constantly low,

226
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:34,237
sometimes waves. So this is fairly common with other chronic illnesses or disabilities,

227
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:41,259
including depression. It's very, depression itself is a chronic illness, right? And

228
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,000
depression can also be caused by not feeling well.

229
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:55,373
So as a coworker, it's important to realize that these low energy days are most likely going to happen and to sort of help your coworkers with chronic illness deal with them as they go.

230
00:19:56,314 --> 00:20:03,199
This might look something like offering up a bit of help on a low day or asking for help on a high day if possible.

231
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:10,504
And this can be great for both parties is it provides some relief to the low energy energy person and potentially if possible.

232
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,690
And it's a great way to have a conversation about your

233
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:12,790
life.

234
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,290
And it makes the chronically old person feel good on a day when

235
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,811
they actually have a little bit of extra energy to give.

236
00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:17,252
Right?

237
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:24,395
So low energy can also lead to being overly emotional.

238
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:25,675
As you're tired.

239
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:26,696
If you can imagine.

240
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:28,056
For me.

241
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:41,553
As a person who does experience these energy fluctuations, it's important for me to realize when I'm being grumpy and adjust if possible.

242
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:54,623
Some folks can sort of give me a little nudge in this regard, but there are also other folks who might not know about my underlying health conditions and might just see me as being the grumpy person,

243
00:20:55,203 --> 00:21:02,729
even if I'm only grumpy and interact with them maybe once every couple weeks, right? Because this is what they see.

244
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:15,869
And remember, so as a coworker, it's really important to understand that folks with health issues might really not being being rude to you on purpose, they might just be having a like a low energy day, right.

245
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:28,432
So overall it's important to remember that some days it's going to be easy to function like a normal person as a person with chronic illness and some days it just isn't.

246
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:32,873
And there's not really much that can be done to control this right so.

247
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:40,374
I try to do what I can on bad days if I can and make up for things on good days also if

248
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:40,734
I can.

249
00:21:41,314 --> 00:21:44,276
And I also try to control the grump thing.

250
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:45,176
It's difficult.

251
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:48,758
So finding support.

252
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:57,061
If this wasn't already a no-brainer for you, dealing with health issues by yourself is

253
00:21:57,121 --> 00:21:57,282
hard.

254
00:21:58,057 --> 00:22:00,337
And if you're dealing with chronic illness or disability,

255
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:03,198
I believe that it's important to build a support network

256
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:06,459
and preferably both inside and outside of work if possible.

257
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:11,100
The most important part, at least to myself,

258
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,241
with the support network is sort of finding someone

259
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:19,902
who I can talk with about different health-related things

260
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:21,022
on a given day, right?

261
00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:23,603
So things like my doctor's appointment

262
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:24,783
that didn't go so well,

263
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:27,064
or how I'm not feeling well one day or the next.

264
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:34,019
Or a new medication that I'm suddenly like a little bit scared to start taking because side effects, different things like this.

265
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:43,306
And I personally don't feel like I can just talk with any old person about most of these things is I feel maybe I'll annoy them or just burden them more.

266
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:54,854
It's also nice having someone that you can ask things like, um, is this kind of a normal human feature or is this like I should go to the doctor sort of feature like is this thing supposed to hurt like this.

267
00:22:57,072 --> 00:23:01,694
Because a lot of the time I kind of feel like I'm just complaining about aches and pains that a normal person can feel.

268
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:07,297
But I don't really have the privilege of knowing what a normal person feels like most of the time.

269
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:21,383
In addition to this, communities can also be fostered within your office via things like employee resource groups or maybe even just like small groups of folks dealing with health issues or disabilities that meet and talk about different things right.

270
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:27,828
If you're someone working with a person with chronic illness or a disability, it's important

271
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:30,770
that you support them in ways that they want to be supported.

272
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:35,714
For some folks, this might mean asking how their illness affects the way they work and

273
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:39,417
seeing if you can do something to help improve that aspect of their work life.

274
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:45,402
For others, it might be just being there for them to vent about a bad doctor's appointment.

275
00:23:46,443 --> 00:23:50,827
There are also things that you can do to help elevate their voice, especially when it comes

276
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,608
to things like making their place of work.

277
00:23:52,995 --> 00:24:00,463
more accessible. So in the past, I've been asked by folks in sort of upper management type roles

278
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:06,229
about what they can do to help better support people within the company, within their company

279
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:14,317
with chronic illness. The first and biggest step you can take is to create a culture of advocacy.

280
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:20,574
Most likely not everyone in your company has worked with a person who has chronic illness

281
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:22,995
or does not have a chronic illness themselves.

282
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:29,057
The best way for these folks to learn more about what it's like to live and work with

283
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:33,179
one of the many chronic illnesses is to learn about different illnesses and how they may

284
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:34,719
affect a person's work life.

285
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,201
Attending this session is a good first step, so thank you all for attending.

286
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:39,802
Good job.

287
00:24:40,572 --> 00:24:44,853
It's also important to provide opportunities for teaching.

288
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:47,494
And this can either be by supporting folks

289
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:50,555
within your company with chronic illness or disabilities

290
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:53,936
who want to talk more openly about their condition,

291
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:57,697
or by providing learning and development opportunities

292
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:00,118
centered around working with chronic illness

293
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:01,358
for those in your company.

294
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:08,715
Hopefully this last bit of support you can provide will sort of speak for itself

295
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:12,076
after you've created a culture of advocacy within your company.

296
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:18,957
You must advocate for the fact that not all folks, especially those with chronic illness

297
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:23,258
or disabilities, will be able to work in the same ways that folks without chronic

298
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:29,259
illness or disabilities can work, especially with ease, and that's completely okay.

299
00:25:30,594 --> 00:25:40,197
The people who work at your company with chronic illness shouldn't feel like they have to work past their limits because everyone else around them seems fine with working that way or a certain way.

300
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:50,561
it's important to make sure that teams carry this mentality as well, this means reassuring folks that it's okay to not take the early morning plus late night call one day.

301
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:58,804
And again, making sure the teams carry this sentiment, so the information trickles down from the top and.

302
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,198
keeps form all the way through, right?

303
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:04,900
So these are just a few ways that you can start

304
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,541
to provide support for folks in your company

305
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:09,482
with chronic illness from the top down.

306
00:26:10,723 --> 00:26:13,024
And I hope you'll join me in trying to make our industry

307
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:14,945
as inclusive as possible for folks

308
00:26:15,065 --> 00:26:16,706
with chronic illness or disabilities.

309
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:22,149
So finally, to the folks who are working

310
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,871
with chronic illness, be their advocate.

311
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,332
Support them in doing the best they can

312
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:29,253
with what they have.

313
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,191
and elevate their voice.

314
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,092
To folks dealing with chronic illness working in games,

315
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:36,512
you can do it.

316
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:37,833
We can do it.

317
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:40,754
We can make it in this industry, though we

318
00:26:40,794 --> 00:26:42,094
may need some help along the way.

319
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,334
But honestly, who doesn't?

320
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:47,276
Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it,

321
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:50,156
even if it isn't from your coworkers or boss.

322
00:26:51,457 --> 00:26:52,177
I won't lie to you.

323
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:53,878
There have been a lot of hard times

324
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:58,899
while dealing with my health issues and work.

325
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:02,195
But it's possible to overcome the rough patches.

326
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:05,857
It's possible to thrive as a person with chronic illness

327
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:08,959
or disabilities in game development.

328
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:11,541
Thank you.
