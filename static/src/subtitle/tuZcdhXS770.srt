1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,521
Uh, hi, I'm Leighton, blah, blah, blah.

2
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:09,081
I'm currently the art director at Fulbright,

3
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,263
and I'm the co-creator, co-writer, and art director

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,184
of Dream Daddy, a dad dating simulator.

5
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:15,365
The dating sim where you play as a hot dad

6
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:17,286
and your goal is to meet and romance other hot dads.

7
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,027
But, honestly, maybe that's not the best way

8
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:20,827
to introduce myself.

9
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:21,968
Let me try this again.

10
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,190
Hi, my name is Leighton, and I'm terminally online.

11
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:28,485
And I bet you are too.

12
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:32,966
If being logged on all the time instills a gnawing sense of existential dread

13
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:36,147
that permeates every aspect of your life until the ennui is so overwhelming

14
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:38,728
that you wish you could just chuck your phone right into the ocean,

15
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:42,289
then you are probably a fellow sufferer of terminal onlineness.

16
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:45,870
The internet was supposed to make our lives better.

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,671
It was supposed to connect us to each other in new, meaningful ways.

18
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,971
We were supposed to be surfing through space on keyboards by now.

19
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:58,129
And instead, it makes me feel like I've opted into an additional mental illness,

20
00:00:58,169 --> 00:00:59,351
because as it turns out,

21
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:03,278
it's not good, actually.

22
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:06,577
And yet, none of us would be so logged on

23
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:08,258
if it wasn't at least kind of good.

24
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:09,998
I wouldn't be standing up here today

25
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:10,998
if it wasn't for the internet.

26
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:13,099
If it wasn't for Twitter or Tumblr,

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,479
we would have never made Dream Daddy.

28
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:16,580
I wouldn't have any of my wonderful friends,

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,900
most of whom I met online.

30
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:21,001
And I imagine none of you would be here at GDC this week

31
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:22,162
without the internet.

32
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:25,023
I mean, how many of you got your jobs by networking online

33
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:27,443
or using socials to meet up with friends this week?

34
00:01:28,324 --> 00:01:30,324
I mean, the Indians community would not be

35
00:01:30,364 --> 00:01:31,705
what it is today without the internet.

36
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:34,473
So I don't feel like I need to sell anybody

37
00:01:34,613 --> 00:01:36,914
on all of the incredible things that the internet does for us

38
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:39,155
and how it quite literally changed the world.

39
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:41,275
It's essential to the work that we do here

40
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:42,436
and how we live our lives.

41
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:45,957
So it's good, actually, most of the time.

42
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:50,158
The thing is, we just don't have the luxury of logging off

43
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:51,039
when things get bad.

44
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,820
Have you ever tried to complain to somebody about the internet

45
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,201
and then they very helpfully tell you to just log off?

46
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:57,941
Or haters going to hate?

47
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,502
Or it's just the internet?

48
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:02,183
Or they're probably 12 and living in their mom's basement.

49
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,834
It's like getting cuts all over your hands,

50
00:02:04,914 --> 00:02:06,515
and then you ask someone for some Band-Aids,

51
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:09,135
or like, I don't know, to stop cutting your hands,

52
00:02:09,615 --> 00:02:12,796
and instead of helping, they're like, just chop them off.

53
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,497
What are you even using those for anyway?

54
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:17,217
Kids these days, so addicted to their damn hands.

55
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:21,118
So yeah, it's not that simple.

56
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:23,939
The internet is no longer some sort

57
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,359
of secret geographical place you access

58
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,200
on the family desktop to look at websites

59
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,280
about Bigfoot on websites that have a black background

60
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,680
and green Comic Sans text on them.

61
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:34,890
Now it's like this weird layer on top of reality

62
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,171
that we can access anytime, anywhere,

63
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,652
and need to do our jobs, especially as indies.

64
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,112
Oh no, what have I done?

65
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:41,772
No, the bit!

66
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:46,734
And despite it being something that is so embedded

67
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:47,955
into the fabric of society,

68
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,435
I feel like we don't spend enough time

69
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:50,796
talking about how it affects us,

70
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:54,077
psychologically, emotionally, and how it shapes culture

71
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:55,557
and the way that we talk about media.

72
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:57,838
And we do this sometimes, and that's great,

73
00:02:58,218 --> 00:03:00,099
but a lot of the time, it looks like this.

74
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,370
And what these are all really saying is just,

75
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,571
we live in a society.

76
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,552
And they aren't engaging with the real nuanced issues

77
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:12,193
of the internet, of which there are a lot.

78
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,314
So with all this in mind,

79
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:15,714
today I wanna do a bit of a sequel

80
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:17,175
to the talk that I gave here last year.

81
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,212
It was about how understanding the historical origins

82
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:22,354
of internet culture can help you make your game something

83
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:24,376
that people will want to share online,

84
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,798
and how we use the concept of metamodernism

85
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:29,461
to make Dream Daddy a bit of a viral success.

86
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:31,282
So, one second.

87
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:35,746
Gotta get my gamer voice on.

88
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,848
So I'm gonna do a quick high-level speed run

89
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:38,769
of the stuff we talked about

90
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,010
because it's relevant to this talk.

91
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,611
Here we go.

92
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:41,672
What's up, gamers?

93
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:44,283
Modernism, sincere.

94
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:47,764
Postmodernism is cynical, deconstruction

95
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:48,744
of modernist ideals.

96
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,745
Postmodernism is dead, long live metamodernism.

97
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:52,485
What's that?

98
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:54,286
The art period we're currently in.

99
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:57,707
The entire idea is that it combines both modernism

100
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:58,847
and postmodernism.

101
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:02,328
So the guiding tenet is sincerity wrapped in cynicism,

102
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:03,868
like a nice empanada.

103
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:07,787
And just like how modernism was spurred on

104
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,469
by the Industrial Revolution and post-modernism

105
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,590
was spurred on by the proliferation of broadcast

106
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,371
television, metamodernism's biggest influence

107
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:16,592
is the advent of the internet.

108
00:04:17,232 --> 00:04:18,653
A lot of the most popular media today

109
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:20,594
follows this guiding principle of sincerity

110
00:04:20,614 --> 00:04:22,556
wrapped in cynicism, like these things.

111
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:27,078
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

112
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:28,239
But.

113
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:33,268
What I didn't talk about last year is that sometimes,

114
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,129
when your game gets really successful,

115
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,870
when you kind of thought like four people max

116
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,131
were gonna play it, it breaks your brain a little bit.

117
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:43,231
So now that we're caught up,

118
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,972
today I'm gonna talk about how I had a nervous breakdown

119
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:47,432
after Dream Daddy became a success

120
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:50,073
and how that breakdown forced me to reevaluate

121
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,394
my relationship with the internet,

122
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:54,295
my work, media criticism, and myself.

123
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:59,486
So before we get into internet theory stuff, I want to also do a speedrun of what happened

124
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:00,467
after Dream Daddy blew up.

125
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:06,591
My friend Vern and I both love hot dads and are clinically depressed.

126
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:11,114
Neither of us had ever made a game before, but we decided to do a game about hot dads

127
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:12,255
who kiss each other anyway.

128
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:17,179
We wanted to make it silly on the outside and sincere on the inside.

129
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:18,159
Empanadas.

130
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:22,998
We wrote the game together across the country from each other using Skype and Google Docs.

131
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:27,040
We formed a ragtag group of cool game developers who are actually, some of them are sitting

132
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,842
in the front row and they're great.

133
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,403
And we worked out a publishing deal with our friends, the Game Grumps.

134
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:34,969
Blah blah blah, year and a half of development goes by,

135
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,130
nya nya nya, all right.

136
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,292
So, as a bisexual woman, and Vernon being a straight dude

137
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,813
but a good ally, we were fretting a lot

138
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:44,594
about getting the queer representation right.

139
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:47,455
So we were constantly showing the script to people,

140
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:49,256
getting perspectives from other queer folks,

141
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:51,837
researching, having sensitivity readers look at it,

142
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:53,318
and a lot of the crew is queer,

143
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,199
so we were feeling pretty good about it.

144
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:59,520
Our mission statement from the beginning was to contribute something that was just a nice,

145
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,082
funny, positive queer thing that was more focused on the romance angle than having to

146
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:09,584
navigate being queer, because so often narratives about queer people are either really insensitive

147
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:13,706
or are just hyper serious and angsty and all about struggling with your sexuality.

148
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:18,788
And I do enough of that in real life. So we announced the game on Father's Day,

149
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:20,528
only a few weeks before it was set to come out.

150
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:26,179
The response was immediate and ridiculous and really unexpected for me.

151
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,461
We spent all of announce day just trawling through socials reading everything, which

152
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:34,143
is not a good idea at all.

153
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:41,206
The issue was that we had still not completed or QA'd the game when we announced and we

154
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:42,987
were kind of racing to the finish.

155
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,129
But we did not anticipate the response.

156
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:47,830
So now there was this added pressure

157
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,612
of our 70,000 Twitter followers and lots of conversation

158
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,113
and many, many articles about it.

159
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:55,234
And there was already a lot of controversy.

160
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:58,615
And not just from who you or even I

161
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,536
would have expected either, i.e.,

162
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:02,397
alt-right homophobe Gamergate types.

163
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:03,858
And we got some of that.

164
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,719
But it was overwhelmingly kind of calls

165
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,059
coming from inside the house.

166
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:11,394
The people that I had always wanted to be stoked about this game

167
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:13,716
were the same ones who were really upset about it.

168
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:16,299
And that was like a knife in the heart.

169
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:19,381
Because my timeline was still all Dream Daddy stuff,

170
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,743
but we also had people adding us nonstop

171
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:23,104
with everything from,

172
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:24,486
this is going to be homophobic

173
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:27,008
and you should give money to actual queer creators.

174
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,213
Instead of this game, to this is clearly just a cash grab,

175
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:32,934
to Layton is not actually queer,

176
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,797
to tell us exactly the sexualities of everyone in your team,

177
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:38,239
to the one that I cried in corners about most,

178
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,761
I'm queer and I want to be excited for this,

179
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,383
but I know it will be bad and hurt me.

180
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:45,486
And because the game hadn't come out yet,

181
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,127
and honestly wasn't even finished,

182
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:49,409
a lot of this was just speculation

183
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:51,211
and we knew we couldn't address any of it

184
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,052
because we wanted to let the game speak for itself.

185
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:57,470
But the interim was torture and extremely overwhelming.

186
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,911
And like, I totally get the reaction.

187
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:03,313
As queer folks online, and honestly

188
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:05,073
as any sort of marginalized folk online,

189
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:07,335
we have to have our hackles up about this stuff

190
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:09,896
because it's so often harmful and exploitative.

191
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:11,857
So we're just trying to protect ourselves.

192
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,220
And when something that comes out that's billed as queer,

193
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:18,523
we put a lot of scrutiny on it because it can be really frustrating

194
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:20,464
when you're desperate for media that represents you,

195
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:21,826
and you never get any.

196
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:24,608
And finally, something comes out that might speak to that,

197
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:27,770
but actually, it's something you're not even remotely interested in,

198
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:29,892
or, in our case, for a lot of folks,

199
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:31,313
made it seem like they were the butt of the joke.

200
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,976
And it's even worse when it seems like everyone is excited about it but you.

201
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:37,738
And that can just feel like a slap in the face to players.

202
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,540
And...

203
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,761
Having spent years being an extremely logged on teen denizen of Tumblr,

204
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:48,222
I've seen it from both sides.

205
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:52,725
And the skepticism of the community is almost always valid and makes a lot of sense.

206
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:55,547
But what I didn't realize until it happened to me

207
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:59,549
was that when you have thousands of people piling on with thousands of different takes

208
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:03,112
and accusations and speculation all at once, all the time,

209
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,553
it's overwhelming as hell and it hurts.

210
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,696
And most of all, it hurt because I felt like I was letting my community down.

211
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:11,397
I didn't want to be that guy, ever.

212
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:17,584
So I had dropped out of school temporarily and flown out to LA to help deliver this weird

213
00:09:17,604 --> 00:09:19,264
dad baby with the rest of the Dream Team.

214
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:23,045
They're great, please thank them because they're wonderful people and very talented.

215
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:23,926
Woo!

216
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:25,606
They're good.

217
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:26,866
Anyway, oh shit.

218
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:30,487
So anyway, I flew out and it was hellish.

219
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:33,088
This isn't a crunch talk, but we were wrecked.

220
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:37,469
All-nighters, only going off of coffee and Soylent, the nicest people ever snapping at

221
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:38,869
each other because everything was breaking.

222
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:39,870
You know the drill.

223
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:45,406
To compound this, at the last minute, we had to delay the game twice due to game-breaking

224
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:45,726
bugs.

225
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,788
You know, how crunch works.

226
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:51,911
Cue even more yelling at us while we're all having some of the most stressful nights of

227
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:52,311
our lives.

228
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:57,015
So while we were getting nonstop tweets about how we didn't care about the fans, that this

229
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:01,659
was evidence it was a cash grab, etc., we were all literally in tears trying to make

230
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,842
this extremely hard decision to give ourselves more time, partially because our bodies were

231
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:07,644
breaking down under the stress in long hours.

232
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:13,383
Completely full disclosure, that month I had a period that lasted for 12 days because of

233
00:10:13,443 --> 00:10:14,666
how hard I was pushing my body.

234
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,653
There was a point where I was throwing up from the stress.

235
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:18,715
It was great!

236
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:22,839
So that night after the second delay,

237
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,981
Vern and I were both convinced that this whole thing was over,

238
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,103
our careers were ruined, and we would

239
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:29,084
get laughed off the internet.

240
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:32,867
We were basically like, well, we had fun making it.

241
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:35,049
That's kind of a year and a half down the drain, but hey,

242
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,751
it'll be fine eventually, I guess.

243
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,533
And the next morning, Dream Daddy

244
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,255
was the top selling game on Steam globally.

245
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:43,916
And people really loved it.

246
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:46,098
So that is a thing that happened.

247
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,791
Everything that came next was kind of a blur and a ridiculous whiplash from,

248
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:54,154
well, this whole thing is over and I can never go on the internet again, to,

249
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:58,659
oh, so my entire life just changed overnight and I can drop out of art school

250
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,862
and fulfill a lifelong goal of moving to California now, question mark?

251
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:05,245
Out of nowhere, we were suddenly absurdly successful.

252
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:08,047
And yet, I didn't feel any differently

253
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,087
than I had for the past month.

254
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:11,729
I just felt kind of numb because of how surreal

255
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:12,569
and sudden it all was.

256
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:14,910
I flew home, I dropped out of school,

257
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:17,292
I moved into a futon in my dad's spare room.

258
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:20,233
My body was destroyed, I was exhausted.

259
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:22,474
Crunching the internet stress fucked me up so bad

260
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:24,876
that I was like sick and recovering for months.

261
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:27,937
We continued to read everything about the game obsessively,

262
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:30,939
which was again, never a good idea.

263
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:38,951
And the funny thing about a lot of people loving a thing that you made is that not only

264
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:44,076
is it a real dissociative trip mentally, but it becomes really easy to tune the positive

265
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:49,721
stuff out and only focus on the negative because for some reason the negative stuff feels more

266
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:50,521
true somehow.

267
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:51,843
And there was a lot of it.

268
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:56,364
So if your self-esteem is like a bowl that holds all of the wonderful positive things

269
00:11:56,404 --> 00:12:02,188
that people say, each bad tweet or email or message pokes a hole in the bowl until it's

270
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,930
basically a strainer and it feels impossible to hold on to a shred of the good stuff.

271
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:10,634
The imposter syndrome was really strong and as my career in the games industry started

272
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:14,937
to form around the work that I did on Dads, the more I felt like I was still just a stupid

273
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:16,898
art school dropout who had no idea what she was doing.

274
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:18,799
Because I kind of was.

275
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:25,282
And due to all the criticism, I was suddenly faced with the fact that even though we took

276
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:28,305
all these steps to be as sensitive as possible, we fucked up.

277
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:31,548
There are a lot of slip-ups we made that I still don't feel good about.

278
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:36,072
And now looking back, I know that there's no such thing as positive representation and

279
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,335
there never will be, which doesn't mean that we shouldn't try.

280
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:43,539
But being forced to face that stuff over and over and over every day was a big learning

281
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,400
experience for me.

282
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:50,383
Now I'm even more committed to advocating for thoughtful representation and holding myself to a higher standard than I was before.

283
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:54,506
But it still felt and feels just awful.

284
00:12:56,046 --> 00:13:00,869
Anyway, I had always thought that being successful would instantly make me happy and cure my depression,

285
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:03,090
and when it didn't, it kind of tore me apart.

286
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:04,876
Frankly, I was a wreck.

287
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:07,136
I had to make my friends go through

288
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,797
and clear my notifications and inboxes on everything.

289
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,858
I isolated myself in real life.

290
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,778
I ate junk food compulsively, stayed in bed all day,

291
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:17,859
smoked too much weed, had to double my antidepressant dosage

292
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:18,920
and get back on Xanax.

293
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,281
And yeah, we had done it, and I felt like a failure.

294
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:27,690
When I was in art school, I had this recurring nightmare

295
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,451
where I'd be in a critique, but instead of my art,

296
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:32,292
I'd be the one being critiqued.

297
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,593
And everyone in the class would tear

298
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:37,075
into all my personal flaws, but then when I left class,

299
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:38,836
they would follow me around campus

300
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:41,477
and then huddle around my bed at night still critiquing.

301
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:45,279
And that's how being online felt for a really long time.

302
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,521
Even my subconscious is extremely on the nose.

303
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:54,796
So the good news is that even though it took a lot of time of me being completely miserable,

304
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:58,780
I'm in a lot better place mentally than I was a few years ago, and I'm a lot stronger

305
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,241
for it too.

306
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:04,286
I still struggle with my mental health and the imposter syndrome all the time, but that's

307
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:05,588
just kind of how my brain is.

308
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,892
Through a lot of intensive therapy, getting heavily medicated, and a ton of self-help

309
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:15,315
and psychology textbooks I bought on Amazon Prime, I found a lot better coping mechanisms

310
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:16,195
to help me get through it.

311
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:20,318
And at the end of this talk, there'll be a page with a link to a breakdown of all those

312
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:21,898
practical self-care tips I learned.

313
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,141
But while I'm up here in person, I'd rather talk about the biggest thing that helped me

314
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:26,741
get through this.

315
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:32,224
And because I love to overly intellectualize my feelings, that was trying to understand

316
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:34,025
why the internet works like this.

317
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,640
As we struggled with this, we discovered that actually,

318
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,241
this experience is extremely common among people

319
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,761
who make popular pieces of media.

320
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:46,602
We were lucky enough to be able to talk to people

321
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:48,242
who went through it and came out the other side

322
00:14:48,282 --> 00:14:50,643
in one piece, and that was ridiculously comforting.

323
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:54,384
But we don't talk about this stuff in public spaces

324
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:56,925
because it's basically admitting that all of the angry

325
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:59,726
emails and tweets worked, that you let it get to you.

326
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,926
You're successful, who cares?

327
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:03,147
It's what you signed up for.

328
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:05,327
It's just the internet, right?

329
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:09,158
And the idea of being vulnerable and real online

330
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,759
after going through that kind of experience

331
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,420
is kind of terrifying.

332
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:14,982
It does make you want to log off entirely

333
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:16,583
just so you don't have to deal with it anymore.

334
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,665
Honestly, it's pretty scary talking about it up here today.

335
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:23,888
But my intent isn't to throw some sob story at you

336
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:26,190
to get pity or even cast aspersions

337
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,611
on people who didn't like Dream Daddy

338
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:30,553
because it is completely allowed and valid actually.

339
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:34,115
But I tell you this because the experience forced me

340
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:36,157
to reexamine the way that I engage with the internet.

341
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,257
I love to feel like I'm drinking half and half.

342
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,942
Whenever I tell this sordid tale at conventions, I always hear the same thing, and it breaks

343
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,243
my heart more and more every time.

344
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:55,727
When I'm talking to young game designers, I always hear that, based on the public reaction

345
00:15:55,747 --> 00:16:00,031
that creators get when they try to put out work that attempts to tackle any sort of serious,

346
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:04,374
complex issue, it makes them afraid to even try to put their work out there.

347
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:06,876
And that's the worst possible outcome.

348
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:12,109
Because if the ultimate goal of discourse and brigading creators and calling them out

349
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:16,890
for their fiction is to make representation better, more diverse, and more respectful,

350
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,290
then we've failed.

351
00:16:19,531 --> 00:16:24,512
If we have kids who are so afraid of being dogpiled by not only ignorant idiots, but

352
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:28,773
also their own communities, then we're essentially bullying them into virtual non-existence,

353
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,053
and then we're losing those stories entirely.

354
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,587
And to be clear, I'm not saying that anyone

355
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,048
is immune to criticism or that we should eliminate discourse.

356
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:38,929
Having public critical discussions

357
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:41,310
of work that analyzes the ways in which it's successful

358
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,072
and ways in which it's harmful is literally the only way

359
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:44,892
we can move forward.

360
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:48,814
What I am saying is that the way we have these discussions

361
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:49,174
matter.

362
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:53,897
Flattening complex issues into the hottest take possible

363
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:55,537
is not productive.

364
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:59,259
Twitter should be used as a tool to facilitate discussion,

365
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,120
not to shut it down.

366
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:05,293
And like any tool, it can be used for good and bad.

367
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,174
You can use a hammer to build a house,

368
00:17:07,314 --> 00:17:10,136
but you can also use it to smash someone's kneecaps in,

369
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:11,477
metaphorically.

370
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:14,319
Part of learning how to do better

371
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:16,480
is by admitting that you don't know what you're doing.

372
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:19,342
Part of maturing is having space to fail

373
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:20,423
without getting canceled.

374
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:23,465
And part of learning about yourself and about others

375
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:26,046
is to explore the shades of gray between black and white,

376
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:27,647
and by wading into the things

377
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,869
that you don't know you don't know together.

378
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:33,001
And there's a lot of value in work that fails.

379
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:35,263
It's a collective learning experience

380
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,304
rather than a personal one.

381
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:40,028
But we shouldn't be robbing ourselves of opportunities

382
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:42,511
to get better just because we want to be capital R right.

383
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:45,755
And unfortunately, marginalized creators

384
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,557
making work about their own experience

385
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:50,700
that is messy or dark or imperfect

386
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,222
are disproportionately targeted.

387
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,297
not only by the ignorant shitheads we'd expect,

388
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:57,098
but also by their own communities.

389
00:17:57,739 --> 00:17:59,981
And to be extremely clear, I do not mean this is like a,

390
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,843
blah, both sides are just as bad thing at all,

391
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,145
because that's a stupid and dangerous rhetoric,

392
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:06,786
and that is not what I'm trying to say.

393
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:11,050
But we have a responsibility to hold space for that

394
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,651
and protect the most vulnerable members

395
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,692
of our network online,

396
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:16,975
just like we need to do in real life and our fiction.

397
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:20,222
And if we're ripping people to shreds over not being perfect

398
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:23,062
and not making perfect work that perfectly represents everyone,

399
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,943
we're just eating our own tails here.

400
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:29,704
This is especially discouraging because IRL queer spaces

401
00:18:29,764 --> 00:18:31,925
are being eliminated en masse through a combination

402
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:34,345
of gentrification, the proliferation of dating apps,

403
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:36,366
and the fact that young queer people have more access

404
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:37,186
to each other online.

405
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:40,047
Honestly, this is a whole talk in itself, so I will stop.

406
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:43,528
But there is no replacement for physically surrounding yourself

407
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:44,448
with people like you.

408
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:46,749
There is safety and strength in that.

409
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,463
There's no replacement for activism and organizing in person.

410
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:53,926
And there's also no replacement for having these important discussions

411
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,388
about complex issues like queerness in person.

412
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:59,730
And especially in this goddamn political climate,

413
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:02,833
the fact that we're replacing the warmth of IRL queer spaces

414
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:06,616
with fighting each other to the death online over fictional characters

415
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:08,217
makes me want to cry.

416
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:12,100
And aside from existing unconscious bias,

417
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,382
I think a big part of the reason this happens is because of the sheer access.

418
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:18,556
Smaller creators, especially indie creators,

419
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:20,438
who rely on the attention economy

420
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:22,000
and by branding themselves online

421
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,281
are particularly vulnerable.

422
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:26,324
There's a higher likelihood of a tangible result

423
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:29,347
of adding them, say, than there is of repeatedly adding

424
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:31,089
Marvel or any other big celebrity

425
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:32,530
who are perceived as inaccessible.

426
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,632
And by getting someone fired,

427
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:35,894
getting their project canceled,

428
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:37,635
or just getting them to delete their account,

429
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:40,358
that's a tangible outcome that rewards that behavior.

430
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:44,836
And we've seen over and over how this approach has been utilized in a positive way.

431
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:46,557
I mean, you can just look at the Me Too movement.

432
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:52,099
But we can't immediately go from a nuanced critique of a piece of media to jumping to

433
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,680
conclusions about its creator in the same way we oust predators because it's then it's

434
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,141
not actually about discussing media or even keeping the community safe anymore.

435
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:04,543
It's about the exchange of social capital, but we'll get to that in a second.

436
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:06,843
So this sucks.

437
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:10,389
You ever hear of the crab bucket mentality?

438
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,271
It's the idea that when crabs are trapped in a bucket,

439
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,933
any of them could potentially escape.

440
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:17,194
But instead what happens is the ones

441
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:18,415
that get close to escaping

442
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:20,257
get pulled back down by the other crabs.

443
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,539
It's very much like, if I can't have it,

444
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:23,199
then neither can you.

445
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,922
And that's exactly what's happening on socials,

446
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:26,982
especially Twitter.

447
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:29,585
And while this is pretty basic human behavior,

448
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:31,907
the affordances of the internet are exacerbating it.

449
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:32,527
Namely.

450
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:37,940
context collapse, temporal collapse, parasocial relationships,

451
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,202
and the gamified exchange of social capital.

452
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:44,707
And learning about these concepts and how they're in play on the internet

453
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,349
helped me find a lot of peace with this stuff.

454
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:49,352
As I said, over-intellectualizing feelings, it's a thing.

455
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:51,374
So, let's talk about it.

456
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:56,359
The way we present ourselves changes based on who we're with, right?

457
00:20:57,482 --> 00:20:59,563
You could say that our identities are contextual.

458
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:01,383
The way you talk to your parents

459
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,104
is different from the way you talk to your friends,

460
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:05,505
romantic partners, your boss, colleagues,

461
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,606
or strangers on the street.

462
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:09,147
You can't have a personality in a vacuum.

463
00:21:09,987 --> 00:21:11,708
It's not that we fundamentally change ourselves

464
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,129
when we interact with different people,

465
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,630
but that we display different facets of ourselves

466
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,051
in different situations because it's based on knowledge

467
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:19,391
of who we're presenting it to.

468
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:22,410
This is why it's so annoying when people comment

469
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,512
on how social media is inherently performative,

470
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:25,474
like that's a bad thing.

471
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:27,796
Existing itself is performative.

472
00:21:28,357 --> 00:21:29,178
That's not a problem.

473
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:29,919
That's awesome.

474
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,081
But what is a problem, though,

475
00:21:32,302 --> 00:21:35,165
is that self-performance online can't be regulated

476
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,266
in any meaningful way

477
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:39,130
because you don't know who your audience is.

478
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:44,832
At any given time, you have the concept of your followers, but this is an imagined audience,

479
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:49,034
and you have no way of knowing how much of that imagined audience overlaps with the people

480
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:49,955
who actually see it.

481
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:54,758
Thus, you have virtually no control over how you're presenting yourself or being perceived.

482
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:57,559
Your identity becomes something that others build for you.

483
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,601
This is what context collapse means.

484
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:04,030
We have never had this level of immediate global communication

485
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,371
with each other, ever.

486
00:22:05,972 --> 00:22:07,633
Thus, we have no rules for navigating

487
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:09,635
the levels of multifaceted self-performance

488
00:22:09,655 --> 00:22:11,837
the platform requires, no way of understanding

489
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:14,020
the cultural nuance of the random people we interact with,

490
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,842
no facial or body cues we can use to inflect tone.

491
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:20,767
We have people of all ages, from children to the elderly, from disparate backgrounds,

492
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:23,911
with different levels of life experience and education, all tossed in together on a few

493
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:27,715
bespoke platforms that have no design unifying purpose other than vague terms like to share

494
00:22:27,855 --> 00:22:28,516
and communicate.

495
00:22:29,117 --> 00:22:31,119
I mean, and also to make money off of you fighting.

496
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,621
It's absurd.

497
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,806
It's amazing that we can get anyone to agree on anything with this, this many cultural

498
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:37,807
and social balls in the air.

499
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:44,152
Further, because we're out here making games or art or whatever that's associated with

500
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:47,834
our real names, we essentially have to turn our identities into a brand.

501
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:52,537
You and your work become inseparable, because to make money, we have to constantly be marketing

502
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:52,998
ourselves.

503
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:59,121
In an industry where it is so easy to base your self-worth on your output, the system

504
00:22:59,162 --> 00:23:00,522
only perpetuates this fallacy.

505
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:06,128
Instead of having the luxury of treating socials as a space for friendship, you now have to perfectly

506
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:11,072
perform your work and your life and your friendships 24-7 because it is literally part of the job.

507
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:17,859
This in itself is exhausting, but this is why arguments about media online so easily devolve

508
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:22,103
into ad hominem attacks. Because if we can't distinguish ourselves from our work,

509
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:25,606
strangers who only know us by our work definitely can't.

510
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:29,090
Further, context collapse intersects

511
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,550
with this idea of temporal collapse.

512
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:33,992
Just like we have no context, we have no true sense

513
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:35,333
of the passage of time online.

514
00:23:36,274 --> 00:23:37,855
Despite timestamps, everything that's

515
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,836
happening on the internet is happening right now.

516
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,597
No past, no future.

517
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:44,939
Media crit used to take place over months or years

518
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,320
through traditional printing avenues,

519
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,961
but now it's happening about millions of things at once

520
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:51,223
for millions of people, and the entire cycle

521
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:53,184
of hot takes that used to happen over months

522
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,025
now happens in a period of minutes.

523
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:59,515
And it also incentivizes just throwing a take out there as fast as possible,

524
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:02,097
leaving no time for real deep thought and reflection.

525
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,842
Since we have so little information with which to form our image of strangers online,

526
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,405
it becomes easier to look at their web presence divorced from the passage of time.

527
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:15,748
That's part of why we have people digging through tweets that are a decade old and trying to use them to smear someone.

528
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:22,652
We are only going to see this issue get worse as the generation that grew up with their entire lives constantly being broadcasted get older.

529
00:24:23,293 --> 00:24:26,494
People change. Part of being a person is changing.

530
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:31,037
And the Internet requires your existence to be static, branded, and reliable,

531
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:36,900
even though the image strangers form of you online is literally only the tiniest facet of your personality.

532
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:40,718
Because it's impossible to fully convey ourselves online,

533
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:43,320
what we do instead is present a flattened version

534
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,741
of ourselves, a simulacrum that represents us

535
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:46,602
instead of the real thing.

536
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:50,224
And unfortunately, we now conflate the simulacrum

537
00:24:50,244 --> 00:24:51,305
with the actual person.

538
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,647
And that's where parasocial relationships come in.

539
00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:57,193
You know when you have a crush on someone that you don't know too well?

540
00:24:57,874 --> 00:25:00,757
You take a few things that you know about them, they're attractive, they like dogs,

541
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:06,742
whatever, and we're pattern-seeking creatures, so you favorably extrapolate that data into

542
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:08,124
a fantasy of what you think they're like.

543
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:14,029
The fantasy then becomes a separate entity from the actual person, and now you're expending

544
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:17,313
all of your emotional energy on that fantasy that you're conflating with the person.

545
00:25:19,044 --> 00:25:23,548
A parasocial relationship is a one-sided experience where the audience or viewer or player forms

546
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:27,571
a mental image of a public figure or fictional character that they project emotions onto.

547
00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:31,332
This is a super deep well of information,

548
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:33,393
and there's a YouTube series that does the deep dive

549
00:25:33,453 --> 00:25:34,953
better than I could ever give justice to.

550
00:25:35,353 --> 00:25:37,713
It's required viewing, and we'll also link at the end.

551
00:25:38,414 --> 00:25:39,674
Anyway, you see this everywhere.

552
00:25:40,454 --> 00:25:42,254
The YouTube industry relies on fostering

553
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:44,155
parasocial relationships between the audience

554
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:44,955
and a personality.

555
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:47,355
Dating sims work because they entice you

556
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:50,116
into a parasocial relationship with hot dads.

557
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:52,876
And we've been doing this with all sorts of actors

558
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:53,997
and public figures forever.

559
00:25:54,657 --> 00:25:55,837
It's a normal human thing.

560
00:25:56,737 --> 00:26:01,679
But the internet, with its unprecedented access to the subjects of these parasocial relationships,

561
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:06,021
has morphed this into a very real issue that hinges on treating real people like they're

562
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:06,802
dolls to play with.

563
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:08,462
Again, talk in itself.

564
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:12,925
The thing is, a parasocial relationship is often a positive projection.

565
00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:14,726
But it can also work the other way.

566
00:26:16,046 --> 00:26:20,188
Let's say you're hanging out with a close friend and they say something stupid and offensive.

567
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:24,533
You've known them a long time, you know they're a good person and that it doesn't reflect

568
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:28,975
their values, so you feel completely comfortable being like, yo, don't say that.

569
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:32,856
And then you can have a productive discussion about why it's bad, turns out they didn't

570
00:26:32,896 --> 00:26:35,637
know, you can explain the context, and then you both learn from it.

571
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:39,739
Let's say that, instead of generic stock photo friend saying the offensive thing to you,

572
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,019
he tweets it.

573
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,660
You know, like a dumbass.

574
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,701
Your friend has 12 followers.

575
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:50,749
But then someone with 20,000 followers quote tweets your friend with a sick dunk,

576
00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:53,870
and suddenly people are crawling out of the woodwork to call your friend an awful

577
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,591
person and make all sorts of leaps about who they are and what they meant.

578
00:26:58,371 --> 00:27:01,532
I'd like to posit that this is also a parasocial relationship.

579
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:05,874
By the way, stop quote tweeting idiots just to boost your ego because you're

580
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:08,114
playing into their hands and giving them a platform they wouldn't have had

581
00:27:08,154 --> 00:27:11,435
otherwise. Seriously, you are part of the problem. Anyway.

582
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:14,976
Thanks.

583
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:19,397
Uh, no, oh, uh, thanks.

584
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:22,437
Social media is a network of real actual relationships

585
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,318
jumbled in with positive and negative

586
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:26,618
parasocial relationships that are all treated

587
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:27,538
as if they're the same.

588
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,799
Combined with context collapse and temporal collapse,

589
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:33,999
we have no context, no sense of time, and no sense of self.

590
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,140
No fucking wonder the internet can be such a nightmare.

591
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,620
And all of these things are only exacerbated

592
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,901
by the fact that the platforms we use to talk to each other

593
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,441
capitalize on all this chaos.

594
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:48,565
Due to the lack of a unifying thematic structure of a website like, I don't know, Twitter,

595
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:50,546
it's basically just the Wild Wild West.

596
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:54,848
Because what's the one thing that unites every account on the platform no matter what they're

597
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:55,268
here for?

598
00:27:55,869 --> 00:27:58,510
Likes, retweets, followers, and engagement.

599
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:03,353
Because in lieu of any sort of traditional structure, eventually a social hierarchy is

600
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:03,993
going to form.

601
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:07,295
And what we've watched form is what we call an attention economy.

602
00:28:07,735 --> 00:28:11,337
Everyone is fighting for your attention all the time, so those who can hold it the longest,

603
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:11,717
win.

604
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,941
This applies to both the platforms themselves

605
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:15,721
and the people on it.

606
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:18,321
The major social media networks are all vying

607
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:20,102
for your eyeballs, so they design themselves

608
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:22,182
to be as attention-grabbing and addictive as possible.

609
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:24,823
This releases the same feel-good,

610
00:28:24,843 --> 00:28:27,343
addictive surge of dopamine as this,

611
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:29,724
and most importantly, this.

612
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:34,024
And of course, the attention economy

613
00:28:34,204 --> 00:28:36,285
is built on both intermittent variable rewards

614
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:38,105
and the logic of late-stage capitalism.

615
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:44,100
So the exchange of social capital and essentially dopamine via attention, views, likes, and follows

616
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,624
is ruthlessly competitive. Because the internet doesn't have firm guiding values, social capital

617
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:54,147
trumps everything else. So now it becomes about aggressively pursuing what gets you the most

618
00:28:54,187 --> 00:29:00,471
social capital and fast. Making something that's quality takes work. Being thoughtful and measured

619
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:04,754
takes time. Showing others kindness and patience doesn't make you popular.

620
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:08,616
Socials are now a globalized version of a high school cafeteria,

621
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:11,337
where the meanest, loudest, most inflammatory people

622
00:29:11,478 --> 00:29:15,560
are rewarded with attention, and in 2019, attention is power.

623
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:19,503
We have smudged our identities and the truth so far

624
00:29:19,543 --> 00:29:21,224
that these words don't even matter anymore.

625
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:24,207
Look at the events of the past week. Look at our president.

626
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:27,069
This is the ultimate consequence of the attention economy.

627
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:30,631
It does not matter if you are good, or if it's right, or true.

628
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:32,673
It matters if you can keep people watching.

629
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:37,392
The fact that we're still downplaying the impact of the internet as a cultural agent,

630
00:29:37,813 --> 00:29:41,136
or considering it something that we can just log off of, is fucking dangerous.

631
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:43,719
At what point do we start taking it seriously?

632
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,201
What's it going to take?

633
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:50,066
How much damage do we have to do to each other, to the environment, to our culture, and to

634
00:29:50,106 --> 00:29:52,929
our moral character until we start talking about how we can make this better?

635
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,020
This is where it comes back to metamodernism and why it matters.

636
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,821
And it's certainly not a panacea.

637
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:02,161
I also, oh shit, I also do not have all the answers

638
00:30:03,322 --> 00:30:04,442
because I don't think anybody does.

639
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:07,943
But pure irony and cynicism are killing us.

640
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,524
And for a lot of us, it's a defense mechanism

641
00:30:10,564 --> 00:30:12,044
to protect that core sincerity,

642
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:14,125
but for many more, it's a way of life.

643
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:16,846
Because if all you stand for is cynicism

644
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:19,907
and distance and mockery, then you stand for flatness.

645
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:21,287
You stand for nothing.

646
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,102
The core of what I'm saying isn't that it's all bad and that we're doomed.

647
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:30,869
It's that we need to use these tools and the power of our attention and social capital responsibly.

648
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,394
It's that we need to take the internet and the way it affects us seriously,

649
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:38,499
because doing the opposite has even more serious consequences for us in real life.

650
00:30:39,815 --> 00:30:41,697
Just like it's not helpful to tell you to log off,

651
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:44,320
it's also not helpful to just passively accept

652
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,742
that the internet is a bad place

653
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:47,244
and will always be a bad place.

654
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:49,707
And I kind of can't believe it took me

655
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:51,630
getting yelled out online for making a game

656
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,093
about dads kissing to realize how the problem

657
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:56,115
is so much bigger than just caring for yourself

658
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:57,337
in the face of sudden success.

659
00:30:58,127 --> 00:31:02,492
how call-out culture and entitled gamers and the decay of media crit and internet culture

660
00:31:02,552 --> 00:31:06,035
thriving on aggression are just a symptom of a problem that infects us all.

661
00:31:06,776 --> 00:31:11,000
I know it sounds silly, but we can't let being terminally online actually kill us.

662
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:17,346
We can't let this tool flatten our work, our politics, our activism, our friendships, and

663
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:21,891
most importantly, our identities into something two-dimensional, clickable, and purely cynical.

664
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:28,885
I challenge you and myself to use this week at GDC to embody the complexity of ourselves

665
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:31,888
and our work and to share it with others in person.

666
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:33,870
We deserve complexity.

667
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:39,775
As humans, we deserve the chance to be multifaceted and always growing, and our work should reflect

668
00:31:39,795 --> 00:31:39,995
that.

669
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:46,161
But most of all, we deserve the chance to treat each other and ourselves with honesty,

670
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:48,023
compassion, and sincerity.

671
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:49,244
Thank you.
