00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,931
This is GDC Podcast Episode 3.

2
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:05,934
Remixing the radio host voice a little bit.

3
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:06,935
I should super...

4
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:09,858
This is GDC Podcast Episode 3.

5
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:34,167
Hey everybody, we are back. I am Chris Graft, Editor-in-Chief of Gamasutra. I'm here with my co-host Alyssa McAloon.

6
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,373
Hello, I'm Alyssa. I am the News Editor over at Gamasutra.

7
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,942
You are, you're also the associate publisher.

8
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:44,725
Yeah, I think you explained that my job is to stare at the website all day.

9
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:49,930
Yeah, yeah, that is actually, that was the only requirement on the job description,

10
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:55,795
must be willing to stare at a game industry website for...

11
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:59,198
The refrigerator in control, you just gotta make sure nothing bad happens.

12
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,843
Oh yeah, oh, I haven't gotten to the refrigerator in control.

13
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:05,188
Oh, well, spoilers.

14
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:05,748
Yeah.

15
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:07,129
There's a refrigerator in control.

16
00:01:07,449 --> 00:01:09,130
It's been spoiled.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,111
You fight a refrigerator and everybody hates it.

18
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:13,532
Ooh.

19
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:14,052
Ffff.

20
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:14,252
Ffff.

21
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:14,453
Ffff.

22
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:14,653
Ffff.

23
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:14,893
Ffff.

24
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:15,033
Ffff.

25
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:15,893
Ffff.

26
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:16,354
Welcome.

27
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:17,194
Welcome back.

28
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:19,855
So yeah, this is episode three.

29
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:23,677
We haven't been canceled yet by the bigwigs

30
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:25,398
at Game Developers Conference.

31
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:30,891
we have managed to stagger away through two

32
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:32,733
and hopefully we can make it through three

33
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:36,097
without any major issues.

34
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:37,900
Yeah, I feel like that's the way to jinx it.

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,682
So like knock on wood or whatever superstition

36
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:40,923
you subscribe to right there.

37
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:43,204
We are doing so good.

38
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:44,445
It's perfect.

39
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,567
This is going to be the longest lasting podcast ever created.

40
00:01:48,128 --> 00:01:52,971
So, before we get into our next guest, our next guest is huge, by the way.

41
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:58,195
She's just basically, I mean, she's Forbes 30 under 30.

42
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,697
I never got that. It's too late for me.

43
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:02,878
You still have.

44
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:06,060
I've got two years to do something impressive, so we'll see if that...

45
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,601
Yeah, clock's ticking.

46
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:12,920
Yeah, and, uh, yeah, and she's also, she was, uh, you know, I'm not going to spoil

47
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,401
anything yet, but she was also, uh, the IGF host.

48
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,902
Um, you know, the indie independent games festival host.

49
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:22,843
And, uh, I'm not going to even tell you the year because, you know,

50
00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:25,364
that's going to give it away, but it was pretty recent.

51
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:30,366
And, uh, and she's even a, uh, multiple times GDC speaker.

52
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:34,008
So, um, yeah, but we're not going to quite bring her in yet.

53
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:36,449
Uh, what have you been up to?

54
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:37,289
So what have you been playing?

55
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:42,336
I got my PC back up and running after it was out of commission.

56
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,777
I killed my motherboard somehow.

57
00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:46,420
How'd you do that?

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:46,980
Don't know.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,243
I hope it doesn't happen again, because I got a new one

60
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:50,104
that I spent a lot of money on.

61
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,786
Yeah, you know you're not supposed to just pour water

62
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:53,747
on your computer, right?

63
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:54,949
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm learning that.

64
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:58,772
I've been using toasters when I set things on top of my computer

65
00:02:58,793 --> 00:02:59,533
from now on, I think.

66
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:05,032
Yeah, that's good. That's how I do it now too. No one told me that you're not supposed to pour

67
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:08,774
water directly on electronics. Just a pro gamer tips here at the GDC podcast.

68
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:15,819
Yeah, yeah. This is for game developers and just if you want random tips on electronic.

69
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:20,162
No, I was talking to someone on twitter.com the other day and they reminded me that Disco Elysium

70
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:24,925
comes out. So I stayed up until 11 putting the pile of parts I'd compiled into my computer and

71
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:27,686
getting everything working just so I could play this game today.

72
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:34,581
Yeah, wow. And that's made by, I don't know how to pronounce it. It's Z-A-U-M, Zaum.

73
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,942
But there's also like a slash right in the middle.

74
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:39,003
It's very stylish, just like the game.

75
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:44,325
Yeah, the game is very stylish. What do you find stylish about Disco Elysium from Zaum?

76
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:48,566
It's got that good art. So I think we've both only managed to play like 15,

77
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,207
20 minutes of it on our lunch breaks today.

78
00:03:50,627 --> 00:03:50,847
Yeah.

79
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,812
But yeah, it's got really stylish look and art.

80
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:59,337
The writing is like, it's like being at a cool little poetry night that a friend of

81
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:02,321
yours invited you to, and just let it have a kind of jazzy feel to it.

82
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,726
And the voice acting's great, and the first 15 minutes of that game, super fun.

83
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:12,340
Yeah, yeah, it is kind of poetic. It's also got, it's got prose for days.

84
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:22,327
And yeah, so far I've had a tie speak to me. It like lets you get in your own head

85
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,571
and you know, you have this inner voice that's talking to you and you talk to it and apparently

86
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:36,416
inanimate objects talk to you as well. And I like the unexpected weirdness of it.

87
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,100
Yeah, no, it's really weird how conversations come out of nowhere, and like, because it's

88
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,346
a RPG depending on how you build your character at the beginning, it's got that kind of Fallout

89
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:50,451
2-esque where if you just have zero intelligence, you will just try to hit things with a rock

90
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,532
instead of opening doors.

91
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:57,359
It's got that kind of writing, but on this really, really poetic, and it's just good.

92
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:01,431
Yeah, I'm looking forward to putting some more time into that.

93
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:02,572
Yeah.

94
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:06,756
So big GDC news this week, registration is open.

95
00:05:07,756 --> 00:05:10,479
You can actually go buy some tickets and go now.

96
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,060
Well, not, you can't go now.

97
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:16,759
I mean, you could plan ahead a little bit, just show up incredibly early.

98
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,581
Punctuality is important, but...

99
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:19,703
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:22,946
Try not to show up, uh, five months early.

101
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:28,252
Um, but yeah, it's a, yeah, shooting for March.

102
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:34,118
So, uh, that stuff is all live on the website now at gdconf.com.

103
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,122
And speaking of other GDC things, which we kind of like to do here on the morning

104
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:45,483
announcements, we're on YouTube now, right?

105
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:46,804
Yeah.

106
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:48,104
The podcast.

107
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:48,845
Yeah, the podcast.

108
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:49,905
Well, us also.

109
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:50,225
But.

110
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:55,908
So far the first two episodes are live up there and this one will be once it's live probably as

111
00:05:55,948 --> 00:06:01,291
well too. Episode one is talking to Grant Schankweiler about game production and episode

112
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:06,554
two is talking to Matthew Burns about designing neat and compelling choices. So you should give

113
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:13,338
them both a listen, they're really insightful. Give them a listen and then give them a thumbs up.

114
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,522
Like, subscribe and the bell icon is YouTube's thing, right? Yeah. I don't YouTube a ton but...

115
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:22,403
Oh, you're not a professional YouTuber then.

116
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:24,310
No, no, only the GDC YouTube channel.

117
00:06:24,712 --> 00:06:25,756
Yeah, cool.

118
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,212
You know what else happened as far as GDC stuff?

119
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:30,413
GDC stuff happened.

120
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:34,817
We, we, we closed out the IGF submissions.

121
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:37,639
We ended up getting 550 entries.

122
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,824
So that is off to the judging process.

123
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:45,566
There's a lot of, that's a lot of games.

124
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:49,490
Yeah, no, I, I know a few people, I think were IGF judges that were

125
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,072
talking about it and just kind of like cracking their knuckles to sit down

126
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,134
at the keyboard, because that's a lot of games to go through.

127
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,939
Yeah, do you think they crack the knuckles?

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,801
I mean, you have to like cinematic effect, right?

129
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:02,043
You do the little like flex, then you start like hacker man.

130
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:03,124
That's how I start every work day.

131
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,485
Typing at your keyboard, yeah.

132
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:12,638
Yeah, and you know, there's like submissions of clothes like I've seen, you know, the talks that I'm I can't talk about any of this

133
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,841
Uh, but there's just going to be a lot of really cool

134
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:18,762
talks at gdc 2020

135
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:22,724
Uh, it was not paid to say that specifically

136
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:26,507
I'm literally part, you know, I I literally get paid

137
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:33,331
Uh from by the company that runs gdc. So, uh, I guess but but I really believe that yeah gdc 2020 has some

138
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:39,596
Really cool stuff coming up, and I frankly cannot wait.

139
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:44,079
And GDC kicks off on March 16th of 2020, right?

140
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,220
Yeah. Yeah.

141
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,942
March 16th to 20th, it's practically here.

142
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,243
Oh my gosh, I don't like that.

143
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:50,524
Well, I do like that, but like,

144
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:52,825
the concept of time moving too quickly.

145
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:01,624
Yeah, yeah. I can't. Yeah. Well, speaking of moving, I think that we should get our next guest on.

146
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,985
Alyssa and I are kind of excited about this one, right?

147
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:04,465
Yeah.

148
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:09,687
Yeah. This is kind of... Does indie game dev have royalty?

149
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:18,290
What kind of system, political system does it use? I would say that if there was some kind of royalty

150
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,852
or monarchy, our next guest would qualify.

151
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:25,935
No, I'm a plebe.

152
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:28,437
Oh, there she is.

153
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:32,420
Don't worry, I'm just a scrub.

154
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,663
OK, our next guest, we're very excited for this scrub.

155
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,606
She is known for making these brilliant and.

156
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:49,273
intensely personal games. She is currently a game designer at Tacoma

157
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:55,758
developer Fulbright while also doing these other really great personal

158
00:08:55,818 --> 00:09:02,764
games known for the IGF Nuova Award-winning Sybil, which is a game

159
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:09,269
about falling in love in an online game. How do you do it? Where you like take

160
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:15,152
dolls and you try to figure out how they do it sexually.

161
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:23,657
And also recently released the really great vignette formatted

162
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:29,320
game called We Met in May. So here we go. Welcome to the

163
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,661
podcast, Nina Freeman.

164
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:32,481
Thank you. Happy to be here.

165
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:37,987
So for people who aren't familiar with you,

166
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:40,931
and they should be, can you talk a little bit

167
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:43,694
about your background in game development?

168
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:44,896
Sure.

169
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:48,680
So yeah, like you said,

170
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,202
right now I'm a game designer at Fulbright.

171
00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:56,674
in Portland, Oregon, and before that I was based in New York City, so that's kind of where I got

172
00:09:56,714 --> 00:10:03,537
my start. My way back background is in English literature. I did, like, a lot of poetry stuff

173
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:11,720
back when I was in school. And then I got kind of into the New York City game development scene

174
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,681
through some friends who were doing, like, indie game stuff at the time.

175
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:22,020
um and through them I like got super involved with going to like game jams in New York and

176
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:25,675
different events like baby castle stuff and whatnot.

177
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:31,679
Um, and that's kind of how I got started was just going to these things with my

178
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:35,681
friends and making tiny games with them and participating in local events and

179
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:40,664
stuff. Um, and yeah, even like a lot of the

180
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:42,566
early stuff I was working on was still like

181
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:45,668
personal stuff, not all of it was because you know I'm just doing game jams with

182
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:48,629
my friends, but I was really into like personal writing

183
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:49,530
and poetry so I

184
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,455
since that's what I was doing and that's how I learned to write, I sort of instantly brought

185
00:10:54,475 --> 00:11:03,557
that over into my game development life. And during that time, that's when I worked on How

186
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:09,379
Do You Do It with a bunch of my friends in New York and a bunch of other games. Sybil

187
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,100
sort of came out of that as well, although I ended up working on that pretty heavily when

188
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,660
I was in grad school at NYU and their integrated digital media program.

189
00:11:18,706 --> 00:11:24,671
And then shortly after I got a job at Fulbright and worked on Tacoma as a level designer and

190
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:29,174
still worked on my own personal projects on the side, again with lots of different friends.

191
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:33,017
I always work with sort of different teams on each side project.

192
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,682
But yeah, so I've been doing Fulbright stuff and otherwise keeping up with my

193
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:41,284
smaller games work on the side.

194
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:43,083
So that's sort of my background.

195
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:43,403
Great.

196
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:44,203
Yeah.

197
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:47,003
So all of you aspiring game developers listening right now,

198
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,524
that's exactly how you get into the game industry.

199
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:51,204
And that's how you just have to do it.

200
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:53,465
Follow it beat for beat and guaranteed success.

201
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:54,665
Solved.

202
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:58,246
It's always interesting to hear how many people in games...

203
00:11:58,326 --> 00:11:59,666
I'm a former English major.

204
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,627
I graduated with an English for New Media degree.

205
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,387
And I think two other people at Gamasutra are too.

206
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:06,088
And a bunch of people in games.

207
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:08,568
So it's always interesting to see how that spirals out

208
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,269
into different careers in game development.

209
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:11,229
Yeah, for sure.

210
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,251
I mean, what else? I mean, I also have an English degree.

211
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:17,733
And then I end up doing, I'm doing a podcast now.

212
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:21,515
So I guess, you know, it's also how you get into podcasts.

213
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:24,957
So English degrees, game dev, or podcasting.

214
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:27,038
That's how you do it.

215
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:27,818
Very multifaceted.

216
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:34,521
Yeah, so it's interesting also just academia leading into this career.

217
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:42,245
There are lots of young people, there's always that question, you know, do I need to get a

218
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:47,427
like a game design degree or game development degree to, does that improve my chances of

219
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,608
becoming a game developer or does it matter?

220
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:54,782
I think it really depends on the situation.

221
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:59,207
I mean, school in general is always going to be good, right?

222
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:02,311
Like, you know, getting an education is good, but

223
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:06,836
it can be super expensive, so the only reason I was able to

224
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:07,697
do...

225
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:12,415
undergrad and then grad school was because of like the immense amount of financial aid I got

226
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:22,844
because I did not come from a rich family. So I was really lucky in that sense. But I think like

227
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:28,969
go to school if you can afford it and you're not going to completely be like in debt for the rest

228
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:29,430
of your life.

229
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:37,897
And if you can't really afford it, there's a lot of other ways to build up what you would get from school.

230
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:43,040
I think the best thing you can get out of school for games is a portfolio and a body of work.

231
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:51,225
And also being a part of a social space where developers are giving each other feedback.

232
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,767
I think those are the two most important things that you can get out of school.

233
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:57,289
But you can find that just in the real world too.

234
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:58,870
I had that when I was...

235
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:03,008
getting into the game scene in New York just because there was so many like community events

236
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:10,236
that weren't academia related. And I really got my start making games in that environment where

237
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:17,924
I was like just with friends, people in school, and people not in school at local stuff. So I

238
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:20,667
think it really depends on your situation, but I wouldn't...

239
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:23,346
put yourself in debt for school, personally.

240
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:29,171
Just make stuff, like, ship stuff, put it online, meet people, get feedback, actively

241
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:34,075
seek that stuff out, and just, like, build a portfolio if you're in school or not.

242
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:39,220
For some people, school makes that a lot easier, and if you need that, that's totally fine,

243
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,480
but...

244
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,651
Yeah, don't go into too much debt.

245
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,091
No debt.

246
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:44,891
Yeah.

247
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:47,092
It's tricky.

248
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:48,232
It's a tricky thing.

249
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:48,913
It is.

250
00:14:49,393 --> 00:14:50,313
Yeah.

251
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:53,454
So, let's talk about your games a little bit.

252
00:14:55,035 --> 00:15:00,937
I had played Sybil in the past, but I hadn't played all the way through it because I just

253
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:06,919
I don't know, I just get, I have the attention span of a caterpillar or something.

254
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,582
But yeah, so I did actually play through it recently again, and it's, you know, it's completely

255
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:14,102
brilliant.

256
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:20,665
Can you kind of, can you explain the background of that game for people who aren't familiar

257
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:24,246
with it and what you were trying to do with it?

258
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:26,247
Yeah.

259
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:29,268
So Sybil sort of...

260
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:33,113
The beginning of it actually hilariously happened when I was in school.

261
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:38,976
I was at NYU in grad school, and I was in Bennett Foddy's Prototype Studio class, which

262
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:41,436
was the class where we made a game a week for a whole semester.

263
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:43,377
It was like a game jam a week, basically.

264
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:45,198
Each week had a theme.

265
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:51,860
One of the weeks, my friend Francesca and I were like, let's have the theme be sex!

266
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,301
We just decided we want it to be, because we make games about that.

267
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,862
So we forced that theme on the class, which was funny.

268
00:15:58,242 --> 00:15:58,342
And...

269
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:03,595
So out of that theme came the idea for Sybil,

270
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:05,295
and I made like a little prototype for it,

271
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:06,736
which was really cool.

272
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:09,816
And I was into it and wanted to work on it more,

273
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,017
and Bennett encouraged me to work on it more.

274
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,578
And I had a bunch of friends who I'd been jamming with.

275
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:17,478
So Emmett Butler and Deki Koss,

276
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,159
who had both done How Do You Do It With Me.

277
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,160
Emmett doing a lot of code with me,

278
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,361
and Deki was the musician, sound designer,

279
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:28,601
and I did design stuff.

280
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:31,442
So I took the prototype to them and was like,

281
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:32,582
hey, do you wanna work with me again?

282
00:16:32,602 --> 00:16:36,143
And then Rebecca Dunlap came on.

283
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,104
She's an illustrator in New York, really talented,

284
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:40,285
and I knew her, so I invited her to work on it too.

285
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:42,246
So it started out as a small project

286
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:43,346
that came out of a class.

287
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,327
I decided to do it for my thesis.

288
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:48,388
It's based on my real experience

289
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:51,669
playing Final Fantasy XI as a teenager

290
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:53,750
and falling in love with this guy.

291
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,511
And him and I met up and had sex,

292
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:58,832
and that was the first time either of us had sex.

293
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:04,535
And then, yeah, the game is about how he kind of just like bounces after that.

294
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:08,016
And it's, yeah, it's like, you know, I don't know.

295
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:08,617
It's hard.

296
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:09,757
It's a hard game to spoil.

297
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:11,058
Cause it's more about the details.

298
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:17,161
I think, um, the mechanics and design of it are kind of inspired by games like

299
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:21,423
Gone Home, which are games where you experience the story through the

300
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:22,604
things you find in the space.

301
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:27,146
Um, it's a combination of that with a lot of sort of voiceover stuff.

302
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:27,306
So.

303
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:30,570
That's kind of how that game got started.

304
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,533
What did the what are the prototype for Civil?

305
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:40,378
Because it's like simulating, you know, it's your desktop, you know, quote unquote.

306
00:17:40,938 --> 00:17:44,361
What did what did that game in its early stages look like?

307
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:52,287
So the prototype was like a little pixel art 2D

308
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:54,909
game that.

309
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:59,371
was basically the same as what ended up being like the game in a game of Sybil.

310
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,833
So if people haven't played it in Sybil, it's like you're playing as this girl

311
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,394
who's playing an online game and you have access to her desktop.

312
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:10,016
And then you also play the online game she's playing with this guy she likes.

313
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,078
So the prototype was the online game part of that.

314
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:18,140
And in the prototype, it was all I didn't really have time for voice.

315
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,981
There's like a little voice.

316
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:23,223
So it was like some voiceover of her talking and then text from him

317
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:24,843
in the chat like.

318
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:27,469
you know, the fictional chat in the game.

319
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,511
And there was just like a little conversation of them flirting.

320
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:34,793
And you would just walk around and like kill enemies.

321
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:38,295
And his NPC didn't really do anything because I didn't have time in a week

322
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:41,937
to like make an AI or like even a scripted character.

323
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:46,099
So, yeah, it was just a really simple expression of that

324
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:49,400
that online game aspect of

325
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:52,102
of what Sybil ended up being.

326
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:57,915
It's so interesting because you feel like you're playing with this person, you know,

327
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:01,877
and the way that you describe it, you know, it's kind of a simple idea.

328
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:08,161
It captures a lot of like, if you, I've played, like I've had partners that I've communicated

329
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:10,822
with normally through just playing online games together, playing Destiny together for

330
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:15,185
like hours and hours and hours, and like, it captures the thing where the games kind

331
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:18,927
of becomes background noise to the actual conversations and relationships developing

332
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:19,367
through that.

333
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:21,348
Like, that was captured very well in your game.

334
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:21,849
Thank you.

335
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:28,616
Yeah, I wanted to... I always, I think MMOs are funny because I think they're like super...

336
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:34,022
It's easy to forget how simple they are, like if you strip back all the layers of like

337
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:40,690
different leveling systems, different job classes, different whatever, like in the end a lot of them are just like, you click on stuff to kill it.

338
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:45,578
So I also kind of wanted to make a parody of how that's really what a lot of those old

339
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:46,399
MMOs are.

340
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,384
So yeah, I was trying to capture that for sure.

341
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:52,369
You called it out in the writing too, just like, what are we doing right now?

342
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,852
We're just smashing stuff.

343
00:19:54,623 --> 00:20:00,870
I mean, after I played Final Fantasy 11 from like age 14 to 19, like a lot.

344
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:06,776
So I, I was fully prepared to like, get down and make fun of it, even

345
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:09,779
though it's a game I adore, but you know, when you think about a lot of

346
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:14,304
games like that, it's like a lot of it really is a lot of the interesting

347
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:16,887
parts of it come out of the social interactions you have.

348
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:23,210
And the fact that they're really simple games actually makes socializing a lot easier, I think.

349
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,373
And that's an interesting thing about those games, that comes out of the simplicity of the mechanics.

350
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:31,394
And I was excited about that when working on Sybil, for sure.

351
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:34,035
Yeah. Alyssa, are you an MMO person?

352
00:20:34,753 --> 00:20:37,194
I've tried to be in field several times.

353
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:43,939
I played Final Fantasy XI when I was an early teen with no money to afford the monthly subscription

354
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:48,122
fee and my mom wasn't very receptive to, you want to pay this money every month to play

355
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:48,722
a video game?

356
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,423
So that one didn't last very long.

357
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:52,745
Ah, come on, mom.

358
00:20:53,185 --> 00:21:00,029
Yeah, yeah. It's definitely Destiny, though, and how more and more live games are kind of becoming the modern MMO in a way,

359
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:04,772
where those communities now form around these games that, I don't know, can be played single-player,

360
00:21:04,852 --> 00:21:08,474
but you can just kind of tune them out and play them multiplayer, just go in these loops forever,

361
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:13,458
without having to commit like 80 hours to beating the primary story of Final Fantasy XIV or something.

362
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:20,001
It's nice. Video games are good. I don't know how, I don't know why I can't either.

363
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:23,902
Well, I kind of know why I haven't gotten into. I have a friend who's like, has

364
00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:27,704
been really on and off into World of Warcraft since it first came out. And

365
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:34,407
every time I try to play with him, like, I'll skip a day playing with him. And the

366
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:38,409
next thing I know, you know, I play with him and he's like level like a million

367
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:41,630
on like a flaming awesome horse mount with all this.

368
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,134
It's like, oh yeah, I've played it for 24 hours straight since last. It's like, well now there's

369
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:51,999
nothing for me to do. I'm just going to be like a little wimpy guy and I just feel like I missed

370
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:59,086
out. Yeah, I don't know. I think I'm just old too. It's interesting too, speaking of being old,

371
00:21:59,846 --> 00:22:01,408
like being a 39-year-old dad playing Sybil.

372
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:14,854
And you're kind of, I don't know, it's like you end up, you empathize with it in a different way than you would if I was, you know, a young woman.

373
00:22:16,254 --> 00:22:22,217
We talked about this a little bit ahead of in DMs where you're like, oh, my dad, like instincts are just going crazy.

374
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,418
And I'm like, no, the tone of this, I have talked to these guys online before.

375
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:27,619
I have had this guy being like, you want to send me a picture?

376
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,019
And I'm like.

377
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:30,864
it's too real and I didn't like it in that way.

378
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:39,892
And so to kind of talk about that, the personal nature of your games,

379
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:43,555
you know, people are making more of them,

380
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:46,197
like, what is your, what do you feel like is your

381
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:50,221
process for making a game that is just so

382
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:53,384
incredibly personal and autobiographical?

383
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:03,404
I am the type of game designer that really likes sort of a research-driven process, so

384
00:23:03,945 --> 00:23:05,227
for Sybil, for example.

385
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:12,748
I'm like a notorious archiver of everything in my life, and so I have this flash drive

386
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:15,351
with everything from all my computers since I was a teenager.

387
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:22,720
So I was able to go back and read a lot of actual conversations I had back then with

388
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,443
my online friends and with the guy that the game is based on.

389
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:33,761
like based on. So I had a lot of like you know source material to draw on and then I also like

390
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:40,249
went on the Wayback Machine and dug up some of my old blogs and stuff from even earlier than

391
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:41,991
the game just to like give myself

392
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:46,487
some context to like get in the character's head to like write that voice accurately.

393
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:54,354
And I even I actually found on YouTube a video of my old Final Fantasy XI Link's shell doing

394
00:23:54,374 --> 00:24:00,919
this like big fight so I could hear that guy's voice again. And so I even found that. So I like

395
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,804
gather when I do a personal game, I gather as much like real stuff as I can,

396
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:08,606
especially if it's something that happened a long time ago.

397
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:16,120
Although with something like more new like we met in May, which is about myself and like my current partner Jake,

398
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,627
like the research for that is a little different. It's mostly like conversations between us about like whatever the dates we've been on.

399
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,795
because there's not as much of a digital trail left by that game,

400
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:30,779
because it's about real physical dates we went on.

401
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,703
We have pictures from them and stuff, so that helps.

402
00:24:33,803 --> 00:24:37,569
But yeah, I try to research in whatever way

403
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:40,012
is appropriate for the kind of game I'm making.

404
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:47,360
When you're using yourself as a character, writing something autobiographical about events

405
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,664
you've been through, it would be really easy to just be like, here's my recollection of

406
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:56,089
that and that's how it is, but things are so much more multifaceted than that.

407
00:24:56,129 --> 00:25:00,493
When you're using your past self as a character, how do you detach from your current self in

408
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,636
order to make that as accurate or true as possible?

409
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:15,104
It depends on the topic, but for something more serious like Sybil, uh, or like, you know, an emotionally painful memory, I have to, like, give it a lot of time.

410
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:19,327
So I, like, didn't even consider writing that until...

411
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:24,117
I think it was like it had been like eight years since I had had that experience.

412
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:26,940
And then maybe a little, maybe like seven.

413
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:31,864
And then I'm like, I think I have enough critical distance from it to like look

414
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,946
back and be able to like look at myself

415
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:38,809
in like third person and like not like it's me

416
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:40,991
and not have any like emotional investment in it.

417
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:44,934
Yeah. So the timing depends

418
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:48,277
on the specific situation or memory I'm drawing on.

419
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:49,138
But I try to like.

420
00:25:49,774 --> 00:25:53,977
or I make sure I have like the critical distance from it to like look at it for what it was.

421
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:59,681
And also the source material helps a lot with that because if I have real text to draw on,

422
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:05,525
I just use that and like I'll edit it so it makes more sense but like a lot of Sybil

423
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,867
is just literally things I said or things that that guy said so.

424
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:15,989
yeah I have that kind of like I don't even talk about myself in the first person when I make

425
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:20,593
games like that it's always like I talk about Nina like as if she's someone else so that helps

426
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:27,358
yeah wow so um so you just uh basically copy paste all the chat logs and then some of them

427
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:33,083
were actually pretty much copy pasted uh not all of them most of it was pretty edited because like

428
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:43,105
With something like that, there's like a lot that happens and is said between two people that can kind of like distract from the point of the story or like the emotional tones I'm trying to hit.

429
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,910
So there's a lot of like filtering out of like.

430
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:49,194
things that were really said but really didn't matter in the end,

431
00:26:49,654 --> 00:26:52,515
um, that I can recognize now that I'm like so far out of it.

432
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,817
Um, whereas when you're in the moment you're like picking on every single

433
00:26:55,857 --> 00:26:58,498
little detail and trying to read into everything, or at least that's

434
00:26:58,758 --> 00:27:03,180
kind of how I was at that age, uh, but now I can take that story and like

435
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,082
distill it into something more straightforward, so I guess that's

436
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:08,703
like another element of the process.

437
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:15,877
It's also interesting because you're like now a couple of times removed from the original experience.

438
00:27:16,077 --> 00:27:22,679
Is it weird for you to talk about these personal games that are about a specific period in your life?

439
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:23,800
About a specific thing?

440
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,982
I'm so used to talking about them that it doesn't really faze me anymore.

441
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:29,082
Okay.

442
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:31,923
I don't... I mean, when I'm working on them, I don't...

443
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:35,985
Like, I don't know, it sounds weird, but I have a very, like...

444
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:42,192
distant approach. Like, I don't, I'm not, like, emotionally involved in it at all, really. Like,

445
00:27:42,232 --> 00:27:48,199
I'm doing it for the art of it. And that's not true for everything I've made. Like, Sybil is

446
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:53,565
one example. But, like, I think when I made Freshman Year, which is a story about, like, a

447
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:58,234
sort of like sexual assault situation I was in, that was like a little more emotional and I

448
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:04,201
couldn't remove myself from it as easily, but even then I can still like talk about it. I think a lot

449
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:08,025
of it just comes with experience too, just like getting used to talking about this kind of thing.

450
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:09,469
Yeah.

451
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,952
Yeah, I was, I was going to ask, but now the question, you know,

452
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:18,597
doesn't make as much sense, but you know, um, I was going to ask, you know,

453
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:23,561
was it ever difficult for you to put yourself out there in the way that you

454
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:26,583
do through your games, but I guess it just depends on the subject matter.

455
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:29,586
Yeah, it definitely depends on the subject and.

456
00:28:30,547 --> 00:28:34,910
Also, I benefited a lot from my English degree, actually.

457
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:38,193
Well, because I took a lot of, I did poetry, like, was my focus.

458
00:28:38,213 --> 00:28:42,236
So I was in a lot of, like, poetry writing, like, creative writing classes.

459
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:45,739
And in those, you know, you're, like, sharing your work face to face with people.

460
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:52,387
my professor Charles North, he was having us write a lot of personal work.

461
00:28:52,908 --> 00:29:01,051
So at a really pretty young age, I was already talking about pretty personal and sometimes

462
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:03,612
dark stuff to classmates I wasn't even close with.

463
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:09,749
And I think that experience made it a lot easier for me to do in the end.

464
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:13,811
That was like the practice that I got that prepared me to do it on a larger scale.

465
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:16,632
Was anyone ever like, geez, Nina?

466
00:29:17,513 --> 00:29:21,335
No, I mean, everyone was writing like intense stuff, you know, English majors.

467
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:23,676
Sure, sure.

468
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:24,576
Yep, yep, I do.

469
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,218
Flashing back to a very specific day in my poetry class.

470
00:29:27,438 --> 00:29:28,178
Yeah, yeah, you know.

471
00:29:30,414 --> 00:29:40,538
Well, what is it about, you know, relationships and sexuality that lend themselves to game

472
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,059
mechanics?

473
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,580
I mean, I can imagine some answers to this, but, you know.

474
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,442
It can kind of be like a taboo topic, too, like, talking about sexuality and romance

475
00:29:48,982 --> 00:29:52,904
just as they are and the goods and the bads, but also, like, based on real situations,

476
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:53,784
it's like, oh my gosh.

477
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:59,206
Well, I mean, again, I think I got used to it in the poetry.

478
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:04,426
time. I actually remember we, like, had this whole, like, erotic poetry thing that we were doing at

479
00:30:04,806 --> 00:30:09,967
this at school and, like, so that got me even more used to it, but anyway, regardless, I had

480
00:30:09,987 --> 00:30:15,688
the experience coming into it which helped, but more related to, like, game design. I,

481
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:23,870
my biggest interest as a game designer is games that, like, help you embody a character and

482
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:30,045
I think player character embodiment is like a very performative thing, so it's almost

483
00:30:30,085 --> 00:30:35,114
like theater, like you're playing as the character, almost like you're on a stage, and that was

484
00:30:35,154 --> 00:30:37,638
kind of the motivation behind the design of Sybil.

485
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:44,862
for example, where it's like first person, you're supposed to be at her computer as her

486
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:46,103
doing all these things.

487
00:30:47,143 --> 00:30:49,725
It's like role-playing, but more in a theatrical sense in my mind.

488
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:51,786
It's like zero-th person.

489
00:30:52,326 --> 00:30:54,588
You're like the person.

490
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:55,728
It's your desktop.

491
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:56,349
Yeah.

492
00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:01,231
And a part of that process for me is always like, I think the memories I like to draw

493
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:06,954
on the best for personal games especially are things that have a very physical element

494
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:09,948
I think could translate well into game mechanics.

495
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:13,191
So I like to have the story first and find a game mechanic in the story.

496
00:31:14,031 --> 00:31:18,035
So in Sybil, it's the act of like sitting at the computer looking through your files

497
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:18,815
and playing the game.

498
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:20,417
That is like a physical experience.

499
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,966
that's how those mechanics came out of that, or in How Do You Do It, the physicality of, like,

500
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:33,253
playing with your dolls and moving them around in silly and awkward ways and the physical experience

501
00:31:33,314 --> 00:31:39,141
of that. And I haven't done that kind of design for, like, literally everything I've done,

502
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:41,124
but it's one of my big interests, and I think...

503
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:49,478
you know, sex and relationships and sexuality, like, there's lots of sort of stories within that

504
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:56,084
space that are so physical, so I think there's a lot of territory to be explored there mechanically.

505
00:31:57,693 --> 00:32:01,834
I think one thing I noticed when I did a quick brush up on as many of your games as I could

506
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:06,876
find this morning, just to make sure it was all fresh, and going through We Met in May

507
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:11,497
and how each of the different vignettes has their own mechanic that goes with it, but

508
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:16,398
the mechanics feel very tied to the absurdity or the romance or the intimacy of the situation,

509
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:22,080
and that just all comes across as the mechanics as the vehicle for narrative versus a game

510
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,221
where it would distract you from the narrative or something like that.

511
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:31,347
Yeah, for sure. And I've gone both directions, like Kimi is a game I worked on that's more of

512
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:36,472
like a visual novel style game, which is another genre I really like, so just depends on what

513
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:40,816
you're going for, but I think it's exciting to like look for the mechanics in the story,

514
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:44,560
like how can you have the player like step into the character's shoes and like

515
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:47,443
actually perform as them.

516
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,531
in a physical way.

517
00:32:51,014 --> 00:32:51,815
Yeah.

518
00:32:51,895 --> 00:32:53,918
I played through We Met in May this morning

519
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,322
and it's hilarious.

520
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:57,104
Thank you.

521
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:03,391
It's just, um, yeah, I mean, it's already like kind of, uh, you know, on, on game

522
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:09,436
blogs and game sites, so no spoilers, but you do tweak, uh, Nina's boyfriend's

523
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:14,779
nipples in it while he's trying to make a, make a meal and it's just so, just so

524
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:21,124
funny, like how, uh, how evocative it is, like the emotions, like it's, it's so

525
00:33:21,224 --> 00:33:21,604
playful.

526
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:25,968
Can you talk about incorporating this playfulness and how you zero in on that?

527
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:34,663
I... so first, we met in May, yeah, Jake and I made it together and we had all these fun

528
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:38,070
dates and like, one of our first dates was this one that...

529
00:33:38,946 --> 00:33:41,807
where we were at the beach and we discovered we both really like sand

530
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:45,408
and like rolling around in the sand and stuff, which a lot of people think is weird,

531
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:48,789
apparently, but I grew up like right next to a beach.

532
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:50,609
So I'm like, I don't know. It's just like what I always did.

533
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:53,010
And he did, too. So we like bonded over that.

534
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,051
And then we were like talking about that experience with some friends.

535
00:33:57,091 --> 00:33:58,792
They were making fun of us for liking sand.

536
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,573
And we were like, oh, yeah, like that would make a pretty interesting game.

537
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:04,934
And then we could like show people that liking sand isn't weird.

538
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:13,458
Like, the idea came from, like, kind of a playful place for us, um, and like, we...

539
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:20,342
We...especially as someone like me who I've made a lot of, like, kind of darker games about romance and stuff,

540
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:24,965
I wanted to really try getting back into, like, the comedic and lighter side of things,

541
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:29,507
like, what we had done with How Do You Do It back in the day, for example.

542
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:33,590
Um, that's, like, a much more light-hearted game, uh, even though it tackles something...

543
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,531
kind of serious in a way.

544
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:37,613
So, yeah, Jake and I were like,

545
00:34:37,653 --> 00:34:39,974
yeah, let's pick, find

546
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:41,876
some dates we've been on that we thought were really

547
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,837
funny or memorable in some way, and

548
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,019
see what was funny and memorable

549
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,120
about those, and

550
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,782
translate them into a game, and find the game

551
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:51,723
mechanics in those moments. So we came

552
00:34:51,763 --> 00:34:53,785
into it with romantic comedy as

553
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:54,285
a goal.

554
00:34:55,786 --> 00:34:57,067
So, we're glad it comes across.

555
00:34:58,048 --> 00:34:59,469
Yeah, it definitely does.

556
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:01,330
So,

557
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:02,091
the...

558
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:08,122
In your games, there's always this, like visually it just fits.

559
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:09,763
Everything is so cohesive.

560
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:15,265
Um, what are your, what are your, what are your thoughts on, you know, uh, the

561
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:20,727
aesthetics of, uh, and how that plays into the storytelling aspect?

562
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:25,209
Uh, I mean, you can talk about specific games, like, like how, like how do you do

563
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,370
it or, you know, anything.

564
00:35:28,154 --> 00:35:32,377
Yeah, uh, so for all the different games I've worked on, it's usually...

565
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:36,261
a lot of them have been with, like, many different artists. Like, I haven't

566
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:43,267
worked with the same artist multiple times, just... just because of, like, these being, like,

567
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,171
side projects and all of us... many of them being done when I was a student and stuff, you know?

568
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:51,335
It's... I wasn't, like, building a company or, like, anything like that yet, so it's just, like...

569
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:53,442
which my friends wants to make a game today.

570
00:35:53,462 --> 00:35:54,663
Kind of thing.

571
00:35:55,384 --> 00:35:59,067
But I like, I always would reach out to artists

572
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:00,348
whose work I really liked.

573
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:04,152
And I'm not, I try not to be the type of designer

574
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:06,113
that like micromanages an artist.

575
00:36:06,173 --> 00:36:09,156
I kind of just like, you know, if I am into someone's style,

576
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,897
I'm working with them for that reason.

577
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:13,740
And we usually relate over that.

578
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,944
So yeah, my collaborative process with artists

579
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:20,546
is always like, I just like what you do.

580
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:24,273
do that with me, please.

581
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:26,615
But out of that comes a lot of really cool stuff, so like,

582
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:27,976
how do you do it is a good example.

583
00:36:28,657 --> 00:36:31,419
Marina Kitaka did the art for that game, and she...

584
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,341
I actually did work with her a couple times.

585
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:40,347
She released Anodyne 2 recently with Sean.

586
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:46,042
They're a pair of game developers that have been working on stuff.

587
00:36:46,422 --> 00:36:47,543
We're like old friends, it's funny.

588
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,487
We all like, I know Marina through Sean, who's a friend from New York.

589
00:36:51,028 --> 00:36:52,650
So anyway, small world of game developers.

590
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,130
Marina's great.

591
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,272
Anodyne too is super good.

592
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,357
She is a super talented artist with a really good eye for design stuff too.

593
00:36:58,517 --> 00:36:59,638
Game design stuff and writing.

594
00:37:00,156 --> 00:37:05,538
So when we were working on that game, I like storyboarded what I had envisioned for How

595
00:37:05,578 --> 00:37:11,580
Do You Do It? and actually, originally, it was more focused on the hands and the dolls in her

596
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:17,823
hands. But Marina came back to me with a reverse view that included her face, because she was like,

597
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:21,244
I really want to draw her expressions, because I think that that is super evocative

598
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:25,005
for this concept. And I was like, great. Yeah, sounds perfect.

599
00:37:25,645 --> 00:37:27,987
I'm so glad that you thought of that,

600
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:30,067
because that really makes the game what it is.

601
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:33,869
So yeah, my process with artists has always

602
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:36,671
been really collaborative in that way for the design, too,

603
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:39,872
because the visual design of the games matters a lot to me.

604
00:37:40,372 --> 00:37:42,293
Oh, yeah.

605
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:44,954
It's funny, too, how in your games,

606
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:51,397
you add a point system that doesn't really like,

607
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:53,518
it's unclear of how exactly it works.

608
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:59,090
They all have a logic behind them, but it's not like... it doesn't really matter.

609
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:04,979
It seems like it's kind of like poking fun at the gamification of things sometimes and yeah.

610
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:10,728
Yeah, I like, I don't know, I think to me as a game designer it's important to not take...

611
00:38:11,148 --> 00:38:16,870
traditional game mechanic expectations too seriously, because I think it's more interesting

612
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,072
if you try and poke fun at them or use them in a weird way.

613
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:24,714
So yeah, I do my best to try doing that where it makes sense.

614
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:28,336
And yeah, I've done that a lot with scores, because I think they're silly.

615
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:35,862
Yeah, I was pretty proud of my high score on, we met in May when I was putting clothes on,

616
00:38:35,882 --> 00:38:39,605
or when you were putting clothes on, I was putting, yeah, I'd come out and then just,

617
00:38:39,705 --> 00:38:45,070
then Jake just goes ragdoll. So yeah, so this is how it works. Like, apparently Nina and Jake went

618
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:51,015
on a date where she's trying clothes on at a clothes shop, and then she comes out of the

619
00:38:51,055 --> 00:38:54,518
dressing room. And then depending on how you come out of the dressing room,

620
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,942
which you can choose, you'll just literally blow her boyfriend off of his feet

621
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:04,565
and his character models, yeah, damage numbers

622
00:39:04,785 --> 00:39:09,508
come up and he just goes ragdoll. Is there like a hidden leaderboard somewhere for whoever's

623
00:39:09,528 --> 00:39:10,789
tweaked the nips the most times?

624
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,832
I would have loved to do that. I mean some of this stuff actually also comes down to

625
00:39:15,872 --> 00:39:17,353
like scope or like time.

626
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:22,617
Yeah so we there's actually like a ton of other stuff I wanted to do when we met in May but we

627
00:39:22,657 --> 00:39:28,021
just like literally didn't have time for because it's like we're both so busy actually Jake also

628
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:31,063
started working at Fulbright recently so it's like hilarious how

629
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:37,083
We both started having really, like, you know, working a day job and making a game on the side is pretty hard.

630
00:39:38,384 --> 00:39:42,988
So the silliness of the scoring also sometimes comes out of like,

631
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:47,672
well, I don't have too much time to think about this, so what's the funniest thing that comes to mind first?

632
00:39:49,113 --> 00:39:55,339
And yeah, so sometimes the smaller the scope, the sillier your game might end up, it turns out.

633
00:39:57,004 --> 00:40:03,526
Both We Met in May and Game Jam Games both started as Game Jam Games.

634
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:04,946
Sybil, right?

635
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:05,666
Oh, yeah.

636
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:07,187
Sybil was it?

637
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:07,387
Yeah.

638
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:12,889
How many Game Jam Games have you put together altogether, and what's the secret sauce for

639
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:17,410
taking the concept of a jam game and making it its own thing?

640
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:22,051
Oh gosh, how many jam games have I made?

641
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:23,292
Like, so many.

642
00:40:23,312 --> 00:40:23,752
I think...

643
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:29,244
Honestly, almost all of the games I've worked on started at Jams,

644
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:32,050
just because I like working that way. So probably done like...

645
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:36,632
14 or 15 game jams at this point.

646
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:41,774
And God, actually way more than that,

647
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:44,715
because that prototype studio class was like a whole semester of game jams.

648
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:45,095
Oh my gosh.

649
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:46,135
I actually don't even know.

650
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:47,836
And like most of those aren't released.

651
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:49,116
Yeah.

652
00:40:49,256 --> 00:40:51,097
Sybil came out of that and also Bum Rush,

653
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:53,918
which was a game I did for No Quarter a long time ago.

654
00:40:55,578 --> 00:41:01,480
So I would say like game jams are really good because I think people can get.

655
00:41:01,915 --> 00:41:07,660
caught up too much in the details of implementation when working on a game, when sometimes, like,

656
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,843
the best game design can come out of, like, spontaneity and just, like, hacking something

657
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:16,988
together and, like, taking the, you know, the shortest road to something playable.

658
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:22,232
So I've always tried to have that approach where I, like, don't worry too much about

659
00:41:22,252 --> 00:41:25,795
the technicalities and just try to make something that people like.

660
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:32,399
either enjoy or understand the story I'm trying to tell or whatever my goal is. What matters most

661
00:41:32,419 --> 00:41:37,000
to me is that I can put it in front of someone and have them come away with whatever I intend.

662
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,542
And I think game jams are a really good way to be quickly iterative, because iteration,

663
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:47,722
I think, is one of the most important things to game design. It's like making something,

664
00:41:47,762 --> 00:41:51,763
putting it in front of a player, seeing how they react, and then tailoring the game further.

665
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:56,788
based on that feedback you get. And doing that over and over and over until your game works.

666
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,933
So basically the game jam is usually like the first iteration of that

667
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:09,221
and gives me at least a base to work with. Then maybe sometime I refactor it and not always.

668
00:42:10,982 --> 00:42:15,347
But regardless, like building it out after the jam just ends up being like more iteration like

669
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:16,748
that. It's just maybe not as...

670
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:21,512
not all in one weekend, spread out in a more reasonable way.

671
00:42:21,532 --> 00:42:26,853
So it's like starting a project in a game jam where you are in a time, a fixed time

672
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:30,774
window keeps you from lingering too long on making one thing work just right or falling

673
00:42:30,794 --> 00:42:31,834
into those kind of fallacies?

674
00:42:32,034 --> 00:42:37,055
Yeah, yeah, or like trying too many things, because a lot of games fall apart from being

675
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:43,756
just like too much stuff, too many mechanics or whatever, and I think jams can force you

676
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:44,556
to be focused.

677
00:42:46,037 --> 00:42:48,259
So that's something that helps me a lot.

678
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:52,924
And as someone who has always had full-time jobs where I like...

679
00:42:53,647 --> 00:42:58,871
I'm doing other stuff, it also gives me deliberate time to like work on something outside of

680
00:42:58,931 --> 00:43:05,435
work, and sometimes like, you know, as a busy adult or whatever, having that like time where

681
00:43:05,455 --> 00:43:08,557
I'm like explicitly just doing that one thing really helps me get it done.

682
00:43:09,037 --> 00:43:09,157
Yeah.

683
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:12,799
And I care first and foremost really about finishing things.

684
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,782
I tend to like, even if I'm not happy with the jam game at the end, I'll just release

685
00:43:17,822 --> 00:43:20,244
it anyway, as long as my teammates are okay with it.

686
00:43:20,704 --> 00:43:22,205
Just cause like, I care a lot about like...

687
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,662
Just like putting it out there and being like, it's done.

688
00:43:25,864 --> 00:43:26,945
Don't like leaving things hanging.

689
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:28,588
So jams are great.

690
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:32,174
Are you somebody who is constantly like in the back of your mind?

691
00:43:32,254 --> 00:43:33,516
Oh, this could be a game.

692
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:41,282
I do have a bunch of notes on my phone and in various Google Docs about different game

693
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:43,984
ideas I come up with while I'm just walking around or whatever.

694
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:46,825
But actually, it's kind of a bummer.

695
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:51,127
I used to have more of that when I was living in New York and walking around all the time.

696
00:43:52,948 --> 00:43:57,992
ever since I moved to Portland I'm not it's not it's still a walking city but I find myself like

697
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:05,298
having less ambient time just traveling um and so I've like had less of that over the years

698
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:11,282
and have had to like more deliberately like sit down and brainstorm occasionally um I think leisure

699
00:44:11,322 --> 00:44:14,765
time is really important coming up with like good ideas so

700
00:44:15,806 --> 00:44:18,672
But I have to kind of, I'm at a point in my life where I have to schedule that in.

701
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:19,654
You know?

702
00:44:19,674 --> 00:44:19,914
So...

703
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:20,635
Yeah.

704
00:44:20,756 --> 00:44:21,397
That's the game.

705
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:22,559
Schedule and lose your time.

706
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:23,200
Yeah.

707
00:44:23,581 --> 00:44:24,963
It's all spreadsheet secretly.

708
00:44:25,144 --> 00:44:25,464
Yeah.

709
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:26,146
Pretty much.

710
00:44:26,827 --> 00:44:27,047
Yeah.

711
00:44:27,573 --> 00:44:32,576
Well, we're kind of winding down here. So before you go, I'm

712
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:36,157
just, I just wanted to ask to for for people listening and

713
00:44:36,217 --> 00:44:39,759
people familiar with your work or who would like to, you know,

714
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:45,461
do similar stuff, you know, that's that's personal. You

715
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:49,403
know, what, what should people who want to make you these kinds

716
00:44:49,443 --> 00:44:53,645
of really intensely personal games keep in mind?

717
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:55,706
Hmm, I think

718
00:44:57,402 --> 00:45:04,348
Familiarizing oneself with, like, other, you know, personal games that have been done,

719
00:45:04,388 --> 00:45:07,991
like Dysphoria, for example, was really a big inspiration to me when I was getting started.

720
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:12,874
Looking, playing a lot of other games, and, like, keeping up with that stuff can really help,

721
00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:14,376
and just, like, seeing what's been done.

722
00:45:14,396 --> 00:45:14,456
And...

723
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:21,309
making sure to not only do that but also look to other mediums, because, you know, like, poetry,

724
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:27,173
for example, has a long history of personal writing. And you could say the same about film

725
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:33,497
or painting or anything else that has that kind of history. Like, people do personal work all the

726
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:39,741
time. And I think it's important to engage with that work, just to, like, give yourself ideas

727
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:44,704
and find inspiration. And when you do have those ideas, write them down and

728
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:53,014
try to act on them, try to make something really small and finish it, and actually release it and

729
00:45:53,054 --> 00:46:01,136
show it to people. I think that those two things, the act of engaging with other mediums and also

730
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:07,258
looking at other games and making something small and finishing it and releasing it,

731
00:46:07,378 --> 00:46:12,219
are two of the most important things, at least in my experience.

732
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,842
And of course, get an English degree like we all do.

733
00:46:16,302 --> 00:46:19,464
I mean, I'm glad I got it, but I'm always like, I don't know.

734
00:46:19,484 --> 00:46:19,964
It's interesting.

735
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:24,127
I like a lot of my friends, like, don't have any college degree.

736
00:46:24,327 --> 00:46:30,010
And like, I think you can do games with or without, it really doesn't matter.

737
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,652
All that matters is that you make stuff.

738
00:46:33,452 --> 00:46:38,275
Um, and don't let anyone like look down on you if you don't have a degree or if

739
00:46:38,315 --> 00:46:40,517
you don't have a degree from an Ivy league or whatever, like.

740
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:49,420
What matters in the end is your work and your creative output and that stuff.

741
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:56,984
So that's my belief, especially having been doing games for a while now.

742
00:46:57,005 --> 00:47:00,166
I never ask about people's academic history.

743
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:03,929
I just look at what they've made and play their games, and that's what I react to.

744
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:08,996
Yeah. Well, there you have it. Well, thanks so much for taking time out of your day and, uh,

745
00:47:09,876 --> 00:47:15,180
best of luck with, um, I'm sure you have multiple projects in the works and we'll

746
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,002
keep an eye out for them. So thank you so much. Thank you.

747
00:47:38,912 --> 00:47:46,513
All right, we're back and uh, yeah, that's Nina's super interesting, right? Even though she considers herself a plebe scrub

748
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:54,155
Not indie royalty a high-ranking plebs. Please scrub. Yeah. No, I think that's to aspire to yeah, she she's absolutely royalty

749
00:47:54,175 --> 00:47:56,656
Yeah, what what did you what did you think about that?

750
00:47:56,676 --> 00:48:01,437
What were some of the things you you uh that are just like just your mind is still reeling over right now

751
00:48:01,808 --> 00:48:06,234
I just, I like games that, like, the narrative just, like, knocks you off their feet, and,

752
00:48:06,294 --> 00:48:10,319
like, all of Nina's games seem to, like, accomplish that, where it feels like real people and

753
00:48:10,339 --> 00:48:14,464
real stories, and, like, I guess that's because they are based on real people and real stories,

754
00:48:14,564 --> 00:48:17,108
but, like, even when you do that, it's incredibly easy to...

755
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:22,651
lean into, I don't know, the idea of somebody or the idea of a situation and not have it

756
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:23,311
feel authentic.

757
00:48:23,412 --> 00:48:27,153
But like, all of hers do have that authentic feel to them.

758
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:33,615
Maybe because she's able to kind of look back and detach a little bit and go through her

759
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:36,216
archives of teenage poetry and everything like that.

760
00:48:36,276 --> 00:48:40,178
That's the secret to writing good characters, maybe, is teenage poetry.

761
00:48:40,938 --> 00:48:47,724
Yeah, it's, uh, it's like total honesty and then turning it into a story that

762
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:55,270
other people can experience and, uh, her ability to compartmentalize things,

763
00:48:55,711 --> 00:48:59,674
you know, even what, what's a, what kind of surprised me and maybe it shouldn't

764
00:48:59,694 --> 00:49:06,620
have, uh, for Sybil that she basically went back and internet stocked herself.

765
00:49:08,865 --> 00:49:12,504
So that she could remember this experience from several years ago.

766
00:49:13,186 --> 00:49:17,448
The phrase, uh, way back machine to find forum posts, like sent a shiver through my spine.

767
00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:24,212
Yeah. Like, oh my. Like I, yeah, seriously, as you know, people who work on the internet,

768
00:49:24,772 --> 00:49:30,896
uh, there's just this crap that we've made or written just in all kinds of places, probably

769
00:49:31,056 --> 00:49:37,259
archived in certain places. And just to think that, you know, actively going out and trying to find that.

770
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:44,183
I think the current, I guess my generation, right where I'm at, I think Nina and I are

771
00:49:44,203 --> 00:49:49,026
about the same age, somewhere in there, where I feel like exposure to the internet started

772
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:53,289
in about the teenage years when all those hormones and drama was running high.

773
00:49:53,349 --> 00:50:00,113
So that kind of weird artifact of your entire teenage, frozen in time, for you to look back

774
00:50:00,173 --> 00:50:01,434
on for inspiration later.

775
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:03,095
I've mentioned this before, but I have a...

776
00:50:04,495 --> 00:50:08,719
my childhood computer because my dad works in IT so I got like a hand-me-down computer that I had

777
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:13,582
in my bedroom as a teen and like there's still all these MSN chat logs on there just all these

778
00:50:13,622 --> 00:50:19,146
embarrassing conversations I had with my my anime group friends and like all of that but like

779
00:50:19,927 --> 00:50:24,808
Especially going into the next generation who's always online having all of this potential

780
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:28,289
research material to turn around and maybe their personal games will blow us out of the

781
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:29,049
water someday.

782
00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:30,790
It's just mind-blowing.

783
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:35,351
I think that all of our listeners should know that the next GDC podcast is just going to

784
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:40,152
be Alyssa reading out all of her MSN chat logs about anime.

785
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:44,696
It'll be me talking about all the fanfiction I wrote with friends that I will never give

786
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:48,800
usernames for under penalty of death. Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be, uh, we're gonna take

787
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,805
Nina's advice and be, we're just gonna really, you know, get personal here. We're going to

788
00:50:55,247 --> 00:50:56,788
talk about all of those things.

789
00:50:59,176 --> 00:51:00,817
I don't even know where to go from there.

790
00:51:01,957 --> 00:51:07,538
I'm just dwelling on all the embarrassing Inuyasha fanfiction I made in The Sims 1 back

791
00:51:07,578 --> 00:51:08,018
in the day.

792
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:09,359
I'm like, ugh.

793
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,420
No, I think that it would be good, actually.

794
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,360
Yeah.

795
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,540
Good video game.

796
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,680
Back to Nita's games.

797
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:15,940
Yeah.

798
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:24,563
Like, We Met in May is just like, and stuff like Sybil and How Do You Do It.

799
00:51:25,663 --> 00:51:35,769
They're, they drill down so deep into a certain emotion that, uh, yeah, it's just, it's just

800
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:38,751
pure, pure focus and pure honesty and pure authenticity.

801
00:51:38,831 --> 00:51:40,992
And I just, uh, I really admire that.

802
00:51:41,112 --> 00:51:42,453
You just don't see that so often.

803
00:51:42,945 --> 00:51:46,848
It's really interesting to hear how those two games in particular evolved from jam games,

804
00:51:46,908 --> 00:51:51,310
because it was a memory and a concept that started as a small thing and then once the

805
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:54,212
weekend session was done was able to expand and evolve.

806
00:51:54,232 --> 00:51:58,955
And I feel like it's the reason I asked about how many game jams she'd done to date, is

807
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:02,517
because you can do a million, you can have a million ideas and try a million prototypes

808
00:52:02,557 --> 00:52:04,158
and stuff like that, and they're not always going to work out.

809
00:52:04,238 --> 00:52:07,620
But then the ones that stick and the ones that you focus on and that you land on can

810
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,503
evolve into these really evocative and cool things like a lot of her games have.

811
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:18,905
Yeah, and the autobiographical nature of these, it just kind of, it, you know, it blows my mind,

812
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:29,408
because I was talking to you earlier for prep on this, just for me, I just bury all of my

813
00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:36,391
autobiographical things are all of the viewpoints that I might have or feelings I might have in

814
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:38,111
like robot metaphors.

815
00:52:39,252 --> 00:52:43,015
I'm also a coward who hides behind metaphors, so I feel that.

816
00:52:43,315 --> 00:52:49,301
Yeah, so and then with her, it's kind of like, well, when I was a kid, I used to jam plastic

817
00:52:49,321 --> 00:52:52,143
dolls together to try to figure out how sex worked.

818
00:52:52,204 --> 00:52:53,645
Which is relatable, because like...

819
00:52:54,285 --> 00:52:59,006
I also had that memory as a kid with like Barbies in the basement like being like, oh, this is what I saw on the

820
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:06,148
The tv show and then I would also have them like ride dinosaurs. So like it was all this exploration of possibilities of life

821
00:53:06,188 --> 00:53:11,829
I don't know where I was going with that. No, I mean, but but you're right though. Um the things that we

822
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:15,530
as human beings, um, you know, we're

823
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:21,111
Kind of ashamed to talk about or too shy to talk about it. Um

824
00:53:21,752 --> 00:53:26,994
that's what's good, I think, about Nina's games, like how we met in May, like talking about like

825
00:53:27,094 --> 00:53:36,457
the awkward, cute, fun absurdity of a new relationship, things like that. Because

826
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:45,001
everything, like we're not as individual people as unique as we think we are. We all have these

827
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:49,863
experiences that are, that each of us can relate to.

828
00:53:50,315 --> 00:53:54,777
Yeah, even if it's not something that people are prone to talking about, using it, like

829
00:53:54,797 --> 00:53:58,899
creating a game on that concept is, makes it easier to discuss that, like, in the lighthearted

830
00:53:58,959 --> 00:54:03,301
way with, uh, what's the, how do you do it?

831
00:54:03,561 --> 00:54:03,801
Yeah.

832
00:54:04,142 --> 00:54:07,903
Yeah, yeah, in a lighthearted way with that one, but then I also played her freshman year

833
00:54:07,923 --> 00:54:12,926
game, which is the game she was talking about, about sexual assault, where your character

834
00:54:12,966 --> 00:54:13,506
goes out.

835
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:18,570
to a club trying to meet up with a friend, the friend's not replying to her text messages,

836
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,952
and then the bouncer starts hitting on her and the situation spirals, but like,

837
00:54:22,653 --> 00:54:26,736
even that one was like evocative of like, real experiences that can be tough to talk about,

838
00:54:26,876 --> 00:54:31,039
but using a game to kind of like, share that and be like, no other people go through that,

839
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:31,820
it's just, it's really...

840
00:54:32,721 --> 00:54:33,542
I don't know, it's interesting.

841
00:54:33,582 --> 00:54:34,863
And it's kind of like freeing in a way

842
00:54:34,883 --> 00:54:37,727
to just see these experiences play out on this mass stage

843
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:38,768
that everyone can discuss.

844
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:39,229
Yeah.

845
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,471
And it helps people.

846
00:54:40,491 --> 00:54:43,314
It helps people feel less alone.

847
00:54:44,676 --> 00:54:45,237
That's a good thing.

848
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:48,806
She's doing the Lord's work, that Nina.

849
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,728
Okay, well, um, I think that, I think that's it.

850
00:54:54,428 --> 00:54:54,908
Yeah.

851
00:54:54,928 --> 00:54:55,268
Uh, yeah.

852
00:54:55,288 --> 00:54:56,389
For, for number three.

853
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:59,410
Um, yeah, we're still pretty new at this.

854
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,690
Uh, I think,

855
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:06,152
Oh, I feel that we should have asked Nina to plug her games, uh, where you can find

856
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:06,392
them.

857
00:55:06,432 --> 00:55:06,812
Yeah.

858
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:07,912
Oh, we should do that.

859
00:55:07,992 --> 00:55:08,593
We should do that.

860
00:55:08,713 --> 00:55:10,893
You can, um, uh, Nina says so.

861
00:55:12,097 --> 00:55:14,138
Nina says dot so would be the website.

862
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,760
You can find her independent work and she's also working at Tacoma developer Fulbright

863
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,240
currently.

864
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:24,922
So yeah, she has so many games and so many of them, you know, you can, uh, you can, you

865
00:55:24,942 --> 00:55:29,783
can download for, uh, you know, for free or like a small, a small donation to or a large

866
00:55:29,803 --> 00:55:30,224
donation.

867
00:55:30,624 --> 00:55:30,804
Yeah.

868
00:55:30,984 --> 00:55:31,244
Yeah.

869
