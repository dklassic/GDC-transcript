00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:11,154
Today we're talking about Race for the Galaxy, where I don't want to spend a lot of time

2
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:12,574
on the game itself.

3
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:20,639
I want to talk about what went into the design and hopefully help you design your own games.

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,041
Just to help me calibrate things a little bit, how many of you have played Race for

5
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:26,762
the Galaxy?

6
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:28,323
Ooh, very nice.

7
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:30,464
Now how many of you haven't?

8
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:32,705
Feel free to get the hands up.

9
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:34,326
Helps me calibrate.

10
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:35,606
You won't hurt my feelings.

11
00:00:37,352 --> 00:00:43,594
All right, we'll have a brief intro, then I'll do an overview of race to give you enough

12
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:49,217
structure to hang the design on, and then I'll get into the design stuff.

13
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:57,001
The takeaway that I hope you have is some ideas to help make your own games more strategic.

14
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:02,964
My name is Tom Lehman, I'm the designer of Race for the Galaxy.

15
00:01:03,444 --> 00:01:05,985
My first game was published in 1992.

16
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:09,066
I've been a full-time freelance designer since 2008.

17
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:17,069
I've done various board, dice, card, and with Matt Leacock, he brought me on board to do

18
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:21,491
the pandemic expansions with him, and so I've done some co-ops as well.

19
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:27,508
The game we're talking about today, Race for the Galaxy, is a card game, a tabletop card

20
00:01:27,548 --> 00:01:27,828
game.

21
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:31,490
It was published in 2007 by Rio Grande Games.

22
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,152
It's for two to four players and typically takes 20 to 40 minutes.

23
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:43,396
It's had five expansions so far, with another one that's been announced green-lit for next

24
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:43,696
year.

25
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:51,400
It's also had three spin-off games, Roll for the Galaxy, which is a dice version of Race,

26
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,282
and that itself has had two more expansions.

27
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:56,503
Rivalry will be out in June.

28
00:01:57,243 --> 00:02:03,847
It's had Jump Drive, an even simpler introductory card game, and then New Frontiers, which is

29
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:06,688
a board game, which will be out late summer.

30
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,022
It's, you can play it online in a browser at Board Game Arena.

31
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:16,005
They have over 5 million games of it played on that site.

32
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:25,132
There is a free open source PC version that if you have any interest in AI and neural

33
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:28,695
networks, I recommend that you take a look at the source.

34
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:33,158
That began as an AI project by Keldin Jones.

35
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:35,960
Built on top of that.

36
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,683
is a mobile app by Temple Gates Games, which supports both AI and internet play.

37
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:47,586
There's a Steam version as well, and they added a really nice UI on top of it.

38
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:50,407
So about the game.

39
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:54,549
It's a card game, and the cards are two different types.

40
00:02:54,629 --> 00:03:00,532
There are action cards that you use to select the phases, and there are game cards, which

41
00:03:00,572 --> 00:03:03,813
are the cards you actually play to build your space empire.

42
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:09,056
You start with four cards in hand out of a choice of six,

43
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:12,819
and you have one start world on the table

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,241
as the start of your empire.

45
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:19,124
During the game, players select their actions

46
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:20,945
secretly and simultaneously.

47
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:25,768
There are five possible phases, but only the selected phases

48
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:27,610
will occur in each round.

49
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,592
When a phase occurs, everyone can do it.

50
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,974
So if I call develop, everyone can place a development.

51
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:37,937
and the player who selects a phase gets a bonus in it.

52
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,821
So for example, in a three-player game,

53
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,365
if players A and C both chose develop,

54
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:46,207
it'll only happen once.

55
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:48,069
Everyone can place a development,

56
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,432
but A and C will get the bonus.

57
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:53,115
Then everyone will have a chance to settle,

58
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:54,857
and B will get the bonus.

59
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:59,905
One of the consequences of this is that every round tends to be different.

60
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:04,567
So, we might have a game that starts out in the first round with develop and settle,

61
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:07,768
then in the second round explore and consume,

62
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:11,069
and then in the third round explore, settle and produce

63
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:14,010
when the three players all choose different actions.

64
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,912
You explore to find new cards.

65
00:04:18,632 --> 00:04:21,393
You develop and settle to build your empire.

66
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:27,012
So develop is how we, the game cards are divided into developments and worlds,

67
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:29,855
and development is how we place the ones with the diamond.

68
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:34,921
Worlds with the circle are placed during the settle phase.

69
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:41,890
The gray worlds are essentially light developments in that they provide powers, but the colored

70
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,712
worlds, and there are four colors of worlds, are worlds that can have a good on them.

71
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:53,974
A good is just a face card, a face down card taken from the draw pile and placed on top

72
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:59,995
of the world, and in the computer implementations, you can see that they can color code those

73
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:04,696
according to the type of the world it's on, which determines what type of good it is.

74
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,289
Produce is what creates the goods on the production world,

75
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:13,130
and consume is how you convert goods

76
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,391
into VP chips and card draws.

77
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:17,751
So here we have two consume powers.

78
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:20,312
This one will take any type of good

79
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:22,793
and turn it into one victory point chip.

80
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,054
This one will take any type of good

81
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:27,995
and turn it into a victory point chip and a card draw.

82
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:33,725
Obviously the second power is better, but you can only use one of these powers on one

83
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:34,186
goods.

84
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,351
So if you had two goods, you'd get two victory points and one card draw.

85
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,394
So that gives us two phases in which you're building out your empire,

86
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:48,096
two phases in which you're producing and consuming goods.

87
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:51,578
And this leads to two different ways that the game can end.

88
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,881
It can end when any player gets 12 or more cards in their empire,

89
00:05:56,742 --> 00:06:00,585
or when the communal victory point pool is emptied.

90
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:02,086
In that case,

91
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:05,977
we add these 10-point chips to the pool

92
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:09,541
so that everyone gets all the chips that they're entitled to.

93
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:13,305
In both cases, we finish out the round and then we score it up.

94
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:16,669
There are three ways to score victory points.

95
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,973
There's the victory point chips that you earn during consume.

96
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,611
There's the value, the victory point value of the cards in your empire.

97
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:27,973
Cards in your hand do not score.

98
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:34,098
And finally there are the VP bonuses from the six cost developments.

99
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:39,203
Here we have a six cost development, Alien Tech Institute, and it pays off for all the

100
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:46,410
yellow worlds in your empire, plus any cards with the alien tag, such as Alien Tech Institute

101
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:46,830
itself.

102
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:51,817
And then whoever has the most victory points is the winner.

103
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:56,299
So that's Race for the Galaxy in a nutshell.

104
00:06:56,359 --> 00:07:00,880
Hopefully that'll be enough to let you hang the design

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,740
discussion on it.

106
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,781
It's a game with simultaneous action selection.

107
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:08,542
You're finding cards that fit together to form strategies.

108
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:10,662
You're doing empire building.

109
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:12,343
You're building VP engines.

110
00:07:12,803 --> 00:07:15,143
And you're trying to score those six cost bonuses.

111
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,785
So now we're going to dive into the actual design.

112
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:24,307
The first thing to notice is that unlike many Euro games,

113
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:28,507
this game does not have a set number of turns.

114
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:33,349
That instantly produces strategy along the lines of how fast

115
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:34,909
do you do something?

116
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:37,350
Do you do a quick tableau rush where

117
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,230
you're putting out lots of cheap worlds and developments?

118
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,893
to try to end the game quickly before someone else gets going?

119
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:50,839
Or do you try for more expensive but denser with more victory point worlds and developments?

120
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,124
Do you, on the produce-consume side, you could put down just a couple of production worlds

121
00:07:56,164 --> 00:08:00,488
that have consumption, not all of them do, and run that

122
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:07,176
for victory points immediately, or you could put down production worlds and then nice consume

123
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,219
powers in order to get more victory points.

124
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:17,468
So simply by not forcing a set number of turns, you instantly get some strategy about the

125
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:17,829
pace.

126
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,862
But you get even more strategy out of the fact that you have two different end conditions.

127
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:31,206
This creates strategic tension in the game as to whether you invest in a victory point engine,

128
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:37,349
do you invest in order to get the discounts to develop and settle and build an empire,

129
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:40,591
or do you try some sort of hybrid strategy in between the two?

130
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:49,680
As a thought experiment, what if Hearthstone, a popular digital card game, or Magic the

131
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:56,104
Gathering, a popular tabletop card game, had two main victory conditions, ones that happened

132
00:08:56,164 --> 00:08:56,844
all the time.

133
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:02,527
So imagine that the normal way you win in those games is you drive your opponent to

134
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:03,228
zero health.

135
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:09,411
However, imagine that they had a tower that they could build, and if they got it to level

136
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,112
then they instantly won the game.

137
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:17,688
Now suddenly you're going to think about, well, I could put minions that attack my opponent,

138
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:20,909
but I could also put out minions that build the tower.

139
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,290
Which do I want to do?

140
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:29,193
I can put out defenders for myself so that they defend my health, or I could try to defend

141
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:31,394
those minions who are building the tower.

142
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:40,122
And in particular, as the tower rose, if its height interacted with the various powers

143
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:46,365
of cards, right, if they start to interact, so if at, say, fifth level, archers fired

144
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:51,107
every turn instead of when they first entered the battlefield, and, you know, at eighth

145
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:56,350
level ballistas worked and dragons flew off the top of the tower and so on, you could

146
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,311
get a lot of interactions in the game.

147
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:05,424
I'm not saying that a game is better if it has two different winning conditions, but

148
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:10,989
if you have it, it's the easiest way I know to introduce strategic tension into a game.

149
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:15,072
So how do you pay for cards?

150
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:20,568
In race, you pay for cards by discarding other cards.

151
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:23,109
So here we have a hand of six cards.

152
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:29,973
We want to place this development terraforming robot out of our hand, and we have to pay

153
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,514
the cost in the diamond.

154
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:35,496
So we have to discard three cards out of our hand to pay for it.

155
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:36,676
There's no mana.

156
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,078
The cards themselves are the money.

157
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:44,845
If we'd called develop, then we'd have an extra card left in our hand

158
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:48,948
because it gives the bonus for development is that it gives us a discount of one.

159
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:55,273
So one way to think about the cards in your hand in race

160
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:57,855
is that they each represent an opportunity.

161
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:02,693
Something that you can put into play or not put into play.

162
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:07,318
And this gets us to what economists call opportunity cost.

163
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:11,183
Where the cost of something isn't just the resources spent,

164
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:13,525
but what you could have done instead.

165
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:21,591
So some examples from regular life, in college in most majors you have a limited number of electives.

166
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:27,436
When you take an elective, the cost isn't just the tuition and your time and your effort,

167
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,898
but it's also the fact that you could have taken some other elective

168
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:34,641
and what you might have gained from that elective instead.

169
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:40,790
If you're at a seminar session, the cost is, well, you could be, instead of listening to me right now,

170
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:44,496
you could be in some other room listening to someone else, and that's part of the cost

171
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:50,125
that you're paying. And similarly, job offers, investments, all these things have opportunity cost.

172
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:54,967
returning the games, if you have a system that gives you mana,

173
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,028
so that you're spending mana to place your cards instead of

174
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:03,430
spending the cards, then you have a much smaller opportunity

175
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,132
cost. Say I have four mana and I have two four-cost cards.

176
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:11,613
Well, I can place one or I can place the other, so there's

177
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:13,394
still an opportunity cost there.

178
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:18,680
but after I place it on the next turn I have four mana and I can place the other one.

179
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:22,665
So the opportunity cost in those sort of systems is much smaller

180
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:25,509
because you're merely postponing an opportunity

181
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,733
as opposed to giving it up when you discard a card.

182
00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:33,325
Opportunity cost is often overlooked in games.

183
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:37,088
Richard Garfield talks about the fact that when he first

184
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:40,170
started designing Magic, he didn't think he could have

185
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:42,112
zero-cost cards in the game.

186
00:12:42,753 --> 00:12:44,094
He thought it would break the game.

187
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:49,388
And he came to realize that there's an opportunity cost in magic

188
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:55,916
in that you want your deck to be as small as possible so that it's efficient and the combinations arise.

189
00:12:56,577 --> 00:13:02,144
And that this cost is real and meant that he could have zero cost cards in the game.

190
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,307
Because when you draw an Ornithopter...

191
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:09,176
That's a card that you drew instead of some other card,

192
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:12,337
and that some other card might have been more useful for you.

193
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:14,458
So even though the cost is zero,

194
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:17,799
there's still the cost of the slot in your deck.

195
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,880
And we know that that cost is at least as much

196
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,162
as a zero-two flying artifact creature.

197
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:32,759
Returning to race, in a typical game of race, players draw about 30 to 50 cards per game,

198
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,501
but they're only building 8 to 12 of them.

199
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:41,486
This card sifting mechanism allows for a lot of varieties in strategy.

200
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:45,269
In the race base game, you have 114 cards, 91 of them are unique.

201
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:51,496
So you can have many different strategies,

202
00:13:51,556 --> 00:13:54,216
because if you draw a card that doesn't fit your strategy,

203
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:57,898
you just throw it away, using it to pay for some other card.

204
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:03,980
Now, there are other approaches to variety in a game.

205
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,801
Deck construction, the problem there

206
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:08,481
is that you need a deck to play.

207
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,662
That's an investment of time in advance.

208
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,323
Drafting, if it breaks up the play,

209
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:17,264
if you do it over several rounds, like in Seven Wonders.

210
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:22,142
Then you have this, I play, then I draft,

211
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,582
then I play, then I draft,

212
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:26,163
and that can take people out of the game sometimes.

213
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:29,384
Or alternatively, it must be done before play.

214
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:32,826
In deck building, as a Dominion,

215
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:36,347
you have a large variety of kingdom cards

216
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,727
that's possible to be played,

217
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,308
but you're using only a subset in each game.

218
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:44,983
Debt sifting integrates variety into the gameplay.

219
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:51,528
And the other benefit of it is that it instantly adds a new

220
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:53,769
class of decisions, hand management.

221
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,672
You have a bunch of cards in your hand at the start of the

222
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,734
game, you can play them all to put down a big purchase.

223
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,936
But then you won't be able to do anything for several rounds

224
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:05,537
until you repunish those cards.

225
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:09,924
Furthermore, if you have cards that you want to save for the

226
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:11,825
end game, they have a cost.

227
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:15,007
They're like a boat anchor in your hand, because you can't

228
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:16,728
spend them to pay for something else.

229
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,991
There are some criticisms of deck sifting.

230
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,473
One is that some players find it too angsty.

231
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:28,576
The thought that they discard a card that two turns later

232
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:32,618
they realize, oh, I really wanted to keep that card, for

233
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:34,279
them is just a total turn off.

234
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,800
And the other one.

235
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,141
is that experienced players have a deck knowledge advantage.

236
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:42,663
They know what's in the deck, so they

237
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:44,884
know some of the combos they could wait for,

238
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:47,206
and that informs their discarding decisions.

239
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:50,428
Now, the experienced player issue

240
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,151
comes up in all games, whether it's a co-op,

241
00:15:55,352 --> 00:15:58,214
whether it's a two-player competitive game,

242
00:15:58,354 --> 00:15:59,975
or a many-player competitive game.

243
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:03,157
So I'm not that much worried about it, but I do note it.

244
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,919
So where does all this come from?

245
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:11,101
there is a Euro game called Puerto Rico by Andreas Seyfarth

246
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:13,543
and it was a very popular game.

247
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,446
And Stefan Bruch, the head of Olea,

248
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:18,287
the publisher of Puerto Rico,

249
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:22,331
felt he wanted a card game

250
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:26,034
and he had a very limited time to produce one

251
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:28,616
to capitalize on Puerto Rico's success.

252
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:32,740
And Andreas Seyfarth's prototype wasn't working.

253
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:37,399
So he contacted several designers, including myself,

254
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,662
and asked us to essentially become backup Andreas Seyfors

255
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:45,024
and to design games independently

256
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:48,607
that if Andreas couldn't get his prototype working,

257
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:50,868
that he would then publish instead.

258
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:54,162
So I designed the Puerto Rico card game.

259
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:57,863
I spent three months, I went through three major iterations.

260
00:16:58,423 --> 00:17:01,444
I collapsed Puerto Rico's cost structure

261
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:03,604
from one to ten to one to six.

262
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,645
I figured out a bunch of things involving this card sifting.

263
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:09,885
And I presented it to Stefan at the gathering of friends.

264
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:13,266
We played it for a week, we made some small tweets,

265
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:14,566
and at the end of it he said,

266
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:17,507
Tom, if it was up to him, he'd offer me a contract.

267
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:21,821
But Andreas was involved, so he took it back to Andreas.

268
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:25,764
Andreas looked at it, said, ooh, this solves my problems,

269
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:27,805
but I still want to do my prototype.

270
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:32,008
And so Stefan Bruch combined Andreas Seyffardt's prototype,

271
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:34,930
my cost structure that I developed,

272
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:38,413
and his own ideas about market slips together

273
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:39,593
to form San Juan.

274
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:42,656
I get a royalty from San Juan, but it

275
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:46,618
was a bit disappointing not to see the game that I had designed

276
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,539
actually published.

277
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,424
Well, San Juan came out, it's a perfectly fine game,

278
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:56,548
but I felt it had not pushed the variety button

279
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,291
the way I thought you could push it.

280
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:02,536
In particular, San Juan has 29 unique cards

281
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:03,337
out of a deck of 110.

282
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:10,729
Furthermore, I had an unpublished collectible card game called Duel from the Stars

283
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,031
that I felt would be a very good setting,

284
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:19,095
and I had evolved some new action selection ideas over the year and a half intervening.

285
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:24,079
And those are the three things that I put together to form Race for the Galaxy

286
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,362
after getting permission from ALEA and offering them first right of refusal.

287
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:36,658
So the thing that had bothered me about Puerto Rico's action mechanism, it's a classic Euro

288
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:36,958
game.

289
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:43,739
The play goes clockwise, it's not simultaneous, and the interactions between the player are

290
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:48,360
very much this, you constrain the next player as you go around the table.

291
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,720
You limit their options, you block them.

292
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,881
In particular, when you pick a roll, which is their term for an action, you block it

293
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:57,941
for the rest of the round.

294
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,101
No one else can pick it.

295
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:02,124
You all get to do it, but you don't get the bonus.

296
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:09,550
This phenomena in which you are affecting the next player downstream the most,

297
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,872
J.C. Lawrence has termed left-right binding,

298
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:15,334
and it was beginning to bother me.

299
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,738
In particular, I played a number of five-player games at Puerto Rico

300
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:22,700
in which I had a player upstream of me

301
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:25,403
who would just hammer me

302
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:27,905
and make it so I could never win.

303
00:19:28,762 --> 00:19:33,707
Now, if that player had won, I wouldn't be upset, but he never won either, right?

304
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,929
But his attitude was that was how you play the game.

305
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:40,052
You just squeeze the next player as hard as possible.

306
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:45,697
Furthermore, I had played some five-player games where we had four experienced players

307
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:47,118
and one novice player.

308
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:52,282
And in those games, the player downstream of the novice player always won.

309
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:56,486
And so I was really getting to the point where I was going,

310
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:58,228
I don't like this left-right binding.

311
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:02,331
And what if the actions were instead picked simultaneously?

312
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:06,763
Doing so gives a greater sense of player agency.

313
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:09,844
If there's an action you really want to do, you just pick it.

314
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:13,246
It eliminates the left-right binding problem.

315
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:16,587
And the game can now go in many more directions

316
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:20,429
because you're no longer forced to pick different roles.

317
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:23,071
You can have all the players pick the same role,

318
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:25,412
as I showed you in an earlier slide.

319
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:29,254
Once I made that decision, then I started going,

320
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,315
well, what if the build tempo per round?

321
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:35,864
was 0 to 2 instead of 0 to 1.

322
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:41,968
In Puerto Rico, you only have a single build action, so the buildings, which is one of

323
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,970
the ways the game can end, only grow at a certain rate.

324
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:52,355
What if we had both develop and settle so that you can potentially go 0 to 2 times?

325
00:20:55,794 --> 00:20:59,415
Then I started wondering, well, if I'm going to improve the Empire building,

326
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,096
what am I going to do about the produce-consume stuff?

327
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:06,277
What if the consume bonus was double the victory points?

328
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:12,339
None of this namby-pamby, you know, just plus one extra VP in the captain role in Puerto Rico.

329
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,840
And from those ideas, I began to think about a game

330
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:21,222
where the players had much more control over how the game evolved.

331
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:27,866
The issue with doing simultaneous action selection

332
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:32,088
is that you want all the actions to be equally viable

333
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:35,210
to be called in the early, mid, and late game.

334
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,111
It's not very interesting if you have some action

335
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,292
that's only going to be called in the late game

336
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:44,674
because then there isn't a lot of bluffing or anything.

337
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:47,856
So I started looking at the five actions.

338
00:21:48,116 --> 00:21:49,336
Explore was easy.

339
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:51,977
You're always looking for cards that fit together.

340
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:56,714
Sometimes, even on the final turn, you're doing a Hail Mary,

341
00:21:56,734 --> 00:22:01,797
you know, I will explore and hope to draw the one card that

342
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:04,119
will save my position and pull out the win.

343
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,042
Develop was looking pretty good in that you often want to

344
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:11,904
build some technologies early, get some powers down on the

345
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:14,746
board, and you want to build those six devs in the late.

346
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:16,367
But what about the mid-game?

347
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:26,633
In both Puerto Rico and San Juan, the buildings that give you bonuses have no powers.

348
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:29,615
They're just for scoring points at the end of the game.

349
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:35,839
I said, what if I put powers on them so now I had a reason to build them before the end

350
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:36,339
of the game?

351
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:41,880
So here if I'm committed to doing a yellow strategy where I'm putting down lots of these alien worlds,

352
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,801
this minus two discount makes it a lot cheaper.

353
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:48,882
And if I have three or four yellow worlds, I'll actually pull a profit.

354
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:52,542
So now I have a reason to build this before the endgame.

355
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:54,983
And that sort of fits develop.

356
00:22:56,503 --> 00:23:01,904
Settle, well, you often want to settle in the early game in order to get your card flow going,

357
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:05,825
in order to put down worlds and get some goods on them and sell them.

358
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:08,187
in order to get more cards.

359
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:13,828
There also obviously you want to build them in the mid-game in order to set up your VP

360
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:14,329
engines.

361
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:17,590
But why would anyone want to settle late?

362
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:24,032
From Duel from the Stars I always had this idea that there would be two ways to place

363
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:30,394
worlds that you could both settle them peacefully or you could settle them by military conquest.

364
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:31,795
So

365
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:35,694
I decided to take that from Deal From The Stars.

366
00:23:35,774 --> 00:23:38,495
So here's how military works.

367
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:43,778
You hear I have a start world that gives me two military, I put down this development

368
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:49,942
that gives me three more, and that lets me overcome the defense of this card, which in

369
00:23:50,002 --> 00:23:54,545
turn gives me another two military, which lets me put down this seven card, which is

370
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:56,026
worth a lot of victory points.

371
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:04,114
Now, when you do the big military strategy, you often don't want to be calling settle

372
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:05,115
in the middle of the game.

373
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:10,961
You don't want to help the people who are doing these VP engines build their engine.

374
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:17,207
So you'll save your worlds and then slam them down at the endgame because you don't have

375
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:23,052
to pay any cards to place the worlds that you do with a military.

376
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:28,727
The non-military worlds are essentially placed exactly the same as the developments.

377
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,328
You have to discard cards equal to their cost.

378
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:37,332
And the only difference is that the bonus is you draw a card after you place the world

379
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:38,772
instead of getting a discount.

380
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:42,354
So now I had Settle working.

381
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:45,276
Produce had the opposite problem.

382
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:50,259
In both San Juan and Puerto Rico, Produce looms too large.

383
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,520
It has a who bells the cat issue.

384
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:56,420
When you call produce, particularly in Puerto Rico,

385
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,921
then the players after you in the turn order,

386
00:25:00,342 --> 00:25:02,863
they get first crack at selling for goods,

387
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:05,043
for shipping them for VPs,

388
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:08,565
and you don't get much for calling produce.

389
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:11,486
So everyone wants someone else to call produce.

390
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:15,969
So I decided to solve that and I did two things.

391
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:19,751
The first thing is I moved produce to the very end of the round.

392
00:25:20,372 --> 00:25:26,416
So if you call produce, then next round you, like all the other players, can now call an

393
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:27,897
action that benefits from it.

394
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:31,559
The second was I introduced windfall worlds.

395
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:35,301
All the worlds I've been showing you up to now were solid circles.

396
00:25:35,822 --> 00:25:38,343
This one has a halo, which is a windfall world.

397
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:42,897
The production worlds only get goods when produce is called.

398
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:47,082
The windfall worlds get a good upon being settled.

399
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:50,206
And so now you could settle a windfall world,

400
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:54,430
sell it this alien good for a large number of cards,

401
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:57,314
and don't call produce.

402
00:25:58,883 --> 00:26:02,387
However, this is a sort of a two-sided, two-edged sword

403
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:06,692
because the Windfall worlds don't get goods during produce.

404
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,597
They need a power or the player has to call produce

405
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:13,440
for its bonus, which is to produce a good

406
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:15,242
on one of your Windfall worlds.

407
00:26:15,903 --> 00:26:19,444
So I both gave away to avoid calling produce

408
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,485
and an incentive to call produce.

409
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:25,566
And with those two changes, now produce was being called.

410
00:26:26,186 --> 00:26:29,007
It wasn't so dominant the way it is in Puerto Rico,

411
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,168
but it was still being called throughout the game.

412
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:38,110
For consumption, its double VP bonus works well in the late game,

413
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:39,550
but...

414
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:42,921
Why would you ever double your VPs in your early game?

415
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:49,908
We all know for engine building games that you want to build your engine, then score

416
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:51,129
the victory points from them.

417
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:56,730
So, consume trade is the bonus that we use to sell goods,

418
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:59,934
and it only sells the goods for that player.

419
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:04,960
Now, this may seem very inconsistent with the rest of the game, right?

420
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,264
When you call develop, everyone gets the place of develop.

421
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:11,207
When you call settle, everyone gets the place of world.

422
00:27:12,185 --> 00:27:17,789
But when you call consume trade, only you get to sell the good for cards.

423
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,630
Why is this going on?

424
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:20,831
Two reasons.

425
00:27:21,512 --> 00:27:25,395
One is the one I've already alluded to, so that consume is called early on.

426
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:28,898
But the other is to solve the rich gets richer problem.

427
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:31,379
And this is a problem in many games.

428
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,603
So, in Race, if you have an alien production world,

429
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:39,104
and it automatically produces on Produce,

430
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,125
automatically gets a good on Produce,

431
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,707
and then if you could automatically sell it,

432
00:27:44,147 --> 00:27:46,669
when anyone called Trade,

433
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:50,832
then you would have this huge advantage over other players,

434
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:54,114
and the game would be all about getting the big world down first.

435
00:27:55,355 --> 00:27:59,736
So to prevent Rich Gets Richer, I say trade is a bonus.

436
00:28:00,536 --> 00:28:04,457
Now this Rich Gets Richer issue is an issue in all of these games.

437
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:07,578
And they all solve it, but in different ways.

438
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:12,820
Puerto Rico has a trading house, and your sales are often blocked.

439
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,041
So if someone sells coffee to the trading house in front of you,

440
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:21,342
you can't sell coffee, their high-valued good.

441
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:28,565
If there is coffee left in the trading house from an earlier trade phase, you can't sell it.

442
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:36,008
San Juan uses lower sales prices, those are those market slips I mentioned earlier,

443
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:40,750
and introduces compensation. They have buildings such as the poor house,

444
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:45,313
which if you have the poor house and not very many cards, you get extra cards.

445
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:50,895
And that's very much a sort of casual euro approach to this issue.

446
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:57,599
Roll uses lower returns when you factor in the cost of the producer and shipper dice.

447
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,983
And Waywa boosted its floor tremendously as an alternative to the point where some people

448
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:10,687
don't even bother trading goods to run their economy in Roll, they just use its floor.

449
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:15,390
Race gives you the largest return but requires player action.

450
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,532
So here we have one issue solved four different ways.

451
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,353
Each way is different.

452
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:24,790
in character with the game itself.

453
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:30,973
Explore also has two action cards with different bonuses,

454
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:33,414
allowing you to either get one extra card

455
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:37,036
or to go deep into the deck to try to find the card you

456
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:37,616
really want.

457
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,980
Simultaneous actions led to some very interesting player interactions.

458
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,941
First off, there's bluffing and gambling in the actual calling of the phases.

459
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:58,963
So for example, if I have an alien good and my hand is full with ten cards, and I look

460
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:02,944
around the table and I see someone who's likely to develop and another person who's likely

461
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:10,946
to settle, I might just call trade so that I refill my hand after I both place a development

462
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:11,506
and a world.

463
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:14,050
But those other two players might go, hmm.

464
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:17,803
Tom has an alien good and a handful of cards.

465
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:20,224
We'll just call it Splore.

466
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,505
He'll sell that good for a bunch of cards

467
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:25,506
and then have to discard them because he's

468
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:26,487
over the hand limit.

469
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:28,567
And so he screwed himself.

470
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:31,508
And so you get a lot of this double think

471
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:33,169
bluffing interactions.

472
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:35,810
You also get gambling interactions.

473
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,351
On the final turn, you might have, oh, I have the

474
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:42,253
development in the world that will let me win the game, but

475
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:43,833
I need both phases called.

476
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:49,325
And then you look around and you go, oh, that person's likely to call settle, so I'll call

477
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:50,648
develop and hope it works.

478
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,372
Then within the game, there's also leeching and blunting effects.

479
00:30:56,173 --> 00:30:58,334
So develop is the second phase here,

480
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:02,217
and if I see a player who's set up to do lots of develop calls,

481
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:03,838
if I put down this bank,

482
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:06,920
I'll get my cut every time they call develop.

483
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:11,324
Similarly, if someone looks like they're going to call produce

484
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:14,706
to refill an alien windfall,

485
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:19,408
then I can put down this lost species world here.

486
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,629
It gives me a genes good,

487
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:24,330
which is almost as good as an alien one,

488
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,411
and it gives me two extra cards on produce.

489
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:31,653
And this, once I put this on the table,

490
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:33,833
the player who was thinking about calling produce

491
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,494
probably isn't going to call it in future turns.

492
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:38,675
So I have blunted their advantage.

493
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:43,366
There's also pressuring interactions in the build tempo.

494
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:46,829
If I'm low on cards and my opponents call both develop

495
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:49,030
and settle, do I put down two weak cards,

496
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,232
one strong card, one weak and save?

497
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:56,014
Every mis-build is potentially incurring

498
00:31:56,074 --> 00:32:00,777
an opportunity cost, because if the game goes out

499
00:32:00,797 --> 00:32:05,320
on tableau and I don't have all my cards on the table,

500
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,182
every slot that I didn't fill is lost victory points.

501
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:14,215
So here we were finding all these interesting player

502
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:17,057
interactions, yet one of the criticisms of race

503
00:32:17,618 --> 00:32:19,599
is that it's multiplayer solitaire.

504
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:23,783
To some extent, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

505
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:25,904
If you play the game very heads down,

506
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:27,806
if you never look at what's going on.

507
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:33,312
in the other player's tableau, if you never make any predictions about what they're going

508
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:36,376
to call, it will feel like multiplayer solitaire.

509
00:32:36,436 --> 00:32:37,997
There's no forced interaction.

510
00:32:38,618 --> 00:32:43,724
But strategy games work when all players do their best to try to win, and the people who

511
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:46,668
do pay attention generally do a lot better in race.

512
00:32:48,597 --> 00:32:51,041
In addition to simultaneous action selection,

513
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:53,706
Race also uses simultaneous play,

514
00:32:53,866 --> 00:32:56,290
which can really speed up a multiplayer game.

515
00:32:57,131 --> 00:33:00,096
So Race plays maybe five minutes longer

516
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:01,919
when it's a four-player game

517
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:03,541
as opposed to a two-player game.

518
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:08,856
When you introduce simultaneous play, that has a bunch of issues around it.

519
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:15,337
First off, there will be times when you have to serialize play in order, because you have

520
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:19,738
some situation where if someone does something, then the game may end and the other person

521
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:25,039
needs that information, because they may do something that could end the game and you

522
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:28,040
have to resolve that timing issue somehow.

523
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,841
But as a philosophy, you want to slow down play only when you need to.

524
00:33:33,615 --> 00:33:34,496
and keep it going.

525
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:40,819
So two things that help you do that is one is to hide non-essential information.

526
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:47,342
So in race, the discards are face down that you use to pay for cards so that people can't

527
00:33:47,382 --> 00:33:52,425
go, well, I don't want to decide what I'm doing until I see what you're discarding.

528
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:54,365
I just hide that information.

529
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:58,988
Similarly, you want to minimize your number of synchronization points.

530
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:06,403
If a race has one main synchronization point, which is during the action selection in Revelation,

531
00:34:07,064 --> 00:34:11,705
then players who want to can go ahead with their turns while you might still be exploring,

532
00:34:11,845 --> 00:34:13,086
and that's perfectly fine.

533
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:19,148
If you introduce too many synchronization points, you will not get benefit from simultaneous

534
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:19,448
play.

535
00:34:21,991 --> 00:34:24,233
Turning to the actual design of cards,

536
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:27,675
I knew I wanted multiple powers on cards.

537
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:30,017
So here we have this terraforming robot,

538
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:33,539
and here in the settle phase it gets a card on settle,

539
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:36,821
and here there's a consume power as well.

540
00:34:37,762 --> 00:34:39,763
And so this card could work

541
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:42,025
with either a produce-consume strategy

542
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:44,186
or an empire-building strategy.

543
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:47,769
And I knew I wanted these multi-power cards

544
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:50,590
in order to get the variety of strategy

545
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,531
that I wanted to pack into the game.

546
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:56,254
However, putting multiple powers at fire

547
00:34:56,314 --> 00:34:59,096
at different times is tough.

548
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:02,117
It really increases the cognitive load of the game.

549
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:05,079
And you want to make that decision carefully.

550
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:15,220
The, you know, some people refer to race not having a learning curve, but a learning spike

551
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,141
that the players get impaled on.

552
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:24,922
And a lot of that cognitive load that's blamed on the icons is actually due to the multiple

553
00:35:24,982 --> 00:35:25,423
powers.

554
00:35:26,523 --> 00:35:28,683
This did influence the card graphics.

555
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:35,585
We added these little swooshes behind things so that players could easily look across the

556
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,466
cards in their empire and see the powers.

557
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:45,525
Another issue when you start thinking about designing a game, a card game, is, well, what

558
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:48,167
type of powers do you want to put in the game?

559
00:35:49,008 --> 00:35:54,572
Do you want big effects, where the game is mostly about assembling a combo of cards?

560
00:35:55,073 --> 00:36:00,657
Or do you want smaller, incremental powers, where it's mostly about gaining an edge and

561
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:04,099
slowly getting more powerful than your opponent?

562
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,821
And this is a spectrum.

563
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:08,723
Your game could fall anywhere between these things.

564
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,811
At the gain and edge thing, sort of the meta strategy

565
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,592
is making lots of small decisions well

566
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,633
in order to gradually produce a win.

567
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:21,714
In the combo thing, often the meta strategy becomes

568
00:36:22,274 --> 00:36:25,995
stave off defeat until your combo arrives in your hand

569
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:28,355
and then play it and just take out your opponent.

570
00:36:29,216 --> 00:36:32,157
So for example, in Hearthstone,

571
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:36,418
you often see someone defending themselves,

572
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,958
they have some defender in front of them with high defense.

573
00:36:39,596 --> 00:36:43,779
And then when their combo arrives, it's like double their defense, double their defense,

574
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:47,241
make the attack equal to their defense, wham, take out their opponent.

575
00:36:48,762 --> 00:36:50,523
And that's an example of a big combo.

576
00:36:51,403 --> 00:36:56,026
I tend to like to make games with lots of tough decisions with good strategic tension,

577
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:58,968
so I'm more on this end of the spectrum here.

578
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,629
But it is a spectrum.

579
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:06,012
There's nothing about card sifting or anything that I've talked about so far that says it

580
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:07,433
has to be gain and edge.

581
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:08,591
Right?

582
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:16,095
Glory to Rome is an example of a game that uses big combos that lets people use the discard

583
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:21,739
pile to assemble their combos and is notorious for teetering on the edge of control before

584
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:24,881
suddenly someone puts in a combo and wins the game.

585
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:35,387
But I wanted to go with the smaller, simpler powers and one of my other reasons for doing

586
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:37,188
it was reduce the cognitive load.

587
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:41,889
As I'm sure the people here who haven't played race before have already noticed,

588
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:44,511
there's a fair amount that's going on in the game.

589
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:47,313
And so the powers in race are very simple.

590
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:53,538
They're like see an extra card in explore, or get a little extra military, or get a card

591
00:37:53,578 --> 00:37:57,561
in the middle of the various phases, or add a new consume power.

592
00:37:57,881 --> 00:37:59,803
They're all very small and incremental.

593
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,706
There are only three powers that really break the rules.

594
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:11,191
One of them is paying for military worlds in order to connect up the military game and the non-military game.

595
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:13,572
I felt that connection was important.

596
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:20,163
Another is to break that rule after having carefully built consume trade as a bonus,

597
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:22,583
is to have some powers that break that rule.

598
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:28,025
And the third is normally you can only make victory points through your empire.

599
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:34,246
But there are some powers that let you spend cards directly for victory point tips,

600
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:35,966
and that breaks that rule.

601
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:39,147
Those three I felt were important enough to put in the game,

602
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:41,988
but all the rest I went with very simple powers.

603
00:38:43,627 --> 00:38:48,629
So with simple powers, you have the choice of do you put text on the cards or do you

604
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:49,809
just have icons.

605
00:38:50,389 --> 00:38:52,970
And we went with having a mixture.

606
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,651
Here we have powers, no text on this card.

607
00:38:57,272 --> 00:39:00,733
Here we have some powers with no text that are pretty simple.

608
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:07,335
And then we highlight this phase and we have text right here for the more complex power.

609
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:10,996
Something we didn't expect was that...

610
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:16,215
If you have some powers without text,

611
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:20,658
a lot of players then assume all the powers don't have text,

612
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:23,080
even when there's text right there on the card.

613
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:26,943
And so that was a bit of a learning experience.

614
00:39:27,623 --> 00:39:30,445
Our model with the textless powers was to keep them,

615
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:32,426
you know, similar to road signs,

616
00:39:32,526 --> 00:39:34,768
just a couple basic shapes and a number.

617
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,811
This is normally a big mistake.

618
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:40,986
Okay?

619
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:45,509
Normally you want to do everything you can in a game to make it accessible.

620
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:51,192
Because if people won't play your game, then, you know, who cares about the replay value?

621
00:39:51,812 --> 00:39:56,415
But with Race, we had noted during playtesting that we had people playing the game hundreds

622
00:39:56,455 --> 00:39:59,657
of times, even thousands of times before publication.

623
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:04,780
And so we backed off a little bit on the accessibility

624
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,061
to emphasize the ease of road play.

625
00:40:07,561 --> 00:40:10,423
Most players who can handle the graphics,

626
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:13,484
I mean there's some people that it's just not the way their brain works,

627
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:17,487
but the people who can handle the graphics,

628
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:20,608
they find that the game clicks after a couple plays

629
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:24,290
and then it allows them to play much faster and easier.

630
00:40:25,779 --> 00:40:31,305
For the spinoff games, these are geared to more casual audiences, and there we put both

631
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:35,369
complicated icons and the text right there.

632
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,572
Similarly, here this is from New Frontiers.

633
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:45,540
And then for Jump Drive, which has very simple powers, we just put a few helper words in

634
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,541
the middle of a power.

635
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,790
The icons paid dividends when Race was ported to a device,

636
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,471
because you can actually see it pretty well on your phone.

637
00:40:57,351 --> 00:41:01,973
And then the implementer added an expanded mode,

638
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:04,734
and you can do some actions in this expanded mode,

639
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:06,414
and everything gets text.

640
00:41:06,614 --> 00:41:09,415
Even the icons that in the base game didn't have text

641
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:11,296
have text in the mobile app.

642
00:41:12,936 --> 00:41:16,138
The card design evolved through many iterations.

643
00:41:16,238 --> 00:41:18,598
So here is one of the original prototype cards.

644
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:23,111
This is the finish card, this is all the same card on this slide.

645
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:28,595
These two are Waywa's designs before he and I started working together.

646
00:41:29,376 --> 00:41:34,139
And these last two over here are after the art team gets involved,

647
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:37,942
and we're now testing their ideas on our players.

648
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:41,004
So you can see how it changed quite a bit.

649
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:43,406
So who's who on the race team?

650
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:48,989
Wei-Hua Huang, who I've mentioned several times, he did the prototype icons, the car

651
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:53,992
design, some development assistance, and he was the lead designer on Roll for the Galaxy.

652
00:41:54,732 --> 00:41:59,935
Jay Tomelson is the publisher, the head of Rio Grande Games, and he's a huge science

653
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:01,176
fiction fan.

654
00:42:01,716 --> 00:42:06,519
And in 2007, the German publishers were all convinced that science fiction games would

655
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,239
never sell.

656
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,202
And so he supported doing it and paid for a lot of artwork

657
00:42:12,302 --> 00:42:13,502
from these three gentlemen.

658
00:42:13,942 --> 00:42:15,103
He found the art team.

659
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:19,225
And Klaus and Martin do the covers, the card art, some of

660
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:22,506
the 3D modeling that we use, and the logos.

661
00:42:23,046 --> 00:42:26,448
And Mirko Suzuki, our skateboarding graphic artist,

662
00:42:27,488 --> 00:42:31,330
he does the rules layout, works on the card templates,

663
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,452
did all the icons, redoing all the icons, and does all the

664
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,213
production work.

665
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:42,898
We've been working together for 13 years now, which is a long time in any field,

666
00:42:43,818 --> 00:42:46,160
and we work in a very collegiate way.

667
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,062
For Roll for the Galaxy, we talked to the art team and said,

668
00:42:50,622 --> 00:42:55,945
you know, how we wanted to position it as the DICE version of Race for the Galaxy.

669
00:42:55,965 --> 00:42:59,307
And they came back with this idea of floating DICE in space.

670
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:03,469
with the race symbols coming out in red light, which would help,

671
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,749
in yellow light, which would help pick

672
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:08,350
up the difference in the branding.

673
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:11,292
So, you know, they suggest ideas.

674
00:43:12,732 --> 00:43:15,853
All the cards are actually designed from a thematic point

675
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,675
of view, but I don't tell the artist about it.

676
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:23,476
Okay? So, here we have Distant World, and my model for this world,

677
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:26,478
my internal model when I designed this card, was Iceland.

678
00:43:27,931 --> 00:43:30,392
Iceland has a very isolated population.

679
00:43:31,072 --> 00:43:35,493
They are the focus of numerous genetic studies going on in Iceland right now.

680
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:38,014
So that's why it produces a genes good.

681
00:43:38,954 --> 00:43:45,656
And Iceland has one of the highest book readership, book ownership rates, cultural interest rates

682
00:43:45,936 --> 00:43:47,016
in the entire world.

683
00:43:47,436 --> 00:43:50,717
And that's why they have this huge bonus for novelty goods.

684
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:55,301
Do I expect any player to look at this card and go,

685
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:58,244
oh, this is obviously a science fiction analogue to Iceland?

686
00:43:58,604 --> 00:43:58,764
No.

687
00:43:59,525 --> 00:44:01,286
Did I explain this to the artist?

688
00:44:01,507 --> 00:44:01,727
No.

689
00:44:02,227 --> 00:44:04,149
All I give the artist is the title,

690
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:06,311
and I let them do what they want to.

691
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:08,774
Occasionally, they'll ask me a question or two,

692
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:11,616
but mostly I do this so that they feel fresh

693
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:13,778
and they bring their own ideas to the project.

694
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:20,194
Race does have two thematic inspirations, both of which I credit in the rules.

695
00:44:21,094 --> 00:44:27,238
Fred Pohl's Heechee saga contributed the idea of a long-vanished alien civilization where

696
00:44:27,278 --> 00:44:29,899
the aliens, all we see are their artifacts.

697
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:37,203
And then David Brin has the idea of uplift where alien races are being brought to sentience

698
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,724
by other alien races.

699
00:44:39,265 --> 00:44:43,367
I use nothing directly from these things, but they were inspirations.

700
00:44:44,904 --> 00:44:50,127
Two ideas from optimization theory informed my card design.

701
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:56,250
To make a game more strategic, you want to mine the gap.

702
00:44:56,871 --> 00:44:58,672
So here I have New Sparta.

703
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:01,693
They want to put down this military world here.

704
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:08,745
They have this card which gives them temporary military, one shot military.

705
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:11,068
It's cheap, but then they lose a tempo.

706
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:16,655
Or they have this one which is, I can do this, overkill.

707
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,318
It's more expensive than they want.

708
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:23,801
What they actually want is they would like to draw this card here,

709
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:28,783
but they have to make a decision when they're faced in this situation

710
00:45:29,363 --> 00:45:33,625
as to whether they want to go into military as a serious strategy

711
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:36,446
or as a one-shot, get this world down, get going.

712
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:45,270
And if you provide all power-cost combinations in your game, then it's possible for very

713
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:50,131
tactical play, worrying just about what you need to do right away to dominate.

714
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:55,072
If you start putting in gaps, you force your players to make strategic choices.

715
00:45:56,232 --> 00:46:02,574
Random draws reduce this issue for card games, because you may not draw the needed intermediate

716
00:46:02,654 --> 00:46:03,814
card when you want to use it.

717
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:11,095
But CCGs, drafting, and board games need to be very careful in this area if you want

718
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:12,576
to produce a strategic game.

719
00:46:13,877 --> 00:46:19,401
The other idea from optimization is the notion of switching costs and how to overcome them.

720
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:24,144
You don't want your players feeling trapped by their initial hands.

721
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:29,648
So this is a very abstract diagram where these are the strategy hills.

722
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:34,434
and you can think of them as your players trying to climb the hill up to the top.

723
00:46:34,935 --> 00:46:40,582
And so this might be, symbolize the alien hill with the alien tech institute I've shown

724
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:41,523
you a couple times.

725
00:46:42,104 --> 00:46:43,706
This might be big military.

726
00:46:44,147 --> 00:46:45,969
This might be the novelty strategy.

727
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,312
And if your cards initially say,

728
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:53,134
Go the alien strategy and then you don't draw any more of those cards.

729
00:46:54,074 --> 00:46:58,458
And your cards now say go military, you have a switching cost.

730
00:46:58,758 --> 00:47:03,081
If you put down the six for this military, it will score less because you have fewer

731
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:05,163
of the military cards in your tableau.

732
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:12,368
So you need to come up with some way to compensate players for when they have to switch strategies

733
00:47:12,428 --> 00:47:13,629
in the middle of a card game.

734
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:21,613
And the approach I used is the six cost devs having both powers and victory point bonuses

735
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:22,756
really helped.

736
00:47:23,951 --> 00:47:28,732
In terms of their cost, they are under-costed when you consider both of these items.

737
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:33,253
But when you consider just their powers, I mean, we just saw that a development that

738
00:47:33,293 --> 00:47:36,554
gives you two military is about two cost, right?

739
00:47:36,594 --> 00:47:38,054
They're way over-costed.

740
00:47:38,854 --> 00:47:43,495
And this provides you a way of putting in compensation without putting in cards that

741
00:47:43,535 --> 00:47:46,176
are too powerful in terms of their in-game effects.

742
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:54,882
Finally, another consideration when designing cards is that you want cards to appeal to

743
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:56,102
various player types.

744
00:47:56,683 --> 00:48:02,505
Mark Rosewater has a classic article describing magic player types, and so when it came time

745
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:08,067
to actually design cards, I sort of, I bore that in mind and I put in cards that were

746
00:48:08,107 --> 00:48:08,948
very efficient.

747
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:14,909
for the spike players who really value efficiency and winning on a high percentage basis.

748
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:20,591
Pilgrimage world, which lets you win in a very creative way, it lets you take all those

749
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:25,812
goods if you had no other consume power and suddenly consume them in one big swoop.

750
00:48:26,352 --> 00:48:31,473
And that appeals to the Johnny-type player who likes to win in very creative ways.

751
00:48:32,014 --> 00:48:37,315
And then Timmy, big military, provides the big effects that the Timmy, the stereotypical

752
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,335
Timmy player likes.

753
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:40,576
So that's something to bear in mind.

754
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:42,657
So what didn't work?

755
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:51,061
The deck size, which was fine in the base game, became a problem when we got to about

756
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:54,262
beyond 180 cards as we added expansions.

757
00:48:55,443 --> 00:48:59,124
This is what statisticians call the sample variance problem.

758
00:48:59,585 --> 00:49:04,447
The deck variance remained the same, but the sample, those 30 to 50 cards that a player

759
00:49:04,487 --> 00:49:06,228
saw, started to vary too much.

760
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:15,142
And this led us to break the expansions into separate arts, so that you play the base game

761
00:49:15,222 --> 00:49:19,823
and you play with these three expansions, that's fine, and then you get rid of them,

762
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,104
play the base game with some other expansion.

763
00:49:22,424 --> 00:49:25,785
That also lets me tell different stories, which as a designer I like.

764
00:49:26,825 --> 00:49:32,486
A few cards were a little too specialized, and we turned out to have colorblind issues

765
00:49:33,327 --> 00:49:35,007
in our browns and our greens.

766
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:41,076
And in JumpDrive, we introduced these dots to try to solve the issue.

767
00:49:41,496 --> 00:49:48,063
We actually had a playtester who is extremely colorblind, but the problem was he was an

768
00:49:48,163 --> 00:49:49,204
expert bridge player.

769
00:49:49,224 --> 00:49:50,906
He just memorized the cards.

770
00:49:51,346 --> 00:49:54,089
So we didn't realize that we had a problem.

771
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:58,573
We said, well, if Larry can play it, what's the big deal here?

772
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,883
So second edition race is coming out.

773
00:50:04,663 --> 00:50:06,144
It's at the printer right now.

774
00:50:06,985 --> 00:50:12,789
And we are adding these dots into the blue, green,

775
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:16,112
and brown worlds to help with the color blind.

776
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:20,295
It's not a complete solution, but it's like a 90% solution.

777
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,097
And that's one of the things we're doing.

778
00:50:23,617 --> 00:50:25,539
And as long as we were in the game,

779
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,881
I made the rules completely gender neutral.

780
00:50:29,981 --> 00:50:31,582
They were mostly gender neutral

781
00:50:31,622 --> 00:50:33,263
because that tends to be the way I write,

782
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:37,406
but there were two he or she's and 12 hises

783
00:50:37,906 --> 00:50:39,247
that are now they and their.

784
00:50:40,027 --> 00:50:43,469
We added new samples of rounds of play for new players.

785
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,231
We added the six promo worlds from the app

786
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:47,512
that were designed for the app.

787
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:51,573
and added them as along with optional start world choice.

788
00:50:52,534 --> 00:50:55,715
And then we adjusted five cards that were a little too weak

789
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:58,516
and we will make them available as separate promos

790
00:50:58,536 --> 00:50:59,896
through the BGG store.

791
00:51:01,717 --> 00:51:02,937
So some takeaways.

792
00:51:03,698 --> 00:51:06,098
I'm not going to read this in detail,

793
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:08,319
but these are things to consider

794
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:11,800
when you're designing a strategy card game.

795
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:16,842
And good luck.

796
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,936
So we have about 10 minutes.

797
00:51:27,696 --> 00:51:28,757
Questions are welcome.

798
00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:32,759
And remember to fill out your evaluations.

799
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:37,961
Last.

800
00:51:38,701 --> 00:51:39,001
Hey Tom.

801
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:44,063
So I really like what you were talking about, about multiple different winning strategies.

802
00:51:44,743 --> 00:51:48,665
One of the things I really like about Magic is that it has that built into the deck building.

803
00:51:48,685 --> 00:51:53,047
One of the things I really don't like though is the inevitability with certain strategies,

804
00:51:53,107 --> 00:51:57,750
where you realize that there's no way you can win against that strategy because your deck isn't set up to do it.

805
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:02,752
So I'm interested to know kind of how you approach balancing different strategies for winning the game.

806
00:52:03,819 --> 00:52:07,021
Okay, so the question is how to balance certain strategies,

807
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:10,924
particularly if one strategy starts to feel inevitable.

808
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:11,204
Yeah.

809
00:52:12,585 --> 00:52:16,408
So part of that is magic, to some extent,

810
00:52:16,528 --> 00:52:20,151
particularly at high levels when you're using lots of rares and so on,

811
00:52:20,772 --> 00:52:23,274
is a game of big, big effects and combos.

812
00:52:24,194 --> 00:52:26,676
By making a game of smaller effects,

813
00:52:27,117 --> 00:52:29,158
the gain-the-edge thing, you...

814
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:31,500
get rid of a lot of that issue.

815
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,102
You don't completely solve it.

816
00:52:33,743 --> 00:52:36,385
And in two-player experience in race,

817
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:39,408
in certain conditions you can see a very strong

818
00:52:39,468 --> 00:52:42,992
develop-develop strategy that can sometimes produce problems.

819
00:52:43,552 --> 00:52:47,055
The other thing is it really depends on the length of your game.

820
00:52:47,756 --> 00:52:49,858
If you can whip through race in 10 minutes,

821
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:52,561
the problem's really not a huge problem.

822
00:52:55,299 --> 00:52:55,519
Hi, Tim.

823
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:58,360
So I'm curious, since one of your major contributions

824
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,360
to San Juan was the cost crunch coming down,

825
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,881
and that's remained in place, I believe,

826
00:53:03,941 --> 00:53:05,321
to some extent for race.

827
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:07,942
I'm curious about what led you to that decision

828
00:53:08,322 --> 00:53:10,902
and how we can sort of approach holistically

829
00:53:10,962 --> 00:53:13,183
to avoid that problem when we're starting from scratch.

830
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:16,324
So the question is, how did I come up

831
00:53:16,464 --> 00:53:20,064
with the cost structure in San Juan?

832
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:23,485
What led you to realize that it needed to be crunched?

833
00:53:23,505 --> 00:53:23,665
Yeah.

834
00:53:24,293 --> 00:53:27,474
Well, one of the problems is simply physical, right?

835
00:53:27,994 --> 00:53:31,155
If the cost goes from one to 10, and you have to pay nine

836
00:53:31,235 --> 00:53:35,496
cards or 10 cards split down to 10, that's a big hand.

837
00:53:35,997 --> 00:53:38,597
And if you want to save some cards in addition, now you're

838
00:53:38,617 --> 00:53:40,918
talking about 15-card hands, right?

839
00:53:41,578 --> 00:53:44,859
And so part of it was driven by ergonomics.

840
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,380
Part of it is driven by the entire deck size.

841
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,181
If all players can have 15 cards in hand and

842
00:53:52,886 --> 00:53:59,090
cards in the tableau than we needed more than 110 cards. So a lot of it was driven by external

843
00:53:59,150 --> 00:53:59,631
factors.

844
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:01,292
Okay, cool. Thank you.

845
00:54:03,593 --> 00:54:12,019
Hello, my name is Steven. I really enjoy ROL and I also quite like RACE but ROL has an

846
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:21,326
aesthetic of accessibility that's much easier. The way that the tiles line up in different

847
00:54:21,366 --> 00:54:21,726
phases.

848
00:54:22,502 --> 00:54:22,702
Yes.

849
00:54:23,002 --> 00:54:27,426
Yeah, so that's something that I feel that's really important to get people into the game,

850
00:54:28,627 --> 00:54:29,748
whether new or old player.

851
00:54:30,008 --> 00:54:34,332
I've played race over and over and I still can't quite wrap my head around each phase.

852
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:36,093
It's really annoying.

853
00:54:36,554 --> 00:54:42,118
So this is, I don't know, is there something that you might want to...

854
00:54:43,902 --> 00:54:48,264
I don't want to say fixed, but like, because they're intrinsically very different games,

855
00:54:49,284 --> 00:54:49,965
role and race.

856
00:54:50,205 --> 00:54:55,867
But the way the design and the presentation work makes role much friendlier to read.

857
00:54:57,508 --> 00:54:58,568
Right.

858
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:08,152
So the question is, why is role easier to read compared to race, and is there anything

859
00:55:08,232 --> 00:55:10,033
we could do to make race easier?

860
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:10,733
Yeah.

861
00:55:10,973 --> 00:55:11,113
Yeah.

862
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:17,135
Largely, Roll avoids multi-phase powers.

863
00:55:18,216 --> 00:55:24,421
In the few tiles that have it, it's the same power that happens to occur twice.

864
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:30,145
And that means that you can have the text right there because it applies to all of the

865
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:36,670
powers on the tile, and the vast majority of the tiles in Roll only have one power or

866
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,311
one power that happens twice.

867
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:41,720
That makes it a lot easier.

868
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,141
It's the multi-phase powers, I suspect, that are causing you,

869
00:55:46,161 --> 00:55:48,822
I mean, everyone's different, but I suspect that's what's

870
00:55:49,123 --> 00:55:52,244
causing it to make race harder to wrap your head around.

871
00:55:53,324 --> 00:55:55,785
And I think it's just the nature of the game.

872
00:55:56,826 --> 00:55:58,887
We are committed to the spin-offs in part

873
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:02,968
because we recognize that there's a variety of audiences.

874
00:56:04,137 --> 00:56:09,602
And so race, we're sticking with the multi-phase powers,

875
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:12,824
but new frontiers in role largely avoid them.

876
00:56:13,525 --> 00:56:14,425
Same with jump drive.

877
00:56:15,226 --> 00:56:15,546
Thank you.

878
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:22,331
I'm interested in the balancing of all of the cards

879
00:56:22,391 --> 00:56:23,472
that you used in race.

880
00:56:23,912 --> 00:56:26,835
And because obviously you are drawing cards and then spending

881
00:56:26,895 --> 00:56:27,955
them as a currency.

882
00:56:28,777 --> 00:56:34,061
How did you come up with the numbers of 1-cost, 2-cost, 6-cost cards

883
00:56:34,921 --> 00:56:36,862
in a kind of balancing way that made sense?

884
00:56:36,902 --> 00:56:38,363
Because every time you playtest it,

885
00:56:39,224 --> 00:56:42,246
people could get rid of the different cards each time, things like that.

886
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,868
It is tricky, but...

887
00:56:48,123 --> 00:56:49,925
Part of it was the mind the gap thing.

888
00:56:49,945 --> 00:56:53,669
You'll notice there's very few five cost developments

889
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:57,212
because I wanted there to be a big step up the sits

890
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,475
and that would be a strategic move.

891
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:04,139
Some of it was identifying what my strategies were.

892
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,201
I'm sorry, I didn't repeat the question.

893
00:57:06,241 --> 00:57:08,283
The question is how did I balance all those cards?

894
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:09,825
Is that fair?

895
00:57:12,301 --> 00:57:14,982
By defining some strategies early on,

896
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:20,844
like the novelty strategy, lots of cheap blue worlds,

897
00:57:20,864 --> 00:57:23,905
then that gave me the anchor points

898
00:57:24,225 --> 00:57:27,166
that then the other things could be interpolated to within.

899
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:36,228
I also tried to put in cards that were entire strategies in a card so that you would re-evaluate

900
00:57:36,449 --> 00:57:42,996
when you drew a card and go, oh, I have consumer markets, maybe I should go the novelty path.

901
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:45,519
And then that was cost five because

902
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:51,023
Cost five is really tricky because for just one more you could have a six dev, right?

903
00:57:51,383 --> 00:57:53,665
But so I made those very powerful.

904
00:57:53,745 --> 00:57:59,429
So I had a sense of where in the cost spectrum various things would fit.

905
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:04,293
And once I developed my overall strategies, then it was just a matter of interpolating

906
00:58:04,433 --> 00:58:05,774
and then testing and revising.

907
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:10,149
with the sixes, which seem like these really strong cards,

908
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,672
how did you come up with the total number?

909
00:58:12,732 --> 00:58:14,473
If 30 to 50 are being drawn,

910
00:58:14,814 --> 00:58:16,776
did you always want someone to get at least one

911
00:58:16,836 --> 00:58:17,456
or two or three?

912
00:58:17,496 --> 00:58:20,600
Like, just a little bit more on that sort of balancing how

913
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:25,172
Are you asking about the points on them,

914
00:58:25,192 --> 00:58:28,595
or are you asking about the proportion of them in the deck?

915
00:58:29,095 --> 00:58:33,899
Well, as a strategy led you to what card you wanted to design,

916
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,622
but the feeling for a player is to, when I draw that,

917
00:58:39,424 --> 00:58:41,706
how often that happens to them and at which stages.

918
00:58:42,707 --> 00:58:44,728
Right. So, some of...

919
00:58:45,649 --> 00:58:48,631
How did I design the sixes so that...

920
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:57,351
and what led me to decide some of them would be a strategy in a box and some wouldn't.

921
00:58:59,393 --> 00:59:07,399
If the strategies were well-defined in other cards, then the six could be a capstone and

922
00:59:07,479 --> 00:59:08,680
mostly just scoring.

923
00:59:10,081 --> 00:59:15,005
If the strategies weren't so well-defined in the sets, then its powers needed to be

924
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:17,307
stronger and its veeps needed to come down.

925
00:59:18,442 --> 00:59:26,287
So, for example, the galactic economy in Rebel versus Imperium expansion works with all different

926
00:59:26,347 --> 00:59:33,513
colors, and so that's a very powerful power, and we had to reduce the cost of the VP bonus

927
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,814
to compensate for that.

928
00:59:35,174 --> 00:59:36,255
So it was an OP, basically.

929
00:59:36,275 --> 00:59:36,355
Yeah.

930
00:59:36,415 --> 00:59:36,635
Cool.

931
00:59:37,175 --> 00:59:37,435
Thank you.

932
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:44,444
I also have a question about optimizing and specifically

933
00:59:44,744 --> 00:59:45,545
balancing the cards.

934
00:59:46,605 --> 00:59:50,348
When you're starting out, before you go through dozens

935
00:59:50,388 --> 00:59:53,930
and dozens of initial play tests, how do you prefer to

936
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:58,273
visualize all of the cards in the deck and how they play

937
00:59:58,313 --> 00:59:59,333
into each strategy?

938
00:59:59,994 --> 01:00:00,214
Right.

939
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:02,696
So how do I visualize the cards?

940
01:00:02,736 --> 01:00:05,597
How do I visualize the strategies before I start

941
01:00:05,657 --> 01:00:07,739
playtesting, when I'm constructing the initial

942
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:08,219
prototype?

943
01:00:08,912 --> 01:00:10,572
Well, every designer is different.

944
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:15,895
In my case, I sit in a tea shop and I write down potential

945
01:00:15,975 --> 01:00:16,976
names of cards.

946
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:19,257
That's how I start.

947
01:00:19,757 --> 01:00:22,618
And I sort of start grouping them into categories.

948
01:00:24,946 --> 01:00:29,929
I get those names and I'm just working with the names first, and then I distribute them

949
01:00:30,149 --> 01:00:32,410
among costs and so on from that.

950
01:00:32,871 --> 01:00:38,934
But I start looking and go, this is one strategy, this is another strategy, and I start circling

951
01:00:38,994 --> 01:00:39,594
strategies.

952
01:00:39,874 --> 01:00:42,516
This is all before I've assigned numbers to the cards.

953
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:49,080
But by identifying strategies, then it's a lot easier to identify, and then I start thinking

954
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,421
about, well, what are the components of this strategy?

955
01:00:51,821 --> 01:00:53,902
For example, novelty will be cheap worlds.

956
01:00:54,763 --> 01:00:58,524
Alien will be density, because I know I want density as a strategy.

957
01:00:59,024 --> 01:01:04,865
And by identifying the key ideas of the strategy, that guides me to putting out some numbers.

958
01:01:06,025 --> 01:01:13,227
And in fact, I had all the experience from doing those three Puerto Rico card game iterations.

959
01:01:14,487 --> 01:01:18,748
Race actually didn't change that much from the first prototype to the actual produced

960
01:01:18,788 --> 01:01:19,108
version.

961
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:22,088
So it was three weeks in a tea shop.

962
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:26,003
That may not be how other people are going to do it,

963
01:01:26,103 --> 01:01:27,383
but that's what it was for me.

964
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:27,883
Great.

965
01:01:27,963 --> 01:01:28,264
Thank you.

966
01:01:28,624 --> 01:01:28,784
Yeah.

967
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:34,066
OK, we are now, I believe, at the end of the session.

968
01:01:34,286 --> 01:01:37,107
So I'm happy to have questions, but we'll

969
01:01:37,147 --> 01:01:39,908
move across the hall to the wrap-up area, all right?

970
01:01:40,068 --> 01:01:40,329
OK.

971
01:01:40,789 --> 01:01:41,069
All right.

972
01:01:41,129 --> 01:01:41,389
Thank you.
