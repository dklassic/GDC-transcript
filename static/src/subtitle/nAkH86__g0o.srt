1
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:24,614
Not sure what I did to earn this already. Thank you so much for being here this early in the

2
00:00:24,654 --> 00:00:31,499
morning. I know there's so many more better things to do at 9, like sleeping. So, thank you for being

3
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,604
here. My dears, I was told to remind you to turn off all your buzzers and all, you know, devices

4
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:41,807
that you decided to bring in and emit sounds, you know, whatever that is. You can fill it in.

5
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:45,408
This talk is long as hell.

6
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,389
So basically I'll do as much as I can.

7
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,550
I'll be speaking quite fast

8
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,131
because I want to show you a lot of things.

9
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,211
Now we will finish in like 55 minutes,

10
00:00:56,312 --> 00:00:58,052
hopefully when I'm efficient.

11
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,293
That means that there will be no time for questions.

12
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:02,373
However, I'm going to stay with you, of course,

13
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:05,835
till I'm dead in a wrap-up room in 305.

14
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,476
Okay, 305, this is where I'm going to be after this talk.

15
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,036
And then we can,

16
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:16,679
know, sit together and chat for like, I think, two hours I have for you. So I hope that I'll be able

17
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:23,342
to answer all the questions. So having that out of the way, I'm really glad we have audio. I hope

18
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:29,744
that that's gonna stay. Shout out to our technician. He's amazing and helped me out a lot.

19
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:31,225
Thank you so much, sir.

20
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:36,023
And having that out of the way, let's go.

21
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:40,825
So my dears, my name is Pawel Sasko and I'm a Quest Director in CD Projekt RED.

22
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:45,347
So what I do, I direct quests, open world and cinematic departments in our studio.

23
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:51,909
We are the teams that design and implement the story together with our amazing writers.

24
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,734
Now, today I'll be talking to you about a few things and I'll mention a few words about me so

25
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:02,037
you know who the hell I am, but I promise this will be short because this is not about it.

26
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:06,861
Then we'll talk and look into the narrative pipeline inside the project. This is a really

27
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:11,665
important element of really how we build the games and really the reason why those games are good.

28
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:15,688
Of course, you know, there will be some level of simplification to this pipeline because

29
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:20,232
otherwise we would have spent here hours just discussing important elements to it.

30
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:25,035
And then I'll move on to Key Quest Design Lessons.

31
00:02:25,836 --> 00:02:30,860
I have divided it into three parts for you so that you can kind of wrap your head around it.

32
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,763
There we'll be mastering the plot, structuring the narrative, and improving the design at the end.

33
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:42,007
All of those lessons are actually designed in a way that they're supposed to give you as much takeaway as you can.

34
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:45,189
However, I have prepared takeaways at the end as well.

35
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:51,013
However, each lesson is kind of a thing that I learned throughout many years in the industry.

36
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,754
Things that I didn't know really at the beginning.

37
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,796
I don't think they are trivial. I don't think so.

38
00:02:58,197 --> 00:03:02,540
Otherwise, I would have probably known from the very beginning what to do, but I didn't.

39
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,081
And I want you to know now.

40
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:10,485
So, moving on. A few things and a few games I worked on. I'm in the industry almost 19 years now.

41
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:14,949
I've worked on a bunch of indie games that you never heard of and a few games that have actually

42
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:19,232
never been released. If you are in the industry long enough, you will actually get to that point

43
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:25,136
that your game is shut down throughout the production. So, each of us has to go through

44
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:31,261
that painful process. Then, I managed to join the Two Worlds 2 team where I was a lead writer,

45
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,403
lead quest designer, and then joined our Witcher 2 team.

46
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:42,466
During the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition work, I was just helping out with things, debugging,

47
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,127
and learning from my fellow designers.

48
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:48,428
And then from The Witcher 3, I was a senior quest designer, did a bunch of main story

49
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:54,590
and side quests, and became a lead of the team from Hearts of Stone, and led the team

50
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,251
through Blood and Wine, and then Cyberpunk 2077.

51
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:03,313
After we shipped Cyberpunk, I got to other departments, which is open world and cinematic.

52
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:07,514
And right now we are working on Phantom Liberty.

53
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:10,274
It's around a 60 people team,

54
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:13,275
so shout out to them because I love them.

55
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:14,455
And some of them are here actually.

56
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,096
So thank you for being here.

57
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:20,537
Now, my dears, let's move on to the narrative pipeline first.

58
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:23,858
Hopefully this part won't be too boring for you fellow game devs,

59
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,358
especially people working on a story.

60
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:27,718
I think this is a very valuable slide,

61
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:29,479
even though it might not look that appealing.

62
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,919
But I tried to put a picture there, so here you go.

63
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,106
There are a few things I wanted to point out. First and foremost, our games are about the story.

64
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:43,993
The story is the most important factor in them, always. We want to seduce you as a player.

65
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:48,959
We want to take you on an adventure to our worlds and really make you feel how it looks like.

66
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,143
That's why we always start from a story outline.

67
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:57,168
Our writers, in a small group, prepare first a story outline, and again, that outline can be

68
00:04:57,288 --> 00:05:03,313
actually really short. It can be really like, at first, a few pages, maybe even less. And then we

69
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:08,557
feedback that outline, and it grows, and we get it to the point that we can start working

70
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:10,359
on a quest design document.

71
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,283
And this is when the Quest Design team steps in and they start working on the designs.

72
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:21,228
Those are like designs that you can say look like something between game design and a movie scenario.

73
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:24,791
Something like this. There are elements of a dialogue there, but not too much.

74
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:28,314
It's just an example. We do not really write dialogues in those documents.

75
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:34,600
And of course, that iteration process on the design documents, it happens together with the cinematic design team,

76
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:42,609
and also the open world team, and also others like writers, for instance, and other important departments in our company.

77
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:45,271
We are trying to include as many voices as we can.

78
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:50,835
And then we move on to the draft implementation. Actually those documents are used, when they're

79
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:57,039
approved, they're used to actually produce a base for all of the departments to be on the same page.

80
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:01,241
And then we start working on first blockout locations. So this is when our level design team

81
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:06,745
steps in. We are starting to work on the first drafts of the dialogues. So basically the quest

82
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:10,868
designers are like sketching them out. We do not write them, we just sketch them out basically

83
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:15,050
what the scene is about. We do include first elements of gameplay.

84
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:18,952
That's basically we want to make sure that the quest is playable.

85
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:24,535
And then this whole process concludes with actually something that various companies called

86
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:32,040
first playable. For us it's just draft. And when the quest is playable and all the quests are

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,702
playable, that means that the whole game is playable. And that is basically the goal of the draft stage.

88
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:46,234
And afterwards, we move on to pre-alpha, alpha, pre-beta, beta, and then we polish the game and ship it in that, period.

89
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:52,057
This is how it looks like though in practice. So when you have the story outline, we iterate the hell out of it,

90
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:56,480
and then when it's approved, it goes to quest design, iteration happens there,

91
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,961
and to the draft implementation with iterations are happening there.

92
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:02,843
What's important is that it actually can be...

93
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:09,794
Disapproved, you can call it. It can be sent back to the previous stage. And I think this is a key thing,

94
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:15,559
like why our things are working the way they are working, because we basically do not

95
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,504
resign until we are really, really happy with whatever we have produced. And sometimes we

96
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:26,407
do a lot of iterations and we bounce a lot back and forth between those stages.

97
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:31,610
And every single time when we actually move on and let's say update something in a meaningful way

98
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:38,574
on the draft implementation level, we also go back and really try to update the documents,

99
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:44,316
at least till the alpha stage. That was the most boring part out of the way. Let's now

100
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:51,880
focus on the key quest design lessons. So, my dears, the thing is that I will need to

101
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,802
talk about the story. And to talk about the story, I need to spoil you some things.

102
00:07:56,524 --> 00:08:00,387
So if you didn't play Cyberpunk 2077 or Witcher 3,

103
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:01,328
you need to leave the room.

104
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:06,993
So I think everyone's gone.

105
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,514
That was supposed to be gone.

106
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,297
That's the last warning, really, to turn off the video

107
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:12,258
or just leave the room.

108
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:16,021
I'm trying, I will do my best not to spoil too much,

109
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:17,763
but I'll have to spoil some things because I

110
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:18,924
will be using examples.

111
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:24,107
So let's move on to the first stage, which is mastering the plot. I will be talking about three

112
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:29,411
major lessons here, engagement, impact, and believability. This slide is only for you for

113
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:35,875
tracking where we are. We will now talk about the engagement. When we were working on The Witcher 3

114
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:42,259
Blood and Wine, the opening quest, The Beast of Beauclair, there was a moment when you as a player,

115
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,341
you as Geralt, you go in and you investigate.

116
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,122
And then there is this moment of autopsy.

117
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:49,263
There's this guy chopped off on a table.

118
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:51,065
The quest was designed by Blazej Augustynek,

119
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,085
our lead quest designer.

120
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,467
And what we wanted to do there,

121
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:56,188
we wanted to make sure that as a player,

122
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,870
you'll be intrigued by what the hell is happening.

123
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,652
You know, like why this guy is chopped off in such a way.

124
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:05,194
And every single detail that you actually find out

125
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,956
throughout this investigation is

126
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:11,298
introducing some new things that you wouldn't expect.

127
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,140
And every single step is actually surprising in a way.

128
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,061
And that is a, I would say, like one of the elements, one of the factors that's really

129
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:27,262
driving us when we are constructing our story. We want the player to want the story. You don't have

130
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:32,683
to shove the story into players throat, you can structure it in a way that player is craving for it.

131
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:38,304
And player really wants it. And the key thing that I wanted you to memorize from this is that

132
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:40,325
by subtraction of key information,

133
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:45,408
you can actually make the player really intrigued and really curious about what's going on.

134
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:53,715
And the investigations actually are a really interesting typical element of that.

135
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:59,620
And Witcher 3 is really a detective game in a fantasy setting. I loved, I think it was PC Gamer

136
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,123
that did this article when they actually properly identified what Witcher 3 was trying to be

137
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:06,185
when in terms of a genre.

138
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:11,308
This is a detective game in a dark fantasy setting.

139
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:15,050
And not that many people maybe felt it from the very beginning,

140
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,431
but when designing the quests and so on,

141
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:20,213
we were using a lot of investigation mechanics,

142
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:25,976
and that naturally sent us to actually creating many more stories

143
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:29,498
that will be simply about finding out what the hell happened.

144
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:38,332
Now, another example I wanted to show you is from one of the most beloved quests from Cyberpunk 2077, The Dream On.

145
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:41,193
This is one of the opening scenes. Let's watch it together.

166
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:20,360
As you can see, in this particular scene,

167
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,182
we have set it up in a way that there is a deliberate

168
00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:24,683
subtraction of information.

169
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,904
Look at another example that I have prepared for you.

170
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:29,166
Here at the moment when you're actually, as a player,

171
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:31,567
doing the investigation, there's a moment when you're

172
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:32,868
actually getting to this back room,

173
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:34,650
there are those big machines there.

174
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,931
When you scan them, when you can see actually

175
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:39,573
on the scanning in the UI, you can see that

176
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:42,215
it's an unknown tech, that it's a system

177
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:46,398
that is not in a database, that it's basically being not recognized.

179
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:52,239
As a player, you are taught actually that using the investigation mechanics and scanning basically in Cyberpunk,

180
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,740
you're going to find out what happened, what it is, and so on.

181
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,961
In this case, Patrick Mills, the quest designer for this quest,

182
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:02,222
and Rafał Orkan, the writer for this quest,

183
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:06,504
they have decided to actually very deliberately remove those informations for the player

184
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:09,965
and really say, you know, I know that you are using the scanning

185
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:12,706
and you want to know, you want to find out what actually happened,

186
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:13,786
but you won't find out.

187
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:18,187
And this is really, really deliberate play with the player.

188
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:22,168
And throughout that, and it's really, really important

189
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:25,108
that when you're constructing your story by doing this,

190
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,869
you can really make the player very curious.

191
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:29,890
And I brought up, of course, the Dream On

192
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,630
as one of the examples of such quests,

193
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,371
because I think it has done it the best

194
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:37,251
out of everything that, out of the quests

195
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:39,192
we have at Cyberpunk 2077,

196
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:42,012
but both Witcher and Cyberpunk

197
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:44,053
are actually full of such examples.

198
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:51,936
We'll be moving on. I could be talking much more about that point, but I want to give you those nuggets of knowledge.

199
00:13:51,956 --> 00:14:00,339
So we will now jump into the impact. And this is one of the more powerful, I would say, lessons that I can give you.

200
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,161
When we are creating the story, we are trying to, from the very beginning.

201
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,172
created around those emotional banging moments.

202
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:12,674
What you're seeing here actually is Judy.

203
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:16,376
She is broken down after the moment of what has happened to her friend.

204
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:20,278
I'm not going to spoil it much more, but it's really heartbreaking.

205
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:22,279
And as a player, you have met Judy already.

206
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,920
You get to know her, you know who she is.

207
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,021
And then throughout that storyline,

208
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,661
you also get to know Evelyn.

209
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,122
And at this point, there is a moment

210
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,662
when you actually face her.

211
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,322
And it's a really heartbreaking moment

212
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:39,103
when you actually see her makeup dripping down her face.

213
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:43,404
And it really makes you, as a player, empathize with her.

214
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:45,825
And when we are creating those stories,

215
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:49,426
we always try to think about those emotional moments that

216
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:52,607
really are going to drag the player to our stories.

217
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:57,846
This quest was designed by Sarah Gruemmer, who's sitting here in the front of row, and Magdalena.

218
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:04,967
And Magdalena Zych, who is the writer of this quiz,

219
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,950
they did a phenomenal, phenomenal job on Judy's storyline.

221
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,032
And what's interesting is that from a very, very beginning,

222
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:13,673
we didn't have that moment.

223
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,434
But when working on that storyline,

224
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:18,136
we discovered that we actually have to add it.

225
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,777
And it was fairly early, of course,

226
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,800
when we discovered that that particular beat has

227
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,660
to be in the story.

228
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,102
And this is what I want to encourage you to do.

229
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:27,783
Like, when you're actually crafting your stories,

230
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:30,065
think about those emotional moments.

231
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:36,550
Like the moments when you can really like punch the player or your reader, your audience into the gut and really make them feel things.

232
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,251
Because this is the most important thing.

233
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:44,697
And when I'm always training like my younger designers, we always tell them that we want to

234
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:50,561
teach the designer, to control what player is thinking and what player is feeling.

235
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:53,564
And that is really your job as a narrative designer.

236
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,125
I always, I really believe in that.

237
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:59,310
You really need to try to control what players are thinking and feeling.

238
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,433
Super important for building good impactful stories.

239
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:05,735
Another example actually comes from The Witcher 3,

240
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:08,715
when I was working on the Battle of Kaer Morhen.

241
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:11,016
That's the quest I designed and implemented.

242
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:16,957
And I needed a moment for Ciri to actually make a decision

243
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:19,158
that she is not going to be hunted anymore.

244
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,918
She's not going to be a prey.

245
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:22,598
She is going to be a hunter,

246
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,259
and she's going to be going after the wild hunt.

247
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:30,920
But to do so, I knew that I need a substantial event

248
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,181
that will really break her inside.

249
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:37,786
And that was the moment when I proposed to our writers team to kill Vesemir.

250
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:44,933
And at first, they weren't sure if we should be doing that, but throughout the discussions with

251
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,799
Marcin Blacha, our story director, we reached the conclusion that actually it's a really good

252
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:54,544
decision to basically really make Ciri, make that step, make that change.

253
00:16:55,945 --> 00:17:00,388
You know, some of you might be a psychologist. I'm a psychologist by education. There is a lot of

254
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:05,631
events in our lives that actually can tremendously change us. You know, like for instance, people that

255
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:10,714
have been in concentration camps, like there's a lot of data that shows when they left them,

256
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:15,116
they were completely different people. And that incident, what happens in their life and changes

257
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:19,119
them really tremendously, is something that they kind of needed, right?

258
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,122
To build it in a game, I really had to be very careful.

259
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:23,403
That's why I picked Vesemir,

260
00:17:23,623 --> 00:17:25,165
because his character is built up

261
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,867
and prepared really well.

262
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:29,210
You get to know him throughout many quests.

263
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,852
So that's why this moment was so impactful.

264
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,095
And also, I wanted to do something

265
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:36,458
that players wouldn't believe that we will be doing.

266
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:41,398
I wanted to surprise you in a good way, I hope,

267
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,520
basically to drag you to our storytelling.

268
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,721
And that is the second point I wanted to make here.

269
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:49,024
Like really, when you are building those impactful stories,

270
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,365
no holds are barred.

271
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:54,749
Like you can do anything that is needed to make the player feel things.

272
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,192
And here's another example I wanted to show you.

273
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:03,576
There is a moment when V wakes up on a landfill in Cyberpunk 2077.

274
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:05,318
Let's watch the scene together.

280
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:02,273
So what's interesting is that when you're actually creating your stories, you can create them around

281
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:07,474
the emotional impactful moments, as I said, but sometimes it's difficult. Those things need a

282
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:11,976
proper build-up. It takes time, it takes screen time, it takes a lot of pages in a book, a lot of

283
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:18,858
pages in a comic book to really build it up properly. So what you can do is also build your

284
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:25,201
story around something that, together with Tomasz Marchewka, our story director, we call it cool scenes.

286
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:27,701
And normally, when you are actually

287
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:29,282
working with the designers, a lot of them

288
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,563
will actually propose to you lots of different cool scenes

289
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:33,664
and things that could happen.

290
00:19:34,624 --> 00:19:36,265
The thing is, I do not think that this

291
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:39,166
is a proper way to build a story and tell a storyline

292
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:41,747
and tell an emotional story.

293
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:43,028
However, you can do it.

294
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,349
You can actually think about those banging moments that

295
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,370
really stay in your mind and kind of intertwine them

296
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,291
in your story.

297
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:52,732
And here is an example of basically Takemura

298
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:55,173
going there and basically delivering the justice.

299
00:19:55,793 --> 00:20:01,058
Dex is the guy that double-crossed you in Cyberpunk 2077. You probably know that. Hopefully you played

300
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:07,906
the game. It serves multiple different purposes. It kind of concludes the storyline of Dex as a

301
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:10,348
character. It introduces Takemura.

302
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:14,490
as an important main story character here for us.

303
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,772
And it's also a short, concise, very punchy scene

304
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,313
that's very memorable at the same time.

305
00:20:23,073 --> 00:20:25,354
We had a lot of discussions internally

306
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:27,695
if that should be an actual objective for the player.

307
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:31,037
Maybe you should be asked to really go after Dex and do that.

308
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:35,121
But throughout many discussions, you know, weighing pros and cons,

309
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:38,804
we reached the conclusion that it would be probably better to just have

310
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:42,227
Takemura take care of that and use it.

311
00:20:44,124 --> 00:20:46,907
Bless you. And use it as an introduction.

312
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:50,110
So, one last thing for you to memorize here.

313
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,854
Outside of those emotional moments, you can also think about great scenes,

314
00:20:54,094 --> 00:20:57,097
but this is always, I would say, secondary to the

315
00:20:57,438 --> 00:21:01,001
great emotional impactful stories that you're building, but have that in mind.

316
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:06,306
If you only have the storyline that's constructed out of the cool scenes, you'll see that there's

317
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:07,948
no soul in your story.

318
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:12,212
There's a great storytelling, I would say, theory about fire and embers.

319
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,694
Maybe you heard about it.

320
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:19,519
It's basically the fire is everything that is the soul of the story, and embers is really

321
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:20,080
what I see.

322
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,381
You know, is the VFX, is cool shit happening,

323
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,983
is, you know, transformers beating the shit

324
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:25,604
out of each other.

325
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,626
This is basically like great stuff happening in a screen,

326
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:30,107
you know, great visual spectacle,

327
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:31,949
but there's no fire, you know, in it.

328
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:34,831
And I think like we as storytellers and narrative designers,

329
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:37,933
we always need to take care of the fire that is there.

330
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,095
That concludes the impact.

331
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:43,057
I need to slightly speed up because I'm talking too much.

332
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:46,240
So right now we will move on to believability.

333
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:53,199
As an industry, and I'm here speaking about also myself,

334
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,142
we are sometimes very uncomfortable with actually

335
00:21:57,222 --> 00:22:00,584
giving the player the moments when there's nothing to do.

336
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:04,107
And there are moments when you are not

337
00:22:04,187 --> 00:22:07,889
supposed to run in and basically build something new

338
00:22:07,969 --> 00:22:09,550
and you don't have any new objective.

339
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:10,991
Look at this example.

340
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:12,252
This is a moment when you actually

341
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:15,234
had your intimate moment with Judy,

342
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,116
and you're there embraced.

343
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:23,659
Looking at her, having a smoke, and there's nothing else going on. There's nothing else to do,

344
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:30,903
there's nothing else to be, it's just being with her. And being a human is really a lot about this.

345
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:36,466
Like we intuitively, as human beings, we know it. Like when you are with your loved one,

346
00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:41,168
you do not like hug and then run to take out the trash, right? Because that's the next objective.

347
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:48,697
You normally spend time with them, right? You embrace them, you just look into each other,

348
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:54,519
and this is what you do. And as a studio, we have learned that, actually, that we need to make,

349
00:22:54,779 --> 00:23:00,162
give space to our characters to really shine on the screen, to really give them time

350
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:02,203
to do all of those elements.

351
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:05,905
And there's so little games that actually do it.

352
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:08,508
Like you can probably search in your memory.

353
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:11,270
There's literally few examples that come to mind.

354
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,373
And that really is so powerful when you're

355
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:15,394
building the characters.

356
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:17,816
But you, of course, need to use your empathy.

357
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:22,079
your personal empathy and try to feel, you know, what is the proper moment.

358
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:25,481
And of course, you know, the fact that this slaps so much in Cyberpunk,

359
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,744
it's a work of our amazing cinematic design team that makes sure

360
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:31,146
that those moments are really properly timed.

361
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:34,968
Cinematic animators, they make sure that, you know, all the animations are really fluid.

362
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:38,371
Look, look how believable she is, how she acts, you know, when she looks at you.

363
00:23:38,631 --> 00:23:40,633
And this is the, this is how you see her in the game,

364
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,794
because your face is literally next to her.

365
00:23:43,134 --> 00:23:45,796
So when you have those moments, don't rush.

366
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:52,023
Another element, another moment is like, there's this situation when you're actually together with Panam, right?

367
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:55,788
Like there is the sandstorm coming and so on, you're supposed to sit with her and so on.

368
00:23:56,188 --> 00:23:59,893
And I remember watching so many YouTubers and streamers and so on, influencers,

369
00:24:00,253 --> 00:24:05,480
playing our game when she actually put the legs on your legs and everyone's like,

370
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,164
What's going to happen now?

371
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:10,425
Because that's so unusual.

372
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:13,567
That's so unusual for characters in a game to do that.

373
00:24:14,047 --> 00:24:14,768
That's normal.

374
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:15,428
That's human.

375
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:16,549
We never do that.

376
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,010
That should be just two characters in idle

377
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,852
and over-the-shoulder camera just talking to each other.

378
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:23,133
That's what we are used to.

379
00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:24,574
But that's not life.

380
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:27,476
That's not how people act, normal people.

381
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:30,958
That's why our cinematic designers, when

382
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:31,979
they were working on that scene, they

383
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:35,541
had this idea actually to start introducing the connection.

384
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:41,530
between V and Panam that is sort of getting born here, you know, the moments when she actually does this, you know.

385
00:24:41,891 --> 00:24:45,016
So those human-like moments are really important.

386
00:24:46,003 --> 00:24:48,124
And I know I'm talking too much and I need to move on.

387
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:50,505
I wanted to point out something, something super important.

388
00:24:51,145 --> 00:24:52,626
Make sure that in your storyline,

389
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:56,187
when you are building a story, it's not only about the plot.

390
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:57,908
So when you're meeting the characters,

391
00:24:57,948 --> 00:25:01,029
they are not telling you about what's next to do,

392
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:02,230
what's our next objective,

393
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,931
but there are also moments when they are themselves

394
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:06,912
and they speak what's important for them.

395
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,193
That's why there is a moment when you go

396
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:10,633
for a coffee with Kerry.

397
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:12,814
That's why there is a moment when you just lie

398
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:14,795
embraced with Judy and there's nothing else going on.

399
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:19,502
That's why there is a moment when you're with Panam here, she puts her legs on your legs,

400
00:25:19,803 --> 00:25:24,530
and you're just there together. And they do not talk about the plot. They do not talk about like

401
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:29,838
what's next to happen about Yorinobu Arasaka Saburo and the chip in your head and all that.

402
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:30,559
They don't.

403
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,201
They are people and they talk about what's important for them, right?

404
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:35,822
So please remember about this.

405
00:25:35,842 --> 00:25:38,703
When you're building a storyline, do not pack their only plot,

406
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:43,185
but also characters, who they are, and make them speak about themselves.

407
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:45,446
And that's important, especially in AAA,

408
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:48,848
because like we normally don't have a budget to basically pack it all in.

409
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:53,890
And it's important to reserve a bit of that budget to be able to do those things.

410
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,211
Please remember about this.

411
00:25:56,132 --> 00:26:01,196
Now we'll move on now to the next section. This pretty much concludes the mastering the plot.

412
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:05,300
Now we'll talk to you about structuring the narrative. And there are three parts here,

413
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,804
brevity, choices, and consequences. Now some of those elements are pretty much separate talks on

414
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:18,191
their own, but I will try to give you as much as I can during this talk. So first and foremost,

415
00:26:19,216 --> 00:26:26,278
The cinematography and cinema industry, a long time ago, has figured out how actually from

416
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:31,780
the movies eliminate so-called busy work. And what I mean by that, there is a situation when

417
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,042
you're together with a character, you find out about something, and then you go into another

418
00:26:36,082 --> 00:26:40,543
character, and you talk to them, and basically refer everything, and you sort of go on and

419
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:41,403
repeat everything.

420
00:26:41,843 --> 00:26:44,245
This is pretty basic when it comes to storytelling,

421
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:47,486
but I see it all the time, even in the movies, in games especially.

422
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,788
So there are situations when we, as designers,

423
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:53,329
we need to look really in our writing, in our scenes,

424
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:56,610
but also like in a structure of our quests and be like, OK,

425
00:26:56,651 --> 00:27:00,933
when are we actually repeating information and when things are not needed?

426
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:04,114
Because when you remove the fat, when you trim the fat,

427
00:27:04,514 --> 00:27:06,315
then the story becomes much more punchy.

428
00:27:06,895 --> 00:27:09,056
Here's the example from Battle of Kaer Morhen.

429
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,798
So there was a moment when I knew

430
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,838
that we had to actually plan out that scene.

431
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:16,340
And that's the scene that Igor Sarzynski,

432
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,421
right now he's our narrative director.

433
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:20,962
Igor was working on that scene.

434
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,502
We knew that at this point,

435
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:26,004
we don't really want the player to discuss with Ciri

436
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:27,685
every single nook and cranny

437
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:31,026
how that the defense of Kaer Morhen is going to be.

438
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:33,267
Because you're going to see it in a moment.

439
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:35,628
So why the hell have it talk them about it?

440
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:40,291
So that's why we basically decide, okay, let's just use a simple cut here.

441
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:44,914
And they say, Geralt says, okay, you know what, let's just focus on it and discuss it in detail.

442
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:52,458
That's it. It cuts and then you're in the action basically as the Wild Hunt is attacking Kaer Morhen.

443
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,060
The next thing I wanted to point out to you is...

444
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,001
Something that actually we have been learning throughout Witcher 3, but I think we have

445
00:28:00,641 --> 00:28:06,483
mastered it or maybe get closer to it during Cyberpunk is how you do your exposition.

446
00:28:07,023 --> 00:28:14,324
And when it comes to Cyberpunk 2077, everything is, you are all the time in action there,

447
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:19,105
in the shoes of you. We have almost no cuts. We have no cut scenes. You're always there

448
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:24,727
yourself. Because of that, we had to be very strategic about how we divide the information.

449
00:28:25,227 --> 00:28:29,431
And before I explain, I need to mention to you the signal and noise theory.

450
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:31,072
Maybe some of you heard about it.

451
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:34,976
Signal is all the messages that you want to give the player.

452
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:39,080
All the important information, everything that you want the player to learn.

453
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:43,685
Noise is everything that player can do in the same time,

454
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:46,647
therefore making the signal less visible.

455
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:50,871
So, for instance, here's the example that I'm showing you right now, the moment when you're

456
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:54,995
going for a reconnaissance with Takemura. At first, you're actually walking with him. This

457
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:59,499
is something that we call internally walk and talk. You're walking, basically, and Takemura

458
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:03,263
tells you and V, they talk about things that are slightly less important.

459
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:09,670
Because here, the noise is high, I can go naked, I can jump around, I can do things, throw grenades maybe,

460
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,634
you know, and not really listen to him. The noise, but the potential noise, is quite high.

461
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:18,340
And the signal is pretty low, because I can do so many things. But then, as a player,

462
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,865
you actually get at the top of the building, you sit down together, look at Takemura.

463
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:28,869
Then the signal is high and the noise is low, because I have control over the camera, I know where the player is looking,

464
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:34,994
and then I can actually give the player all the important information about the plot and the characters.

465
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:42,479
So when you look at all that sequence, you can see that sequences in Cyberpunk, and they were like that in Witcher 3 too, but to a lesser extent.

466
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,066
You can see that sequences in Cyberpunk, they are divided in a way that you have moments when you're together with the character,

467
00:29:49,347 --> 00:29:51,589
when noise is high and signal is low.

468
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:56,895
And as a player, you can do weird stuff during that, but all the most important information

469
00:29:57,155 --> 00:29:59,257
are always delivered when you're focused on the characters.

470
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:04,323
Because we wanted to make sure that you understand as a player that we don't lose you as an audience.

471
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:10,352
So it's a really good trick, in a way, to divide your exposition like this.

472
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:14,876
Ask yourself a question, okay, what actually is the important part of my narrative and what is not?

473
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:18,138
Or what is slightly less important? And what is only maybe your ego,

474
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:22,721
your ego speaking, and you wanting actually the player to get all of those important

475
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:26,224
story informations, everything about the world and backstory and all that.

476
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:27,865
Maybe it's really not needed.

477
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:33,348
Maybe it can be really something that we call an opt-in design, so a player can actually decide,

478
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:36,849
okay, I will actually listen to it deliberately because I want,

479
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,751
but if I don't want to, I'll go naked and throw grenades.

480
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:47,217
One last bit that I wanted to mention. This is fairly difficult to do and it requires, I think,

481
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:52,900
quite a lot of skill, but you know we are in GDC and I think it's a perfect audience to talk about it.

482
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,422
Exposition in general is difficult to do well and

483
00:30:59,503 --> 00:31:04,227
A bit in Witcher 3, but I think in cyberpunk we kind of learned it, how to do it well.

484
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:09,791
And here's an example when you're actually walking together with Jackie into the Konpeki Plaza.

485
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:13,554
There's this moment when this lady that works there, she greets you.

486
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:16,036
And she has a uniform, that's cool.

487
00:31:16,316 --> 00:31:17,517
But she also has real skin.

488
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,899
And her skin is like dark gold.

489
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,361
It's like a dark gold kind of a shade.

490
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:28,522
And it's surprising in a way, because it turns out that in this world,

491
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:32,963
and your skin is a part of your attire, you wear it to work.

492
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:34,783
That's basically a normal thing.

493
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:38,384
However, here in the story, we never address it.

494
00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:41,465
There's not a moment when we in the story point out finger to that

495
00:31:41,705 --> 00:31:42,945
and tell you that as a player.

496
00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:47,287
But you can actually understand it if you look at what's going on.

497
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:50,428
You can actually understand, oh, so this is what this world is.

498
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:51,588
This is how it's constructed.

499
00:31:51,968 --> 00:31:54,109
And it's normal and natural to be like this.

500
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:57,870
And, you know, when you are moving through Cyberpunk, you actually see lots of those.

501
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,012
So, you know, commercials, for instance, that we have in the game, the TV, the radio,

502
00:32:02,352 --> 00:32:03,833
all of them are actually about this.

503
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:05,833
They're the subtle exposition.

504
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:10,055
And subtle exposition is about the values that are underlying your narrative,

505
00:32:10,155 --> 00:32:11,155
underlying your world.

506
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,540
And we wanted to make sure that those values stick through,

507
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,145
but they are never directly given to you.

508
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:20,328
We never point our finger to it, almost never.

509
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:24,453
We basically try to make you soak in that world

510
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:25,575
and really be in that world.

511
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:31,611
Let me move on, because I'm far from being brief, so that concludes the brevity point.

512
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:37,375
Let's move on now to choices and consequences. Now, my dears, this section is really gigantic and

513
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:44,200
I could have a completely separate talk about this, so I will be deliberately picking just some

514
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:49,344
elements of that. There's more to it, but there are some things that I think are really important,

515
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:53,788
or things that I learned throughout our work in CD Projekt Red.

516
00:32:55,648 --> 00:33:02,274
This example that you're seeing right now is Geralt, who is facing the tree, you can call it,

517
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:06,077
the heart of the tree. And then there's this choice that you're supposed to make. Now,

518
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:11,422
what we have done here deliberately as designers, we have built up

519
00:33:12,063 --> 00:33:19,187
both sides of that story, both sides between those you're choosing, so that you have no idea

520
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:23,710
exactly what's going to happen. This is an example of the choice where actually bad things happen no

521
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,453
matter what you choose. We sometimes do that. Sometimes we don't, but sometimes we do and

522
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:35,597
that's a matter of a play between us as creators and you as an audience. In this specific case,

523
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:38,799
we wanted to make sure that you will make a bad choice no matter what.

524
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:40,480
And that was the design.

525
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:47,545
However, all of those sides are actually very carefully created and very carefully structured.

526
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:50,608
As a player, you don't really know what's going to happen,

527
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:53,870
but both sides sort of have been presented to you.

528
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,113
And those emotional dilemmas, those interesting dilemmas,

529
00:33:57,193 --> 00:34:01,956
are like, they are making the best possible choices you can actually have in your game.

530
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:03,858
Really, like, when you're choosing,

531
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:07,961
choosing if you want to do a quest or not is not really an exciting choice.

532
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:14,587
Maybe if you want to have sex with a character, that's probably also not exciting because everyone will choose it.

533
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:23,115
So because of that, it's really good to think about what is actually a moral dilemma and what is really not obvious.

534
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:27,839
What is really not obvious? There's so many things in our world that are not obvious

535
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,122
and things that everyone fights on social media every single day.

536
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:35,203
It is not that difficult to create those dilemmas

537
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:38,484
and make sure that the player has really something to think about.

538
00:34:39,604 --> 00:34:41,225
In here, actually, you have another example.

539
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:43,085
There is a moment when Placide,

540
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:47,126
he's one of the frontmen of the Voodoo Boys gang,

541
00:34:47,146 --> 00:34:48,806
so he actually double-crosses you,

542
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:50,847
and as a player, I'm pissed at this guy.

543
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,307
And when I meet him, I want to fucking punch him in the face.

544
00:34:54,347 --> 00:34:54,987
And what happens?

545
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:57,028
The game gives you exactly that.

546
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:59,947
And this is what we learned actually throughout working

547
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:01,588
in Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077.

548
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:06,832
When it feels right that the given choice should be there,

549
00:35:07,492 --> 00:35:09,894
then we as a designers, we should provide it to the player.

550
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:13,136
Because in most cases, it means that we have created

551
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,718
that situation in a way that as a player,

552
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,979
you're really believing you should be able,

553
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,240
you should be given the choice

554
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,901
and given the option to do so.

555
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:23,323
And that's always like a philosophy that we have

556
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,084
that when we were playing our quests,

557
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,825
you know, throughout working on them,

558
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:32,007
We always ask ourselves, OK, does it feel fine that I can't do something here?

559
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:33,127
And sometimes it does.

560
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:37,388
Sometimes you may want to not give a choice because you want to make a point.

561
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:39,308
And that's also fine.

562
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:42,249
You just need to be conscious about it as a designer.

563
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:46,550
For me, it's really amazing when I watch like streamers and YouTubers, influencers,

564
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,451
when I see them play our games and they literally at the moment

565
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:53,092
when they say, I fucking hate this guy, I want to punch him.

566
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,192
And then the choice comes in.

567
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,901
When to do that, like that happened with Fingers, that happened with Placide,

568
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:04,464
this means that the design was on point and we have actually felt right because then as a player

569
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:08,946
you were in shoes of V, you felt you're not forced into any choices and you really feel,

570
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:13,829
okay, the design's provided me that I can be that person. I can really role play that person.

571
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:17,531
I really need to speed up. Now when

572
00:36:18,992 --> 00:36:25,337
We were building the race for the crown in The Witcher 3 for Skellige.

573
00:36:25,638 --> 00:36:32,284
There is Cerys, she is a daughter of Crach an Craite, and then there's her brother Hjalmar.

574
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:46,154
They are both on a race for a crown, but as a player, you are really presented with a choice that is not a good one.

575
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:48,816
This is a negative example that I'm showing you right now.

576
00:36:49,257 --> 00:36:54,661
The Cerys in the story, she has been structured in a way that she will be always a preferred choice by our players.

577
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:56,262
And in a way here, we didn't do...

578
00:36:56,902 --> 00:37:02,143
too well preparing that choice. And that's why I'm giving you this example to show you that it's

579
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:07,805
difficult and we do not always get those things right. Because Cerys was preferred by many people

580
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:13,966
because she was more interesting as a character, she looked better than Hjalmar, she had more

581
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:19,027
screen time simply, she was written in a better way, and then when you have Hjalmar who has so

582
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:24,128
many downsides, much less people will choose him. So you need to think about those things.

583
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:29,069
When it comes to Cyberpunk, actually, we have discovered that also a very interesting factor,

584
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:35,433
which is the star power. We have Keanu Reeves playing Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077.

585
00:37:35,493 --> 00:37:42,778
We have Idris Elba playing in Phantom Liberty. We need to take into account the fact that every

586
00:37:42,818 --> 00:37:47,941
time when we have a star, players are going to fall for a star almost all the time.

587
00:37:48,658 --> 00:37:53,279
Therefore, Johnny Silverhand, when you meet him first time in Cyberpunk, he's a real asshole.

588
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:58,660
Because we wanted to make sure that we draw this really big arc from him being a horrible person

589
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,021
to the point that you actually really like this guy at the end and really understand him.

590
00:38:03,421 --> 00:38:07,462
But we thought about this from the very beginning, that star power of Keanu Reeves in this case,

591
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:12,763
he will skew your choices. He will skew your choices and he will make you want to be with

592
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:16,603
him more than if that would be some random generic character.

593
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,940
My dears, that will be the choices.

594
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,441
Now I'll move on to consequences.

595
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:23,783
Let's look actually an example from one of the quests

596
00:38:23,823 --> 00:38:26,965
that I've done for Cyberpunk 2077.

597
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:30,087
This is a moment when you are going back

598
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:32,729
to Totentanz club.

599
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:35,151
You could have, as a player before,

600
00:38:35,511 --> 00:38:37,733
met Maelstromers in Old Food Factory

601
00:38:37,813 --> 00:38:39,474
where you could have killed a bunch of them

602
00:38:39,714 --> 00:38:40,795
or resolve that situation.

603
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:44,517
This quest is much later and let's look at this example.

627
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,171
In here, actually, you can see another example.

628
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:49,753
There is a moment when you go into Totentanz and there's Dum Dum.

629
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:52,935
You know, if you managed to, if you actually made a deal with Maelstrom, he's there.

630
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:57,198
Now, what it is, as a designer, I am doing telegraphing.

631
00:39:57,258 --> 00:39:58,178
This is how we call it.

632
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:01,440
We are at the moment when you have actually made your choices.

633
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:03,342
Those choices come into something.

634
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:07,905
And at the end, when you meet that character, he is there talking to you in person.

635
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:12,228
And I, as a designer, I'm telegraphing in as many levels as I only can.

636
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:16,751
There is a moment when you walk in, then there's the dump, there's Dum Dum. Or if you kill them,

637
00:40:17,011 --> 00:40:22,134
there's Patricia, that she basically takes a rule over like Maelstrom and so on, she's taking care

638
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:27,357
of it. And you talk to them, the story develops in a completely different way. They walk you

639
00:40:27,377 --> 00:40:30,820
through different paths, they walk you to different rooms. This is called telegraphing.

640
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:38,522
When you're showing your consequences to the player, use every possible trick you have to make them realize that is the choice.

641
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:48,265
One of the things that we have realized when working on Cyberpunk 2077 is the fact that when consequences are too subtle, players won't see them.

642
00:40:48,765 --> 00:40:51,727
And I will show you more examples of that in a moment.

643
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:56,950
Here, the choices, the consequences that come in, that are really clearly

644
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:00,932
telegraphed, are always the best. And players are always surprised and they love it.

645
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:05,535
They really love it. And it's not really that expensive in terms of budget to make.

646
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:11,858
So, those choices that are really, really delayed, and sorry, consequences that are really,

647
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:16,740
really delayed, are always the best. In here, you could have made the choice in prologue,

648
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:24,703
and this quest comes in really late in the game. It's a part of a storyline of Kerry Eurodyne that

649
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:28,905
is pretty much one of the last main characters that we're introducing to the game.

650
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,127
You as a player, you probably forgot what happened.

651
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:34,728
That's why when you walk in, they have a chat.

652
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:35,929
And in that chat, they say,

653
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:38,731
Hey, is it that gung, that zeroed Royce in All Foods?

654
00:41:39,522 --> 00:41:43,483
That's the reason why that line is there, because I'm telegraphing to you.

655
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:50,684
Hey player, do you remember? You did that. Do you get it? Yes, Royce, All Foods. That is the

656
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:54,305
reason why those lines are there, right? Telegraphing on every level, because like,

657
00:41:54,665 --> 00:41:58,486
the game of Cyberpunk is gigantic. Players don't remember all of those characters,

658
00:41:58,606 --> 00:42:01,287
everything that happened. Besides, I don't know what happened in their life.

659
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:06,428
Player could have played, you know, 10 days straight for 20 hours every single day and got

660
00:42:06,468 --> 00:42:09,148
there, or they might have took five years.

661
00:42:09,468 --> 00:42:12,910
The player, you know, their kids might have born, you know, in the middle.

662
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,111
Who knows what happens?

663
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:17,572
You know, you never know what happened to the player,

664
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:19,533
so that's why you need to telegraph very clearly.

665
00:42:20,353 --> 00:42:24,916
Another example, actually, this is the one that is a negative example, I would say.

666
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:30,258
We've put a lot of effort in Cyberpunk 2077 in television and radio content.

667
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:33,179
And again, players who actually paid attention to that

668
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,061
liked it and really appreciated that.

669
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:37,841
But most of players didn't.

670
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:42,824
Most of players actually didn't realize that it's even there. That's why when you're actually

671
00:42:42,904 --> 00:42:48,128
designing the consequences for your choices, design for visibility. This is how I call it.

672
00:42:48,168 --> 00:42:55,132
So think how you can actually show it to the player in any possible way. When you're designing

673
00:42:55,332 --> 00:43:00,415
something that's super obscure and nobody will see it, it makes no sense. Really, it makes no

674
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:06,219
sense to spend that budget because for the player, something that that player didn't see, it doesn't exist.

676
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:12,718
And again, maybe their Redditors, they will go to Reddit and, you know, they will read about it and they will be all excited that it actually is there.

677
00:43:13,198 --> 00:43:15,300
But that is a fracture of your player base.

678
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,843
Majority of them, if they don't find it, they assume it's not there.

679
00:43:19,244 --> 00:43:21,526
And this is what happened for Cyberpunk, quite a lot actually.

680
00:43:21,886 --> 00:43:24,168
Like, a lot of our consequences have been subtle.

681
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:27,751
There have been situations where characters appear somewhere, they're mentioned, you know,

682
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:31,535
you can meet people that you have saved, you know. For instance, in this example, you know,

683
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:36,679
depending on your choices there, some of the TV content changes or radio content changes.

684
00:43:36,939 --> 00:43:42,284
Pretty much nobody realized that for quite a long, for quite a lot of time, you know.

685
00:43:42,744 --> 00:43:47,488
People claim that it's actually not in the game at all. So really designed for visibility,

686
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:52,473
especially when you're spending as much budget as we have spent on all of the radio and TV content.

687
00:43:53,685 --> 00:43:57,447
My dears, that concludes consequences. I'm actually not that bad with the time, though. I'm horrible. Okay,

688
00:43:58,968 --> 00:44:03,770
let's move on because we have like four more, but you know, thankfully we have a whole day. So

689
00:44:05,131 --> 00:44:08,633
we'll be talking about over-design, bravery, novelty, and effectiveness here. I have

690
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,214
quite a lot, so I'll be short on it right now.

691
00:44:12,635 --> 00:44:18,358
There is a moment when we as designers, we really feel that our ego speaks to us, right? And we want

692
00:44:18,398 --> 00:44:24,302
to make the most, the best possible life simulation we can. An example here, Panam is here sitting in

693
00:44:24,322 --> 00:44:29,665
a bar, sipping a beer in the prologue of Cyberpunk. You can actually meet her. And throughout the,

694
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:33,868
you know, early stages of the work on the game, through conversations, hey, should she maybe

695
00:44:34,128 --> 00:44:39,751
finish the beer, get into the car, leave, drive to Badlands, you know, meet the nomads, you can

696
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:40,812
follow her, see all of that.

697
00:44:41,572 --> 00:44:46,515
Okay, but what the hell is the point of that? You always need to ask yourself a question, okay,

698
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:53,900
why this is even in the game? Why I would be even adding that? Details are amazing when they matter,

699
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,642
when there's some kind of a meaning behind them, when there's a reason behind them. Adding that

700
00:44:58,702 --> 00:45:02,665
stuff really makes no sense. And always when you're working on the things, you need to ask

701
00:45:02,685 --> 00:45:06,667
yourself a question, am I actually designing or over-designing at this point?

702
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:13,473
I remember throughout work on Cyberpunk 2077, one of my designers changed his title on Slack to

703
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:22,821
Quest Overdesigner. So another example I wanted to show you is the example from Cool Metal Fire.

704
00:45:23,602 --> 00:45:27,365
This is the quest. This is the moment when Johnny Silverhand, for the first time,

705
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:32,449
takes over your body. And in here, actually, what I did

706
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:41,034
Together with cinematic designer, Łukasz Śliwa, we've made a decision that there's no point of actually V as Johnny,

707
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:46,676
because Johnny has control over everybody at that time, to meet the Rogue and with her actually talk about everything

708
00:45:46,716 --> 00:45:48,377
and really repeat everything that was said.

709
00:45:48,637 --> 00:45:55,421
We've decided to use a cut here and basically jump directly to the most important things.

710
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:58,522
And then there is a moment after that when you wake up in that hotel.

711
00:45:59,663 --> 00:46:03,184
You feel you have blood on your hands, you know, because you're like coughing badly and so on.

712
00:46:03,465 --> 00:46:07,446
Rogue is there and it turns out they already talked and established everything and she knows

713
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:11,107
all the important elements. So this ties up a bit to the brevity I talked about,

714
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:16,308
but also like we knew that, okay, we could actually design here an amazing long scene

715
00:46:16,588 --> 00:46:20,750
and do all of that, but we felt it's really not needed. Because in most cases,

716
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,990
it will be just repeating the same information.

717
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,612
And that is the overdesign. I'm speeding up slightly because we are short on time.

718
00:46:28,012 --> 00:46:32,794
So now let's go to the bravery. Now, I really want to, I really love this quest,

719
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:38,036
but this requires some introduction before I'm going to roll that clip. So, my dears,

720
00:46:38,476 --> 00:46:45,138
there's a quest in Cyberpunk 2077 when you meet Joshua Stephenson. He is a convict, and he,

721
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:51,000
during his time in prison, he decides to go back to God. He wants to die.

722
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,023
But dying a specific, and he knows he will die, he is sentenced to death,

723
00:46:55,283 --> 00:46:57,745
but he wants to die in a specific way. He has a purpose.

724
00:46:58,286 --> 00:47:01,308
He wants to die and become a symbol for everyone else.

725
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:03,850
And in our world, we have something called brain dances.

726
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:07,773
As a brain dance, you can record that brain dance and make someone else

727
00:47:08,254 --> 00:47:10,796
exactly feel and experience what you feel.

728
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:12,717
So what Joshua Stephenson does,

729
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:20,243
He gets in contact with a brain dance studio and they agree on so that he will die on a cross.

730
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:26,849
And they will record that as a brain dance for everyone who's a follower, for everyone who can

731
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:31,693
actually go through that experience. And there's a lot of build-up leading up to that scene. I

732
00:47:31,733 --> 00:47:36,116
wanted to make sure that you know all the context because that content is really important. We pay

733
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:37,077
a lot of attention to that.

734
00:47:37,597 --> 00:47:44,122
We had incredible writer Marcin Blacha, our story director, who wrote the dialogues for this quest

735
00:47:44,342 --> 00:47:48,305
to really make sure that we flesh it out before actually that happens.

736
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:50,306
Let's look at it and watch it together.

749
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,280
I honestly love this scene.

750
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:33,703
At the very beginning, when we were working on this quest, when the designer who actually

751
00:50:33,743 --> 00:50:39,326
designed it, Przemek Tarczynski, when he came to me, actually this quest was about something else.

753
00:50:39,506 --> 00:50:44,009
At the very beginning, you as a player, you're accompanying Joshua Stevenson, in the end

754
00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:46,890
you are delivering him to brain dance studio, and this is where it ended.

755
00:50:47,784 --> 00:50:51,306
And I told him, Przemek, but we have this amazing interactive scene system.

756
00:50:51,766 --> 00:50:56,929
I want to be in the shoes of that Roman soldier who actually hammers him to the cross.

757
00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:01,831
Because this, you can really put the player in that experience and you can really make the player feel it.

758
00:51:02,171 --> 00:51:04,773
And you can really make it be like this.

759
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:07,994
And our amazing cinematic team really made it happen.

760
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:13,477
And I honestly believe that we as a AAA industry, we are so scared of new topics.

761
00:51:13,977 --> 00:51:16,558
of things that require bravery,

762
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:18,139
and I'm talking about artistic bravery.

763
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,560
This quest has a lot of context.

764
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:23,282
It's not an edgy scene for being an edgy scene.

765
00:51:23,702 --> 00:51:25,122
It's a scene about the person,

766
00:51:25,203 --> 00:51:28,744
it's a quest about the religion, about belief.

767
00:51:29,264 --> 00:51:32,046
It's the really gruesome and dark world.

768
00:51:32,586 --> 00:51:33,967
That's why all of those elements

769
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,607
about religion, spirituality,

770
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:37,728
and being in close connection with other people

771
00:51:37,768 --> 00:51:38,989
actually matter so much.

772
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,511
And this is a very important element to have in your game.

773
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:49,137
In most AAA, and I'm speaking about this because the indies are actually doing a much better job here,

774
00:51:49,638 --> 00:51:54,743
in most AAAs you don't really see that. We are so safe with everything that we are building.

775
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:58,136
There is another example I wanted to show you.

776
00:51:58,176 --> 00:52:01,057
Actually, when I was working on Bloody Baron storyline from The Witcher 3,

777
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:06,140
there was a moment when I came up with the idea of Botchling,

778
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,402
you know, this miscarried child that Baron has.

779
00:52:10,042 --> 00:52:12,083
And there was a lot of concern.

780
00:52:12,143 --> 00:52:15,004
You know, we had some young fathers in the company

781
00:52:15,405 --> 00:52:18,046
and they were pointing out to me that they are maybe not too comfortable

782
00:52:18,066 --> 00:52:20,868
with having a zombie child in the game.

783
00:52:21,657 --> 00:52:23,958
But when we talked, I told them what it is about.

784
00:52:24,299 --> 00:52:25,459
It's about domestic violence.

785
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,981
It's about this broken father who's

786
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:31,604
a parallel to Geralt, actually trying to do his best

787
00:52:31,884 --> 00:52:34,606
and actually understanding all of his shortcomings.

788
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,368
And then there is a moment when he actually

789
00:52:36,408 --> 00:52:39,450
takes the botchling in his arms and walks with him.

790
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:43,313
That whole sequence when he carries him in the files,

791
00:52:43,713 --> 00:52:46,355
in the game files, I actually called it peregrination.

792
00:52:46,915 --> 00:52:53,777
Because he goes in to actually undo in a way as much as he can to do what he has done to his family.

793
00:52:54,157 --> 00:52:57,358
And that was important. It's not a shocking value just to be there.

794
00:52:57,638 --> 00:52:59,918
I wanted to talk about something that wasn't talked about.

795
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:05,580
And again, we are talking about 2012. At that time in AAAs, you didn't see topics like this.

796
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,520
Nowadays, it's maybe slightly different, especially in the indie space.

797
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,081
But at that time, it was something that nobody has ever done before.

798
00:53:12,361 --> 00:53:16,322
And we really wanted to do it because we believed that this artistic bravery.

799
00:53:17,062 --> 00:53:18,724
This is something we should be doing.

800
00:53:18,764 --> 00:53:20,004
This is our responsibility.

801
00:53:20,265 --> 00:53:23,007
And especially this is how I see it as a director in our company.

802
00:53:23,407 --> 00:53:26,589
And I know that a lot of directors are with me in this.

803
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:30,572
We have a purpose of basically doing something else, something different.

804
00:53:30,932 --> 00:53:35,135
Because you as players, when you come to us and you play a game from CD Projekt Red,

805
00:53:35,556 --> 00:53:37,477
it needs to feel like our game.

806
00:53:37,837 --> 00:53:38,598
And it's not safe.

807
00:53:38,918 --> 00:53:42,241
And we'll be doing things that sometimes nobody else will do.

808
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,181
There is another example from here.

809
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:48,022
There is a moment, one of the most beloved endings to Cyberpunk 2077,

810
00:53:48,382 --> 00:53:49,262
Don't Fear the Reaper.

811
00:53:49,623 --> 00:53:52,443
There is a moment when actually, if you have built a relationship with Johnny,

812
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:56,904
who will at some point offer you that he can actually join you

813
00:53:57,324 --> 00:54:00,505
on this one-to-one suicide mission on Arasaka.

814
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:03,706
That was something that our quest designer, Eero Varendi, proposed.

815
00:54:04,046 --> 00:54:07,487
He felt that it was needed in this given moment

816
00:54:07,547 --> 00:54:09,227
to give the players something like this.

817
00:54:09,527 --> 00:54:11,247
And we were like, this is so fucking bold.

818
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:12,568
We should probably do it.

819
00:54:13,348 --> 00:54:15,649
And that was basically how the conversation went.

820
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:18,251
We really wanted to give you that option as players,

821
00:54:18,691 --> 00:54:20,232
and we found out ways how to do that.

822
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:22,493
If you go in there solo on Arasaka,

823
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:25,995
when you die, the credits roll, because that is your ending.

824
00:54:26,295 --> 00:54:28,016
And of course, you know, a lot of players proven us

825
00:54:28,036 --> 00:54:31,978
that they are able to beat it really well, that whole sequence.

826
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:35,560
My dears, there's much more going on, and it's six minutes left.

827
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,442
So we are going to speed up even more.

828
00:54:39,682 --> 00:54:46,306
I wanted to show you one of the scenes, an example where our interactive scene system is used here

829
00:54:46,886 --> 00:54:52,590
as a matter of novelty. It was an important element of the innovation that we've been doing

830
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,991
for Cyberpunk 2077. Let's watch it together.
859
00:57:20,091 --> 00:57:21,472
Yeah, I don't see any brick here.

860
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:27,878
So, my dears, this scene actually shows so many innovations that we have done in Cyberpunk 2077

861
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:31,382
when it comes to first-person perspective storytelling.

862
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:36,907
And I wanted to mention this because of the MAYA principle that I wanted to explain to you.

863
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,389
Like, MAYA principle is something that...

864
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:46,334
I think can guide us a bit when it comes to working on a new novel things for our games.

865
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:51,657
And basically defines that you should actually provide as much novelty as you only can,

866
00:57:52,197 --> 00:57:55,819
while in the same time trying to stay somewhat

867
00:57:56,675 --> 00:58:01,996
relevant to the player, somewhat familiar, so that player is not lost. That is the way how we've been

868
00:58:02,016 --> 00:58:05,976
building our interactive scene system. As a player, you kind of get it. You know, you're there, okay,

869
00:58:05,996 --> 00:58:09,957
you can look around, even though at first, actually, a lot of other players didn't know

870
00:58:09,997 --> 00:58:13,898
that they can move their head in the scenes. They felt that they were just stiff because this is

871
00:58:13,918 --> 00:58:18,239
what they were taught to before. In time, of course, players learned, you know, that they can

872
00:58:18,279 --> 00:58:24,400
actually do it. And incredible things about the scene done by Michal Zbrzezniak, our cinematic designer.

874
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,823
Amazing thing about the scene is that you can see how much staging was changing.

875
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:32,666
You know, the characters were moving, you were in a place, but actually the plans were changing.

876
00:58:32,686 --> 00:58:36,690
You know, there was Royce in the background, you know, when the door opened, he was there,

877
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:40,433
then he walks into you. We're actually, by changing things in the front of you,

878
00:58:40,713 --> 00:58:41,674
changing your frame.

879
00:58:42,514 --> 00:58:47,038
It took us actually a lot of time to get to the point that we understood how to build those things.

880
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:52,643
So when it comes to the novelty, I really advise you to stick to the MAYA principle.

881
00:58:52,884 --> 00:58:57,528
When you're like maybe worried about like just going too wacky and doing something that, you know,

882
00:58:57,608 --> 00:59:03,533
your game won't find its place on the market, it will guide you in a way of like how to do.

883
00:59:04,314 --> 00:59:09,017
And what to do. Another example here is like, actually coming from one of the quests I worked on,

884
00:59:09,498 --> 00:59:15,282
you need to establish the rules before you break them. This is a pretty simple rule. A lot of young

885
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:20,245
designers really love to break the rules and they want to break all of the rules into first show the

886
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:26,069
rules that you have them, that you have established them to really be able to break them. I need to

887
00:59:26,089 --> 00:59:29,932
speed up slightly. So that's why we'll move on to effectiveness right away.

888
00:59:30,452 --> 00:59:36,314
And here is one of the elements of effectiveness I wanted to talk to you about is the fact that

889
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:43,257
you as a designer, you can really design your story and everything you have for the team you have.

890
00:59:43,557 --> 00:59:49,419
When I was actually working on like a Supreme Quest, I knew that my cinematic designer,

891
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,821
in this case it was Michal Zbrzezniak that I mentioned before, and David Cordero, an animator,

892
00:59:53,861 --> 00:59:58,763
they actually are both guitar players and they fucking love that stuff.

893
00:59:59,023 --> 01:00:03,266
So I knew that I can really basically design the whole concert when you are putting together

894
01:00:03,626 --> 01:00:08,249
samurai band, you're there in the shoes and playing with them. And I think this requires

895
01:00:08,329 --> 01:00:14,153
actually a lot of skill because you as designers, you need to have bonds, human bonds with your

896
01:00:14,273 --> 01:00:19,837
teammates. You need to know the people you're working with because sometimes some certain

897
01:00:19,897 --> 01:00:24,080
stories or elements you will be able to pull off and others you won't be able to.

898
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:29,424
And treat them as assets, treat them as resources, as a thing that you can really help out with,

899
01:00:29,464 --> 01:00:33,687
be together with that, and build together. But this requires you to know the people you're

900
01:00:33,747 --> 01:00:38,831
working with and know their strong sides and weak sides, because then you can really build it for.

901
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:44,335
I will just glance over those really fast, but this is the last two points.

902
01:00:45,328 --> 01:00:47,808
Pay attention to what other designers are building.

903
01:00:48,488 --> 01:00:51,149
This is an example from a quest from Philipp Weber, The Parade,

904
01:00:51,549 --> 01:00:55,190
in Cyberpunk 2077. When we designed that quest in 2019,

905
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:59,591
we already knew what is in the game. Therefore, it was actually pretty easy to

906
01:00:59,711 --> 01:01:02,931
know that we are providing something different than other designers.

907
01:01:03,391 --> 01:01:06,352
Believe me or not, but if you're working with creatives and, you know, probably

908
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:09,392
some of you definitely feel it, creative people

909
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,373
actually come up with the same ideas very often.

910
01:01:11,813 --> 01:01:14,153
You know, separate people will come up with the same ideas.

911
01:01:14,594 --> 01:01:15,394
That happens really.

912
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:18,594
A situation when you actually have the team that communicates well

913
01:01:18,835 --> 01:01:20,675
and knows what the hell is happening in the game

914
01:01:20,995 --> 01:01:24,396
is really important because then you don't copy each other's ideas

915
01:01:24,736 --> 01:01:27,757
and you don't reuse the same solutions that you already have.

916
01:01:28,257 --> 01:01:31,758
And the last, last moment, a shot from Pyramid Song, a quest by Sarah Gruemmer.

917
01:01:32,698 --> 01:01:36,060
This is one of the quests that's actually one of the primary examples of situation

918
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:41,843
when whole team was put so much on the same page. This is one of the most beloved quests from

919
01:01:41,903 --> 01:01:47,046
Cyberpunk 2077 where all of the disciplines collaborated really well. Sarah, basically,

920
01:01:47,086 --> 01:01:51,189
Sarah is our expert. She knew everyone in the team. She knew their capabilities, knew what

921
01:01:51,369 --> 01:01:55,971
what to do, and she knew how to push their buttons to really push them to do their best.

922
01:01:56,872 --> 01:01:58,373
My dears, that concludes this part.

923
01:01:58,893 --> 01:02:01,374
This is a speed run at the last moment.

924
01:02:01,895 --> 01:02:03,616
So now I'm actually moving on.

925
01:02:03,756 --> 01:02:06,758
Here are actually a few slides that are basically takeaways.

926
01:02:07,398 --> 01:02:08,799
I'm just displaying them for you here.

927
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:11,361
Of course, this will be on GDC Vault, so you can take a look.

928
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:15,623
All of those points are actually already in the presentation.

929
01:02:15,663 --> 01:02:17,625
So this is more of a sum up for you

930
01:02:17,645 --> 01:02:19,186
so that you know what's going on.

931
01:02:19,246 --> 01:02:20,907
And here's the last part.

932
01:02:21,787 --> 01:02:26,714
And now, I wanted to thank you so much for being here!
