1
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:10,576
started. Um, my name is Nick Van Vught and I'm the uh, community lead at Yukon Games. Uh,

2
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:15,698
today I'm going to be talking to everyone here about overcoming community negativity. Um, and

3
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:22,020
as the title suggests, it can be a bit of an exercise in sanity. Um, I've been asked to let

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,001
everyone know to please silence your noise makers. Um, that'd be fantastic.

5
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:30,814
So very quickly to give some background information,

6
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,696
Yukon Games is a Toronto based mobile game studio.

7
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:37,900
At Yukon we currently have 13 titles available for download

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,721
which vary across different demographics.

9
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,823
Our oldest games on the top row

10
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:43,204
have been around since 2009.

11
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:46,026
We use the term U Wars to refer to all of them at once.

12
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:49,033
These titles are built in HTML5.

13
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:51,315
They're text-based games that center heavily

14
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,556
around community interaction

15
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:53,817
and befriending people in the game.

16
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:56,759
These are also effectively re-skinned versions

17
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:59,441
of the exact same game, each with their own theme.

18
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,623
Because of this, the audience for these games

19
00:01:01,703 --> 00:01:02,463
are very similar.

20
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:05,045
Skewing more heavily to the male demographic

21
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:07,027
between the ages of 18 to 49,

22
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,709
these players also tend to be some of the more volatile

23
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:10,329
that we deal with.

24
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,140
In this presentation I'm going to be using a lot of case

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,581
studies from these games as the majority of the struggles that

26
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,963
we've encountered in our day to day engagement come from these

27
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:22,465
seven titles. U-Wars is also a unique case study because it is

28
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:25,027
100 percent controlled and operated by our community team

29
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,768
in a live ops fashion and has been for the past three years.

30
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:31,959
So once active development stopped in our games,

31
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:33,580
our position within the community team

32
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,382
was to continue to engage with our players

33
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:38,105
and bring them new content while running weekly events.

34
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:40,288
With no dev knowledge on our small team,

35
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:42,370
this focused on easy to use tools

36
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,352
that allowed us to keep players as happy as we could.

37
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,876
However, the lack of development over the past few years

38
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:50,378
have only made player frustrations even more evident.

39
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:54,609
We've had a lot of members of our community who have had their accounts for upwards of

40
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:58,512
eight years and have become discouraged with the state of the game and the lack of updates.

41
00:01:59,313 --> 00:02:02,735
These are some of our most passionate players who flock to the forums and to social media

42
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:04,376
to express their concerns about these titles.

43
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:10,301
As I mentioned, my talk today is going to be about tackling and overcoming community negativity.

44
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:12,942
And as I'm sure everyone read in the course description,

45
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:16,263
as community managers, we assume that we have this topic handled.

46
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:20,145
It's easy to think that because you've dealt with negativity and lack of enthusiasm in the past,

47
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:22,306
you're going to be able to address these concerns.

48
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:25,948
In reality, it's an ever-changing landscape and something that we honestly don't do enough

49
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:27,348
and should always be working on improving.

50
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:31,105
As a quick warning, I'll be showing some player feedback

51
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:34,947
and comments in this presentation that are a bit colorful,

52
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:35,768
to say the least.

53
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,070
I hope that no one takes any offense to this,

54
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,892
but really I wanted everyone to get a better idea

55
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:42,413
of what we deal with on a daily basis.

56
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:45,376
I know it's stuff that we all worry about on a day-to-day

57
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:47,657
and keeping this presentation as honest as possible

58
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,439
is the only way to get the most out of it that we can.

59
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,741
Also, as you can tell, I'm using really bad stock images

60
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,202
from the web, from like the internet,

61
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:55,463
because those are the best.

62
00:02:58,072 --> 00:03:01,414
Maintaining player enthusiasm is a tough job for community teams, as I'm sure most of you

63
00:03:01,454 --> 00:03:01,594
know.

64
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:05,617
Decisions are frequently made outside your control, and the responsibility of interacting

65
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:08,639
with and mitigating the expectations of your community falls on your shoulders.

66
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,481
It can often be difficult to conduct yourself in a way that is both representative of your

67
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,603
gaming studio, while also empathizing with the frustrations of your community.

68
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:18,185
But these aren't necessarily contradictory positions.

69
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:21,955
Enthusiasm is also hard to maintain.

70
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,656
Some days are extremely rewarding and you feel as though

71
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,496
you've cracked the code on player engagement,

72
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,557
and other days you feel like you're beating your head

73
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:31,418
against the wall repeatedly over and over and over again.

74
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,618
And that's why figuring out little tips and tricks

75
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:35,079
on how to overcome these type of things

76
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,599
can be very rewarding and helpful.

77
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,940
Most importantly, I believe that maintaining enthusiasm

78
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,281
is draining on both your staff and the gaming community.

79
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,976
It can be easy to brush off some pointed attacks or player criticisms,

80
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,039
but often keeping your community happy and engaged in your product

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,103
can be detrimental to the well-being of your team and the community.

82
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:55,927
The biggest problem we face is that giving players what they want

83
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,209
isn't necessarily a top priority for your product team.

84
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,673
It can often come at the cost of long nights spent dealing with player concerns

85
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:03,675
or dreading going into the forums day after day.

86
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:08,802
At the worst, these expectations can cause anxiety or depression, and the problem with

87
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:11,824
that is that maintaining player enthusiasm is our responsibility.

88
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:16,849
Because this is our responsibility, you have to work with your community on improving player

89
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:17,269
sentiment.

90
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:21,613
It can lead to increased sales, improved team morale, and a better community to interact

91
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:21,833
with.

92
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:26,217
It can just be tough some days to dive in head first, understanding the negativity that

93
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:26,757
you may face.

94
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:30,767
So to give a bit of context in this presentation,

95
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:33,568
as I mentioned, I took somewhere in the ballpark

96
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:36,729
of maybe over 100, closer to 200 screenshots

97
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:39,550
of extremely negative comments that we've received

98
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,811
in my five years at Yukon,

99
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,951
but in an effort to keep the presentation

100
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,232
moving along very smoothly, here are just a few of them.

101
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:52,322
So here we have a user calling us dumb and lazy, saying that we're creating an unfriendly

102
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:56,288
atmosphere and saying that we don't deserve to be in the gaming industry. This user has

103
00:04:56,328 --> 00:05:00,915
also chosen to use one of my most disliked nicknames in our company history. Pukin.

104
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:11,514
this charming player has also used the term Pukin uh and told us to stop running

105
00:05:11,574 --> 00:05:16,175
tournaments that cause lag. So for some added context about Pukin, it became so

106
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,836
popular that we actually added it to our language filter blacklist.

107
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:23,218
And this one's super fun as well.

108
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:25,418
A user saying that the new feature we implemented

109
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,279
was a joke, calling us a merry band of morons

110
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,379
and telling us to take our heads out of each other's asses

111
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:30,980
and wake up.

112
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,060
He then goes on to say that his five year old

113
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,280
could have designed a better system

114
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,261
and that we're gonna lose players due to this feature.

115
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:39,202
For some clarification, this comment came following

116
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,022
a request to update the feature the player's

117
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:43,483
complaining about, asking us to make it more interactive,

118
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,603
which we did and was met with extreme negativity.

119
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:52,142
This player called us dishonest, which in itself isn't too bad, but he just piles it on

120
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:55,704
afterwards saying that we're a joke, that our community laughs in our face and that they

121
00:05:55,724 --> 00:06:01,866
fail to believe in us. Another player saying that we don't care about our community and that

122
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:06,347
we only care when our players call us names. In an effort to exemplify this, he then calls us

123
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:14,310
wankers and clowns. And here's another fun nickname, F-Ukin, which a player renamed

124
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,090
themselves to and then said that they were the CEO.

125
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:22,013
He then encouraged the community to go to the app store, providing them with a handy

126
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:26,174
link where, like I said, it's HTML5 games, and then called for a boycott of the game

127
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:29,456
and also called to arms to write negative reviews in with the Better Business Bureau,

128
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:31,136
which I stayed up writing responses to.

129
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:37,807
And this is a good case study too. Lots of fun, this one. Um, here's a case where we tried to do

130
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:41,611
something fun for our users. It was the holidays and we wanted to give back to our players by

131
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:45,674
giving them a bunch of free items, running cool events, um, and just giving them stuff just for

132
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:49,878
logging in. Most of them seemed to revolt saying that the gifts weren't generous enough. This

133
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:53,361
player remarked that our two admins were too busy engaging in intercourse to respond to

134
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:54,221
their concerns.

135
00:06:57,758 --> 00:06:59,802
And another player mad about the free holiday gift,

136
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:01,667
saying that instead of plowing them in the butt,

137
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:03,030
we should have given them something better.

138
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,375
Like I said, free gifts, just for signing on.

139
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:06,417
They didn't like it.

140
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:09,669
In our attempts to help players out

141
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:11,370
and create a more engaging product,

142
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,310
we were met with even more frustration.

143
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,111
We ran a survey to better understand

144
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,951
what players wanted from the direction of the game.

145
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,692
The intent was to give a voice to all players

146
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,153
and to genuinely gauge player sentiment and frustrations.

147
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:25,094
The survey received some eloquent and thoughtful abuse,

148
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:26,174
which I've highlighted here.

149
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,115
Here's a player saying that our results were dog shit

150
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,055
and insulting, saying that we're unable

151
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,296
to successfully run a game.

152
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:34,256
He goes on to tell us that we're inept

153
00:07:34,316 --> 00:07:35,636
and unable to do our jobs.

154
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:39,961
In the rest of the message, he even provided me a copy and paste template for me to send

155
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:42,223
to my CEO about what a bad job I was doing.

156
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:49,912
And here's one of the many players, many players, that agreed with the previous post, saying

157
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:53,256
that the survey was a massive waste of time and inferring that we were bribing them into

158
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:56,099
answering it and that it reeked of desperation for a dying game.

159
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,612
So, that's funny, what can you do when you're faced by this

160
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:06,352
toxicity day in and day out, every single day,

161
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:07,253
it's just awful.

162
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:10,394
And you can, managing these varying degrees of negativity

163
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:13,355
across a dozen active titles means that you have to learn

164
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,836
to and adapt to the different communities that surface

165
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:16,436
in your games.

166
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:19,117
Treating every case as though they were the same

167
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,377
can be catastrophic and detrimental to managing

168
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:21,978
your community.

169
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:24,598
And keep in mind that there are no catchalls

170
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,359
when it comes to handling these concerns.

171
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:30,287
Regardless of the level of negativity or prior experience,

172
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:31,947
there are underlying principles

173
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,808
that every community manager can do

174
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:36,869
that help inspire, build, and maintain player loyalty.

175
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,610
So here are some tried and true approaches

176
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,891
that we've used at Ukin to help mitigate player concerns

177
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:43,131
and to keep players engaged.

178
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,393
Champion those in your community

179
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:48,233
who are passionate about your game or product.

180
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:52,175
Constantly try new things, given the tools that you have.

181
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:58,082
Admit your failures and faults both for the company and personally as a community manager.

182
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:03,526
And finally, be honest and relatable. And these are going to be the pillars that I'm

183
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:08,629
going to be discussing in my talk today. So let's start with the first point.

184
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:12,956
Making champions out of those who are passionate creates players who will fight by your side and

185
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:16,759
who will dilute negativity wherever they see it, be it in the forums, on social media,

186
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:23,963
and even through email. Forces of War is our real-world war-themed U-Wars title. At its peak,

187
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:29,206
it had nearly 400,000 monthly active users. One of those players was named Barry Chen.

188
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:33,489
Although Barry had only ever spent a few dollars in the game and had long since stopped spending,

189
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:37,691
he was very, very close to many influential and high-spending players.

190
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:42,467
Our community managers arranged a tournament that Barry would run completely by himself. We

191
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:46,049
only needed to set up the modifiers and schedule the tournament. Something our community

192
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:49,991
managers could do without bugging a developer. Barry would organize the players,

193
00:09:50,352 --> 00:09:54,354
calculate the scores for us and encourage players to sign up. We on the community team

194
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,816
would only need to cross reference those numbers, which only took a few minutes, and

195
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:01,738
supply some free items and minimal free currency for the winning players. It was so

196
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:05,200
successful that players still talk about it to this day. So here are a few comments that

197
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,061
better illustrate this. These are happy comments.

198
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:10,984
Thanks, Barry, even though I'm not participating,

199
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:12,885
it's a lot of work, it shows dedication.

200
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:15,246
Thanks to Yukon for chipping in some prizes.

201
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:17,247
Everyone knows Barry is a boss.

202
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:18,748
He's selfless and organized.

203
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:19,568
Cheers, Barry.

204
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:21,669
Barry's the god of forces of war.

205
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:24,011
He's bringing war back to this great war game.

206
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:24,671
War's a theme.

207
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,313
Grandmaster Chen, when he walks in the room,

208
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:29,273
everyone bows.

209
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:31,895
Seriously, the initiative and selfless spirit

210
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,896
really creates a new perspective for so many, Barry.

211
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,932
Thank you, Yukon, for working with and green-lighting this player-run tournament.

212
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:40,114
Hope you can upgrade your servers to deal with the next one.

213
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:44,117
And that's fine, I'll take a little bit of, you know, a little bit of harassing

214
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,098
if it is followed by such a positive comment.

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,581
So, what did all this praise get us?

216
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:51,983
The tournament was a resounding success.

217
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:55,405
We had a 200% increase in revenue over the period of the tournament,

218
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:59,208
which was more significant than some of our more successful staff-designed tournaments at the time.

219
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:02,692
We created a limited item that players could purchase

220
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:04,573
called the Chen, named after Barry.

221
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,475
It had great stats and was sought after by the community

222
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:09,255
who wanted an advantage over other players.

223
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,157
We also gave Barry one of his own items for free,

224
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:15,659
which kicked off player personalized items within the game.

225
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,520
We now hold Hall of Fame contests and regularly create

226
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,241
and name items after our passionate players

227
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,343
to give back to them and to also generate excitement

228
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,044
and buzz around participating in events.

229
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:28,947
Creating these items is both low friction and low cost,

230
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:30,710
and it encourages players who are passionate

231
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,112
to engage more often in the community,

232
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,715
and also to generate positive sentiment, which can't hurt.

233
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:37,979
Finally, this event was the initiative needed

234
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,042
to start player-run and organized tournaments,

235
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,345
which we still support to this day nearly five years later.

236
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:48,369
In conjunction with these player run tournaments is the idea of trying something new and is a key

237
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:53,113
component in all of our games. We always take feedback into consideration for development, but

238
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:56,256
actually acting on it shows players that you're willing to listen to them and act on their

239
00:11:56,296 --> 00:12:01,120
ideas. Trying out a new modifier in a tournament or running an event outside of scheduled

240
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,523
rotations can show players that you're willing to work with them instead of against them.

241
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:08,798
By listening to the feedback and suggestions of your community, you show them that their

242
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:13,365
opinions are valued. It's not just about listening, though. You have to act on it. And

243
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:16,469
don't make false promises telling them that you're going to do something that you're unsure

244
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:19,874
of, but promise them that you can look into it and make sure that you report back.

245
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:25,024
Sometimes getting these changes up and running quickly can be difficult, but keeping communication

246
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:26,964
channels open with players helps considerably.

247
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:31,345
Through community suggestions, we've run numerous tournaments and events in our games outside

248
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:35,406
of regulated times and have seen a three or four times increase in sales and a lot of

249
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,127
positive sentiment for such a small change.

250
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:43,068
As a case study, let's take the Centaurians event that we held in one of our games, Age

251
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:45,369
of Legends, our fantasy-themed war game.

252
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:50,967
In addition to battling, competing in clans, and completing missions, crafting has always

253
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,588
been an important mechanic within our games.

254
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:56,350
Players liked upgrading their items to make them even more powerful, but were limited

255
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,851
by the number of items they could carry.

256
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:02,033
So this presented a unique opportunity to give players exactly what they wanted, stronger

257
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:05,555
items they could use in battle, along with a more interactive event that had been requested

258
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:05,975
for months.

259
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:13,866
The premise was a bit complicated, but ultimately it allowed players to focus on acquiring items

260
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:15,466
that they could craft into a stronger item.

261
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:19,527
This image was shared on our Facebook and Twitter pages, not only to give players a

262
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:23,088
better visual opportunity to understand what needed to be done, but also to grow those

263
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:23,609
pages out.

264
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:28,150
And again, we were met with resistance from the community.

265
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,731
Although they had been asking for something like this numerous times, there was a fear

266
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:34,532
that they would miss out on obtaining these limited items.

267
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,893
players with low level accounts were frustrated that they may not get the high level items

268
00:13:39,173 --> 00:13:43,177
without having to pay for it. And as soon as the event started, many called for boycotts

269
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:47,802
and others called us useless and insulted our developers before even trying out the event.

270
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:53,007
But following these complaints, we still had plenty of positive comments in the forums as

271
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,570
well. People giving us credit for trying something new.

272
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,840
One of our players congratulated us for doing something

273
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,843
different, saying that they would still get great items

274
00:14:01,903 --> 00:14:06,327
just for participating, and that some events are just

275
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:07,588
intended to be difficult.

276
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:12,132
And thankfully, this player said that with the release of

277
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:14,374
the event, we managed to make the game interesting again.

278
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:18,520
Finally, a post by a player who goes out of their way

279
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:20,602
to help the community better understand the benefits

280
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:21,763
of participating in the event,

281
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:23,845
even if they aren't entirely happy with it.

282
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:26,267
He addressed the concerns of the low-level players

283
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:28,749
and even gave them some stretch goals to shoot for

284
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,791
to benefit themselves from the tournament.

285
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:33,133
This post alone encouraged the vast majority

286
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:35,115
of the community to actually try out the tournament

287
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,736
and increase the amount of positive sentiment

288
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:37,537
for trying something new.

289
00:14:40,477 --> 00:14:44,520
Explaining the worth of something like this is very difficult. And on the surface, knowing

290
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,822
that players simply participated isn't quite enough to justify the amount of work that went

291
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:52,944
into it. In a worst case scenario, we would have created a tournament that had flooded our

292
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:57,487
economy with really strong weapons and it could have caused a collapse in our game's balance.

293
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:01,569
Which brings up a more measurable question. What did our metrics look like?

294
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,681
So we had a few thousand players participate in the

295
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:06,701
weekend event.

296
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:07,562
80% reached the first tier.

297
00:15:07,662 --> 00:15:09,683
So right away, if you just played along and you hit the

298
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:11,644
first tier, you'd get some free premium currency.

299
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:15,845
65% of participants received free items.

300
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,707
And those were worth much more than the free premium currency

301
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:19,307
that we gave them.

302
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,209
And only 1% actually obtained and managed to assemble the

303
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,710
ultimate item, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

304
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,291
It promotes the limited nature of the item and the prestige

305
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:29,691
of actually being able to obtain one.

306
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:34,268
And our metrics showed the company that investing in new ideas like this is actually a good

307
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:34,509
thing.

308
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,992
Month over month, our revenue in the game grew by 47%.

309
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:41,818
And even had a tail that extended into April, which was usually one of our slower months

310
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,139
in the year.

311
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:48,359
Next is admitting when you're wrong or admitting when something isn't working correctly.

312
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,260
And it's imperative in combating negativity.

313
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:54,242
It's also a trait that all community managers need to embrace.

314
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:59,264
There's a need to protect your integrity or stand strong against accusations, but telling

315
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:01,205
players when you know something sucks can help a lot.

316
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:07,254
In our game Crime Inc., we have items called underbosses. They can be purchased using

317
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:12,217
premium or soft currency and give stat boosts to player accounts. They have great art and

318
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:18,460
allow players to collect a council of criminals to help attack others. Following a lengthy

319
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,762
investigation, we had found that one of our premium underbosses, so ones that you actually

320
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:27,724
had to spend real money to obtain, uh, needed to be rebalanced. And the item was initially

321
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:30,605
designed without a long term plan in mind. We had

322
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:33,168
we had to make a really difficult decision.

323
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:35,569
We had to reduce the benefit that the item was giving,

324
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,309
even though players had spent real money on it.

325
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,570
Her name was Meryl Newsome.

326
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:43,051
And with the right items equipped,

327
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:45,512
Meryl could provide players with nearly unlimited

328
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:47,232
recharges to their health and stats.

329
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,853
So it effectively let players play for free

330
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:50,993
for as long as they wanted.

331
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:52,994
And for a free-to-play title like Crime Inc.,

332
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:54,815
this was very, very dangerous.

333
00:16:56,082 --> 00:17:00,064
And obviously this blew up in the forums with players calling us greedy bastards, saying

334
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:03,886
that we're bending the laws, committing fraud and saying that the decision to make the change

335
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:08,929
was highway robbery. Players were urging others to contact third party services for full

336
00:17:08,989 --> 00:17:12,451
payment refunds, resetting their accounts and many were contacting us with some of the

337
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:16,193
more belligerent and abusive behavior that we've encountered in the company. And this

338
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:21,276
comment isn't even the tip of the iceberg. So how do you deal with something like this

339
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:22,517
without popping a vein in your head?

340
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,971
In our experience, admitting exactly what happened

341
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:28,112
and why it had to happen means that you have to admit

342
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,034
that the initial design was ill-informed

343
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:32,055
and that the fault lies in the hands of the company

344
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,736
and relieves the players of blame.

345
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:36,798
Although players are drastically affected

346
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:38,039
in rebalancing cases like this,

347
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,241
finding loopholes is understandable.

348
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:42,583
In order to keep the game fair and balanced for all players,

349
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:45,084
it's important for the community to not only understand

350
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:46,205
why the decision was made,

351
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,667
but then to give them a platform to voice their concerns.

352
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:52,276
We spent an exhausting afternoon in the forums,

353
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,397
responding directly to player concerns and feedback.

354
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,058
No question was off the table.

355
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,520
We spent a considerable amount of time doing our best

356
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,041
to quell the concerns of our community,

357
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:02,722
and honestly, it helped.

358
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:05,543
We had numerous players praising us

359
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,824
for taking the time to talk to them

360
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:09,325
and for trying to find a compromise for their concerns.

361
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,267
Sure, there were still plenty of upset users,

362
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:14,768
but knowing that we took the time to address the concerns

363
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,109
took a lot of the pressure off.

364
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:19,454
In summary, we found that players are substantially

365
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:22,135
less likely to directly attack you if you put up your hands

366
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,436
and you say, my bad.

367
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,236
And that goes for bugs too.

368
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:26,797
Tell players what's going on.

369
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:27,877
Are you working on a fix?

370
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:29,198
What's the status of the fix?

371
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:30,918
It shows players that you're trying to manage

372
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:32,439
their expectations the best that you can.

373
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,401
And my final point, it's important to not come at players

374
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:38,201
from on high.

375
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:40,042
Representing your company is critical,

376
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:42,403
but also being able to talk to your players on their level

377
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,183
is necessary in improving communication.

378
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:49,380
Saying that you understand your player's frustration isn't always helpful.

379
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,223
It can come across as dismissive if you don't genuinely try to connect it with your player's

380
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:53,723
concerns.

381
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:58,167
Show them that you know why they're frustrated, reiterate their concerns, and speak to their

382
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:00,649
issues in a way that shows them that you're more than just a talking head.

383
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:04,718
Anticipate how players will react to your comments.

384
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:06,559
If you can anticipate their response,

385
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,240
it makes it significantly easier

386
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,540
to mitigate your expectations.

387
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,281
If you write a response and think,

388
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:13,061
this will probably make things worse,

389
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:14,362
chances are it will.

390
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:15,822
Show of hands real quick,

391
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,523
who has written up a response in HitSend

392
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:19,503
when they knew that it was gonna make the situation worse?

393
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:21,124
Me too.

394
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:22,544
It, don't do it.

395
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:24,545
You're gonna keep doing it.

396
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:25,585
I'm gonna keep doing it,

397
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,885
but it never makes things easier.

398
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,046
If you can recognize it before you HitSend,

399
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,147
you have time.

400
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:35,896
and bite your tongue, seriously.

401
00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:38,738
You may feel inclined to respond to the contrary

402
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,440
and to prove the player wrong,

403
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,042
but never allow yourself to respond while in this headspace.

404
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:45,564
In some cases, honesty means telling a player

405
00:19:45,604 --> 00:19:46,365
that they're incorrect,

406
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,326
but it never means that you should do so in a way

407
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:50,468
that devalues their contribution to the community.

408
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:53,150
As a side note, did you know that there's like

409
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,953
a million photos of women biting laptops on Google?

410
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:00,937
I hate it so much.

411
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:07,378
So being honest and relatable gains you a lot of credit

412
00:20:07,418 --> 00:20:09,319
in the community and players are always thrilled

413
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,419
that you took the time to talk to them on their level.

414
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,100
In one of the threads I mentioned earlier

415
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,881
where we conducted the community survey,

416
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:18,001
we received a considerable number of complaints

417
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:19,962
from players who felt as though regardless

418
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,482
of the intention of the survey,

419
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:23,623
it was too late for us to redeem ourselves.

420
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:26,884
Our response was as follows, and I'm paraphrasing

421
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:28,625
as you can see a very long admin post.

422
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:32,406
It's difficult to help a community that's so negative.

423
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:36,710
The purpose of the survey was to give a voice to players who feel uncomfortable posting in the

424
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:42,154
forums, because of the negativity, and being mean doesn't open dialogue for proactive solutions.

425
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:47,979
Even following that initial post, players continued to harass us, saying that we didn't

426
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,862
care about our community and that the requests for new features had gone unnoticed for quite

427
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:57,266
some time. Aha! This provided an opportunity for us to be more transparent to our user base.

428
00:20:58,252 --> 00:21:01,694
We went on to describe a bit more about the way new features are worked on and how they

429
00:21:01,714 --> 00:21:04,436
get through a suggestion pipeline and eventually deployed by our devs.

430
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:09,640
It also gave us a chance to explain to players that the voice of so few in the forum doesn't

431
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,982
always represent the best interest of the entire community.

432
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:15,404
I think that was noted in the first talk this morning for the community summit, which it's

433
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:21,529
roughly 1 in 1,000 that actually respond in the forums, so it's such a small, small number

434
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:24,211
of players, but they can also be some of the worst players.

435
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,667
And after a bit of explanation,

436
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:31,390
players received the response very positively.

437
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,092
This player is thanking us for taking the time

438
00:21:34,132 --> 00:21:35,073
to address their concerns,

439
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:37,395
and admitted that they had lost faith in our ability

440
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:38,536
to provide customer service,

441
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:40,257
simply because we weren't being as honest

442
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:40,978
as we should have been.

443
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,062
This player's feedback was actually very well put,

444
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:46,803
saying that despite their comments,

445
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:49,245
they were only interested in engaging in a dialogue,

446
00:21:49,345 --> 00:21:51,507
and didn't realize that we would have taken it

447
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:52,568
as seriously as we did.

448
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:58,870
Another player saying that our intent interactions in the forums turned them from the grumpiest

449
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:05,114
player to the most content. And a player telling us that we just provided them with the best

450
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:11,357
in-game customer service and feedback that they've ever received. This player is noting

451
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:16,039
that baby steps helped the situation and actually provided useful information, encouraging us

452
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:17,220
to be as honest as possible.

453
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:21,274
and probably the most relevant comment

454
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,275
and the one we receive the most often,

455
00:22:23,996 --> 00:22:26,618
thanking us for taking the time to listen and to get abused.

456
00:22:27,198 --> 00:22:28,559
And this screenshot goes a long way

457
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,420
in illustrating just how frustrating it can be

458
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,501
to be a community manager.

459
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:34,363
Players assault you with abuse and harassment

460
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,025
and expect you to wait around for praise

461
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,986
once you've managed to push through to a breakthrough.

462
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,228
It's exhausting and draining,

463
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:42,149
and yet we encounter it every single day.

464
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,832
So what does this adoration mean?

465
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:52,721
In this first graph, the bump that you see here in August is a 67% increase in revenue

466
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:56,624
week over week following our interactions we had with our villains players in the forums

467
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:58,085
in regards to the community survey.

468
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:02,748
The long draining afternoon of abuse actually provided worthwhile results.

469
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:06,622
The second graph I have here is following

470
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:08,302
the Merrill Newsom incident in Crime Inc.

471
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:10,683
Getting into the forums and spending an afternoon

472
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:13,664
quelling player concerns resulted in a 54% increase

473
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:14,825
in week over week revenue.

474
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:18,266
It seems hard to believe, and trust me, it was,

475
00:23:18,906 --> 00:23:21,547
but we weren't running any new sales or interesting events

476
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:23,228
or anything like that during these spikes.

477
00:23:23,848 --> 00:23:25,929
The conclusion to tie to this is that spending the time

478
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,389
to actually connect to your players

479
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,370
means that you might be making your company more money.

480
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:31,731
If there was ever a reason to bring to your company

481
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:34,412
how important having a community team is, this is it.

482
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:37,873
So let's recap.

483
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:40,255
What can you do to maintain player enthusiasm

484
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:41,616
and help mitigate frustrations?

485
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:44,357
Champion those who are passionate,

486
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:46,679
so have players on your side to fight for you

487
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:47,579
and to rally the troops.

488
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,201
Try something new once in a while.

489
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:51,942
Get players out of their routine

490
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:53,363
and keep them engaged with your product

491
00:23:53,423 --> 00:23:54,443
and your company's direction.

492
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,225
Admit your failures and faults.

493
00:23:57,685 --> 00:23:59,226
Do your best to explain to your players

494
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:00,947
why things happen the way that they did.

495
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:04,340
And finally, be honest and relatable.

496
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:06,143
Be a spokesperson for your community

497
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:07,585
and give them a reason to root for you.

498
00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:10,902
So what does the future bring?

499
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:12,924
Well, first and foremost,

500
00:24:13,344 --> 00:24:15,346
the company is moving towards casual titles

501
00:24:15,406 --> 00:24:17,327
like Kings of Pool, Bingo Pop,

502
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,269
and coming soon Jeopardy World Tour.

503
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:21,210
These present their own challenges

504
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,351
with different demographics,

505
00:24:22,691 --> 00:24:24,452
but ultimately the themes I've talked about today

506
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,694
remain the same and will help carry our community team

507
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:27,515
into these releases.

508
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,736
And it's important to always remember

509
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:32,718
your vocal community is only a small representation

510
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:34,480
