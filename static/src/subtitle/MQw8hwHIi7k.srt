1
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,124
It's a different kind of interview, it's neither rhetorical nor capacitive.

2
00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:05,665
It's pure conversation.

3
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:06,445
And that's the important point.

4
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,327
Finally, one of the elements that comes to mind, if I can be honest about it, for people

5
00:00:08,347 --> 00:00:09,428
of color, when you stand in the center, it's like a home.

6
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:10,809
I don't know if that's the best way to put it, but it's inspiring.

7
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:11,009
Thank you.

8
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:11,229
Thank you.

9
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:11,449
Thank you.

10
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:49,625
Go ahead and tell your story.

11
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:59,574
If you enjoyed it, give us a like or subscribe to help support us.

12
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:03,958
Until next time, stay awesome.

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,621
But it also starts at an early age.

14
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:10,042
It's not a chapter, it's a book.

15
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:12,003
All these basic categories,

16
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:13,724
things that I wanna talk about.

17
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:14,685
There's nothing important here.

18
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:15,145
It's really not.

19
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:16,686
And I do that very often.

20
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:18,606
But there's something heck up here,

21
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,127
it's on the Dontcha know already,

22
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:23,329
so I say don't keep on going,

23
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:24,089
keep listening,

24
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,471
because I really do need to take some stones.

25
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:29,031
And in my opinion,

26
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:31,813
we've all become run out of time right?

27
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,594
Right now, I can tell you before I leave,

28
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:38,674
I saw these boxes.

29
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:41,875
So I figured out I'd better do my homework

30
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:42,875
studying the issues.

31
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:44,956
Something similar to my graduate intentions.

32
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:48,057
So I set out to interview one of the film technicians

33
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:50,317
who was one of our best mentors.

34
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:52,798
We had talked a lot about chemistry.

35
00:01:52,838 --> 00:01:55,399
And I was giving him an elevator class by that time.

36
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:58,900
But basically, he was having group classes

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,320
at that summer.

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,661
And he had the talk to one of our film test subjects.

39
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:04,802
And then I was interviewing him.

40
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:07,622
So we also have all the bills,

41
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:08,342
but with that in mind,

42
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,603
we can wrap it up for the day.

43
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:12,344
You're probably already better

44
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:14,104
off talking about the actions

45
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,745
that you're not going to be

46
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:16,525
talking about,

47
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:19,126
but if you have anything

48
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,067
that you want to discuss

49
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:23,207
here atunction.org

50
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:24,228
what do you have in your mind?

51
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:24,988
And then we'll come back

52
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:26,728
when we do have questions.

53
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:27,769
This is Nancy.

54
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:29,049
Hi, so thank you for your

55
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:29,529
very input.

56
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:30,710
I'd love to finally get

57
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,630
a feeling for both of you

58
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,090
about to work in

59
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,000
and I'm sure there's a lot of nice, positive comments,

60
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,662
and I think we're trying so hard to get

61
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:37,723
the replies from people,

62
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:38,604
and it's also important for us

63
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:39,105
to be the speakers now,

64
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,587
and I've got to say,

65
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,669
from people saying they have a question for you.

66
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,211
So, I'm not going to take a row

67
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,032
whilst everyone says one thing,

68
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:46,093
and then everyone says a different thing.

69
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:47,094
So, thank you all very much,

70
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:48,857
and thank you all for your time.

71
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,978
I wish everyone lots of success.

72
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:51,139
I hope you all do well,

73
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,062
and hopefully see you next shining star night,

74
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,391
for each of these.

75
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:57,633
Very soon, these sessions will continue.

76
00:02:57,673 --> 00:02:59,675
And today, also going to take into,

77
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,957
in this evening, I think going to solve

78
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:04,600
a few things that are very compelling

79
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,281
about age propaganda agency.

80
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:08,644
I also wanted to know maybe about

81
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:11,046
the governor's referral to this case.

82
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,568
The current refugees throughout the United States

83
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,931
made history on economic reform.

84
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:22,825
to everyone that has their work to ourselves.

85
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,107
We need to make a difference.

86
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:25,649
We are not a private enterprise.

87
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:27,751
I wish to have more private employees.

88
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:29,853
I want to have my own business.

89
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:32,977
Even where there are international organizations,

90
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:34,439
we are a global exchange.

91
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,581
And it's kind of a world love thing.

92
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:38,423
The whole whole degration

93
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:39,865
I mean we haven't 20 years ago.

94
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,987
I'm so glad we can start from where we've been.

95
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:46,342
Thank you.

96
00:03:54,958 --> 00:04:01,624
I was assigned in, about a year and a half ago, to lead a sectional evaluating programs

97
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,626
that were currently working for CUMM.

98
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:10,092
We also spent some time in college, working on research, and meeting things that were

99
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:11,793
about economic value.

100
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:15,337
That's where I ended up in.

101
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:19,100
D. Scarce bohemian states diversity of marriage program at London.

102
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,082
I'm a teacher in the New York Department, and I have had some opportunity and some advice.

103
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:24,023
I think that's why I'm here.

104
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,524
There are so many good things that happen.

105
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:30,987
I'm going to teach human rights, I'm going to teach human rights, and I'm going to do some work in the space of the humanities.

106
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:32,068
That's what I'm here for.

107
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:33,128
Thank you so much for coming.

108
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:33,849
Thank you, everyone.

109
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:34,329
Thank you.

110
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:34,789
Thank you.

111
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:35,149
Thank you.

112
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:35,430
Thank you.

113
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:35,750
Thank you.

114
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,090
Thank you.

115
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,390
Thank you.

116
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:36,790
Thank you.

117
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,031
And I'll be back in a minute.

118
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,331
Thank you.

119
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:38,752
Thank you.

120
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:40,032
Thank you.

121
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:40,252
Thanks.

122
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:40,573
Thank you.

123
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:40,853
Thank you.

124
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:41,133
Thanks.

125
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:41,333
Thanks.

126
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:41,553
Thanks.

127
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:41,753
Thanks.

128
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:42,073
Thanks.

129
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:42,574
Thanks.

130
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:42,794
Thanks.

131
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:42,954
Thanks.

132
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:43,274
Thanks.

133
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:43,834
Thanks.

134
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:44,155
Thanks.

135
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:44,935
Thank you.

136
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:45,335
Thanks.

137
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:45,696
Thanks.

138
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:45,876
Thanks.

139
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:46,076
Thanks.

140
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:46,216
Thanks.

141
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:46,516
Thanks.

142
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:46,876
Thanks.

143
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:47,196
Thanks.

144
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,749
And this whole grand context that I have balanced

145
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:04,791
from the current schemes of care.

146
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,072
I learned a lot from this.

147
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:06,832
I was terrified at first.

148
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:11,095
I was afraid that if it's not present in this school,

149
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:12,475
this had to be disrupted.

150
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:13,756
I was always afraid of that.

151
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:16,297
That I would not be even aware of hinten-frente

152
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:18,579
because it still didn't have a compute system.

153
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,981
It still doesn't speak to me,

154
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,922
it's not really moving in terms of

155
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:26,823
the education and the social system.

156
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:35,781
At CLI North Carolina, I am a senior research professor

157
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,322
in an on campus curriculum setting.

158
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:41,645
It's not quite the term that I developed for my department

159
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:45,048
in it's going into later.

160
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:46,969
It's not something I've done in a year,

161
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,830
but in a few years time,

162
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:52,793
have received at CLI OSPI which is too different from the class

163
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:55,435
that I've assigned to defend clarity.

164
00:05:57,404 --> 00:06:00,489
I don't know, I think I'm pretty good.

165
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,555
How about we go around and explore this, can we?

166
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:07,961
So we've all been through this.

167
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,263
But it is, it is

168
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:10,344
just

169
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,896
I hope that you take it seriously.

170
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,578
I'm sorry it's going to take you a little while.

171
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:29,221
As a strong leader of such an environment,

172
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:32,404
I would say go ahead and slip into whatever

173
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:34,225
you will and take it seriously.

174
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:37,168
But I'm going to have to end this video talking

175
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,210
to some of your colleagues, their family,

176
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,311
friends, and associates, and hopefully

177
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,532
get some experience going.

178
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:47,070
Also, I've been having a lot of talks about outsourcing material

179
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,451
that have kind of taken a buck on a bunch of different industries.

180
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:53,571
There's obviously the OEMs, so I was asked by Michelle

181
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:56,932
to bring a number of different maternal with us here today.

182
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:59,833
Also, I found things, there's a number of institutional

183
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,133
people from a subset of high school,

184
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:05,254
I think quite a few people from early childhood.

185
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:06,414
But at the...

186
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,135
in total, 10,000 hundred other indigenous teachers

187
00:07:08,215 --> 00:07:11,215
who donated, and some of the people who donated

188
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,442
And, uh, the reason for me is, uh, you know, I think, uh, the issue of race, uh, is, uh,

189
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:23,587
and, uh, and for years I've been a refugee and, uh, I've been a part of a safety net

190
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:28,610
and, uh, you know, I've helped, uh, contribute to the African-American community.

191
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,433
And I just feel like, uh, I'm a little bit of a, you know, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a

192
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:36,256
terrorist, uh, and, uh, the example that I can give you is when you're looking for a

193
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:37,556
group of people that, uh, they don't know.

194
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:40,903
again that is really not instability somewhere,

195
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,024
it's a really interesting matter that

196
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:46,245
as great as real, this was built according to climate.

197
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:49,566
We have people coming in or going out of their homes

198
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:51,087
where it's not a sanitary thing

199
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:52,887
when it's reported and they don't know.

200
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:53,828
Many people see it now,

201
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,288
but there's a real clutter of people

202
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,989
who believe in climate change

203
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,250
and believe that this is going to happen

204
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,431
and we're seeing this happen.

205
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,412
Uh, we..uh we want to encourage..uh, we want to encourage, for instance uh, anyone who

206
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:15,734
works in that field to be involved in our creative spaces and to be involved in such

207
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:18,154
synodic practices like the Woodrow Wilson School.

208
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:22,596
I think that they have a future and hopefully this probably is the drugged action that,

209
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:23,116
that they have.

210
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:27,937
Uh, so I think it's a really important..really important issue in the white plains community

211
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:33,799
Uh, so I think it's a really important..really important issue in the white plains community.

212
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:45,491
My name is John McNeely, the former ambassador to the United Nations.

213
00:08:45,511 --> 00:08:48,975
I'm here as work Ergebi of Guadaly's group.

214
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:54,580
Guadaly and I were first followed up last year when we estemed we were in a

215
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,841
secure environment.

216
00:08:55,981 --> 00:09:01,226
In the beginning I reached out to Guadalipur because it looks like Guadalipur

217
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:05,911
needs社です and then Guadalipur and I became really interested in being

218
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:06,992
in Guadalipur and Guadalipur.

219
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,366
They wanted a society that is a higher-safe environment,

220
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:18,026
better safe air conditions, better safe sights,

221
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:19,367
so they designed the DRAGONPAINT

222
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:21,247
particular design to like try to push people

223
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:23,028
towards the idea of community rather than

224
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:25,469
the design having people who want to

225
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:28,970
do community-based activities.

226
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,391
They believe that community-based design

227
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,231
needs to be another model of how individuals

228
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:34,252
can pursue this path and it's like

229
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:34,912
it's the end of the end.

230
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,233
So, I just use GRIS as a code to stop

231
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:41,414
any kind of associative behavior characteristic of us.

232
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:54,175
I'm a professor of psychology at the State University of Minnesota,

233
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:57,517
and I'm going to be asking you to write a book for us.

234
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,919
So, if you would be so kind, my name is Lucila Skelton,

235
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,600
and I'm going to be asking you to write a book for us.

236
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:09,404
Lucila, if you would be so kind, I'm going to be asking you to write a book for us.

237
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:10,505
Thank you for the opportunity.

238
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,449
in a city where children are creatures of light.

239
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:25,890
When I say that, I actually mean white people,

240
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,971
so maybe, like, Facebook and Twitter

241
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:29,872
but, you know, for our time, people are,

242
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:31,172
if these counts, then,

243
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:33,874
blue button so you know everyone else

244
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:35,695
in that town, where we're supposed to be.

245
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:36,635
The crazy thing is,

246
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:37,715
they can't even settle down.

247
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:39,156
There's no way they could,

248
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:39,936
unless you go to a webcam

249
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:40,997
or a BMPC, or a Google,

250
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:42,257
or whatever that other place.

251
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:44,358
The Macon disconnect then.

252
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:53,309
pretty out of way. It's nobody looking like me, it's me admiring scenery, it's

253
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:57,972
what I regard—I'm doomed, but I'm not doing that. Yes, in some things, I do

254
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,874
see the end points of my life, that I have come through and that I've had

255
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:04,657
opportunity, so I think I shouldn't be hiding behind these findings. I'm

256
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,338
going to say goodbye for now.

257
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:09,220
Thank you for the interview.

258
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,441
Goodbye Dean Foster.

259
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:15,684
This talk today made all the sense. It has all been great. Someone who לא

260
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:17,325
understands what is happening.

261
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:24,972
there are about 15THOUSAND DOLLARS worth of money for our instructional achievement.

262
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:26,874
Finding a job is achievable.

263
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:31,678
It is a lot easier to also provide options for students with disabilities.

264
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,380
Shout-out to Christiani Haben-Towa

265
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,260
We are all Patrons.

266
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,922
You've all done a great job.

267
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:38,184
And feel invited to join us in the future as well.

268
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:52,579
where she was able to, by opening them up,

269
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,981
like Mason was able to expand information

270
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:58,642
in a very pocket of time and space,

271
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:01,023
which I thought was quite remarkable.

272
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:05,025
That question's probably sitting in the back of my head.

273
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:07,586
The question is now, what do we do for that?

274
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:10,227
And saying, your workup is not defined,

275
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:12,848
it's defined as confirmed in common knowledge.

276
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:16,130
And so I could add some things I can think of

277
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,990
from different works.

278
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:20,348
that you can do with this even basic communication

279
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:21,450
facilitates the Hnaak.

280
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,932
With the Hnaak you learn that when there's something

281
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,654
you need to do you stop doing it,

282
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,416
so there is a useful process to do that.

283
00:12:27,556 --> 00:12:29,078
And the other thing that's very important

284
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,221
to notice is the Hnaak program

285
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:33,062
that you're now in the school.

286
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:34,523
Hopefully, some goals coming back

287
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:35,504
from the Hnaak program there,

288
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:38,007
because you really can use your Hnaak.

289
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:42,920
And I think that was one of the most helpful parts.

290
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,381
Write a big thesis about it in the lecture notes.

291
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:51,023
And then you can take it from there, and actually, just imagine the consequences of doing that.

292
00:12:51,043 --> 00:12:53,523
And I think that's a really good way to start.

293
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:54,524
Thank you.

294
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:54,884
Thank you.

295
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:55,444
Thank you.

296
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:10,478
and we're not insisting that anyone else can have it,

297
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,280
and if anyone can also cut out anything that's under our

298
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,521
housing, it's going to pretty even interest.

299
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:17,522
You can have them in a higher income couple,

300
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:18,743
it's going to, what's the word,

301
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:20,945
Cause we've gotta get the money for them

302
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:24,447
so if you can get it.

303
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:26,008
Welcome back to może's home

304
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,709
Thank you guys so much for coming.

305
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,670
This was a wonderful experience to be able to

306
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,031
bring your families together.

307
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:33,313
Seeing so many of you gravely suffering,

308
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:34,974
with our lives in perspective,

309
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:36,335
I'll see you next time.

310
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:40,385
All of these aren't us, and some are theirs.

311
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:42,065
Again, we were deliberatedly talking about

312
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:44,226
that we are in a lot of donkey businesses,

313
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:48,287
and we're so lucky to also have a lot of hundred-eared cars

314
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:49,607
that we've gained on this.

315
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,408
All these Brandsfield cars,

316
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:52,968
everybody reacts well with them,

317
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:56,929
everywhere they go they get admitted into those spaces.

318
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,309
Clearly, this is the big problem,

319
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:01,470
and this last decision for these cars

320
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,051
is to expand it.

321
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:08,475
and I said we can offer you up entrance here. 100%.

322
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,576
We see right there.

323
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,057
We see you there.

324
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:11,177
Yes.

325
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:12,638
And they're just on the front page there.

326
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:13,459
We'll ask them.

327
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:15,740
And now, we've got our new elevation model.

328
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,041
And we hope that it will cover you

329
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:18,923
if you come back in June.

330
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:21,585
It'll be the best way to get started.

331
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:22,365
It'll cover all other maps.

332
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:23,506
It does cover everything.

333
00:14:23,526 --> 00:14:25,147
It covers the three top miles just

334
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,148
on the descriptive images here.

335
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:28,089
It covers all the areas.

336
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:30,871
It covers the area, the corner of the road.

337
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:37,041
little rises and falls now they're aiming everywhere.

338
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:39,785
And it's very different, if they look at Branson

339
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:43,149
the way they do in Tampa, it's very much right around the corner.

340
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:44,210
So, I try to get them up there,

341
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,653
they have to cover more than 90% of where parking's going.

342
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:48,235
Alright, thanks a lot.

343
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:49,771
The costs here are very thick.

344
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,552
They are a city of $ uncounted in Australia and in Europe for the last 200 years.

345
00:14:53,572 --> 00:15:02,095
There are a lot of privileges between the nation's economy and the citizens of the world,

346
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,936
and the Polity Partnerships are there too.

347
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:06,076
It's a franchise working with the war evacuate community.

348
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:10,197
It's from Mr. Iggy, he's our chairman, the foundation for our society.

349
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:13,178
It's critical that our united ELF really becomes universal.

350
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:38,826
We want to give them an opportunity to become an empowering voice they need international

351
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:39,907
democratic country.

352
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:43,168
Thank you very much.

353
00:15:48,634 --> 00:16:00,685
We excel in the WScales, we excel in the alphabet, we excel in the grammar, we excel in English,

354
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:09,733
we excel in English, we excel in Math, we excel in Business, we excel in English and�도

355
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,470
And, we will have clarity to speak about as such

356
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,371
in these meetings.

357
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:18,472
And, we've also sometimes,

358
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:22,693
come engaged in breaking out in those conversations

359
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,174
and the being unheard,

360
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,194
and it can be difficult.

361
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:26,135
We regularly have meetings

362
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:27,075
where we talk to our caregivers,

363
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:28,256
taking them out to the community

364
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:31,437
that she and us of Colorado Island are making,

365
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:32,938
and I find those very encouraging.

366
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,399
I'm getting to talk to some pregnant women

367
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:37,160
at needs intervention.

368
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:44,326
I will now be back to speak on some advice about exit plans around the US.

369
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:49,731
The reason I'm back this time is because you asked a question, Jose,

370
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:54,074
on the driving in life, and there's no pan-American plan for that.

371
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:59,378
You know, it's kind of like, I'm going to try to answer that.

372
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,659
We are all strong people and that's okay.

373
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,628
Well that's definitely part of the reasons I wanted to bring you here today.

374
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:13,450
I actually, is that also why I am here today.

375
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,031
Not everybody has that kind of vision about who they want to be when they SRCC is released.

376
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:20,032
So just like you all are here today and I would love to hear more from you.

377
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:23,233
If you have other things on your mind, please do tell me.

378
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:26,694
I would love to hear all of your thoughts and ideas and theories about this process

379
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:27,914
I'm part of.

380
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:28,395
Thank you.

381
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,337
Instead of the very bad thing that the government did,

382
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:33,919
they used the inverse of glass to make them softer,

383
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:34,860
for a very small purpose,

384
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,041
they used steel to make them very physically.

385
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:40,444
And now, it is very easy for you to think

386
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:44,647
that a lot of people work at

387
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:47,169
what is pretty expensive for them,

388
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:47,950
because in the USA,

389
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,391
UN and the UN are now

390
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:52,173
the only photo department in the U.S.

391
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,755
and so that's what they do.

392
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,641
And you see all of the modern cars,

393
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:57,301
the modern tents,

394
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:59,122
the new steering systems,

395
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:00,923
and the kind of sound as well.

396
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:01,523
So to hair,

397
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:03,124
I don't do anything else really,

398
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:05,445
it's just that I enjoy all of these commerces.

399
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08,467
So I was reviewing the design ofDOA.

400
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:09,187
It was the second.

401
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:12,689
And there was two of these for girls and for men.

402
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:13,729
I loved it.

403
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:14,610
It is what it is.

404
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,811
It's something that I had been doing for ten years

405
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,272
to build on top of all that.

406
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:20,333
So it was all those kind of 옷.

407
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:22,654
It was really the absolute best thing I've done.

408
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,696
This is Pepper.

409
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:25,717
Hi, everybody.

410
00:18:26,057 --> 00:18:27,198
So I really do not use the uso.

411
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:30,841
One of my clients is Benjamin Hnight

412
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,142
and I had him down here.

413
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,283
I know that he has other schools where I could

414
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,446
help if they had needs like there is no one else here,

415
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:43,270
but he knew if he's in here and he

416
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,412
knows how to sit.

417
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:50,115
So were going to try to chat with him.

418
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:53,218
See if he knows how to say hi.

419
00:18:53,238 --> 00:18:53,398
Yes.

420
00:18:54,102 --> 00:19:04,390
Okay, a huge thank you to everyone who's participated in our research.

421
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,351
I think it's...

422
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:15,539
It's been understandable, but I also received a very people concerned

423
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,481
and, um, that was most Room 300.

424
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:20,519
What's your social income?

425
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:21,539
Say in terms of...

426
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,441
if you were to have a social income,

427
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:26,483
you were to have done some social work.

428
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:28,584
And then if you're to get a job

429
00:19:28,624 --> 00:19:30,866
their are the other four to five jobs.

430
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:32,166
So basically my job is to

431
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,028
help business people

432
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:34,948
if they have any problem,

433
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,050
you should help them,

434
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,631
especially if your job is

435
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,673
a business, if your family is it.

436
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:45,956
Okay, thank you so much.

437
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:48,017
Thank you for having me.

438
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:49,431
All right.

439
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:50,732
I'm going to start by東京 Grenier.

440
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:53,814
And if you'd like more information,

441
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:55,555
it's on the top right.

442
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,318
I also think it's important to see that there's

443
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:02,260
a dependent recession on levels of jail, asylum,

444
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,661
deferred treatment facility in the US

445
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:05,642
at these times.

446
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:08,644
Now, what they're doing in the US

447
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:11,126
is almost not unresolved in which they are

448
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:13,468
allowing some of themselves, including

449
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:14,348
the use of rancho.

450
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,236
Everything.

451
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:17,137
It's a waste of time.

452
00:20:17,197 --> 00:20:17,697
We're saving lives.

453
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:22,220
It's very beautiful to talk to you and to have you by my side

454
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,882
because you are a woman to the very very best of my friends

455
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:27,424
and you guys to the very very best.

456
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:30,746
Also, if you have questions or if you need any help

457
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:33,327
with any of my ideas, I would love to hear from you.

458
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:35,329
I'm going to try to do a few other things

459
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:36,890
that I love to share.

460
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,111
But thank you for being an economic leader

461
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:41,553
and for sharing больше and比ще FPB.

462
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:43,798
I want to highlight that, too,

463
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:48,679
which has been a acute problem in Hanoi and the region.

464
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:50,640
With, I don't know if I would have called it,

465
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,181
or I wouldn't call it a problem.

466
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,961
But they've been looking at algorithms

467
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:56,202
from the site of the ProHaja Rainforest,

468
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,263
forming 100 million macro scales

469
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:01,844
for way about a half a million people,

470
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:03,805
to come up with a set of scaling model

471
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:05,625
and determine how smoothly

472
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:08,526
they compare waterogloes in my nice little island.

473
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:10,607
There are some basic premises

474
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,292
And I hope you enjoyed that.

475
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:17,154
I'm going to say a couple of things.

476
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:20,896
I think it's a really special day today.

477
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,937
Thank you all for coming to this event.

478
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:24,618
I'm so excited to be here.

479
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:29,160
I'm really excited about all the beautiful characters and models that we've got.

480
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,121
I'm excited to see what's next.

481
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:32,542
I hope you all have a wonderful day.

482
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:40,399
and hopefully it's a good thing to try to get around and get some of the stuff that

483
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:40,639
I need.

484
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:44,521
But, yeah, I think that's all I have to say.

485
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:49,323
I hope you enjoyed the video and I hope you found it useful.

486
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:51,544
Please subscribe to the YouTube channel and the website.

487
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:53,365
I'll see you next time.

488
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:53,505
Bye.

489
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:53,585
Bye.

490
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:53,805
Bye.

491
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:53,946
Bye.

492
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:54,086
Bye.

493
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:54,166
Bye.

494
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:54,246
Bye.

495
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:54,486
Bye.

496
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:54,686
Bye.

497
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:56,067
Bye.

498
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:09,513
Well the process is really an interdisciplinary growth,

499
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:13,514
you've got the people that you need to go to to get there and

500
00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:15,315
but you also unique contexts,

501
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:19,456
you gonna create your own frame of reference because

502
00:22:19,736 --> 00:22:23,818
you get to experiment very quickly with different practices,

503
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:27,079
disciplines that you wanna work right with other people.

504
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:29,360
And that's something that we're good at and

505
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,501
we just appreciate it.

506
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:41,081
And as I fell in love, and I fell in love with Nan,

507
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:46,245
I think of Nan, I almost started to feel it in love,

508
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:50,027
after all that I have lived through.

509
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:51,789
I think of Nan almost every day,

510
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:54,231
I feel the peem of Man's love

511
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,012
this kind of happy and information,

512
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:56,813
I love you, Nan.

513
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:58,114
Thank you.

514
00:22:58,134 --> 00:22:58,234
Why?

515
00:22:58,314 --> 00:22:59,635
Because I feel that's still...

516
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:04,689
If we don't know how to inform people

517
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:06,690
about the human behavior in their system,

518
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:08,492
then that is,

519
00:23:08,712 --> 00:23:11,314
that is stuff that we need to find and inspect.

520
00:23:11,354 --> 00:23:13,336
I mean, if something is law against Xeonos,

521
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:14,557
what is that?

522
00:23:14,637 --> 00:23:15,798
Well, except Xeonos,

523
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:18,740
you know, it doesn't actually include it.

524
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,762
It's hard to be aware of how to do it.

525
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,543
So she's using a very simple model

526
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:25,345
of dynamic two-dimensional голод.

527
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:27,127
I mean, what about,

528
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:28,968
the human being who's responsible for what happens?

529
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:29,408
I don't know.

530
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:32,808
May your loneliness be realized in the rest of your life,

531
00:23:33,188 --> 00:23:38,332
and may your peace be with the Lord always.

532
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:38,452
Amen.

533
00:23:38,472 --> 00:23:38,612
Amen.

534
00:23:38,632 --> 00:23:38,812
Amen.

535
00:23:38,972 --> 00:23:39,553
Amen.

536
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:39,893
Amen.

537
00:23:39,913 --> 00:23:39,993
Amen.

538
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:40,113
Amen.

539
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:40,273
Amen.

540
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:41,034
Amen.

541
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:42,075
Amen.

542
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:42,755
Amen.

543
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:43,236
Amen.

544
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:43,996
Amen.

545
00:23:44,497 --> 00:23:44,577
Amen.

546
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:44,757
Amen.

547
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:45,177
Amen.

548
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:46,078
Amen.

549
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:46,338
Amen.

550
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:46,458
Amen.

551
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:47,819
Amen.

552
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:55,358
because we don't want to be a spotty scale,

553
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:57,219
90% or at least 80% drop out

554
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:58,940
when I have a weakness,

555
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:03,843
and then I have to take it.

556
00:24:03,863 --> 00:24:04,784
There is another area,

557
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:06,945
and this is one that I hear people tell.

558
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:08,786
That there's a 항상 problem

559
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:09,707
at parasites showing up

560
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:13,229
when you do things that are outside

561
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:13,849
the universe.

562
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:14,830
So, it's a weird disease

563
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,470
that's there.

564
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,491
The only thing that's in play

565
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:20,413
at the center is nobody cares.

566
00:24:23,905 --> 00:24:25,466
These things can be useful for a lot of reasons.

567
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:27,187
It is very interesting and they are,

568
00:24:27,227 --> 00:24:27,867
they seem to be very useful.

569
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:28,567
I mean, somebody asks,

570
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:30,188
''Well, how do you prioritize things?''

571
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,389
Then you have the potential to do the thing

572
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:32,249
right and I've done things very well.

573
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:33,690
They're all very, very, very valuable.

574
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,651
I always say, ''Well, yeah you definitely need

575
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:36,592
an American's Handbook of Science,

576
00:24:36,612 --> 00:24:36,752
right?

577
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:39,773
You really need to read it and you need to

578
00:24:39,873 --> 00:24:41,994
understand it and you need to be expert in it.

579
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:42,755
And then, you can use it.

580
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:09,434
of so young persons experiencing depression,

581
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:10,654
and as Education Central, our desire at finally,

582
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:12,155
at last, was what we wanted to see.

583
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:13,396
So, you know Professor Kauffman

584
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:14,417
in his year I just wrote a book called

585
00:25:14,457 --> 00:25:15,397
Where Is Black Education?

586
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:16,518
It's on bail now.

587
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,499
One year, I'd just finished it.

588
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,941
I sent to him and he said take this,

589
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:22,382
take it away, and I yelled at him,

590
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:25,404
I said Dr. Kauffman, you're not doing it right.

591
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:26,725
This definitely isn't just,

592
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:28,165
not just for white families.

593
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:29,506
Take it away Dr. Kauffman.

594
00:25:29,546 --> 00:25:29,867
Take it away.

595
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:39,236
I don't really have any other thoughts on the engineering community.

596
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:49,720
I think all of us have a lot of empathy for each other and for each other's decisions.

597
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,881
So that's why we actually give so much here

598
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:56,822
andeticize as an engineers to our community.

599
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:59,883
So those are the thoughts I have that I have.

600
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,400
As you can see by the senior occurs,

601
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,221
the visitors are in a kind of a queuered environment

602
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:15,821
because they're heartbroken that she saw

603
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,142
her brother dying in the ocean.

604
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:20,423
They may make some difference if they reach

605
00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:22,283
another grandfatherful country.

606
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:26,145
Unless they're like us, they won't be able to

607
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:26,805
do anything about it.

608
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:28,325
So, once you're on their mind,

609
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:29,766
they'll try their best to organize

610
00:26:30,326 --> 00:26:31,466
this kind of a situation.

611
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:32,487
So, they're learning,

612
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:35,047
they're getting ready for their first vacation

613
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:36,268
planning a vacation,

614
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:38,188
but all three of us already achieved

615
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:42,720
and not only am I saying it atopia the tiered mind by far,

616
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,582
but the way that you are able to actually

617
00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:49,464
see what happens inside and what's happening to you

618
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:54,648
is something that said to me something a long time ago.

619
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,149
And I think, with those films, I might

620
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:58,490
be able to take it in more ways and try

621
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,511
to say something on my side.

622
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:02,673
But for me, I think that it is really

623
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:03,593
going to be by the end of it

624
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:05,455
and I hope that some people will remember that,

625
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:06,675
and I'm hoping that you guys will too.

626
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:07,516
Thank you.

627
00:27:08,804 --> 00:27:11,325
that was really interesting and surprising..

628
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:15,546
I think that having IPP and format computing

629
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:19,887
has been very useful and I'm very proud of it.

630
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:20,107
Okay.

631
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:22,607
Hence the project was launched at the end of August

632
00:27:23,027 --> 00:27:26,968
and continue all year in the next few years.

633
00:27:27,048 --> 00:27:29,409
So really I'm assuming that our candidates

634
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:33,530
are presented in these courts every year?

635
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,670
Ten years, it's been around ten years, right?

636
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:36,850
Yeah.

637
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:41,115
and we can discover our things in other places

638
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:43,256
that we don't, couldn't find any.

639
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:47,798
But another tool, we have really good remote technologies

640
00:27:47,818 --> 00:27:49,999
that will help us see solar energy,

641
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:51,619
phase on the renewable energy

642
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:53,240
that we have working together

643
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,841
inside climate and sustainable energy.

644
00:27:54,861 --> 00:27:57,201
The reason is, if you look at Cleo coming

645
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,042
from Iowa State pots and pans.

646
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:02,564
In Iowa State Pots and Pans there's a lot of energy

647
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:03,644
that's being accumulated.

648
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:14,543
of discipline and to actually get involved in different areas of disciplinary work

649
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:17,464
I, which I felt I could definitely do in the city,

650
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:20,484
I felt that so I went and buckled down.

651
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:23,445
Somehow Jars of Heart gave me a break,

652
00:28:23,525 --> 00:28:27,106
I know they can hear, I know they can feel.

653
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:27,266
And...

654
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:28,346
You're absolutely right.

655
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,187
I really think a lot of people talk to me

656
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:34,327
about my life, doing my job for a living,

657
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,511
So I think that the reason that we started this program a few years ago,

658
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:42,853
that we're going to be able to continue to do what we're doing right now,

659
00:28:42,873 --> 00:28:46,195
is in the hope that we can improve the way that we interact around the world.

660
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:49,457
So it's not a great reason, but I hope that you guys do appreciate it.

661
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:53,299
And I'd like to start by saying that we need to start looking at the rest of the world

662
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:59,082
in a different way, not just in the United States, but in the United States.

663
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:04,365
And I think that we need to look at the rest of the world in a different way.

664
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:11,369
Yeah, so the reason that we've decided we're going to be a part of this is because we're

665
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:13,510
trying to work with different people in the country.

666
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,812
So we're going to be meeting up with people from different countries and different communities

667
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:18,493
in the country.

668
00:29:18,913 --> 00:29:24,356
So, it is because we have no access to our communication and we're not seeing a lot of

669
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:26,277
the time from people in the country.

670
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:30,859
So, we're just really grateful that we have, you know, so many of our speakers here.

671
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,360
It's just so important that people know that.

672
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,206
So, oh no what am I doing now.

673
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:37,207
Do you need to switch?

674
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:39,808
Oh, I'll give them if I do that.

675
00:29:39,868 --> 00:29:41,768
So, this is my device.

676
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:44,389
Oh, it's right on the pulpit.

677
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:51,392
Okay, I can do a squat and then exert a pull up.

678
00:29:51,672 --> 00:29:53,813
And if you look at the Channel 9.

679
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:54,593
It's the best thing.

680
00:30:04,043 --> 00:30:06,825
Yeah, I really spent a lot of time in the country.

681
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:11,028
I'm a Swiss-American, I grew up in the country.

682
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:12,550
I grew up in the country.

683
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,491
So I'm a Swiss-American.

684
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:15,852
So I'm a Swiss-American.

685
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:16,533
Yeah, I know.

686
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:16,893
I know.

687
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:19,015
But I've got a little bit of a long way to go.

688
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:20,916
I think that the process is not really

689
00:30:20,936 --> 00:30:23,178
just about investing in people.

690
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,559
A lot of the people I work with, I

691
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:26,901
hear a lot from people talking about how

692
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:29,483
they can go far, how they can make a successful life.

693
00:30:29,503 --> 00:30:30,984
So I mean, it's a long road.

694
00:30:36,028 --> 00:30:39,469
So, we have a very nice foundation of community-building policy,

695
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:44,030
including issues like the community of the contributors to the online campaign.

696
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,171
So, I think there is a point of like,

697
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:47,991
and definitely a robust community of people,

698
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:50,092
because you don't know where your solutions are going.

699
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:52,932
So, yeah, I think this is a very good point.

700
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,833
Thank you very much.

701
00:30:54,873 --> 00:30:55,693
Thank you.

702
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:57,393
Thank you.

703
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:58,633
Thank you.

704
00:30:58,734 --> 00:30:59,694
Thank you.

705
00:30:59,754 --> 00:30:59,974
Thank you.

706
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:01,134
Thank you.

707
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:01,534
Thank you.

708
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:02,214
Thank you.

709
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:02,814
Thank you.

710
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:03,415
Thank you.

711
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:03,835
Thank you.

712
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:15,002
And I'm sorry, I need some personal Woody.

713
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:16,584
So if I can see this again.

714
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:17,704
Thank you, Liz.

715
00:31:17,785 --> 00:31:20,627
And how much more time do you have?

716
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:21,407
You're on 40 minutes.

717
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:21,868
40 minutes left.

718
00:31:21,888 --> 00:31:22,668
OK, good.

719
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,069
Thank you.

720
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:26,932
So we're going to start talking in this second made up

721
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:27,172
video.

722
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,074
And use that audio, at least, you heard it not

723
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:32,236
다� wirelessly, without cereal.

724
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:36,239
It's hard to remember if we'm talking about cereal

725
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:36,659
or not.

726
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,301
So it's all right if you get it.

727
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:43,504
began to respect and transmit a public Jesus,

728
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:46,467
the rising sun of our lives

729
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,247
in recent years,

730
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:52,651
she has followed in her father's footsteps

731
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:56,073
the mission of reclaiming Africa.

732
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:56,634
Thank you.

733
00:31:56,654 --> 00:31:57,514
I wish you a blessed life,

734
00:31:57,534 --> 00:31:59,996
I wish you an eternal happiness

735
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:00,917
in the world you lead.

736
00:32:00,997 --> 00:32:02,178
We as the American City of States

737
00:32:02,198 --> 00:32:04,379
recognize a bounded and sincere desire

738
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,561
to bring you to your destination.

739
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:15,547
I move that there be a movie, devoted to the audience,

740
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,148
and devoted to the cast, and devoted to the movies.

741
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:19,911
This movie is studded with a lot of great stories.

742
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:23,155
And I hope it will many many millions

743
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:28,200
of theatrical life and movies.

744
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:31,483
This is my authorization.

745
00:32:31,503 --> 00:32:33,325
And this is sort of my jurisdiction.

746
00:32:33,365 --> 00:32:35,207
So championship.

747
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:52,357
nd let us know how that was and we will try to find out.

748
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,718
Thanks everyone!

749
00:33:11,437 --> 00:33:15,882
I mean, I really don't see any reason for me to stay.

750
00:33:15,922 --> 00:33:18,706
You know, I would be happy to just, you know,

751
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:21,570
I mean, I have a lot of friends, but, you know,

752
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,192
I don't have a lot of friends.

753
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:26,095
I mean, it's more important than anything else.

754
00:33:26,115 --> 00:33:26,856
So, you know, I'm not, you know,

755
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:35,070
involved, uh, viewer-to-viewer interactions, the public answers to, uh, to welcome to a conversation.

756
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:40,952
Uh, having a conversation like this can be the same approach as a conventional way of doing things,

757
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:46,673
whatever your best form of leading aggressive response or response is, um,

758
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:50,353
to the post-market narrative, you know.

759
00:33:50,393 --> 00:33:53,814
And it's not necessarily the same response as um...

760
00:33:56,315 --> 00:33:57,616
if you didn't think that.

761
00:33:57,716 --> 00:33:59,556
I think that we see a lot of debate.

762
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:02,737
So from what you say there, I think

763
00:34:02,797 --> 00:34:04,238
that the military, the military is

764
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:05,438
fighting very hard to manage the military,

765
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:06,338
to stand up against that.

766
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:08,459
Like, it's good that gives the military this opportunity

767
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:09,919
to also actually want to do better.

768
00:34:09,939 --> 00:34:13,020
So that's actually a extreme of a sort of a stumper.

769
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,561
But not only that, not only still

770
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,842
going to stabipper the Natives, that the Natives

771
00:34:17,962 --> 00:34:20,403
have in the armies, but they're doing a whole lot of damn

772
00:34:20,423 --> 00:34:21,923
deeperening the honor of one of their most

773
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:23,383
mostly conservative political parties.

774
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:32,016
and give you just a one-minute notice

775
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,336
that your project was well done.

776
00:34:33,356 --> 00:34:34,777
And if you would like to also take another week

777
00:34:34,797 --> 00:34:36,837
to see what you've seen.

778
00:34:36,897 --> 00:34:38,858
We'll give you a little bit, you can show everyone

779
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:39,398
that you've done this.

780
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:41,139
So you can reach out to one of our sponsors

781
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,200
and we'll try our best to work with them to give you

782
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,500
a little bit more of a benefit.

783
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,242
And we trulykillyour price more

784
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:06,018
and good afternoon to all of you, my name is Madelyn, I have been a musician for 15 years.

785
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:11,481
I think of myself as a bassist and a rouletteistly, I'm not saying this to offend y'all, I think

786
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:15,164
of myself as a violin, like a bass artist, at least a violin, so I sort of think of myself

787
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:19,827
as a bass artist, I know what it is to be a musician, as a violinist, but I also think

788
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:23,229
I'm a bass player, I know what it is to be a violinist.

789
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:29,053
Rachelle, you know we're not sure how to reason with stick bills, so if you are deciding

790
00:35:36,565 --> 00:35:42,227
You know, that's amazing, but also really great for our community.

791
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:47,868
This is my friend, John Bronfen, the other dean of the School of Higher Learning.

792
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:53,310
I'm incredibly proud of him, and I hope he continues to do so.

793
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,051
Their 마스� is incredibly resilient, it still protects very well.

794
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:59,392
So we know that we can use it in all kinds of situations.

795
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:00,632
It's effective to protect.

796
00:36:00,652 --> 00:36:03,392
So I think for those who are new to the technology now,

797
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,633
we have one of the most beautiful things

798
00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:05,873
that can get you inside your home.

799
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:06,633
That's right.

800
00:36:06,653 --> 00:36:08,194
So this was my practice.

801
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,234
And this is from a year ago,

802
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:12,395
and it all went to extension for me.

803
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,875
So we're happy to continue this challenge around that point.

804
00:36:21,352 --> 00:36:23,092
Thank you.

805
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:49,482
Thank you.

806
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:05,536
because I really want to spend a lot of time reading this book.

807
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,059
I'm sure there too many things behind this,

808
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:11,961
but to be right back to the thrill of a paper

809
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:13,682
series like I have been doing a lot,

810
00:37:13,742 --> 00:37:15,123
because I know all kinds of things,

811
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:19,125
but maybe this will be an exciting video for you somewhat,

812
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:20,647
just to start your own inspiration

813
00:37:20,787 --> 00:37:22,848
to actually read, especially for English speakers

814
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:27,051
or anyone who's been reading the books in sighting a five year

815
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:31,448
it's deeply important that you understand your human species,

816
00:37:31,468 --> 00:37:33,530
and understand you take a chance

817
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,212
if that's something that's healthy for you.

818
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:38,773
If that's something that's from your flag.

819
00:37:38,794 --> 00:37:41,395
But, you know, we also have a concept,

820
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:44,137
the American flag in Red Stone City,

821
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:47,100
have emails for some things

822
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,061
with people calling them their flag helpers.

823
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:51,443
So I guess that's our mission.

824
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:54,985
I guess that's all we have time about,

825
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:55,786
and thanks a lot.

826
00:37:58,028 --> 00:37:59,048
I think if some of you guys have,

827
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,289
I would génerally say approximately

828
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:02,030
40% of women with developing disabilities

829
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,270
experience had their arms crossed

830
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,511
several times during their experience,

831
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,132
they're clearly not going to be at their best

832
00:38:07,272 --> 00:38:09,133
more than a lot of other people.

833
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:10,914
The other thing I want to do right here

834
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,655
is my policy presentation

835
00:38:13,675 --> 00:38:17,417
so I'm spending a lot of time

836
00:38:17,577 --> 00:38:19,558
in просто more informal...

837
00:38:19,578 --> 00:38:21,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

838
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,982
just to snuggle in right here,

839
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:28,469
all that we have to pull out.

840
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:29,830
I would suggest that you report it

841
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,031
to the sanitization office.

842
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:34,112
And make sure that that's confidential

843
00:38:34,132 --> 00:38:36,694
so you have your researchers order your money

844
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,314
and have everything root in.

845
00:38:39,595 --> 00:38:42,036
If you don't manage to have this certificate

846
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:42,757
in a police officer,

847
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:45,318
the police will work its way through

848
00:38:45,378 --> 00:38:47,759
and get those documents REALLY FAST.

849
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:48,319
They're also likebags.

850
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:49,720
You do the math and it is very complicated

851
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,281
and stuff like that.

852
00:38:55,315 --> 00:38:55,976
inaudible

853
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:57,356
indiscernible

854
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:58,157
inaudible

855
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:02,138
indiscernible

856
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:03,859
inaudible

857
00:39:03,939 --> 00:39:06,620
indiscernible

858
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,564
And the way that they've taken advantage of that is so local.

859
00:39:23,584 --> 00:39:29,989
Because that is, certainly, something you need to have at the theater,

860
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:33,612
that high-level community-building, high-level group of people

861
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:37,275
that can only really create something open to going out and doing their jobs.

862
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:38,636
And like Robin Wright said,

863
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,519
the so-called kindergartners have always,

864
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,203
waiting to come in and do their jobs.

865
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,544
you focus more on this particular thing in particular.

866
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:58,825
The first thing is that you really hazard

867
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:01,806
a lot of money when you're doing something

868
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:04,827
and you don't want to have to put in that money

869
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:06,948
to do your own things.

870
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,709
Even when someone helps you out,

871
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:12,890
you want to do your own thing and you don't want

872
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,211
to have that kind of burden.

873
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:16,472
Powder, to say the least, powder is really important.

874
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:18,433
And especially when you do talk about

875
00:40:18,473 --> 00:40:19,233
what is a barrier.

876
00:40:19,773 --> 00:40:20,633
It takes time.

877
00:40:24,146 --> 00:40:27,269
once you leave and everything is going to be as you'd like.

878
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:30,833
So it's very important to me to make friends in these things.

879
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:30,913
Hey.

880
00:40:30,933 --> 00:40:32,034
And that's where we are.

881
00:40:32,094 --> 00:40:34,636
Thanks for coming today and talking to me about 커버.

882
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:36,118
Thank you so much for coming today.

883
00:40:36,138 --> 00:40:37,499
And thank you to everybody at MTY.

884
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:38,040
Wow, thank you.

885
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,861
And for all of you doing something like this,

886
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:42,264
connect your mind, be creative.

887
00:40:42,304 --> 00:40:46,708
And let something incredible happen to you.

888
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:47,409
Go to mty.com.

889
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:47,689
Thank you.

890
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:55,103
highlight how these messages are being uploaded to us

891
00:40:55,564 --> 00:40:57,365
generally it's when

892
00:40:57,425 --> 00:41:00,848
on victims a server notes on the computer

893
00:41:00,868 --> 00:41:02,369
about this and allows us

894
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:04,070
include it in our service

895
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,731
but directly

896
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:08,293
get on chat with the provider

897
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:09,714
and are there are good things.

898
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,236
There are good things to do and

899
00:41:11,276 --> 00:41:12,677
how are they and how are they conceived

900
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:14,878
and what they want to do with that?

901
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:16,600
Are they in the constitution?

902
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,741
Are these freedom claims necessary?

903
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:20,022
Are you making them

904
00:41:24,668 --> 00:41:27,909
and conversation with them about fights,

905
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:29,269
and how they can take today,

906
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:32,150
again, and then they will come back

907
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,510
in the next year or two.

908
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,451
So, we are trying to be as systematic

909
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:39,571
as they can on whatever they're fighting for.

910
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,892
It's very, very hard to argue

911
00:41:42,052 --> 00:41:44,112
if it's the internal, fabric, and forces

912
00:41:44,152 --> 00:41:46,253
that are coming out of interest.

913
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:48,293
Family violence, human trafficking,

914
00:41:48,413 --> 00:41:50,373
child abuse and mental health crimes

915
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:01,095
six women from high school contacted

916
00:42:01,115 --> 00:42:02,456
us about making these films,

917
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:03,897
and we started them.

918
00:42:03,937 --> 00:42:06,079
We started it with Our First Love in the Boogie Woods

919
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:07,680
and we started it with ??

920
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,203
and I wouldn't think we could forgive ourselves

921
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:12,444
until we were about 18,

922
00:42:12,484 --> 00:42:14,506
and we had some work projects,

923
00:42:14,526 --> 00:42:16,087
and we don't waste time on stations,

924
00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:16,848
we don't do our TVs,

925
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,729
we have our ﷺ candles,

926
00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:18,970
we have our faith,

927
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,031
that this is what we need.

928
00:42:21,478 --> 00:42:28,761
U.S. Air Force has attempted to intercept Taliban forces.

929
00:42:28,801 --> 00:42:30,202
So that is unpleasant.

930
00:42:30,222 --> 00:42:41,366
U.S. Air Force has attempted to intercept Taliban forces.

931
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:55,869
I don't like being skillful.

932
00:42:55,989 --> 00:43:03,034
Okay, I'm gonna try not to pronounce it wrong.

933
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,776
Ah, you know what.

934
00:43:06,896 --> 00:43:07,877
I like that.

935
00:43:07,977 --> 00:43:08,437
Okay?

936
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:09,598
Ah, okay.

937
00:43:09,658 --> 00:43:13,460
Don't mess with me.

938
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,200
I love you.

939
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,161
Okay, bye.

940
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:15,521
Oh.

941
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:15,941
All right.

942
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:17,923
Until next time.

943
00:43:17,983 --> 00:43:18,103
Bye.

944
00:43:18,323 --> 00:43:18,423
Bye.

945
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:26,154
I'm not hoping I'll be qualified,

946
00:43:26,174 --> 00:43:29,177
if only that would be something I look forward to.

947
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:30,839
You know, maybe I'm not going to get there,

948
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:33,221
but you know, I even have my degree,

949
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:35,984
but that's one I'll come back to to decide.

950
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:37,886
It might not be up to me,

951
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:40,148
or maybe it's up to the way things work,

952
00:43:40,228 --> 00:43:42,570
but all I need to do is memorize my own special things,

953
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:43,952
and then I'll probably be able to start

954
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:46,975
practicing in another field instead.

955
00:43:55,885 --> 00:43:57,726
Tuesdays, and then Wednesday evenings,

956
00:43:57,866 --> 00:43:58,587
and also on Tuesdays too,

957
00:43:58,607 --> 00:44:00,567
after podcasts on Red Bull TV and online gaming,

958
00:44:00,587 --> 00:44:02,528
we can chat about how you can do your own individual

959
00:44:02,548 --> 00:44:03,829
strategies here at Red Bull TV.

960
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:06,390
But right now, I Iike to talk to others

961
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,210
about those things that,

962
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,191
a friend of mine,

963
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:08,991
from the Arduino,

964
00:44:09,011 --> 00:44:09,972
his friends and maybe his best friends,

965
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:14,073
maybe, who'll be the next Kaiamente.

966
00:44:14,374 --> 00:44:17,255
Today you're going to meet some business men here

967
00:44:17,815 --> 00:44:18,295
from Las Vegas,

968
00:44:18,976 --> 00:44:20,336
the graduate of the Association of

969
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:22,337
Software Engineering Associations here at Red Bull SV.

970
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:32,132
So any way that will nest, right now, I'm running a lot of clinical testing here both in Burmar, Western Mission area, I am in L.A. State, in Philadelphia.

971
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:38,814
And here in West Virginia we are running. I live in a space where there are about about 10,000 homeless people.

972
00:44:38,854 --> 00:44:42,495
So what I'm doing here is I'm taking a plan of action.

973
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:51,799
And so first I'm training people to move to a safe and safe space.

974
00:44:52,895 --> 00:45:02,182
And then from there, we'd like to move on to website,

975
00:45:02,222 --> 00:45:04,623
and, you know, we'll give you a little more detail

976
00:45:04,723 --> 00:45:04,963
about today.

977
00:45:04,983 --> 00:45:05,924
So, as you can see, we are here.

978
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:06,785
And so, we've come to an end,

979
00:45:06,885 --> 00:45:09,526
and we've come in the form that stems from a feeling

980
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,688
of the same difficulty that we've encountered

981
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:14,329
over the years after we launched,

982
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:15,790
which is that we ourselves weren't able to work

983
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:19,313
out a way that we were really going to enjoy them.

984
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,313
And therefore, we graduated COVID.

985
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:26,411
And, uh, the third experiment so that is, um, talking to a really interesting teacher

986
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:28,752
online who is my son's engineer.

987
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:34,396
So I want to give you a littleienteer, whoever you are and who is everybody at my, uh, institution

988
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:39,559
that is here, to actually talk about a whole bunch of things that we're doing.

989
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:49,232
So I think that's reception in the US basically.

990
00:45:49,252 --> 00:45:50,212
That's probably Canada.

991
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,693
You know Transportation Workers' Day

992
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:53,714
where people just smile,

993
00:45:53,814 --> 00:45:55,154
because I don't know,

994
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:57,936
you know, that's in Canada.

995
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:59,196
Once you have that

996
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,477
you're actually going to want to go.

997
00:46:02,517 --> 00:46:04,078
Do you know that am I right?

998
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:04,998
I certainly do.

999
00:46:05,038 --> 00:46:05,078
So,

1000
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:05,439
fourth ocean,

1001
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:05,659
or second,

1002
00:46:05,779 --> 00:46:06,199
kingdom.

1003
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:06,979
I love the second one

1004
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:08,300
the West Sea,

1005
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:08,820
right, right,

1006
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,860
Columbia.

1007
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,601
Those are the most

1008
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,581
where I sing the Turtle

1009
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:14,622
sing when you get ready.

1010
00:46:14,702 --> 00:46:14,982
I think that

1011
00:46:15,363 --> 00:46:15,863
once you've done

1012
00:46:16,795 --> 00:46:20,720
and I'm going to put the link down below.

1013
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,202
And I'm going to say thanks.

1014
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:24,485
Thank you so much for listening to my talk.

1015
00:46:24,746 --> 00:46:26,068
I hope you have a great weekend.

1016
00:46:26,128 --> 00:46:27,870
See you very much next week.

1017
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:29,072
Bye, bye.

1018
00:46:29,132 --> 00:46:30,013
Bye, bye.

1019
00:46:30,173 --> 00:46:30,394
Bye, bye.

1020
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:30,614
Bye, bye.

1021
00:46:30,634 --> 00:46:30,834
Bye, bye.

1022
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:31,014
Bye, bye.

1023
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:31,235
Bye, bye.

1024
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,441
Things like that.

1025
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:43,502
What else?

1026
00:46:43,522 --> 00:46:43,842
Fossils.

1027
00:46:43,882 --> 00:46:46,123
Fossils since I didn't realise they exist.

1028
00:46:46,143 --> 00:46:49,005
I actually know they do and I got into a Arab society.

1029
00:46:49,025 --> 00:46:53,988
I spent 30 years with Islam, I spent some years with Islam and so on.

1030
00:46:54,048 --> 00:46:57,170
Years of Islam since I didn't realise I had to go from them.

1031
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,611
So that seems pretty high-key.

1032
00:46:58,671 --> 00:46:59,051
So thank you.

1033
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:18,374
I'm going to show you how to do those interstitial steps.

1034
00:47:18,394 --> 00:47:22,398
So I'm just going to start in the middle.

1035
00:47:22,538 --> 00:47:26,261
So I'm going to do a right hand up and a left hand down.

1036
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:27,522
So I'm going to do that.

1037
00:47:28,123 --> 00:47:28,884
And that's great.

1038
00:47:28,904 --> 00:47:32,707
So I'm going to do a right hand up and a left hand down.

1039
00:47:34,407 --> 00:47:39,871
Soites like my channel, Sha Le and Nev-lease I guess in a way,

1040
00:47:40,071 --> 00:47:43,733
these are the best sources for in-development.

1041
00:47:43,953 --> 00:47:48,996
You know, these are so great for us,

1042
00:47:50,097 --> 00:47:54,519
and that is one of the reasons why we were really

1043
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:55,800
instrumental in that.

1044
00:47:57,401 --> 00:48:01,204
So I'm happy to play my songs today,

1045
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:09,199
So, it could be worse.

1046
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,022
And, you know, if you're a person of color,

1047
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:13,723
you might feel a little bit of a sense of belonging.

1048
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:15,785
But, if you're like me, you're really amazing.

1049
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:18,187
And, if you're like me, you're really kind of a good person.

1050
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:21,029
I just want to say a few things.

1051
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:28,135
I'm going to talk about this a lot in the future.

1052
00:48:28,195 --> 00:48:31,598
But, I just wanted to let you know that I'm so glad you're here.

1053
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:38,072
So my experience as a kindergarten teacher

1054
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:41,593
was in relationship with a lot of people

1055
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:44,754
and some of my friends and my parents

1056
00:48:44,954 --> 00:48:48,735
did not really understand what he was doing.

1057
00:48:48,775 --> 00:48:50,596
My family thanks to the Master's Degree

1058
00:48:50,956 --> 00:48:53,396
I was able to survive over there and,

1059
00:48:54,356 --> 00:48:57,297
you know, so I feel very profound,

1060
00:48:57,817 --> 00:49:04,459
because to my reason of which many of the

1061
00:49:07,918 --> 00:49:10,419
subtype two is right, so if these are all changing and maybe

1062
00:49:10,439 --> 00:49:12,240
these two are the first team we marked earlier,

1063
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,300
they're the first team that we come out

1064
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,641
of our first testuntion date and that's what they described.

1065
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:22,244
They're in second and third.

1066
00:49:22,264 --> 00:49:24,445
Okay, so thank you, Jason and I for your discussion.

1067
00:49:24,465 --> 00:49:29,168
Again, I'm just going to get to it,

1068
00:49:29,228 --> 00:49:30,408
have a great rest of the evening.

1069
00:49:30,508 --> 00:49:33,550
Hope you got to choose what it is

1070
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,150
that you are most productive at.

1071
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:44,769
Fromatisfaction you have to keep calm and sit and reflect.

1072
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:47,171
And a lot of people are all over the world.

1073
00:49:47,211 --> 00:49:50,433
They get out into town and they say,

1074
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:52,315
this is your best friend.

1075
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:58,520
They are going to be in the crucial conversation

1076
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,120
that they are in.

1077
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,901
My favorite cause and effect, Guerra,

1078
00:50:00,921 --> 00:50:01,762
it was the decade of what I do.

1079
00:50:03,056 --> 00:50:07,860
Then there is the ability to monitor, to survey, etc.

1080
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:13,185
And of course there are these things that come up.

1081
00:50:13,225 --> 00:50:14,306
Like, for example, age, people.

1082
00:50:14,446 --> 00:50:16,788
You know they said you know,

1083
00:50:17,088 --> 00:50:18,529
you know they have, I don't really know,

1084
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:21,332
you know if they are 18 years old or younger than 16,

1085
00:50:22,233 --> 00:50:24,354
and that has happened,

1086
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:27,978
because of NASA's design.

1087
00:50:28,398 --> 00:50:29,619
They are very strong to do that.

1088
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:30,120
They follow.

1089
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,570
It was amazing.

1090
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:39,691
But, in the end, what's really interesting is that

1091
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:43,672
the fact that I was going to sign on

1092
00:50:43,712 --> 00:50:44,612
was actually a good thing.

1093
00:50:44,652 --> 00:50:46,693
I was actually going to sign on.

1094
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:49,353
And I had a lot of beautiful pieces

1095
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,874
that I had already signed on,

1096
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,494
and I was like, this is amazing.

1097
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:54,355
And, the guys, they signed on,

1098
00:50:54,395 --> 00:50:57,535
so I was like, I'm going to sign on.

1099
00:51:03,056 --> 00:51:10,261
I know that whether a student has access to any of these tools will depend on the graduate student's privacy,

1100
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:12,743
so I'm willing to use them.

1101
00:51:12,843 --> 00:51:17,686
I've also learned that there're really non-professional forms of healthcare for doctors.

1102
00:51:18,587 --> 00:51:24,811
As part of my research, I'm able to use some of these guidance and guidance for this personal transformation.

1103
00:51:25,312 --> 00:51:30,595
I have also worked very closely with the university's medical award operations group,

1104
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:33,579
So I think that's a great way to go.

1105
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:36,500
So I've done an experiment where I'm using

1106
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,122
two hundred and thirty five years old

1107
00:51:39,142 --> 00:51:40,482
and we've got one week of winter

1108
00:51:40,522 --> 00:51:41,383
and one week of summer.

1109
00:51:41,403 --> 00:51:43,084
And so I've had six years of that process

1110
00:51:43,104 --> 00:51:44,304
and I've been able to work with

1111
00:51:44,924 --> 00:51:46,605
six hundred and eighty five.

1112
00:51:46,745 --> 00:51:49,026
And I've been able to work with

1113
00:51:50,693 --> 00:51:53,574
so I've been doing it for a long time and this is

1114
00:51:53,594 --> 00:51:55,855
something I can always do every week,

1115
00:51:56,135 --> 00:51:57,715
I want to do something nice,

1116
00:51:57,735 --> 00:52:00,416
I have now developed an experimental code

1117
00:52:00,436 --> 00:52:02,897
that I'm learning, it's a fairytale code

1118
00:52:03,057 --> 00:52:05,298
that I'll be playing on stages,

1119
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:08,219
for about three more days

1120
00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:10,840
and then I might actually post a monthly video

1121
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,360
of it as well.

1122
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,701
And so, I'll try to keep up

1123
00:52:13,901 --> 00:52:15,962
with that work every week.

1124
00:52:17,932 --> 00:52:22,254
So, for me it is really about thinking about the relationship in Yup'ik with other countries.

1125
00:52:22,454 --> 00:52:27,316
And it was very nice to consider music as part

1126
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:28,417
of my musical career,

1127
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:34,740
which also that would lead me to become Creative Actor,

1128
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,102
and one feeling that my career attracted me to East-West India,

1129
00:52:38,142 --> 00:52:40,363
in the government award for my film.

1130
00:52:40,383 --> 00:52:40,883
So, Tony's sticky peak

1131
00:52:40,943 --> 00:52:41,923
and I did film there,

1132
00:52:42,804 --> 00:52:46,266
how can I talk about the sticky peak

1133
00:52:46,506 --> 00:52:46,846
in the film,

1134
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:58,752
university of minnesota webster 2011

1135
00:52:58,932 --> 00:52:59,632
in the

1136
00:52:59,773 --> 00:53:00,553
senate

1137
00:53:00,633 --> 00:53:01,694
Thomas

1138
00:53:01,714 --> 00:53:02,334
Sen

1139
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,953
and I'm glad I got to share this with you.

1140
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:19,235
I hope you guys enjoyed that.

1141
00:53:19,255 --> 00:53:20,516
I'm really not saying anything.

1142
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:25,342
I'm just letting you know that I'm not in a relationship.

1143
00:53:25,442 --> 00:53:27,624
I'm really glad I'm coming out to this side.

1144
00:53:27,764 --> 00:53:29,546
I've seen a lot of videos of people saying things like,

1145
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,488
I'm not in a relationship with you.

1146
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,130
I'm not in a relationship with you.

1147
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,131
I'm so glad I got to say something.

1148
00:53:34,151 --> 00:53:36,213
I'm so glad to say that I'm in a relationship with you.

1149
00:53:36,233 --> 00:53:36,974
I'm really glad.

1150
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,425
but with these experiences and others here,

1151
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,226
it's a great motivation,

1152
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:47,626
so please commit to it.

1153
00:53:47,646 --> 00:53:50,727

But, um, um that are cross-border,

1173
00:54:17,913 --> 00:54:19,313
as well as, you know,

1174
00:54:19,773 --> 00:54:21,774
some Whois-Ines

1175
00:54:21,874 --> 00:54:22,734
or whatever your name is.

1176
00:54:22,754 --> 00:54:23,974
I'm interested in that as well.

1177
00:54:24,114 --> 00:54:26,415
It definitely worries me,

1178
00:54:27,155 --> 00:54:29,976
because it worries me too

1179
00:54:30,056 --> 00:54:31,676
and I have to talk to my family.

1180
00:54:31,856 --> 00:54:33,396
I live in the CCMK.

1181
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:37,017
There's a family who's died.

1182
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:38,618
Um, I don't, um,

1183
00:54:38,738 --> 00:54:40,178
I don't, um,

1184
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:44,977
So, we've done a lot in the last year or so.

1185
00:54:45,457 --> 00:54:47,018
I hope you've enjoyed it.

1186
00:54:47,278 --> 00:54:47,759
It's been a long day.

1187
00:54:47,779 --> 00:54:49,460
I hope you've enjoyed being here.

1188
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,103
It's been a satisfying and rewarding time.

1189
00:54:54,723 --> 00:54:56,064
I hope you've had a good time.

1190
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,485
I hope you've enjoyed this lesson.

1191
00:54:58,585 --> 00:55:03,889
We also have a lot of good stories to share with you.

1192
00:55:03,949 --> 00:55:05,450
I hope you've learned a lot today.

1193
00:55:05,784 --> 00:55:11,873
It is my honor to be a part of this presentation for

1194
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:16,260
977 for the Communist Party of the United States of America.

1195
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,525
Thank you very much for tuning in.

1196
00:55:19,585 --> 00:55:20,847
We are ready.

1197
00:55:21,408 --> 00:55:27,049
since now we have a new company and we've moved into digital models for many, many

1198
00:55:27,129 --> 00:55:34,831
different perspectives. We have done some different things. We had Canvas in 2009

1199
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:39,452
with Joelis. Before Joelis, it was a digital-age project. It was very popular with

1200
00:55:39,752 --> 00:55:45,933
people with suburban living needs. On a larger scale, it's started as a project

1201
00:55:46,373 --> 00:55:49,214
that's the last thing that's left behind.

1202
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:55,631
of science, 1939 and then to 19ulpture after that.

1203
00:55:55,811 --> 00:56:00,194
We win the contest, then I was at Hull University,

1204
00:56:00,214 --> 00:56:01,295
was at Princeton.

1205
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,777
They went outside and they brought out

1206
00:56:04,137 --> 00:56:08,661
a GPS I didn't see, I was looking under Communications

1207
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:10,322
and they brought this in for me.

1208
00:56:10,442 --> 00:56:13,625
I was really kind of bogged down

1209
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:17,888
by the Field of Science and Computer Science.

1210
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:19,049
And they give you a full package

1211
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:20,950
and you can work out whatjekt is.

1212
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:22,451
When you just kind of take it in.

1213
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:33,380
has led to Hanoi getting worse by less than 2%

1214
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,920
to a further 1,000%.

1215
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,261
And you can see it grocery statistics

1216
00:56:37,341 --> 00:56:38,761
present its 2%.

1217
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:45,324
So it's cap in New York for this zigzaging along.

1218
00:56:45,544 --> 00:56:49,065
And I think a lot of people know about it.

1219
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,746
And I would just like to point it out

1220
00:56:51,786 --> 00:56:53,327
that I aesthetically say it's actually

1221
00:56:53,407 --> 00:56:55,788
a psychological thing, because people

1222
00:56:56,128 --> 00:56:59,589
don't really look down on it.

1223
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:08,010
So, when it comes to when it comes to the

1224
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:11,112
producer, it's very successful.

1225
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:44,472
If I haven't worked with a Cuban immigrant, I have not met a Cuban immigrant at all.

1226
00:57:44,692 --> 00:57:50,774
That is why I still sit on the microphone when I talk about issues.

1227
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:57,397
I really want to work with some more of your views.

1228
00:57:57,797 --> 00:57:59,697
Thank you for talking to us today.

1229
00:57:59,797 --> 00:58:00,998
Is that so?

1230
00:58:01,038 --> 00:58:02,458
Thank you for having me.

1231
00:58:11,463 --> 00:58:17,407
I think that's it for that.

1232
00:58:17,668 --> 00:58:18,208
Anything you want?

1233
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,629
All right, thanks so much for listening.

1234
00:58:19,649 --> 00:58:21,271
I know it might be difficult sometimes

1235
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:22,572
hearing what I am saying in voice

1236
00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:26,415
and it's the same for me who's not going to the stage,

1237
00:58:26,435 --> 00:58:28,256
but a lot of questions that you sent me

1238
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,378
on the facebook group called

1239
00:58:30,398 --> 00:58:33,780
Can you talk about your인미래What you feel about the British south?

1240
00:58:34,201 --> 00:58:35,382
With this topic on the issue,

1241
00:58:35,422 --> 00:58:36,743
and thank you.

1242
00:58:40,321 --> 00:58:43,083
and need ideas, and everyone needs to give a reason.

1243
00:58:43,123 --> 00:58:44,704
So we've got two questions.

1244
00:58:44,744 --> 00:58:47,767
We'll also move right into the restructuring bills,

1245
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:50,348
maybe one specific piece for that.

1246
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:54,512
And hopefully you'll have an answer

1247
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:55,632
in your second question.

1248
00:58:55,652 --> 00:58:56,473
The third question.

1249
00:58:56,573 --> 00:58:59,996
Will the Empire be recognized or demonized

1250
00:59:00,056 --> 00:59:01,597
in the Civil War?

1251
00:59:01,617 --> 00:59:02,337
And two for Mr.Cranmer,

1252
00:59:02,437 --> 00:59:03,518
some of the questions we received

1253
00:59:03,718 --> 00:59:05,560
and the general members of the board

1254
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,041
concern if they plan to get discounts.

1255
00:59:12,483 --> 00:59:20,607
I was very happy to be a part of this, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to

1256
00:59:21,407 --> 00:59:22,088
be here.

1257
00:59:22,148 --> 00:59:22,688
Thank you.

1258
00:59:22,728 --> 00:59:24,009
Thank you.

1259
00:59:24,129 --> 00:59:25,649
Thank you.

1260
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:26,650
Thank you.

1261
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,071
Thank you.

1262
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:29,751
Thank you.

1263
00:59:30,552 --> 00:59:31,632
Thank you.

1264
00:59:31,993 --> 00:59:32,593
Thank you.

1265
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:43,745
And also, it's an expensive�를 at first glance,

1266
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:44,345
it's about $25.

1267
00:59:44,385 --> 00:59:46,206
If you are going to use it for basics,

1268
00:59:46,226 --> 00:59:47,587
it's going to be about $40.

1269
00:59:47,987 --> 00:59:51,409
Some people are going to spend more time

1270
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,050
reconciling the value.

1271
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:54,771
You can should everything,

1272
00:59:54,871 --> 00:59:55,652
and look at Mac,

1273
00:59:55,752 --> 00:59:58,093
because it has some nice emojis on it

1274
00:59:58,113 --> 00:59:58,793
for those reasons.

1275
00:59:58,813 --> 01:00:01,075
You're not going to have it.

1276
01:00:01,095 --> 01:00:02,675
But I do think there are some

1277
01:00:02,736 --> 01:00:05,037
people that are playing around with these things

1278
01:00:05,117 --> 01:00:07,218
because they are not used to using a keyboard

1279
01:00:07,418 --> 01:00:08,919
And i am not sure if it's allowed to.

1280
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:09,839
It's something...
