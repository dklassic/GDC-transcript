1
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:14,606
Deadly Premonition is best described as a sanity-be-damned romp into the mind of one

2
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:17,487
of Japan's most unrestrained video game creators.

3
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:21,209
Pure, unadulterated entertainment.

4
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:25,732
It's a good thing they took a research trip to the Pacific Northwest.

5
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:28,073
I think they really captured some idiomatic sense of being in America.

6
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:32,515
If you can explain what's happening in Deadly Premonition, you haven't been paying attention

7
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:32,775
enough.

8
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:36,317
It's the product of a sick and twisted individual.

9
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:37,882
Kind of scary.

10
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:41,025
Sometimes unintentionally so.

11
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:46,389
I really like that his raincoat automatically comes on when it's raining.

12
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:49,652
He's paying $99 for a turkey sandwich.

13
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:51,433
Oh, the controls.

14
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:53,955
The controls are pretty bad.

15
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:57,178
Dreamcast quality graphics.

16
00:00:57,178 --> 00:01:01,802
It may not be the most technically proficient game I've ever played,

17
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:04,704
but it's the most unforgettable.

18
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:12,697
It has a lot of technical polish in areas you might not expect, like in rendering sweaty fat man saliva.

19
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:21,163
There's this girl in Deadly Premonition, this female monster, and she will, like, stick her hand down your throat when she tries to attack you.

20
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:22,764
I don't know, that's awesome.

21
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:25,626
Wargames seem to say, you know what? Fuck it.

22
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:31,764
It's the best open world third person survival horror action adventure game I've ever played.

23
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:39,195
You can kind of walk around town and like peek in windows and just watch people doing their everyday life activities.

24
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:41,338
That's really creepy and that's awesome.

25
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:55,631
This is a game from a very creative visionary director from Japan.

26
00:01:55,631 --> 00:02:00,114
I'm honestly super excited to see what he does next.

27
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:08,658
He brews his creations from a funky, fishy flavor, and it percolates straight from his heart.

28
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:10,259
Game design in the coffee.

29
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,560
Game design in the coffee.

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,241
Game design in the coffee.

31
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,162
Game design in the coffee.

32
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:17,923
Game design in the coffee.

33
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:51,520
game design in the coffee. Okay, start. Uh, good evening everyone, my name is Shua Li from Access Games. Uh, I am the director of Deadly Premonition. Uh, I'm honored to able to speak with you today. Uh, and I'd like to express my

34
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:57,733
gratitude to those who made today possible. Thank you. And

35
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:04,615
to those who took part in the video, thank you guys too. Uh,

36
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:09,517
with me here is Tad Horie, uh, from Catalyst Lab. Hi, Tad.

37
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:13,418
Hi, sorry. Uh, my name is Tadayuki Horie. I'm from

38
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:16,479
Catalyst Lab. Please call me Tad. That's what everybody calls

39
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:16,579
me.

40
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:18,994
I'm an international project manager.

41
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:20,996
I translated the script for this game.

42
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:24,498
I also helped out with some of the voice recordings.

43
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:26,620
Swery asked me to translate this session

44
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,442
and help with some MC work today.

45
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,564
So we're so glad to see so many of you lovely people

46
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:33,085
here tonight.

47
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:35,807
We certainly hope you all enjoy the show.

48
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:40,190
And so I'm reading off my script.

49
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,271
Yeah, so no matter who you are and what

50
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:43,392
you do to live, drive, and survive,

51
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:45,033
there's still some things that make us all the same.

52
00:03:45,980 --> 00:04:09,092
We have to put away our video cameras. We have to turn off the cell phones and turn in these little thingies at the end of the show.

53
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:11,593
Can I speak Japanese?

54
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:12,513
Okay.

55
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:19,962
Point 1, how to make a game that you suddenly remember when you're not playing it.

56
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:26,047
Point 2, how to make the scenario that you've worked hard on play.

57
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:29,209
Point 3, how to build a scenario that's unique to Openfield.

58
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:34,454
Point 4, how to prevent the game from being interrupted on the result screen.

59
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:37,997
Point 5, how to make a charming character.

60
00:04:37,997 --> 00:04:43,341
Point 6, what I'm worried about when recording voice.

61
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:45,383
Point 7, what is the most important thing?

62
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:53,454
So today we'll be talking a little bit about what Sori-san has learned through the process of making video games,

63
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:58,837
specifically about some tips regarding storyline creation and game design.

64
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:04,540
We'll be going over these seven points that are on the screen.

65
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:13,044
I will not be reading them all to you the way Sori did for his Japanese audience here.

66
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:14,445
Let's keep going. お願いします。

67
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:15,065
あなたのシナリオが死んでるかもしれないポイント1、デッドリーポイントですけども、

68
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:15,265
遊んでいないときに思い出さないゲームは死んでいる。

69
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:27,825
We want to talk a little bit on the first point, we want to synchronize the player with

70
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:30,627
the character on screen.

71
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:50,010
the players outside of the TV set, the characters inside the TV screen,

72
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:55,693
what we as game designers want to do is

73
00:05:55,693 --> 00:06:02,998
try to fade that barrier, make that kind of disappear as much as we can.

74
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,365
So gamers who smoke have said this a lot.

75
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,026
When York lights up a cigarette, it

76
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:12,887
makes the player want to light up a cigarette, too.

77
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:15,628
There is a cause and effect going on.

78
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:18,529
Having as many of these scenes in the game

79
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,190
that causes an effect to the player is a good thing.

80
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,490
Go ahead, next.

81
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,470
In addition to cigarettes,

82
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,452
people may also get sleepy, or hungry,

83
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,332
or grow out a beard,

84
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:27,872
or smell bad,

85
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:30,053
or have cigarette smoke.

86
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,954
When we add these elements,

87
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:38,950
And in the same fashion, Deadly Premonition has sleeping, hunger, and shaving, and wanting

88
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,811
to stay clean so that you don't have those flies flying around you.

89
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:46,492
These things seem totally unnecessary at first glance.

90
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:58,574
They help with the cause and effect because they act as reminders to the player.

91
00:06:58,574 --> 00:06:59,374
It's not about...

92
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:01,175
It's not about...

93
00:07:01,347 --> 00:07:06,369
Seeing the character on the screen go to sleep and then thinking that I should do the same. It's more about

94
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:10,171
Having what goes on the TV screen acting as a reminder to the player

95
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:14,113
Oh look at what time it is. I better get some sleep or maybe I should get something to eat

96
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:16,514
I haven't eaten yet these reminders in life

97
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:22,197
They're interesting to actually go into a part of your special part of your brain that kind of remembers them

98
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:26,679
And so the next time you actually shave or go to bed or eat something you have that memory

99
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,320
linked with deadly premonitions

100
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:32,898
In Deadly Premonition, we incorporated these kinds of physiological phenomena

101
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:37,422
to make the game so that the user can remember how to play the game

102
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:39,303
when he or she is not playing the game.

103
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:45,068
I thought that these physiological phenomena were the most effective,

104
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:47,730
so I incorporated them.

105
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:54,015
In particular, by incorporating coffee fortune-telling and movie sequences,

106
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,657
I tried to play more experimentally.

107
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:02,651
After drinking coffee, people who do coffee fortune-telling have a habit of peeking into the coffee.

108
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:06,853
I think that the movie sequence, where Yorke says,

109
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:12,155
this movie is recommended, and by talking about it in the game,

110
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:14,155
people who watch the movie later, or buy the DVD,

111
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:15,756
or increase the number of people who watch it, had an influence.

112
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:21,138
Soeri likes to put in daily human needs, physiological deep desires into his games

113
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:25,240
because they help causing an effect to the player who is sitting, again, outside of the TV screen.

114
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:29,066
And for that premonition, we took another step forward,

115
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:31,887
and we put in some what we call playful elements,

116
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,727
like fortune-telling coffee and conversations

117
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:35,888
about old movies.

118
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:38,288
People have come to us and said that they've

119
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:41,089
taken deep looks into their mugs of coffee

120
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,530
for signs from heaven.

121
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,970
And they've also told us that they've

122
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,751
rented one of the movies that Jörg talks about in one

123
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,312
of the driving sessions in the car.

124
00:08:51,358 --> 00:09:18,629
These fun little elements helped us make players actually remember the game, regardless of whether it occurred days or months after they finished the game, simply having a cup of coffee or seeing an old movie would trigger these memories linked to Deadly Premonition.

125
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:33,732
These things like the movies or little coffee segments, they linger in your mind.

126
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:44,659
So it helps with the lingering effect of the game after you finish the game.

127
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:58,837
So the next point here is about being forced to play through a storyline that has tightly

128
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:00,918
set rails.

129
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:12,727
Those kind of rails basically make the player feel like he's being forced to do something.

130
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:14,948
So how do we alleviate that?

131
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:33,362
People ask a lot of times, how do you make players actually want to play through this

132
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:35,143
one path storyline?

133
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:57,195
So here are two commonly known methods that would help, multiple endings and side quests.

134
00:10:57,195 --> 00:11:07,341
They both add some branches inside the story that help with creating some kind of player

135
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:08,522
sense of freedom.

136
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:17,311
And Deadly Premonition, we chose a third method.

137
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:24,052
It was experimental, and we called it the freedom of timing.

138
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:35,135
Freedom of timing basically means allowing for a change of heart, creating the illusion

139
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:36,315
of freedom.

140
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:40,055
It's a game flow.

141
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:41,416
First, the quest starts.

142
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,876
Then, what's written?

143
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:43,396
Challenge?

144
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:46,818
Then, there's a challenge.

145
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:48,859
After that, there's a judge.

146
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:51,460
This is the judgment.

147
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,561
It's only whether you succeed or fail.

148
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:57,302
For example, if you fail,

149
00:11:57,302 --> 00:12:01,064
you get a hint and go back to the start.

150
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:03,725
If you succeed, the quest ends.

151
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:04,645
Can I do that?

152
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:04,945
Yes.

153
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:10,933
Next, I'd like to talk about how this is different in the case of D.P.

154
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:15,515
After the quest starts, there is a split at the timing of the challenge.

155
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:20,278
Here, not only do you proceed with the quest and proceed to the judgment,

156
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:25,341
but when the player is determined and wants to quit in the middle,

157
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:27,642
you can quit and return to free play.

158
00:12:27,642 --> 00:12:30,083
We have prepared such a split.

159
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,144
When you play the game, sometimes...

160
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,702
and I often end up in a situation where I have to fail to quit.

161
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:43,863
But that's not the case.

162
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,085
I want to do something else while I'm quitting,

163
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:48,685
and that's one of the options.

164
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,006
I made that choice again,

165
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:53,988
and that's what makes me different from other professionals.

166
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,888
So while moving forward in a quest,

167
00:12:57,888 --> 00:13:00,610
there are times when you want to change your mind as a player

168
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,192
and not follow that quest.

169
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:04,614
And however, most games, when you do that,

170
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:06,055
it just equals a failure.

171
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:07,216
You failed on that quest.

172
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:09,097
That's the standard game flow.

173
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:10,959
But for Deadly Premonition, we thought

174
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,481
that should be allowed as a player's decision.

175
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:16,143
And so we spent some time making an extra branch

176
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:18,385
so that the player can have that as an option.

177
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:21,167
This allowed players to feel better

178
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,728
about taking a break from the game,

179
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:25,871
and this allowance of a change of heart, if you will.

180
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:43,517
makes the player feel more comfortable, and once they are comfortable, they are more willing to cooperate with the story.

181
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:55,604
There are times when you just want to do something else in the game, but if that causes a failure, you feel so constricted.

182
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,023
But D.P. wanted to change that.

183
00:13:58,023 --> 00:14:01,406
When the game failed or stopped midway,

184
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:04,108
the game's operator would say,

185
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:05,770
Oh, that's great. I thought so too.

186
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,992
So we made it so that the player would agree.

187
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:12,556
And the player would think that the choice was okay,

188
00:14:12,556 --> 00:14:15,118
and they would feel at ease,

189
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:18,601
and they would think, I can play freely.

190
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,182
I think that's an important mechanism.

191
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:25,395
So in the flow of the last slide,

192
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:27,636
if the player fails to move forward, he fails.

193
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:29,517
And so he's given a hint, and he has

194
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:30,918
scolded at the same time.

195
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:34,119
It was like that in Spy Fiction on the left here,

196
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:38,001
another game that Suerison made a while back.

197
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:40,142
Your player's partner, Nicholas, would say something

198
00:14:40,142 --> 00:14:41,142
like, what are you doing?

199
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:42,823
Mission failed.

200
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:46,024
However, on the right side, what we did on Deadly Premonition,

201
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:47,845
we wanted York to go along with the player when

202
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,126
the player changed his mind.

203
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:52,585
That's exactly what I was thinking, that kind of thinking here.

204
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:55,487
And when the player hears that kind of friendly response,

205
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:00,149
it causes the player to feel okay, a little bit more comfortable, more in control,

206
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,770
and hence this sense of freedom.

207
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,731
And there's another trick in DP.

208
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:09,574
In a story, you don't have to rush the important characters.

209
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,956
What's important is timing.

210
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:16,678
You have to play at your own timing.

211
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:23,902
And in Deadly Premonition, we even took another step.

212
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:30,206
We made an important character say that you have no need to rush.

213
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:36,149
You can take your time, you can do things at the time that you want to do them.

214
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,512
Modifying the story to confirm that this is okay to change your mind allows for the player's

215
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:41,953
desires to be fulfilled.

216
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:50,897
Third, I will give you a recap of the freedom of choice.

217
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:57,362
First, you can provide a system that allows you to retire anytime.

218
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:59,685
This will prevent the player from being forced to do so.

219
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:05,630
Next, you agree 100% with the player's actions.

220
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:11,295
This will make your actions justified and the player will be honest.

221
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:14,157
Third, you can follow the player's actions.

222
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:23,669
So to recap this third point, we allow for a retry at any time, which makes the player

223
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:27,791
feel like he isn't being forced and has some freedom.

224
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:33,294
Then we agree with the player's actions 100%, and that causes the player to feel like his

225
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:36,375
actions were approved, and that always feels good.

226
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,236
Have the story allow for it, too.

227
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:40,137
That's the third box here.

228
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:41,638
Just having the story allow for it.

229
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:57,548
makes the player feel empowered by the game because his desire is actually fulfilled.

230
00:16:57,548 --> 00:17:02,251
And now here's why we do all of this.

231
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:07,674
It helps to make the player ease into the story.

232
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,309
It helps to get gamers immersed into the world you created.

233
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,010
They have to suspend their disbelief in order to do that.

234
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,951
And you have to make it easy for them.

235
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:24,193
And once that's done, the gamer will cooperate with the story.

236
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:27,715
They'll feel more prone to do what you tell them to do.

237
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:31,917
And that way, they'll proceed along the path that you create.

238
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,557
Next up, point number three.

239
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:40,901
In general, I had little impression of the characters performing on stage.

240
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:48,781
Speaking of which, I changed the title of the session.

241
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:50,662
Is everyone bringing coffee?

242
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:53,745
So, yes, we need to make a universe and people,

243
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:58,989
characters in our game that resonate with our audience.

244
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:01,151
By the way, does everybody have a coffee?

245
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:04,053
Did everybody bring their coffee?

246
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:04,773
Oh, good.

247
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:07,055
Can I have a cup of coffee?

248
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:08,596
He wants to take a coffee break.

249
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:08,957
Yeah.

250
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,538
Let's take a break.

251
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:12,680
Let's move on.

252
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:14,062
Yes.

253
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:21,324
Usually, when you write a scenario for a one-way game, you write a synopsis, then a plot,

254
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:28,505
and then you make a character list, and then you make a scenario.

255
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:30,006
This is how it works.

256
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:31,266
Like this.

257
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:37,988
You write a synopsis, then you make a plot, and then you make a character, and then you go to the script.

258
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:42,077
and create the details of the characters.

259
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,717
But DP is different from this.

260
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:45,698
DP first prepares the synopsis.

261
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:48,079
After that, instead of going to the plot,

262
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,402
we spent the most time creating the map and the characters.

263
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:58,465
We actually went to the interview, drew the map of the city,

264
00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:02,547
and for the characters that appear there,

265
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:06,368
we made a code table that took 24 hours.

266
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:12,147
and then create the plot and the scenario.

267
00:19:12,147 --> 00:19:15,948
This is how we create the story.

268
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:20,269
Rather than making a single movie,

269
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:24,150
we create the characters and the story.

270
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,512
It's like making a TV drama or a Japanese manga magazine.

271
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:31,272
I think it's similar to that.

272
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,754
So normally for a single path storyline,

273
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,075
you do what's on the left.

274
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:39,396
You'd create a synopsis, create some kind of plot,

275
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:42,317
list up your characters, and create a storyline.

276
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:46,138
It's not uncommon that you would start making the map

277
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:48,299
and figure out all of the details of your characters

278
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,981
backgrounds after all of that other stuff has been done.

279
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:54,922
But for Deadly Premonition, we did what's on the right here.

280
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,622
We created the synopsis, and then we

281
00:19:56,622 --> 00:19:58,703
went into some more details for the character,

282
00:19:58,703 --> 00:19:59,463
created the map.

283
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:20,002
and then figured out the details of the map and what the characters would be doing on a 24-hour timetable inside that map.

284
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:24,966
And then we created the plot and storyline.

285
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:37,134
I think that, like the story, setting the world and the characters are very important.

286
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:41,836
The reason is that the player is always in the open world,

287
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:47,919
and while they are in the Greenvale city, there is no space.

288
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,841
I wanted something to happen while they are there,

289
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:58,303
so I think it's important that the city is always moving.

290
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,912
So why, you may ask, did we do it this way?

291
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:04,754
It was because the characters and the universe

292
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:07,675
are just as important as the storyline.

293
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:10,716
When we started the development of it,

294
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:12,717
there weren't many games that we could refer to

295
00:21:12,717 --> 00:21:16,359
that had an open field, free roaming style gameplay.

296
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,440
So we had to figure out a way to do this on our own.

297
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,741
The player, we knew that the player

298
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:22,182
was gonna be placed in this world,

299
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:23,763
this town for a long period of time,

300
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:27,204
and so the stage of the town of Greenvale

301
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,925
was very, very important.

302
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:35,027
then we figured that, you know, well, who would be living here in this town that we've created?

303
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:43,249
And once we went through that process, we were able to create a very rich and dense, deep universe.

304
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:48,750
And in hindsight, since the detailed story was written after the setting and the characters

305
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:57,653
were made, one might say that it was created more like a TV series rather than like a movie.

306
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:07,754
This is pretty important, but when you're playing a game, you're usually only concerned about the ending,

307
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:18,903
but the game that you're more concerned about the ending than the next chapter of the story is over.

308
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:20,164
Ah, I made coffee.

309
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:20,624
Hold on, please.

310
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:21,164
Alcatraz glass?

311
00:22:21,164 --> 00:22:22,025
He went to Alcatraz.

312
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:22,646
Thank you.

313
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,295
So, let's go to the next page.

314
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:32,976
In a normal game,

315
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:39,020
there is a task, a hint, and you have to clear it.

316
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,661
Then, you get a reward, money, and other things.

317
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:44,723
Then, the result screen appears.

318
00:22:44,723 --> 00:22:48,625
You have to go back to the beginning and repeat the process.

319
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,727
But after the result, you want to quit.

320
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:54,589
You want to quit, and that's what happens.

321
00:22:56,056 --> 00:23:12,588
So normally, you would take on a challenge, you would receive a hint, and when you finish it, you receive a reward, and you get your results.

322
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:20,874
And the player's mind is now thinking, something just ended, is this a good place to quit?

323
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:27,100
So for Deadly Premonition, we did this.

324
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:33,344
We inserted a glimpse of the next challenge before the result screen.

325
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:52,865
the player's mind is now thinking, I want to know more of what's coming next.

326
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:56,986
The results screen actually acts as a tickling tickler.

327
00:23:56,986 --> 00:24:02,468
It basically tickles you to want to know what's going on in the next scene.

328
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:03,708
This is a cliffhanger.

329
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,529
It's still not in the game, but it's quite important.

330
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:10,950
I hope more games like this will be added in the future.

331
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,531
It's kind of like a cliffhanger.

332
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:15,812
As games are going to progress...

333
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:21,824
people are going to want to make episodic games and these cliffhangers will be very useful.

334
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:24,584
Next. What number is it?

335
00:24:24,584 --> 00:24:25,345
Number 5.

336
00:24:25,345 --> 00:24:34,186
The game where you can't remember the character's name is over.

337
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:35,407
It says it's a virtual game.

338
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:39,747
If you can't remember any of the characters' names, then that game is garbage.

339
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:44,428
It's a game where you can't remember the characters' names.

340
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,797
The character is very important.

341
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:48,918
I have three points.

342
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:50,958
First, let's write a history.

343
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,119
When I write a history, I use a mind map.

344
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,060
For example, the character is an FBI agent,

345
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,321
so I think about how strong his body is.

346
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:02,422
And not only the character's appearance,

347
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:06,543
but also his various characteristics, such as hobbies and hobbies.

348
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:10,304
To put it in detail, his academic background,

349
00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:11,105
his first love,

350
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:13,465
and his favorite books as a child.

351
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:21,818
You need to spend a lot of time to make deep characters, and it really helps in Sori-san's

352
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:30,446
mind to create a resume for each of the characters that you want to create.

353
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:45,692
So he likes to use mind mapping, as you can see here,

354
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:47,633
to get at least a fuzzy image of the character.

355
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,353
Then he likes to write down some notes

356
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:52,634
to generate a resume at the end.

357
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:57,575
And when we talk about resumes,

358
00:25:57,575 --> 00:25:59,975
it sounds more like it's just work-related stuff,

359
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,976
but it's not just that.

360
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,456
It's also about physical appearance, personality traits,

361
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:05,777
ways of thinking, habits.

362
00:26:06,352 --> 00:26:09,693
hobbies, the character's first love, what kind of stuff

363
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,514
did that character like when he was a child,

364
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:14,854
anything that comes to mind, just jot it down.

365
00:26:14,854 --> 00:26:18,175
And then those notes could then be turned into a resume.

366
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:21,096
And the resume doesn't have to be final at this stage.

367
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:21,916
It can be messy.

368
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,637
You can still make changes to it while you're still writing out

369
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:26,517
the full and detailed story.

370
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:30,298
But getting just the core elements locked down early,

371
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:32,119
that would be very important.

372
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:38,509
If you get stuck in the story when you're writing the story just because of the resume,

373
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:41,970
then you should probably make a change in your resume.

374
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,331
You're a jockey, young surfer.

375
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:46,632
I am NOT supposed to answer this question.

376
00:26:46,632 --> 00:26:49,233
Why were you thinking you were a jockey?

377
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,714
What was the reason?

378
00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:53,655
All I can say is that I couldn't do it.

379
00:26:53,655 --> 00:27:00,558
When you finish your resume, when you realize you're not quite right,

380
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:14,725
The player will imitate it, and even after the game is over, it will still have an impact.

381
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:25,869
This is just a small example, but I'm happy to receive many fan letters from the users.

382
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:36,352
This partially goes back to the first point where we talked about having something inside the game affect the player outside of the game.

383
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:48,577
So he thinks it's important that your fans can actually copy the poses and use the phrases and draw the pictures of your characters.

384
00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:50,878
So you want your

385
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:54,900
characters to have these elements that are copyable and mimic-able.

386
00:27:55,337 --> 00:28:03,884
In Deadly Premonitions, Sueri-san used some very over-exaggerated moves, animations for

387
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:10,470
his characters as signature poses and gestures.

388
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,752
You don't have to do that.

389
00:28:12,752 --> 00:28:14,953
It can be a lot more natural.

390
00:28:14,953 --> 00:28:18,016
Some things like he just did, like he scratches his head a lot.

391
00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:22,380
Having that kind of mimicable action in your game.

392
00:28:23,224 --> 00:28:33,586
makes the character much more relatable and dearing.

393
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:58,086
There are some good-natured and child-loving men,

394
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:01,709
and that's their favorite part.

395
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:04,371
But there are also some bad parts,

396
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:05,072
like their true feelings.

397
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:07,234
For example, York.

398
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:08,415
York is an otaku,

399
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,777
and he can't read the room.

400
00:29:11,777 --> 00:29:14,860
Emily is a woman who is terrible at cooking,

401
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,922
and has a lot of insecurities.

402
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,444
And Jason is,

403
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:20,284
you know,

404
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:21,665
he's not shy around women.

405
00:29:21,665 --> 00:29:22,326
He's very erotic.

406
00:29:23,374 --> 00:29:33,921
So, let's hear. So, they say every rose has its thorn, and just like every old cowboy has watched the TV show Facts of Life.

407
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:48,430
So, in life, we are in love with someone. We actually are in love with the good side of that person and the bad side of that person.

408
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,912
We're in love with that mixture, that unique blend.

409
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:54,846
So don't be afraid to add bad sides of your characters

410
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:55,527
inside your game.

411
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,769
The three characters that we have here,

412
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:03,513
we have York, the dapper and looking FBI agent,

413
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:06,856
yet he's an otaku and he's inconsiderate.

414
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:10,199
We have Emily, very beautiful looking,

415
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:12,320
but filled with bad personal problems

416
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,062
and is a horrible cook.

417
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,624
The nice guy on the right has a hard time

418
00:30:16,624 --> 00:30:18,345
keeping his pants on.

419
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:20,767
So having bad sides to your characters

420
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:21,819
is a good thing.

421
00:30:50,994 --> 00:30:55,278
It takes courage as a game designer to be adding a bad side to your character.

422
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:02,904
You want to, when you're creating characters, you want your players to love your characters.

423
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:08,108
So it kind of goes against the grain to be adding a bad side.

424
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:10,249
But you have to remember that this is true to life.

425
00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:16,975
When you think about your friends and your family, what have you, they all have a bad

426
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,577
side, but you still like them.

427
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:27,304
So it's also important to have your characters talk in a way that is memorable.

428
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:31,447
Here's how Suwari-san directed the voice recordings.

429
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:58,393
Now, Suerisan says he can't really speak English, at least not very well, but he was still,

430
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:01,756
as a game director, had to...

431
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:21,898
give directions to voice actors and ask for new takes and give okays in the voice recording studio.

432
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:26,039
And so, instead of focusing on the actual content of what was being said,

433
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,580
he focused on how the lines were being spoken.

434
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:35,642
Does it fit the character situation? Does it sound like the vocal range fits the character?

435
00:32:35,642 --> 00:32:42,145
Does the rhythm and up-downs in tone, like musically, how do they work in the scene?

436
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:45,632
Liverpool Sound and British Universion.

437
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:46,293
Let's move on.

438
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:50,717
I also have a similar idea for other characters.

439
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:52,979
When I make characters,

440
00:32:52,979 --> 00:32:58,744
I need to have this idea to avoid the risk of not being able to speak English.

441
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,686
George is a violent character,

442
00:33:01,686 --> 00:33:03,388
but he has a legendary image.

443
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:05,550
He's a hard rock artist from the 80s.

444
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,672
Emily is a country girl,

445
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:09,753
and she's nostalgic.

446
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:16,753
And so York, as you saw in the earlier slide, sounded like, in his mind, kind of Liverpool

447
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:17,913
soundish, British invasion soundish.

448
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:26,577
Other characters we have on screen, George is tough and gruff.

449
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:29,658
And Emily.

450
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:39,622
Yeah, George is tough and gruff, destructive and wild, but kind of like the old 80s rock.

451
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:51,280
hard rock. Emily would be somewhat not really too country style, but she needed to sound

452
00:33:51,280 --> 00:34:04,930
nostalgic and still fresh and offer a sense of like motherly relief to the player's ears.

453
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:17,425
Of course, Rui-san did not use this on every character, but he was able to feel the emotion in what people are saying and it's the emotion that's really important.

454
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:24,008
To recap on this slide, what we're trying to say here is that you need to make sure that you have your own set of rules when you go into a voice recording.

455
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:36,053
Create some kind of ruler of your own to make decisions with and to make a judgment on what is good and what is not good for the voice file.

456
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:44,725
And so, what's most important are your ideas.

457
00:35:06,693 --> 00:35:08,915
Please use it when you have an idea.

458
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:11,296
It's a chance to use it.

459
00:35:11,296 --> 00:35:13,298
It's a waste to not use it.

460
00:35:13,298 --> 00:35:16,280
It's not like you can take it later.

461
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,343
It's better to use it when you have an idea.

462
00:35:19,343 --> 00:35:23,126
It's okay if it's useless.

463
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:24,947
It's okay if it's useless.

464
00:35:24,947 --> 00:35:27,609
It's okay if no one notices.

465
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:29,130
It's an idea.

466
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,413
So I think it's better to include it as much as possible.

467
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:34,455
This map is meaningless.

468
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:42,743
But I came up with it, so I'm going to include it.

469
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:44,983
I think that's important.

470
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:25,528
We did this because this idea came to Suwari-san. There's no rhyme nor reason to do this, but the idea was there and we wanted to do it.

471
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:29,211
Yeah, there's no rhyme nor reason.

472
00:36:30,198 --> 00:36:37,060
The third one is, the story is important, but we should put more effort into the characters.

473
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:43,922
The fourth one is, the result of the game is wrong. We should make the game with the result of the game.

474
00:36:43,922 --> 00:36:52,245
The fifth one is, the story is good, but we should put more effort into the dialogue.

475
00:36:52,245 --> 00:37:00,148
The sixth one is, the story is good, but we should put more effort into the dialogue.

476
00:37:00,892 --> 00:37:06,316
Lastly, the ability to use all ideas when they are needed.

477
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:12,239
These are the seven points I wanted to talk about today.

478
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,701
Now, that's it for the slides.

479
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:19,444
Those were the seven points.

480
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:24,207
Kind of recap, you've read all of them in Japanese.

481
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:26,368
I won't be reading them all to you.

482
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:27,869
I'd rather use the time for a Q&A. So let's see here.

483
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:28,569
But he has one more thing.

484
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:29,150
Hold on, please.

485
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:34,980
Is there an idea in his coffee?

486
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,843
There's an idea in his coffee.

487
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:47,007
Please come see his coffee. There's ideas in there.

488
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:49,788
Did you find something?

489
00:37:49,788 --> 00:37:56,732
Was there a game design in his coffee?

490
00:38:01,474 --> 00:38:03,516
more art.

491
00:38:03,516 --> 00:38:15,311
So hopefully after we overcome this technical difficulty here, we will be able to show you

492
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:18,675
a video and then we'll get into the Q&A.

493
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:39,283
I used to make fighting games.

494
00:39:03,957 --> 00:39:05,718
It's a tomba.

495
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:10,499
This is a difficult game.

496
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:22,443
This is my first direction work.

497
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,991
It's him!

498
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:50,947
FBI Special Agent Francis York Marvel

499
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:52,648
XS Games

500
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:17,240
Thank you again.

501
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:43,676
So, AXS Games will continue to be making games that challenge the boundaries of video game

502
00:40:43,676 --> 00:40:44,416
design.

503
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:49,919
If given the chance, I swear he would like to use the experience he has to make games

504
00:40:49,919 --> 00:40:58,304
that take, original games that take larger leaps than seen before for the worldwide audience.

505
00:40:58,304 --> 00:41:03,347
So let's do a Q&A if there's anybody have any questions.

506
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:25,709
Looking at the approach that you took with Deadly Premonition, I was kind of wondering about your opinion on another franchise, which on the one hand does seem to do some of the same things, but takes a very, very different approach.

507
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:28,751
So I'm wondering what you think of Metal Gear Solid.

508
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:33,436
Speaking of a different franchise,

509
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:34,876
a similar type of thing,

510
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:37,677
there's Metal Gear, what do you think of it?

511
00:41:37,677 --> 00:41:40,338
In comparison with Deadly Premonition?

512
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:42,239
In comparison with Deadly Premonition?

513
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:47,340
What do you think of it in general?

514
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:52,582
I love Metal Gear 2.

515
00:41:52,582 --> 00:41:54,322
I loved Metal Gear 2.

516
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,365
Any other questions?

517
00:42:04,365 --> 00:42:05,085
Not over here.

518
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:05,766
Oh, please.

519
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:11,491
Can you talk a little bit about why deadly premonition is set in the U.S., and specifically

520
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:14,094
in the Pacific Northwest?

521
00:42:14,094 --> 00:42:17,557
What is your fascination with that region, and why did you select that?

522
00:42:17,557 --> 00:42:19,559
The reason why I chose the American people is because I haven't really seen a lot of

523
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:25,344
US combat experience in the Pacific Northwest, so I don't really know much about the experience

524
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:25,504
there.

525
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:29,508
I don't know much about the episodic world, cause I haven't actualy experienced that.

526
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:44,305
One of my relatives used to live in Canada, and so initially we were thinking about using Canada, but

527
00:42:55,437 --> 00:42:59,860
At the time, we were also thinking about, well, where are most of the gamers?

528
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,681
And most of the gamers are in the U.S.

529
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:05,504
So we thought using somewhere close to Canada but in the U.S. would be good.

530
00:43:05,504 --> 00:43:05,624
Hi.

531
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,425
Hi, how's it going?

532
00:43:06,425 --> 00:43:17,993
I wanted to ask a question about the nether world in Deadly Premonition.

533
00:43:17,993 --> 00:43:21,895
How it is to have a population that's so vulnerable in the entirety of the game?

534
00:43:22,598 --> 00:43:27,680
So Deadly Premonition has a regular reality and then it has another world that York and

535
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,161
eventually other characters pass into.

536
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:35,043
And I was wondering if you could talk about that and what the goal, I didn't want to say

537
00:43:35,043 --> 00:43:39,285
what the meaning is, but what the design of it is.

538
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:41,846
So, I'm going to speak in Japanese.

539
00:43:41,846 --> 00:43:43,846
Thank you for your time.

540
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:44,087
Thank you.

541
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:50,369
I'd like to ask you about the back story of Deadly Premonition.

542
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:56,283
There are two worlds, the normal world and the other world.

543
00:43:56,283 --> 00:44:00,765
There is a place where the yolk grows and solves the mystery.

544
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:03,026
Could you explain about that?

545
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:03,987
Oh, you mean the special oil?

546
00:44:03,987 --> 00:44:04,567
Yes.

547
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:08,909
Well, it's a very complicated story.

548
00:44:08,909 --> 00:44:14,292
The world of Retro-Premonition is a human world,

549
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:20,895
and there are two worlds, the normal world and the other world.

550
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:22,822
影響し合っている不思議な空間にあるそういうテーマの話で 赤いっていうのは悪いことで森っていうのがいいことをみたいなのがあってその赤いっていうのが

551
00:44:22,822 --> 00:44:25,464
人間の世界にこうちょっとずつ漏れ出してきてて それを防ぐのが森でその漏れ出してきているところっていうのが今あの質問いただいたその不思議な

552
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:27,285
ナイトメアの世界っていうことになります 森のところがとこよ森がいいところで赤がところ

553
00:44:52,048 --> 00:44:55,390
Okay, so it's a complex question.

554
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,191
There's a human world, there's a red world,

555
00:44:58,191 --> 00:45:02,792
and there's a forest world.

556
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:04,773
The red world is bad.

557
00:45:04,773 --> 00:45:09,114
It's eating into the human world.

558
00:45:09,114 --> 00:45:12,955
The forest is kind of stopping that from happening.

559
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:17,057
The red world is probably what you mean by the other side.

560
00:45:17,057 --> 00:45:17,157
Okay?

561
00:45:17,157 --> 00:45:19,038
Is that scratch the itch for that question?

562
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:19,878
Next question, please.

563
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:34,321
If there were to be a sequel to Deadly Premonition,

564
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:45,605
would you continue the story with York or would you have a new character?

565
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:52,688
I don't think we should talk about it again.

566
00:45:52,688 --> 00:45:53,789
Yes, I get asked that a lot.

567
00:45:53,789 --> 00:46:01,795
York went back to the forest so of course everybody is going to wonder, can we still

568
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:03,296
use him?

569
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:04,777
But people want to see more of York.

570
00:46:04,777 --> 00:46:06,218
And that's a dilemma.

571
00:46:06,218 --> 00:46:13,004
We can always pretend like Deadly Premonition 1 never happened, and create a sequel.

572
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:15,426
Sorry, I guess I meant Zax.

573
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:15,846
Zax, yeah.

574
00:46:17,756 --> 00:46:23,800
I thought it was Zack.

575
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,243
That's a good point.

576
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:40,572
I have the impression that three songs were used.

577
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:46,636
Was that intentional or was it inevitable?

578
00:46:48,497 --> 00:46:57,940
I had a lot of time to make songs, but I always ended up using the songs I liked.

579
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:04,603
So I used those songs, like Life is Beautiful.

580
00:47:04,603 --> 00:47:06,224
Whistling

581
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:12,286
Well, we had the resources to make more music, so it would be intentional.

582
00:47:12,286 --> 00:47:16,768
Naturally, I had to choose the songs that I liked, and I liked those three songs.

583
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:23,247
I just walked up, you're next.

584
00:47:23,247 --> 00:47:26,127
A lot of the craft of game design involves

585
00:47:26,127 --> 00:47:28,988
paring down what you want to do.

586
00:47:28,988 --> 00:47:35,450
If you'd had more resources, either with the game engine or more time, for instance,

587
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,171
what things would be different about Deadly Premonition?

588
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:43,772
Or more precisely, what were some of the things you wanted to do with it

589
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:45,773
that maybe you had to cut at some point in the process?

590
00:47:47,392 --> 00:47:54,374
YORK UCHIHARA I wanted York to ride a bicycle.

591
00:48:18,873 --> 00:48:23,554
I wanted York to wear cologne.

592
00:48:23,554 --> 00:48:24,074
Good.

593
00:48:24,074 --> 00:48:24,914
Thank you.

594
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:26,054
This is Amina.

595
00:48:26,054 --> 00:48:26,274
Yes.

596
00:48:26,274 --> 00:48:36,556
So I think a lot of people would say that the combat was the weakest part of Deadly

597
00:48:36,556 --> 00:48:44,118
Premonition, and as someone who designs, I think we're mostly interested in you as an

598
00:48:44,118 --> 00:48:46,498
interactive storyteller.

599
00:48:46,774 --> 00:49:01,004
And I'm wondering what your thoughts are on conflict resolution without resorting to guns.

600
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:08,630
I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on that.

601
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:15,936
But when you make a game, there are a lot of things like conflicts and things like that.

602
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:17,256
What do you think about that?

603
00:49:17,256 --> 00:49:20,378
At first, this game didn't have any combat.

604
00:49:20,378 --> 00:49:27,581
It was a game where you just held your breath and ran away from the shadows.

605
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:33,284
But then I was told that it wouldn't sell in North America, so I added combat.

606
00:49:33,284 --> 00:49:34,865
Yeah.

607
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:38,330
Originally, this game didn't have any combat.

608
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,451
The player was just to control the character

609
00:49:40,451 --> 00:49:42,051
to run away from shadows.

610
00:49:42,051 --> 00:49:48,154
We were told that that would not sell well in the United States,

611
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:50,835
so we added some combat.

612
00:49:50,835 --> 00:49:51,476
You're wrong.

613
00:49:51,476 --> 00:49:54,357
It probably was a mistake.

614
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:55,357
Yeah.

615
00:49:55,357 --> 00:49:55,958
Thank you.

616
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,798
Only five minutes left.

617
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:02,451
So I was primarily curious, seeing that the graphics,

618
00:50:02,451 --> 00:50:05,652
I would say, are not the emphasis of the game.

619
00:50:05,652 --> 00:50:09,233
And seeing how much effort you put into the storytelling

620
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:12,474
and the detail of the world, I was basically

621
00:50:12,474 --> 00:50:14,815
curious how much of that came out of your desire

622
00:50:14,815 --> 00:50:19,856
not to distract the player, perhaps, with flashy graphics,

623
00:50:19,856 --> 00:50:23,977
and how much of it was just the constraints

624
00:50:23,977 --> 00:50:26,298
that you were operating under.

625
00:50:26,298 --> 00:50:27,478
SPEAKER 1 IN JAPANESE

626
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:38,575
Yes, Deadly Premonition went through maybe about four times where the project may have

627
00:50:38,575 --> 00:50:40,195
been canceled.

628
00:50:40,195 --> 00:50:42,896
That happened over a span of five years.

629
00:50:42,896 --> 00:50:56,459
During one of those, after we reached a certain point, we just were not allowed or we could

630
00:50:56,459 --> 00:50:56,719
not.

631
00:50:57,872 --> 00:51:00,835
work on the graphics anymore and that's kind of what happened.

632
00:51:00,835 --> 00:51:02,897
My question is if there was a sequel to Deadly Premonition,

633
00:51:02,897 --> 00:51:09,764
would it take place, would you think about taking, take place

634
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:16,230
before or after York's story and where else would it, could it

635
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,493
possibly be located?

636
00:51:20,805 --> 00:51:27,209
Do you want to talk about before DP1 or after DP1?

637
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,271
Or do you want to talk about the same place or a different place?

638
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:32,013
I haven't thought about that yet.

639
00:51:32,013 --> 00:51:35,615
I haven't thought about that yet.

640
00:51:35,615 --> 00:51:35,775
Sorry.

641
00:51:35,775 --> 00:51:37,497
It's all right.

642
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:38,958
One more question.

643
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:40,359
Very simple.

644
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:48,064
In your opinion, what is the point of narrative in games?

645
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:51,096
Narrative in games? What is the point of it?

646
00:51:51,096 --> 00:51:53,356
Yeah, why? What's the point of it?

647
00:51:53,356 --> 00:51:56,797
Sorry, the question is why do we have narrative in games?

648
00:51:56,797 --> 00:52:01,198
What's the purpose of narrative in games? Might be a better way of phrasing it.

649
00:52:01,198 --> 00:52:03,719
What is the purpose of narrative in games?

650
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:04,919
It's difficult, isn't it?

651
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:21,677
You mean narrative story?

652
00:52:21,677 --> 00:52:22,397
Or...

653
00:52:22,397 --> 00:52:28,200
What? I mean, yeah, I'm just curious about the opinion on that.

654
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:33,143
Like, as simple as that is, what is the point? What's the purpose?

655
00:52:33,143 --> 00:52:35,764
Please take this as a very light question.

656
00:52:35,764 --> 00:52:37,285
What is narration to you?

657
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:42,067
I feel like he is definitely progressing the idea of narrative in games,

658
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:43,308
so I'm curious what he thinks of like...

659
00:52:43,308 --> 00:52:48,290
In the case of narration, it's mostly about explaining the story and giving hints.

660
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,731
That's the only thing that's used in the game.

661
00:52:50,364 --> 00:53:16,591
Not just that, but I think it's a very useful tool for making the game more intimate with the player.

662
00:53:16,591 --> 00:53:19,432
That's all for now.

663
00:53:19,966 --> 00:53:21,426
So we're out of time.

664
00:53:21,426 --> 00:53:24,107
So if you guys don't mind, I think we need to end.

665
00:53:24,107 --> 00:53:25,908
But we're going to hang out here.

666
00:53:25,908 --> 00:53:29,089
And you can ask him questions on Twitter.

667
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:32,310
But we'll still be here.

668
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,790
So if you want to hang out and ask some questions,

669
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:34,190
we'll be here.

670
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:37,411
So that's it all of time we have today.

671
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:40,532
I'd like to thank everyone who showed up.

672
00:53:40,532 --> 00:53:46,154
And also, that helps with this session.

673
00:53:46,913 --> 00:53:55,988
Thank you Ted, thank you Ryan, David, the GDC staff, Chris and Brandon and Megan and

674
