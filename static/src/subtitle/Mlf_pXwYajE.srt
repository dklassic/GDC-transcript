1
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:08,693
So my name is Raylene Deck,

2
00:00:09,273 --> 00:00:11,195
and I'm currently a design lead at Bungie.

3
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:14,058
I've been a designer for over 10 years

4
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:16,481
with my start in the industry at BioWare,

5
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:18,863
where I worked primarily as a level designer

6
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:20,725
on Mass Effect 2 and 3,

7
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:22,648
and then later on Dragon Age Inquisition.

8
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:26,424
And, oh, thanks, guy, or lady.

9
00:00:26,964 --> 00:00:28,945
Hi there.

10
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:32,468
So in 2015, I joined a newly formed team at Bungie,

11
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:34,569
where I helped shape what would be the open world

12
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:37,891
destinations in Destiny 2, focusing mostly

13
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:39,632
on PVE multiplayer design.

14
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:43,054
So today, I'm going to talk about how

15
00:00:43,074 --> 00:00:44,635
to design for different types of people.

16
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:47,787
And my examples come from my personal experience

17
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:49,989
working at both BioWare and Bungie.

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,292
And these companies focus on large games with big teams.

19
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:55,874
So solving for different player types

20
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:58,356
involves many disciplines, but this talk

21
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,138
is only going to focus on world design.

22
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:04,134
But world design can mean something different to all of us.

23
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,355
I tried and I couldn't find a formal definition,

24
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:09,456
but my designer ego loved this one.

25
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:12,418
So very few careers offer people the opportunity

26
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:14,319
to become a god, yeah, that's awesome.

27
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:16,199
But a career as a world designer

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,300
might be as close as it gets.

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,826
So, in my world, our godly duties include things like level design, activity, quest,

30
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:30,193
mission, world systems design, and good world designers are skilled in all these fields

31
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:33,456
so that they can take a holistic approach when building experiences.

32
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:39,182
So, let's start by looking at why designing worlds for different player types is important.

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,602
So as game designers, we build systems and mechanics

34
00:01:44,642 --> 00:01:47,483
in our games that target specific audiences.

35
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:50,905
For example, party chat for social players

36
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:52,806
or leaderboards for competitive players.

37
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:54,347
But do we really do the same

38
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:55,528
when we think about world design?

39
00:01:56,755 --> 00:02:00,896
And if we know our audience, we can build worlds that are engaging for these players.

40
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,997
And because we're human, what we value often changes over time.

41
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:09,679
So for example, a new parent may only play shorter games because they have less free time.

42
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:15,480
Or maybe for someone like me, I now value multiplayer games over traditional single-player campaigns

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,962
because I use games as a way to reconnect with my friends in my home country.

44
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:24,258
So if we can understand what players value but our worlds,

45
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:27,225
we can react and do less of one thing and more of another.

46
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:31,275
And the point is to find our blind spots as designers.

47
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:36,632
So it's tempting to want to put something for everyone

48
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:37,593
in your game, right?

49
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:41,155
So you can have an amazing story for immersion-driven players

50
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:43,316
and tons of collectibles for achiever players

51
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:45,557
and PVP for competitive players.

52
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:47,358
So you could do that.

53
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:50,800
Some teams do, but the ones that try often fail.

54
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,281
That's because it's really hard to have something

55
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,402
for every type of person in your game

56
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,063
where everyone will be equally satisfied.

57
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,260
So focusing on what the player values will help you ship

58
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,222
because it'll narrow down that possibility set of what

59
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:05,262
should be in your game.

60
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:07,804
And this isn't easy to do, right?

61
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:09,565
Like, as game designers, we're not mind readers.

62
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,927
And a good portion of our time is

63
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,689
spent iterating on features based on player feedback.

64
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,851
But building the wrong set of features for your audience

65
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:21,153
leads to feature creep, over-scoping, and crunch.

66
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,235
And crunching on something that players don't truly value

67
00:03:24,315 --> 00:03:25,296
is extra frustrating.

68
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:27,297
So.

69
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:32,265
Before I go into examples,

70
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:35,766
this is the best player categorization I found.

71
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:38,086
Some of you are probably familiar with this.

72
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:40,527
It's called the Gamer Motivation Model

73
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,367
by the company Quantic Foundry.

74
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:45,088
And I won't go into detail how this chart was derived.

75
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,988
It's beyond the scope of this talk,

76
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:48,408
but if you haven't already,

77
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:49,669
I really encourage you to check out

78
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,309
Quantic Foundry's work on their website.

79
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:53,450
And they also have a talk on the GDC Vault.

80
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,230
So you also don't have to read all this now.

81
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,711
I'm gonna be referencing this image throughout the talk.

82
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:03,633
So at a very high level, Quantic Foundry

83
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:06,935
found that each of the columns are highly correlated,

84
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:08,796
and they call these clusters.

85
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:12,478
So I'm going to be organizing this talk around that idea.

86
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:14,500
So first, we'll look at world design

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,482
for the immersion creativity cluster, and then

88
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:21,224
the action social cluster, and then finally, the mastery

89
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:22,025
achievement cluster.

90
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:26,905
So we're going to explore three central ideas.

91
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:29,046
And each of these ideas are catered

92
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:30,387
towards different player types.

93
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:33,328
The first is about techniques that make your world feel

94
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:36,530
bigger than it is, and that's centered around players who

95
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,131
play for immersion and creativity.

96
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:41,032
And the second idea is about techniques

97
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,474
that make shared worlds feel friendly for social and action

98
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:44,814
players.

99
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,495
And the last one is about techniques

100
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:49,776
that give players agency in the world catered

101
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:51,217
towards mastery and achievement.

102
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:57,281
So what does it mean to make small worlds that feel big?

103
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:01,305
So these traits, fantasy, story, design, discovery,

104
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:03,627
they're typically found in role-playing games.

105
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:07,051
And a common problem that happens in RPGs

106
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:08,732
is that certain player motivations

107
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:10,314
become at odds with each other.

108
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:12,846
There are players who want to immerse themselves

109
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:14,306
in deep, rich stories.

110
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,667
And then there are players who want

111
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:18,708
to spend hours exploring and experimenting in the world.

112
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:22,329
And on top of that, many RPG players

113
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,250
value achievement, striving for completion and power.

114
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,050
So let's look at an example.

115
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:31,976
So after shipping Dragon Age Inquisition,

116
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:34,657
we heard feedback from players that they were feeling

117
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:36,977
overwhelmed with the amount of content in the game.

118
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:40,258
There were many objects to collect, puzzles to solve,

119
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:42,179
and there was over 200 side quests.

120
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,560
And the most memorable example of this

121
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,320
is an area called the Hinterlands.

122
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,321
And so this was the first open world zone

123
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:52,322
to unlock in the game,

124
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:54,722
and one of the biggest in physical size,

125
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:56,123
and had the most side quests.

126
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:57,843
Players would spend up to 20 hours,

127
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:01,477
here in order to finish all the quests before moving on.

128
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:04,858
And so spending so much time early on in the game

129
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:08,740
in one open world zone was, when there's nine more to explore,

130
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,581
was not the design team's intention.

131
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:14,922
So we tried to get people to leave on Twitter,

132
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:16,723
but it was too late.

133
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,283
It was too late.

134
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,904
Even this guy, this player knows their player type.

135
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,025
They're completionists in them.

136
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:22,446
They wouldn't let them leave.

137
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:24,927
They wouldn't do it.

138
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:27,348
Many of the other zones that we had.

139
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:31,050
Dragon Age will have the same problems as The Hinterlands, right?

140
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,511
So quests and activities didn't feel meaningful and

141
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:41,832
players expressed that large chunks of the open-world game felt like busywork and that players couldn't understand which quests were worth doing.

142
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:46,473
So some of the open-world design

143
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:51,075
conflicted with what most players play Dragon Age for, which is the rich story and characters.

144
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,202
And so I believe that you don't need hundreds of hours

145
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:57,945
of gameplay to satisfy players who enjoy story and exploration

146
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:00,127
by designing small worlds that feel big.

147
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:02,269
So let's look at some examples.

148
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:06,713
One of the open world zones that players

149
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:08,375
said that they enjoyed more than others

150
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:12,518
was Crestwood, specifically the Still Waters quest line.

151
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,241
So I'm going to step through this quest as best I can.

152
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:16,742
And then we're going to analyze it.

153
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,027
All right, so during the main campaign,

154
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:23,988
the player is told to go to a stormy zone called Crestwood.

155
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:28,169
Once there, they find undead attacking the nearby village.

156
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,330
In the village, the player can talk to the mayor

157
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,091
to ask why the undead are attacking.

158
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:35,952
And the mayor says they are coming from old Crestwood

159
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,352
that's been flooded years ago.

160
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:40,433
In order to solve the undead problem,

161
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,073
the player will have to drain the lake

162
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:44,974
by releasing the dam to access old Crestwood

163
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:46,135
that is currently underwater.

164
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,160
After getting access to the dam controls,

165
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,102
the player drains the lake and heads into old Crestwood.

166
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:56,005
They then head deep into a cave and kill a boss

167
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:57,466
that's summoning the undead.

168
00:07:58,467 --> 00:07:59,588
And so coming out of the caves

169
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,029
with Crestwood no longer cursed,

170
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,133
the world is not dark and stormy, but sunny and peaceful.

171
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:11,958
The player then heads back to the village to inform the mayor that Crestwood is safe,

172
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,819
but the mayor is no longer there.

173
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,500
He left a note on his desk explaining that he was the one who flooded Old Crestwood in

174
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,100
the first place.

175
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,821
Years ago, the villagers became very ill, and to stop the disease from spreading, the

176
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:26,602
mayor flooded the village and killed them all.

177
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:27,422
That was his solution.

178
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:31,483
So the player is then given a follow-up quest to go find the mayor.

179
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:36,553
So I believe there are a few key points that highlight

180
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:38,454
why this zone was memorable.

181
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:41,577
Side quest narrative is easy to follow.

182
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:44,418
So it's important to keep story concepts simple

183
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:46,920
because people can only actively process

184
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,362
a handful of items in their short term memory.

185
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:51,183
And in open world games,

186
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:53,385
there are many quest activities active at once

187
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,826
and the player can complete them in any order.

188
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,728
And so if the player has too many options

189
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,790
or if the story is too complicated, they lose interest.

190
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:08,187
Secondly, the side quest narrative encompasses the whole zone of Crestwood.

191
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:11,129
So there is one central problem for the zone,

192
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,512
and for Crestwood is uncovering the mystery of the past to help save the village.

193
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:19,194
After doing this, the players feel like they have completed the zone,

194
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:20,835
given a sense of closure.

195
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:23,597
If there are too many quests in the zone,

196
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:27,060
or if each of each of them have different themes or narratives,

197
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,761
it's hard to answer the question, what did I solve?

198
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,534
But people want to see how their effort matters.

199
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:37,054
After killing the boss in the cave

200
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:38,815
and heading back to go find the mayor,

201
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:40,876
the environment changed from stormy to sunny.

202
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:43,317
In addition, new quests became available,

203
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,957
so your work was recognized.

204
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:48,919
And lastly, the side quest narrative

205
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:50,319
ties back to the main game.

206
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:52,420
So after finding the mayor,

207
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,481
the player can use a global game mechanic

208
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:56,361
that we have in Dragon Age called Judgment.

209
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:58,446
to decide the mayor's fate.

210
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,467
And so this side quest creates a small connection

211
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:05,108
back to the central part of the game,

212
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:06,928
and suddenly it feels worth doing.

213
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:11,950
So let's talk about level design.

214
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,010
So as I said, we built a lot of content

215
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:15,950
in the open world maps,

216
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,351
but during internal play tests,

217
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,891
we got some surprising feedback.

218
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:21,758
Players said that they were bored

219
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,320
and they couldn't find much to do.

220
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:26,824
But looking at that image, it's hard to know

221
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:27,845
where to find the fun.

222
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:30,168
There is no meaningful choice to be

223
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,071
made about which way to go when all the hills look similar.

224
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:36,635
To the player, the open world areas kind of felt like this,

225
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,397
like a flat, boring field.

226
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,371
So we made some mobile design changes.

227
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:45,295
We use a natural world to create landmarks

228
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:46,857
using both lighting and shapes.

229
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:48,779
So close to the player, they can see

230
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,402
that there is probably something in that house.

231
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:52,965
And further away, they have a longer term goal

232
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:55,408
of reaching that monument with a flag in the distance.

233
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:59,219
There's a lot of talks, though, about the importance

234
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:01,241
of landmarks, so I'm not going to get into that here.

235
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:04,804
But what is interesting is that during the next play test,

236
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:07,487
the feedback was, wow, there's so much more stuff to do here.

237
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:10,469
But actually, we didn't add any new activities.

238
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,612
So sometimes adding more content isn't the right answer,

239
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:15,915
but it's how you're presenting that content to the player.

240
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:23,296
So the big takeaways here are to focus on building content

241
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,377
that can be integrated into the world

242
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:27,859
and presented into ways that feels meaningful.

243
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,301
So you'll have to decide what is most important when

244
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:32,221
designing your worlds.

245
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:35,463
So for RPGs like Dragon Age, it tends

246
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:39,006
to index on these player types, especially story-driven.

247
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:42,108
And sometimes that means less content for other.

248
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,983
types of players, for example, for completionists,

249
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:49,044
there could be less quests, or for explorers,

250
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:52,566
maybe less things to find, but that's okay.

251
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:54,767
So I believe it's a better choice

252
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:57,928
to build fewer quests at higher value

253
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:01,170
than risk losing engagement from your core audience.

254
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,432
All right, so.

255
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:07,925
Let's now take a look at action

256
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:09,966
in social-oriented type players

257
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:13,528
and ways to build worlds that feel friendly.

258
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:14,768
In multiplayer world design,

259
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:17,229
there's often a more complicated set of problems

260
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:18,270
than single player.

261
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,691
And this is because for better or for worse,

262
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,492
one player can influence another player's experience.

263
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:29,415
So when playing games, you wanna be the hero, right?

264
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:32,196
But in multiplayer worlds, there are tens, hundreds,

265
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:33,776
or even millions of other players

266
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:34,977
that wanna be the hero too.

267
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,442
And you want to spend time with other people,

268
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,082
but you also want to feel important.

269
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:42,324
So as designers, our multiplayer worlds

270
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:44,125
need to still feel personal.

271
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:48,687
But personal doesn't have to just mean one person.

272
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,488
It can mean you and your group of friends

273
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:53,269
are feeling like they're accomplishing goals together.

274
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,531
So many of the techniques that create small worlds that

275
00:12:57,571 --> 00:12:58,052
feel big.

276
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:00,403
can also apply to multiplayer games.

277
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:03,026
But we need to shift our thinking a bit

278
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,848
when we bring in multiplayer storytelling.

279
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:08,630
Because in a multiplayer environment,

280
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,092
storytelling should never negatively impact gameplay.

281
00:13:12,113 --> 00:13:14,415
So we need to make the world and the experiences in it

282
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:15,536
to be multiplayer friendly.

283
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:19,480
So now look at some techniques from Destiny 2.

284
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,140
on Destiny 2.

285
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:27,503
And so my team wanted to improve the social aspects

286
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,025
of the quest system that was in Destiny 1.

287
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:34,508
So in Destiny 1, after completing the main campaign,

288
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:35,829
players could engage in quests.

289
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,293
And quests were long, multi-step side activities

290
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:43,135
that could take days or sometimes weeks to complete.

291
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:47,189
Although quests were great at providing long-term goals,

292
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:48,990
they were not so great for multiplayer,

293
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,131
because if I wanted to play some quest with my friend,

294
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:55,413
there was a high chance that my next objective

295
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:56,993
would be totally different than my friend's,

296
00:13:57,154 --> 00:13:59,014
because we'd be on different steps of the quest.

297
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:01,135
So it was hard to keep players together,

298
00:14:01,796 --> 00:14:02,856
working on the same goal.

299
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:07,658
If we decided if one of our goals was to improve social,

300
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:09,899
that our activities needed to be shorter.

301
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,120
We had about 10 minutes in length.

302
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,951
We felt that if these activities weren't very long,

303
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:18,173
players would be able to join a friend who

304
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,875
is halfway through that activity and not feel like they've

305
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:22,116
missed a large story arc.

306
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,077
So we call these activities adventures.

307
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:30,081
And you can think of adventures as a shorter, less expensive

308
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:31,121
campaign mission.

309
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:38,517
So during playtests, we had groups of players play adventures together.

310
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:42,660
And many players would give feedback that they didn't understand what they were doing

311
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:44,041
and why they were doing it.

312
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:49,045
Each adventure has a short narrative that tells stories about the world,

313
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,807
but players weren't really understanding that story context.

314
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:54,885
So when playing together in a group,

315
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,386
it's easy to get distracted away from the narrative

316
00:14:57,426 --> 00:14:59,366
because social interaction takes priority.

317
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,406
So players are talking to each other,

318
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:02,927
they're running off ahead of each other,

319
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,967
and they're just focusing on something else entirely.

320
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,288
So our solution was to shorten and simplify our narratives.

321
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:12,789
Adventurers would start with a short call to action,

322
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,489
a statement about what you'll be doing

323
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,610
and why it's important.

324
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:18,694
the player only really need to pay attention

325
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:19,995
at the start of the adventure,

326
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:23,097
and if they miss some dialogue later on,

327
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:25,378
it wasn't critical because at least we know

328
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,339
that they should have a general sense of what they're doing.

329
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,541
And on the level design side, we would place the adventure

330
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:34,763
start location in quiet areas in the open world map

331
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:36,985
where combat is less likely to happen.

332
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:41,207
And so this gives the player time to listen to the dialogue

333
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,348
without getting distracted.

334
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:48,339
So to keep action-oriented and social players engaged,

335
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,101
it's important that it's easy and fast to play together,

336
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:52,782
and the narratives are short and concise.

337
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:56,084
And for these players, the designer's story

338
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,046
is not as important as theirs.

339
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:01,168
And crafted narrative, one-off experiences,

340
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:02,749
they often take a backseat,

341
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:04,911
because your story feels personal to you

342
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:05,811
and your group of friends.

343
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:08,922
And yeah, mistakes were made, yeah.

344
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:11,824
So, I mean, adventures were not perfect

345
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:13,005
for our Destiny's audience.

346
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:16,267
I don't think they were super fun

347
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:18,089
as we wanted them to be to repeat.

348
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:21,811
And we found that players still value those long quest lines

349
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,192
and we ended up bringing those back

350
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:24,513
in a slightly different form.

351
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:28,817
Destiny's player base also highly values pursuit, right?

352
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:29,978
And I think that we could do something

353
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:31,879
when it comes to adventures in the future.

354
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:39,430
So let's look at another multiplayer activity in Destiny,

355
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,651
public events.

356
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,593
And public events are different than adventures

357
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:45,995
because their goal is to bring strangers together.

358
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,078
Each public event is a short, less than five minute

359
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:52,360
combat experience that spawns in and out

360
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,162
of multiplayer zones that we internally at Bungie

361
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:56,123
call public bubbles.

362
00:16:57,259 --> 00:16:59,620
And if a player is in a public bubble,

363
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,862
they will be automatically match made with random players

364
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:05,083
until that player chooses to leave that bubble.

365
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:09,406
And when designing content for public bubbles,

366
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:11,807
one of the most important goals is

367
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:13,548
to make players happy to see each other.

368
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:16,170
And at a minimum, we want players

369
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,851
to not be afraid of another human being.

370
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,086
And so the idea here is to build an environment where

371
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:24,928
a stranger cannot negatively impact another player's

372
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:25,648
experiences.

373
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:28,370
So it should feel like the people around you

374
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,491
are there to help you, and you're there to help them.

375
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:32,512
Let's look at some examples.

376
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:35,694
All right.

377
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:36,214
So.

378
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:40,230
A good way to get help is to show intention.

379
00:17:40,871 --> 00:17:43,873
And public events are advertised on the world map

380
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,894
before they start for a few reasons.

381
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:49,056
And it gives players the ability to plan their time,

382
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,318
and it gives a focal point for strangers to come together.

383
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,980
And in the world, the public event location

384
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,761
is like a physical flag marker.

385
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:00,763
And players can interact with that marker

386
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:03,125
to get a bonus and a timer on their HUD

387
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:05,286
to show when the public event will start.

388
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:09,059
And the idea here is that a player wants that bonus,

389
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,080
so they click on the flag,

390
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,461
which lets other players in the area know

391
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,803
that that player is planning on participating

392
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:16,044
in the public event,

393
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:18,565
so it's a good idea to stick around if you want help.

394
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:24,269
But for showing intention to work,

395
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:29,072
so players, they need to stop and smell the roses, right?

396
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,794
So this is the importance of downtime.

397
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:32,894
And...

398
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,859
To bring strangers together, they need to see each other.

399
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:41,403
So you need to find places to build in intentional downtime

400
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:44,306
where the regular gameplay distractions are minimized.

401
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:47,769
And so emotes are a great example, like here.

402
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,153
One of my design mentors at Bungie, she would always say,

403
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,435
if you don't build downtime in your game,

404
00:18:54,615 --> 00:18:56,717
know that players will seek downtime outside of it.

405
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:04,721
So public events, they're difficult to do by yourself,

406
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:06,723
but they're not impossible.

407
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:10,066
You can technically solo one, but it'll be pretty difficult.

408
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:13,348
And in order to encourage players to play together,

409
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,850
we kind of ride that line on difficulty.

410
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:18,993
If a new event starts up that's really difficult

411
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:21,415
and a player sees nobody else nearby,

412
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:22,776
they probably won't engage with it.

413
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:24,958
And if the event is too easy,

414
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:26,539
players, they don't need each other.

415
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:31,085
So you need to do some hard thinking about how difficult

416
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,888
your multiplayer activity is versus how much trust

417
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:35,609
your players have with each other.

418
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:39,492
So as I was saying before, in Destiny Public Bubbles,

419
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:41,234
it's a low trust zone.

420
00:19:41,854 --> 00:19:45,277
So players are randomly matched together for a short duration.

421
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:49,221
So it's not enough time to build relationships with other people.

422
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:53,158
So if difficult encounters are done poorly

423
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:54,278
in an environment like this,

424
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:56,119
in a player's failure encounter,

425
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,539
they're not gonna blame themselves,

426
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,259
and they're gonna blame all the other players.

427
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,901
So in Destiny raids, raids are a high trust activity.

428
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:10,562
And so they require high coordination,

429
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:11,883
skill, and communication.

430
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:14,893
Players, they self-organize into groups

431
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,994
and they need to speak to each other

432
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:19,856
in order to overcome puzzles and encounters

433
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,577
with only hints from the raid designers.

434
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:24,718
In public bubbles though, players don't have

435
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:27,080
that same type of connections with each other.

436
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,682
And because of this, we try to match the mechanics

437
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,683
to the amount of trust required.

438
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:37,546
So for example, one example how this could go wrong,

439
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:40,608
maybe from the Blade of Crota event in Destiny 1.

440
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,528
And so here, one person needs to go and grab that sword

441
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:46,249
and use it to kill a boss.

442
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,971
But you can't guarantee that that one person will just

443
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:50,832
grab the sword and run away with it

444
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:52,113
or just stand there and be a jerk.

445
00:20:53,474 --> 00:20:57,316
So in public bubbles, there's little to no social consequences

446
00:20:57,476 --> 00:20:58,096
to griefing.

447
00:20:58,577 --> 00:21:00,358
And most people, they aren't jerks.

448
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,199
But in a large population, you need to account for them,

449
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,021
as well as for people who just generally don't understand

450
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,782
the mechanic or they're new players.

451
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:17,328
I found that when designing shared worlds for action and social players,

452
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:21,192
immersion is a common conflicting motivation.

453
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,817
So for example, the public event flag is kind of gamey,

454
00:21:25,498 --> 00:21:27,039
it doesn't really fit in the world.

455
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:33,279
I think that there's a sliding scale when it comes to immersion and multiplayer games.

456
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:38,882
On one extreme end, you don't want to just remove it because then the magic of the world is gone.

457
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:44,385
And on the other side, you can't have it being too overwhelming where it negatively impacts gameplay.

458
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:47,026
And I think that's the most important key.

459
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:52,949
And you could make an argument that that flag should be like a different asset, right,

460
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:55,471
that ties better into the destiny narrative.

461
00:21:56,318 --> 00:21:59,942
It's true, but I think you should pick your battles.

462
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:03,745
How important is it to justify spending those resources?

463
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:05,206
How much can you spend?

464
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:08,489
And incorporating the story and immersion in multiplayer games

465
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:10,991
kind of like halfway is sometimes worse

466
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:11,952
than not doing it at all.

467
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:13,393
So you have to be intentional.

468
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:17,237
All right.

469
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:19,819
So let's look at my last topic.

470
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:23,322
So worlds that give agency for players who value

471
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:24,403
mastering achievement.

472
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:33,189
So typically, people, we don't get excited when we're being told what to do.

473
00:22:33,589 --> 00:22:36,149
And so humans, we thrive when given challenges.

474
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:41,951
And it's fun to learn and try new things in games when being told to go here and now

475
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:46,932
go kill exactly five enemies, now stand and click here and stand right over there.

476
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:48,212
Like it gets, turns boring.

477
00:22:49,232 --> 00:22:51,673
And I think this is true for all players,

478
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:55,273
but especially players who play for challenge or strategy.

479
00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:56,193
So.

480
00:22:57,136 --> 00:22:59,377
They want to do things like get all the achievements

481
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,919
or take on the toughest challenges.

482
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,921
So what should we think about when building worlds for them?

483
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:10,305
One way to create challenge is to place

484
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:13,267
high difficult encounters in the world.

485
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:15,588
So the above image is a dragon encounter

486
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:16,989
from Surprisingly Dragon Age.

487
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,372
We got a lot of positive feedback

488
00:23:21,552 --> 00:23:24,014
from players who chose to fight dragons.

489
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:27,138
And besides the great work from the gameplay team,

490
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:29,720
I think they were popular for a few other reasons.

491
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:32,922
Players were never forced to fight a dragon.

492
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:36,765
They chose to go gear up and go dragon hunting on their own.

493
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:40,608
And on the level design team, we would provide some guidance

494
00:23:40,689 --> 00:23:43,010
to show that there is a dragon in the area,

495
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:45,692
for example, by having it fly by land,

496
00:23:47,054 --> 00:23:48,555
roar like it'd fly by in the distance.

497
00:23:49,355 --> 00:23:50,696
And I think this gave

498
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:55,133
the player agency to make a decision on when and where they

499
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:57,674
want to engage in a dragon fight without hitting them

500
00:23:57,734 --> 00:23:58,534
over the head with it.

501
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:04,736
Which brings me to opt-in challenge.

502
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:09,638
So thinking about challenge when I was working on Mass Effect

503
00:24:09,678 --> 00:24:12,099
was interesting because the majority of players

504
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:14,039
would play for the story and the characters,

505
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,060
but there was a good chunk of players

506
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,581
that enjoyed third-person shooter combat.

507
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:22,579
Outside of world design, the systems team

508
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,760
solved this by building different gameplay modes.

509
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,181
So you could play in full action mode,

510
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:29,822
where conversations are auto-chosen for you.

511
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:33,723
Or you could go full story mode, where combat is easier,

512
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:37,985
but the player could choose to focus on what

513
00:24:38,065 --> 00:24:39,225
Shepard says or does.

514
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,320
Right? So, when thinking about world design,

515
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,760
we need to be careful about large difficulty spikes

516
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,881
because even if you can technically lower the difficulty,

517
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,582
it doesn't, like mid-game, it doesn't feel that great,

518
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:55,222
especially for many of our players' motivations

519
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:57,383
revolved around playing through the fights

520
00:24:57,403 --> 00:24:58,523
to get to the next story beat.

521
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:05,765
And so, one of the missions I worked on was called Grissom Academy.

522
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:08,558
And it was a total cakewalk.

523
00:25:09,138 --> 00:25:10,919
It was super easy.

524
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,280
So this mission opened up fairly early in the campaign.

525
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:20,201
So players had a limited set of abilities and weapons.

526
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:22,222
But I think it's only saving grace

527
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:23,722
was that the mission was optional.

528
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:27,743
So if you're dead set on shipping your Magnus Opus

529
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:30,144
combat encounter in a game that isn't entirely

530
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:32,225
focused on tough encounters, think

531
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:33,865
about when it should be available

532
00:25:34,025 --> 00:25:35,145
and who you're targeting.

533
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:42,108
So a common way of thinking about creating mastery

534
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:43,809
and achievement is through repetition.

535
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,231
So in order to get good at something,

536
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:47,912
you practice it over and over again.

537
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:52,675
So for our purposes, here's a super oversimplified diagram.

538
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:55,297
You complete a challenge in the world.

539
00:25:55,598 --> 00:25:57,499
You get better at it through practice

540
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:00,381
and perhaps becoming statistically stronger

541
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:01,102
by earning loot.

542
00:26:01,622 --> 00:26:03,063
And then when you take on that challenge again,

543
00:26:03,123 --> 00:26:03,764
you're better at it.

544
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,125
And then you're closer to mastery.

545
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:05,185
So.

546
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:11,735
But a word of caution is if your game is about pursuit,

547
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,979
and the easiest, which often translates

548
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,780
to the fastest way of gaining rewards

549
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:19,563
is by doing something that is repetitive or boring,

550
00:26:20,003 --> 00:26:20,564
players will do it.

551
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:23,627
They'll do that thing for hours and ignore

552
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:26,430
all the other fun activities that you built that also give

553
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,872
rewards, but your activity takes too long,

554
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:30,413
it requires more effort.

555
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:34,915
than, for example, standing in front of this cave for hours like in Destiny 1.

556
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:45,279
But to be fair, like the famous loot cave was a bug and an extreme case, but the important point

557
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:49,820
is that when designing for repetition, the world and systems design need to complement each other.

558
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,161
And so what I found when designing for repetition,

559
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,062
like action, is a common conflicting motivation.

560
00:27:00,022 --> 00:27:03,402
So if you don't account for repetition in your activity

561
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:07,043
from the beginning, it only takes one or two replays

562
00:27:07,063 --> 00:27:08,744
to quickly lose excitement.

563
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:12,164
So I'm sure you've played a mission where a narrative twist

564
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:14,005
or a surprising cut scene happened,

565
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:15,525
and repeating that mission again

566
00:27:15,645 --> 00:27:16,905
just doesn't pack that same punch.

567
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:21,544
So in these situations, I think your one-off expensive

568
00:27:21,604 --> 00:27:24,026
explosions in cinematics, they take a backseat.

569
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:27,908
So instead, spend your action and excitement bucks

570
00:27:27,968 --> 00:27:29,369
on things like variability.

571
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,771
So where can you add surprises that

572
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:36,514
changes the experiences in not very expensive ways?

573
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:39,856
Varying degrees of success.

574
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:42,298
So how can that player get better at your activity

575
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:43,318
the next time they play it?

576
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,991
And it's also important to think about what you don't need.

577
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:50,592
For example, is it fun to hear that same dialogue lines

578
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:51,352
over and over again?

579
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:52,232
Yeah, probably not.

580
00:27:53,352 --> 00:27:56,593
So to design for agency with repetition,

581
00:27:56,613 --> 00:27:58,574
you've got to think systemically and globally.

582
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:02,455
All right, we did it.

583
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,155
So we looked at three different concepts

584
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:07,656
to build worlds for different player types.

585
00:28:08,996 --> 00:28:12,437
And so before I wrap up, I want to leave you

586
00:28:12,477 --> 00:28:13,277
with some final thoughts.

587
00:28:14,474 --> 00:28:16,655
So the player category is their guidelines.

588
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,918
Each player is different and will not fit nicely

589
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:22,040
into each category like we want them to.

590
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,203
And most of us have player motivations

591
00:28:25,243 --> 00:28:26,844
that fall into multiple categories.

592
00:28:27,465 --> 00:28:29,126
So you can go find out what player type you are

593
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:31,008
on Quantic Foundry's website.

594
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:31,788
It's pretty cool.

595
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:38,242
And your job, my job, is to use these examples

596
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:38,962
of starting points.

597
00:28:39,402 --> 00:28:42,103
So this shouldn't be thought as complete solutions,

598
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:45,463
and it's the principles that are behind them that are important.

599
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:48,204
And think about who your target audience is

600
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:50,204
and what is most important for your game.

601
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:54,625
And don't forget to extrapolate beyond yourself.

602
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:57,465
So justify your design decisions by thinking

603
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,666
about which humans are for, and avoid using justification

604
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:02,546
like, this is cool, so we should do it.

605
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:03,746
That's the only reason why.

606
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,335
So, and lastly, world design, still in its infancy,

607
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,696
just like games, right?

608
00:29:10,756 --> 00:29:13,078
I'm excited to see where it'll go next

609
00:29:13,138 --> 00:29:14,160
as it changes all the time.

610
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,042
And I think this is especially true for,

611
00:29:17,763 --> 00:29:20,826
as the generation who grew up with games get older, like me.

612
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:24,915
And I think we'll see new genres and world design techniques

613
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:27,777
because players' motivations will change over time.

614
00:29:28,378 --> 00:29:30,840
And I believe that it'll be those designers who

615
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,982
see this and design for what people value most that

616
00:29:34,002 --> 00:29:35,203
will see success.

617
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:36,785
So thank you.
