1
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:07,350
I'm like, I made Secret Hitler along with,

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,153
I co-designed it with Tommy Meranges,

3
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:13,040
and then we produced it with Max Temkin,

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,144
and then Max Schubert did our art,

5
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:16,086
so I'm not the only guy.

6
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:20,191
So Secret Hitler.

7
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:22,413
How many of you, raise your hands if you know the basic

8
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:23,773
idea of Secret Hitler, how it works.

9
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:25,114
OK, a lot of you.

10
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:29,116
And then keep your hand up if you know Avalon also.

11
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:31,097
Just raise your hand if you've also played Avalon, because I

12
00:00:31,117 --> 00:00:31,677
referenced that a lot.

13
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:33,839
OK, so I'll just give you a real background real quick.

14
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:36,240
Secret Hitler is a social deduction game.

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,820
You can put your hand down.

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,701
No, thanks.

17
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:41,122
Secret Hitler is a social deduction game.

18
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:42,123
It's a hidden role game.

19
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:42,923
So you start the game.

20
00:00:42,963 --> 00:00:43,644
Everyone gets a role.

21
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:46,385
You get to see it, you can't show it to anybody else.

22
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:48,745
And then on In Secret Hitler, there's two teams.

23
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,406
There's liberals and fascists.

24
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:51,046
It's 1930s Germany.

25
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:54,067
The liberals don't get to have any extra information,

26
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:55,728
but at the start of the game during the night phase,

27
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:58,048
the fascists open their eyes, they identify each other,

28
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:59,509
so they know who the bad guys are,

29
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:00,409
they know who the good guys are.

30
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:02,590
Hitler doesn't get to open his eyes in the bigger games,

31
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,751
but he puts his thumb up so his buddies know who he is.

32
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,091
And the liberals don't know shit.

33
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:08,852
Just like real life.

34
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:10,868
I'm a liberal.

35
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,589
No, anyway, so the way the game works,

36
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,210
every round there's a two-player government.

37
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,511
There's a president and chancellor.

38
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:17,712
President placard moves around the table clockwise

39
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,073
and then they nominate a chancellor.

40
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:20,874
So they're like a president, vice president,

41
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:21,555
running mate a little bit.

42
00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:24,057
And then they get to enact a policy.

43
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:26,193
And that policy is either fascist or liberal.

44
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,076
There's a policy deck of 11 fascist cards,

45
00:01:29,116 --> 00:01:31,178
six liberal cards, president draws three cards,

46
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,961
discards one face down, passes the other to the chancellor,

47
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,023
chancellor also discards one face down,

48
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:38,266
and then the last one gets played face up.

49
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:40,628
And that's the card that everyone else gets to see,

50
00:01:40,648 --> 00:01:41,709
that's the card that gets enacted.

51
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,672
So the president gets the most information,

52
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:45,293
chancellor gets some information,

53
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:46,935
and everyone else only knows the card that comes out.

54
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,131
And then they judge the 2 based on whatever happened.

55
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:53,052
So the liberals won't pass 5 liberal policies to win the game.

56
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:55,553
The fascists want to pass 6 fascist policies to win the game.

57
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:58,033
And every time you pass a fascist policy,

58
00:01:58,113 --> 00:01:59,214
president gets to do crazy shit

59
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:02,015
because fascism is all about like getting power for the government.

60
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:07,117
So as fascism goes along, it increases in danger.

61
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:09,297
And once the first 3 fascist policies have been played,

62
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:11,838
if you ever elect Hitler chancellor after that point,

63
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:13,499
the game immediately ends in a fascist victory

64
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:14,979
because Hitler kills the president,

65
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:17,020
burns down the Reichstag and becomes fear for life.

66
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,964
So that's the historically accurate way for fascists to win.

67
00:02:21,564 --> 00:02:25,709
And then those two bullets, though, are the liberal antidote to Hitler.

68
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,953
If you pass a fascist policy on that bullet, you get to shoot somebody.

69
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:32,075
And if you shoot Hitler, fascists die with him.

70
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:36,139
Once those three fascist policies are out, it creates a really tense moment

71
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,962
where Hitler is trying to not die, but also trying to get into power.

72
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,632
So, okay, that's SecretHailer, that's how it works.

73
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:43,874
Now everyone knows how to play.

74
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:44,495
Great.

75
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:46,458
So, social justice games.

76
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:47,660
I'm not actually a board game guy.

77
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,663
It's funny, I've been coming to GDC for 10 years

78
00:02:49,863 --> 00:02:52,226
making video games, and I finally make a board game,

79
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:53,448
and that's when they invite me to come talk.

80
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,711
And I don't, I'm not super into board games.

81
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,091
And so when I moved to Chicago a few years ago

82
00:02:59,131 --> 00:03:00,732
and started hanging out with Cards Against Humanity guys,

83
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:03,273
and they got me into board games in a big way,

84
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,254
just hanging out with them, they're immersed in the culture.

85
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:06,714
And I got into Avalon.

86
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:08,415
I had played Werewolf before that,

87
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:10,416
so I knew kind of what social deduction was about,

88
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,317
but I hated Werewolf, Werewolf's a bad game.

89
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:14,657
But Avalon is beautiful and an amazing game.

90
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:16,878
And it really got me into the role-playing aspect of it,

91
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,419
which I thought was really, really cool.

92
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:30,505
I played D&D when I was a kid, but when you're playing D&D and you're trying to act like a dwarf with a beard and a huge axe and doing a weird voice and everyone else is just looking at you like you're an asshole, it's not a fun role-playing challenge for me.

93
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,546
But with Avalon...

94
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:37,031
you you're roleplaying is very very constrained if you're a bad player

95
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,714
anyway if you're a good player you're not roleplaying you're just trying to suss out who's good and who's bad

96
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:43,056
but the acting challenge of playing a bad character is so fun

97
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:45,618
uh... because it's so tightly constrained your actions are

98
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:49,802
are just throw this guy under the bus or claim that you didn't play that bad card

99
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,284
and it was really fun for me to try to get into that acting challenge

100
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:54,726
because i'm actually really like pretty introverted dude

101
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:56,107
and i don't uh...

102
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,110
lie to people or throw people under the bus in real life,

103
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,631
but when you're playing this game,

104
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:03,233
you can mess around with really negative social actions

105
00:04:03,393 --> 00:04:04,774
and it's okay and you're still friends

106
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:05,475
at the end of the game.

107
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:08,298
So that's, I really fell in love with Avalon

108
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:09,959
and actually Tommy and I were playing Avalon.

109
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:14,426
for about a month and we kind of agree that it was mostly a perfect game

110
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:18,407
because it's so simple, there's so few moving parts that

111
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:21,728
but it creates this rich experience of everyone kind of arguing and you really get into deep

112
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:26,109
conversations with people and you really, you know, kind of get to know people really well through this game.

113
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,549
We thought it was kind of perfect and couldn't be improved on

114
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,390
and so as a challenge we were like, hey let's make a better one.

115
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,631
And we tried and you get to judge if we did or not.

116
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,461
So our early inspiration was really based on taking Avalon

117
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,043
and then expanding on the things that we thought were

118
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:45,764
cool about it, and maybe taking away the things that we

119
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:46,164
didn't like.

120
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:50,348
But the really initial early builds of it, the ideas that

121
00:04:50,388 --> 00:04:52,069
we were tossing around were really pretty dry.

122
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,051
It was all really focused on mechanics.

123
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:57,314
And it wasn't until I watched Band of Brothers in like a

124
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:57,734
couple of years.

125
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:04,744
one sitting after we had given up on mechanics based approach that I started researching Hitler because Hitler is super interesting

126
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:08,329
Germany was relatively liberal country and he used the Democratic

127
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:15,522
system to turn it into a despotism, essentially, a totalitarian country.

128
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:19,923
I thought that was a really compelling, interesting, fertile ground for social deduction.

129
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:23,664
Using the democratic system against itself seemed like a compelling setting.

130
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:27,785
A lot of historical-based mechanics came directly out of that initial research.

131
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:32,426
Like the president-chancellor relationship, where the chancellor can betray the president.

132
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:34,905
that comes directly out of Hitler and Hindenburg,

133
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:37,146
and also the road to fascism,

134
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:38,406
the government getting more powerful

135
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:41,487
as more fascist policies came out of that historical,

136
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:43,668
slight Wikipedia research.

137
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:46,329
So the idea definitely came

138
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,010
from the historical setting of it.

139
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:53,679
So our design focus, and this is like me post-mortem

140
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,720
deciding what our design focus was a little bit,

141
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,641
but it was definitely focused on individual experiences

142
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:01,422
rather than creating a game that was like super balanced

143
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:03,463
or really accurate portrayal of history.

144
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,504
We wanted players who were playing the game

145
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,645
to be having really intense moments,

146
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:10,266
really personal moments and interactions with other players.

147
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,947
We wanted the drama to stay high throughout the whole game

148
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:15,308
and keep accelerating until the end of the game.

149
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:17,205
We didn't want it to slow down.

150
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:20,087
If one team got too far ahead and it just turned into kind of

151
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:21,889
a snowball, we didn't want the other players to feel like it

152
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:23,110
was kind of a foregone conclusion.

153
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,972
We wanted everyone to always feel like it was kind of on a

154
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:25,452
knife's edge.

155
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,355
And we wanted them to tell a really fun story every time

156
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,036
they played the game.

157
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:30,917
And it would come out a little bit differently each time.

158
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:33,039
And I didn't realize this until I was doing this talk,

159
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,122
but the game, when you're playing it, creates the

160
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:38,584
typical plot structure of rising action to the climax.

161
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:40,826
And the climax, this is the version for Secret Hitler.

162
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:44,227
but the whole game is the rising action.

163
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:47,329
Every time a fascist policy comes out, it gets more intense.

164
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:50,271
People get more suspicious and worried about what's going to happen to the government

165
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,733
until one side wins or the other side wins.

166
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:56,235
And in the end of the game, after it's over, everyone sticks around.

167
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:57,796
No one really leaves the table.

168
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:00,598
They keep drinking, they keep shouting about who was right, who was wrong.

169
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:03,039
And usually it's me, because I always am right.

170
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,161
And no one ever trusts me, even though I'm very good at this game.

171
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,398
So our path was definitely focused on two facets,

172
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:16,199
kind of the one-on-one drama of interpersonal interactions.

173
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:18,260
So we wanted to give a lot of moments

174
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,540
where people could betray each other.

175
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,401
And we also wanted to have the Hitler mechanic

176
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:23,662
be a personal decision.

177
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:25,442
So when you're president, you have,

178
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:27,323
and Hitler's active and can win the game.

179
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:30,999
you have to pick not Hitler and that's a very dramatic moment when especially

180
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:33,100
when you have no confirmed not Hitler's to pick from.

181
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:36,823
You have to pick out of this field of people, one of them is definitely Hitler

182
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,425
and will lose the game if you pick the wrong guy.

183
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:41,127
So it's a really tense moment for that person to go through.

184
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,809
But then we also want to focus on the dramatic tension throughout the whole game.

185
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:59,814
So Hitler is like this antagonist, shit I keep hitting the mic, Hitler is like this antagonist, he's like Jaws, he's kind of lurking in the darkness and he's always there, and as the game goes he gets more and more important to the story and it creates, it's a fun moment to try to, I don't know, shit.

186
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:05,818
The policy that we use if you're familiar with the game the policy that plays an important role

187
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:08,699
in shifting the balance of power between one team and the other team

188
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,000
and we also extend the climax. So I'm going to get to all those points later.

189
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,961
So the personal betrayal moments is the core of the game and that's the main thing that we took from Avalon.

190
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:22,903
I started playing Avalon and I really like the first mission, which is just a two-player mission.

191
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:29,369
So if you played Avalon, as you go, each mission gets larger in size and shrinks a little bit,

192
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,352
so the bad guys can kind of hide in the numbers.

193
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:34,116
But in that first mission, it's just you and one other person.

194
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:38,684
And when I started playing the game, the meta for our player group

195
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:41,105
had already resolved that, oh, the first mission is safe.

196
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:42,585
Like, you can't fail the first mission.

197
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,025
No one's ever going to fail that,

198
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:46,106
because it outs them immediately to the good player.

199
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:48,267
If you have a spy and a good player on that team,

200
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,307
you're never going to reveal yourself that quickly.

201
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:54,808
And so as kind of a dick, I wanted

202
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,829
to fail that initially, just to mess with their meta.

203
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,771
But also, I knew that if I went into that,

204
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:01,272
it would be a fun acting challenge for me.

205
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:02,652
I knew that I would have the rest of the game,

206
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,473
I would be fighting with this other person.

207
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:05,974
And when I did that the first time,

208
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:08,296
it was the best experience I had playing board games.

209
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:11,157
Because I knew what was happening,

210
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,179
and I knew that I had to act my ass off

211
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:13,879
for the rest of the game.

212
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:18,172
And it was way more intense and way more fun than just kind of like slowly playing and

213
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:22,156
biding my time. I really had to start, I started a conflict immediately and it was really engaging.

214
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,820
And I think it was fun for the other player too because she knew immediately that I had

215
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,663
betrayed her and that we were now in a fight and she had to fight for her life and profess

216
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:33,207
innocence for the rest of the game. So I thought that was really fun and I know it extended

217
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:37,511
that out to the entire game for Seeker Hitler. So every single round is that, has a potential

218
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:38,552
for that kind of interaction.

219
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:42,060
There's always going to be more for that direct betrayal which I think is really

220
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,940
fun and really is a part of why Secret Hiddler is great.

221
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:48,621
It also helps the Liberals

222
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:51,602
a little bit because every time you have a moment like that

223
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:56,103
where two players disagree, like in this diagram you have maybe A and B are in a

224
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:57,243
disagreement currently

225
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,284
and they're fighting over what they saw

226
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:03,485
and you've seen D and C have worked with A before and E and F have worked with B.

227
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:06,185
Now you get a lot of information to what the puzzle is.

228
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,025
And liberals need, they don't necessarily know who is right on that side,

229
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:13,347
but if they get another couple of interactions like that,

230
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:15,549
they sort of figure out the web of alliances that work in the game.

231
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,451
And so these direct one-on-one interactions create more information for the puzzle,

232
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,473
but you only get a few of them throughout the game.

233
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:24,735
Usually people just claim they drew three fascist cards when they do bad stuff.

234
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:28,638
But it's really fun to piece together the puzzle as a liberal.

235
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:32,577
So the other big thing that we wanted to take from Avalon,

236
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:36,421
but repurpose, because we thought it was strong but not necessarily perfect,

237
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,403
was the Avalon mechanic.

238
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:42,349
So in Resistance Avalon, Merlin is a character

239
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,172
who knows who all the bad guys are. He's on the good team,

240
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:49,057
but if he overplays his hand, he can get shot at the end of the game

241
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:49,938
and lose it for the good team.

242
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:55,790
We really like that he was a strong power for the for the good guys, but also

243
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,652
a vulnerability. But we didn't like that his death came at the end of the game.

244
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:04,334
So we wanted to invert that a little bit because it felt a little cheap. If you

245
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:07,215
only had like 3 players on your team, there's actually a good statistical

246
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:09,816
chance that he'll just get shot at random. And it feels a little cheap and

247
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:14,258
not very earned. So for Hitler, we inverted the concept and we took away

248
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:14,999
all this information.

249
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:20,872
And we also made him vulnerable throughout the whole game so that he can change the tide at any moment and it

250
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:26,335
Really ramped up the tension in the second half once he becomes active and he can die or get elected and win the game

251
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,075
for either team

252
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:31,518
It makes it more tense while the game still going on rather than kind of pulling the rug out of

253
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:33,307
under the good team after they've won.

254
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,589
And it also changes the dynamics of who you can trust.

255
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,810
It makes the game into kind of a two-act structure,

256
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,111
where in the first act, liberals and fascists

257
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,211
are just trying to get on the board,

258
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:44,452
trying to do some stuff, get some policies out,

259
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,193
and in the second half, liberals are locking it down,

260
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,694
and they have to figure out who is Hitler.

261
00:11:48,294 --> 00:11:50,175
And if you've done too many liberal policies,

262
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:51,255
you actually look worse,

263
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,596
because you've been set up by the fascist team

264
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:55,577
to look like a good guy who's gonna get elected.

265
00:11:58,454 --> 00:12:01,357
So, okay, those were the initial ideas

266
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:02,458
that we brought to the prototypes.

267
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:04,640
We took Avalon, we basically just took Avalon

268
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,863
and added that shit, and it was already really fun.

269
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:09,004
And how do we know it was fun?

270
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:13,008
So we were playtesting in the Cards Against Humanity office

271
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:15,291
and these guys were doing board games all day

272
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:17,012
and then we invited them to the conference room

273
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:18,113
and we bribed them with pizza

274
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:19,395
because every prototype is terrible.

275
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,683
and they would come and play for like another 2 hours and so they wouldn't

276
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:27,266
leave the office for like 10 hours and after the game is over they would stick

277
00:12:27,286 --> 00:12:29,788
around and keep telling stories of what happened throughout the game and they

278
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:32,970
would love to regale you know fascist would talk about the close calls where

279
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,892
they almost got caught liberals would love to admit mistakes and there's

280
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:39,675
always one liberal who knew who all the bad guys were and that was me and no

281
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:40,196
one trust me.

282
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:46,000
But we had to figure out why it was working and Tommy and I took some time to

283
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,401
focus

284
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:49,943
down what our design was really doing well.

285
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:54,432
and we thought that it was focusing on personal conflicts and ramping up tension.

286
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:57,053
We weren't focusing on creating a really balanced game

287
00:12:57,574 --> 00:13:01,255
or one that definitely was synchronized in actions.

288
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,676
We wanted one where everyone had options

289
00:13:04,636 --> 00:13:07,718
and it felt like it was a story that was kind of going back and forth

290
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:10,659
and ended in a reasonable, interesting conclusion for everybody.

291
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:16,126
And the main way that we kept it interesting as we went was through the policy deck.

292
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:20,510
The policy deck was originally going to be just a way for fascists to hide bad actions

293
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:23,092
because in Avalon you have the increasing team size,

294
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:27,536
but we wanted to create that really fun two-player dynamic of president and chancellor throughout the whole game.

295
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:29,738
So in order for fascists to have a way to hide,

296
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:33,001
we needed to have them be able to blame it on a random deck.

297
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:36,864
And we were initially just going to have a static draw chance.

298
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:42,976
and we would replenish the deck after every round so it was only like a 30% chance or whatever to draw a liberal policy.

299
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:47,210
But what we found was that if you let it deplete itself,

300
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,752
and let, like, if one team gets ahead,

301
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:51,153
their cards come out of the deck too much,

302
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:53,394
it sets up a really interesting dramatic tension.

303
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:55,996
And so, like, you can have a board that looks like this,

304
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,256
where the liberals are way ahead,

305
00:13:57,657 --> 00:13:58,577
and a newbie might be like,

306
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,639
oh, well, we only need one policy, this is gonna be easy.

307
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,019
You go back to the same values we trust,

308
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,460
and we'll get this last one out.

309
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,402
But in reality, the deck looks terrible,

310
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:08,704
and you're going to have a full liberal team

311
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:10,165
draw three fascist policies,

312
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,946
and that inevitably completely upsets the trust balance.

313
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:15,348
So this creates a really, really interesting

314
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,090
rubber banding a little bit

315
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,851
that lets both teams always feel like they have a chance.

316
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,532
So fascists won't see this and be like,

317
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:24,994
well, I guess the game's over, I'm just going to quit.

318
00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:26,895
They will have that lie ready.

319
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:28,776
So when that fascist policy comes up,

320
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:29,857
they can jump on it and be like,

321
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:33,819
you guys did it, I know you had to play that fascist

322
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,561
and just create an upset balance

323
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:37,522
because fascists win when chaos takes over.

324
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:41,871
And so the deck is actually like the hardest thing we had to balance.

325
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:46,012
We started with 6 liberal cards and 10 fascist cards

326
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:48,173
and we were just like throwing numbers at the wall.

327
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:49,154
We didn't know what we were doing.

328
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:52,175
We knew we wanted 6 liberal policies

329
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,996
so that you could miss one policy and still win the game.

330
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:57,177
But as far as the number of fascist policies,

331
00:14:57,217 --> 00:14:58,357
we had no idea what we were doing.

332
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:01,459
10 seemed reasonable and it was fun at the time.

333
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,621
But then we added 2 more policies just to make the numbers round

334
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:07,761
because that seemed like a good thing to do.

335
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:13,326
And we played a game, a playtest at the Red Line, which is a pub in Chicago.

336
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,489
And it was a terrible night. I played, I got liberal, I got liberal three times in a row.

337
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,472
And I had no idea what was going on. It was madness.

338
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:24,234
We lost every game. I don't even think it was close.

339
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,497
And I was so despondent by it that on the ride home...

340
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:31,160
after the game I thought that Secret Hitler might be just completely broken

341
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,282
or the policy deck was a bad idea in general

342
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:37,226
because I know that randomness has the potential to create bad streaks

343
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:39,748
and I thought that maybe it was inevitable

344
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,890
that people were going to have a terrible experience playing Secret Hitler.

345
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,152
But then we changed it to 6 to 11 and it was fine.

346
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:46,754
So I don't know why 6-11 is the good balance.

347
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:52,418
But sometimes, I mean, that's the value of playtest is you

348
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:53,478
try it out and you see what works.

349
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:57,639
And my brain wants to add that last fascist policy to make it

350
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,000
a nice, even square.

351
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,840
But this one works.

352
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:02,161
And it's just magic, and I'm not going

353
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:03,041
to question it anymore.

354
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:06,582
And it has all sorts of interesting issues.

355
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:08,983
Like once you've played the first five cards, there's two

356
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:10,664
left that you can never see, and you have

357
00:16:10,684 --> 00:16:11,384
to reshuffle them.

358
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:15,505
Just a lot of weird, natural issues that make card counting

359
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:17,086
difficult and make the game more interesting.

360
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:18,406
So I have no idea why this works, but

361
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:19,007
it works really well.

362
00:16:21,006 --> 00:16:24,480
So Hitler is the bad guy of our game. He's a very bad man. We don't want him to win.

363
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:29,920
And Hitler as an active threat is the most important part of the second act of the game.

364
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,620
The game really works in two acts.

365
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,722
As the action is slowly rising after each fascist policy, all of a sudden Hitler becomes active

366
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:39,902
and everyone locks down and has to figure out who's good and who's bad

367
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:42,523
because if you put the wrong guy in government you lose the game instantly.

368
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,904
And that's the main way that fascists win is by electing Hitler.

369
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,725
So maintaining that threat of Hitler as the bad guy

370
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:52,126
was a very important part of keeping the second half of the game interesting.

371
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:55,770
because liberals will do everything to try to circumvent

372
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,030
Hitler's power and and lockdown power within a small number of trusted players

373
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,171
and so we had to do a few things to keep that keep them reaching out to new

374
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:04,491
players

375
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,372
and always trying different new chancellors because that moment where you

376
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:09,372
elect someone chancellor

377
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:13,073
and at the table has to ask them are you Hitler and you wait for them to say yes

378
00:17:13,113 --> 00:17:13,353
or no

379
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:16,694
is the most tense part of the game and we wanted them to have to do that a few times

380
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:18,994
because it's just it's fun to have to

381
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:23,510
have them shout in your face yes or say no in a relieving way.

382
00:17:25,268 --> 00:17:29,030
So the ways we did that were presidential succession works as a natural way of like

383
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,193
eventually one of your confirmed not-Hitler chancellors will have to play as a president

384
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:34,994
and then you have to find someone else.

385
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:39,997
We also have the term limits which were put in place specifically to keep people from

386
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:42,979
going back to the well of trusted liberals each time.

387
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,081
So if you're the president or chancellor on the last round you can't be elected the next

388
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:49,263
round so you have to keep reaching out to new players.

389
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:53,645
And also the fascists usually have the assassination power because you have to play fascist policy

390
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:54,226
to be able to do it.

391
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:58,087
and they will often kill confirmed not-Hitlers in order to gain,

392
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:01,849
get another chance at putting Hitler on the chancellorship ticket.

393
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,991
So the final thing that we did to make sure, oh shit, I'm going so fast.

394
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:11,153
The final thing that we did to make sure that the game stayed interesting

395
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:13,514
up until the end of the game was to extend the runway.

396
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:17,828
with the veto power. So the veto power is really interesting

397
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,074
in that it gives liberals a last chance once the fifth

398
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:27,480
fascist policy has been played, they get an opportunity to throw away a triple

399
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,261
fascist draw.

400
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:31,985
Which is great for the liberals because if you get a full liberal team

401
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:34,888
it's like, oh dope, we can get rid of these cards, we don't have to lose.

402
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:38,412
keep going because we don't ever want the deck to win the game for the fascists.

403
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,674
We want the fascists to get in there.

404
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:42,557
But the problem is that now they have to pick a new team.

405
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:44,139
Those two players who are clearly liberal,

406
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,541
who just played or just got rid of three fascist cards,

407
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:49,124
they're unavailable now thanks to term limits.

408
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:52,128
So you have to once again go out into the wilderness and find new players

409
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,692
because we... and then you're almost always going to pick at least one fascist for that team.

410
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:59,894
And because that's way more fun to have a fascist actually screw over a player.

411
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:03,756
Because when you have, our dream game was that you get to the last possible veto

412
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,978
and you have a liberal president and a fascist chancellor and the president's like,

413
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:10,840
hey we can veto and the chancellor's like, no man, I'm going to win the game.

414
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,022
And we dreamt about that for like a month before we finally actually got to play it

415
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:17,903
because it's pretty rare but it's a lot of fun.

416
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:22,253
So we always wanted the game to focus on giving fascists a

417
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:24,154
chance to actually betray people.

418
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:26,796
We didn't want it to be a natural loss for liberals, and

419
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:28,477
we didn't want the liberals to just trip over themselves.

420
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:31,158
We want the fascists to get in the game and actually screw

421
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:31,679
people over.

422
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:37,422
That's the graph of the tension, once people realize

423
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:37,863
they can veto.

424
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:44,455
Okay, so the general takeaway that I want you to come from

425
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:47,497
with this talk is that I don't think that you can actually be

426
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:48,298
good at Secret Hitler.

427
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,941
We had a lot of people early on at BoardGameGeek telling us

428
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,982
that Avalon was way better because it's more

429
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:56,364
deterministic and the randomness of Secret Hitler

430
00:19:56,384 --> 00:19:57,405
makes it impossible to win.

431
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:59,387
And I at first disagreed and was angry,

432
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:03,610
but now I actually kind of agree because I don't think

433
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,732
that you can be good because the game is so random

434
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,493
and there's so much self-balancing going on.

435
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:12,159
that if you get too far ahead you're eventually going to get rubber banded

436
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:12,419
back

437
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,121
uh... and that almost every time you play the game it conforms to this

438
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,002
plot structure which i just think is more interesting though and that's that's

439
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:22,783
the real take away is that i don't think being good at secret hitler is important

440
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:25,844
uh... i think as long as people play the game and they have fun and they have a

441
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:27,885
really engaging experience and they come away with this

442
00:20:28,305 --> 00:20:30,666
interesting story of twists and turns and betrayals

443
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:35,046
all that that's all that matters is the experience whether or not you have a

444
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:38,107
good win ratio is not interesting we thought about how could you do it

445
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:41,468
secret or tournament and I don't think it's possible one because of the teams

446
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:43,169
are in balance but to it's just

447
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:47,470
we focus on creating interesting experiences for you go through

448
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,271
I'm not necessarily a chess like deterministic game

449
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:53,292
and that's why I think it's good

450
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:56,713
a secret and that's all I got

451
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:07,630
We have a lot of time for questions, because I totally

452
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,290
ran through that.

453
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:11,694
So if anybody has any, I'm happy to answer.

454
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:16,958
So I'm curious, since you guys obviously built the game and

455
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:18,840
worked on the rules, if you encountered this in play

456
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,663
testing, but we've seen a lot, especially with new players.

457
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,811
the person explaining the rules always definitely organically seems to be like

458
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:30,133
the most trustworthy even though they're often not yeah, and is that something

459
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:33,574
that you felt was a problem with the matter or something you just was like

460
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:36,375
this is kind of cool let's run with it not try to fix it.

461
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:40,937
I I think it's inevitable I do think that okay, I actually had that it

462
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:43,678
covered in the talk a little bit, but I do think you can be good at secret

463
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:45,839
Hitler in that you know the probabilities a little bit you know how

464
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:51,362
the game works and I played at Pax when we were initially prototyping it.

465
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:56,038
and I play like 30 games and I only lost one because it was just playing with new

466
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:58,900
players. So that's definitely true and it's definitely an issue and it's

467
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,181
especially true for me like I know that better than everyone else because I can

468
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:03,142
just pull out the I made this game

469
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:04,343
excuse.

470
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,705
But I don't know if it's a problem or not. I don't know if that's solvable.

471
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,726
I didn't try to solve it.

472
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,721
we just tried to make the rules as clear as possible.

473
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:17,141
And we have the video explaining the rules,

474
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:18,982
so we're hoping that people get it to speed quickly.

475
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:20,963
And I think after two or three games,

476
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:23,484
people kind of glom onto the idea well enough

477
00:22:23,504 --> 00:22:24,824
that they know what kind of lies they can make

478
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,025
and what kind of lies they can't make.

479
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:28,846
Yeah, that kind of fades when you have a group

480
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,086
that plays together for a little bit.

481
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:31,247
It seems like with new players,

482
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:32,827
it's always the case that people gravitate

483
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,788
towards trusting the guy that explains.

484
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:36,669
And we were playing at the Cards office,

485
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,270
so we had tons of board game interested people to play with.

486
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,630
And so we definitely got tunnel vision.

487
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,971
We were focusing on experience level.

488
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:45,374
play, first and foremost, the people at the office

489
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:47,756
have played hundreds of times, so I definitely

490
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:50,318
didn't think too much about the new player experience.

491
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:50,918
Cool, thanks.

492
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:53,830
Hi, thanks for all the fun.

493
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,570
Thanks.

494
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,751
I read an article that you sent a copy of the game

495
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:58,691
to the US senators.

496
00:22:58,791 --> 00:22:58,911
Yeah.

497
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:00,652
Is it true, and have you heard back?

498
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:05,074
No, Max is kinda tied in with the Democratic,

499
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:08,255
he worked for Obama's campaign,

500
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,376
so he has been hearing some stuff.

501
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:13,817
I've just been reading on Slack while at GDC,

502
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,578
because we put that out on Thursday,

503
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:17,398
so they haven't gotten the packages yet as far as I know.

504
00:23:17,418 --> 00:23:18,819
But yeah, we'll see, I don't know.

505
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,719
Great, thank you.

506
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:20,420
It's been crazy, thanks.

507
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:27,524
So I actually really like the idea that you cannot be really good at Secret Hiddler so that the experience is more...

508
00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:31,466
It's nice for my ego too, like I feel very good saying that.

509
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:37,329
But what I'm wondering about is that you mentioned that the game self-balances and so on and so forth.

510
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:41,711
Is there a relatively equal win ratio for...

511
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:46,233
It is, yeah. Actually we put out the print and play during the Kickstarter

512
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:48,754
and we asked for people to reply back.

513
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,878
telling us who won, how often they won,

514
00:23:51,938 --> 00:23:53,640
how often they played, and who won.

515
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,883
And we found out that early games,

516
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:57,485
Hitler gets killed sometimes,

517
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,148
but then after really early on,

518
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:00,189
Hitler never gets killed again,

519
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:01,631
after you've played like two times,

520
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:03,173
because Hitler figures out he should shut the hell up.

521
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:03,874
And then...

522
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:07,643
And then we also found that it's a really even balance.

523
00:24:08,164 --> 00:24:11,507
But I do think that some groups will swing fascist

524
00:24:11,547 --> 00:24:14,670
or liberal depending on what the individual skills are.

525
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,333
So I think overall, like worldwide, it's pretty balanced,

526
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:19,855
but that might not be true for your specific game group.

527
00:24:20,516 --> 00:24:21,337
But I don't really know.

528
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:21,998
And we also don't care.

529
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:23,879
Like if you're having fun, I don't really care who wins.

530
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:26,502
I clearly want the liberals to win, but.

531
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:28,304
Okay, thanks.

532
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:28,965
Thanks.

533
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:37,347
Hey, so this is completely hypothetical, but you mentioned you've done a lot of game design in the computer or, you know, electronic space.

534
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:38,067
Yeah.

535
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:45,693
Thinking about games with secret or hidden roles, it feels like a critical component of that is the in-person interaction.

536
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:46,754
Totally.

537
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:54,240
If you wanted to translate that experience into a computer game sort of, you know, remote interaction multiplayer situation,

538
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,963
what do you think are the critical things you would need to think about to make that work?

539
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,930
Well, it's really, really tough.

540
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,931
Honestly, there are like three different versions of Seeker Hitler that you can play online.

541
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:06,452
One is on Tabletop Simulator.

542
00:25:06,992 --> 00:25:09,573
It's like the most popular thing on Tabletop Simulator right now.

543
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:14,375
And it's annoying because it's terrible to play without facial recognition.

544
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:16,916
Like, reading another player is a huge part of social deduction.

545
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:21,197
I think that you can get away with other forms of information in Seeker Hitler,

546
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:24,078
but like, I don't even know why you play that.

547
00:25:24,098 --> 00:25:25,759
So we don't like support that or want to do that.

548
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:30,468
And I guess there's VR, the eye tracking stuff that's coming

549
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:32,530
out, maybe some facial recognition stuff.

550
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,230
But without that face, I don't want to play it.

551
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,052
I'm thinking less about translating Secret Hitler into

552
00:25:37,092 --> 00:25:40,073
a video game and more about designing a game specifically

553
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:42,415
to support that kind of hidden role stuff.

554
00:25:42,595 --> 00:25:42,835
Sure.

555
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:46,937
Yeah, well you've got to get away on a lot of voice stuff.

556
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:49,378
You could definitely design a game around it, I'm sure.

557
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:52,220
Like there are plenty of games that are about hidden

558
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,200
identities online.

559
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,501
But I haven't played a whole lot.

560
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:55,361
Thanks.

561
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:56,577
Sorry.

562
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:00,703
Hi, this is a question about matching theme to mechanics.

563
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:01,083
Sure.

564
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:02,866
So imagine it's April 2016

565
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:05,970
and you're making a game called Secret Trump.

566
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,352
and there are six Republican nominees,

567
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:12,692
but no one knows which one is the Donald Trump.

568
00:26:13,753 --> 00:26:15,753
I think we all knew who the Donald Trump was,

569
00:26:15,793 --> 00:26:17,054
and everybody knew who Hitler was.

570
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:21,095
So what's your justification for doing a hidden,

571
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:24,737
nasty person in a political intrigue context?

572
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:27,438
So the metaphor is that like you...

573
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:30,136
People right now are saying,

574
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,737
well, don't say Trump is like Hitler.

575
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:33,738
Hitler put people in concentration camps

576
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:34,758
and Trump hasn't done that yet.

577
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:36,900
Well, clearly we would like to identify Hitler

578
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,681
before he puts people in concentration camps

579
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:39,361
is what I feel like.

580
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,162
So clearly you're not gonna know Hitler

581
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:44,304
because he's named Adolf Hitler.

582
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:46,225
Like the next one's not gonna be named Adolf Hitler.

583
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:47,065
So the metaphor is like.

584
00:26:47,891 --> 00:26:50,892
supposed to be a little more fluid than that.

585
00:26:51,252 --> 00:26:54,954
In that this game is really more about identifying liars

586
00:26:55,154 --> 00:26:58,455
and figuring out who is bullshitting you

587
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:00,256
and just trying to tell you what you want to hear.

588
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:03,037
And that's what we hope people get from it,

589
00:27:03,418 --> 00:27:04,398
is to be a little more skeptical

590
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:05,418
about the political process.

591
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:06,579
Like at the highest level,

592
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:07,579
that's what I want people to take.

593
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,780
And I don't expect us to change the world or anything.

594
00:27:11,918 --> 00:27:13,599
cool so that was an awesome talk thank you very much

595
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,481
uh... i remember when secret hitler came out it just exploded onto the scene and

596
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:19,262
everybody who's playing board games is like

597
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:21,503
you've absolutely got to play this game

598
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:23,945
was any kind of deliberate marketing

599
00:27:24,485 --> 00:27:26,106
strategy that you used to get it out

600
00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:27,707
uh... cars against humanity

601
00:27:28,027 --> 00:27:28,608
facebook page

602
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:32,995
that we've got if you don't know Max Temkin is a co-creator country's

603
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:37,999
humanity and he's a friend of mine and he wanted to help me make the game.

604
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,282
And so he used his might and like the senator, the sending games to senators

605
00:27:42,302 --> 00:27:45,905
like that's we've got a ton of press in the past week from that.

606
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,006
And that's all Max is a genius.

607
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:48,907
Like he put

608
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:56,970
Super Bowl ad was just a potato that said advertisement on it. So like he's crazy and comes up with insane ideas and stunts

609
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:03,652
So that's I don't have it. Nobody. I can't reproduce Max Temkin for everyone else. Can I ask one quick follow-up?

610
00:28:03,692 --> 00:28:07,353
Yeah, she's the print and play. Do you think that helped because yeah

611
00:28:07,373 --> 00:28:10,454
I thought there was lots of print and play then people like I've got to buy this game

612
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:12,545
Yeah, I think it's just good for spread.

613
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:14,086
Like, it's a terrible way to play,

614
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,988
and the components for the full game are so nice

615
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:19,150
that I feel like it's an obvious upsell.

616
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,671
Like, you get real wooden placards.

617
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:22,672
They're so fun to throw around at people.

618
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:26,235
So I think it lets the game spread,

619
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:27,916
and like, Cards Against Humanity did that too,

620
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:30,118
and they're hugely successful,

621
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:32,319
so I don't think it cuts into our sales at all.

622
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:33,380
I think it just spreads the word.

623
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:35,161
Cool, cheers. Thanks.

624
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:37,363
Yeah, thanks for sharing.

625
00:28:37,403 --> 00:28:39,505
It's really cool to see what went on behind the scenes.

626
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:45,046
The process of making this game, you say it's the first board game you've made?

627
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:45,567
Yeah.

628
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:46,208
Yeah.

629
00:28:46,488 --> 00:28:52,575
I'm curious about what did you discover about yourself and in the process of this game,

630
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:54,317
and what are you going to do next?

631
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:56,099
It was real natural.

632
00:28:57,925 --> 00:28:59,246
the game design concepts were

633
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:02,209
I just use the same process I use in video games, but

634
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:04,430
the turnaround was just a day instead of

635
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:07,072
like a week or a month to try something out, like

636
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:09,294
we would play test it, people would tell us what the shit

637
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:11,156
and we're using a ton of, like, Cards Against Mania

638
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:12,817
has published a bunch of games, so we would just

639
00:29:12,997 --> 00:29:14,418
steal games from the shelf and like

640
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:16,300
repurpose their components for our components.

641
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,420
And so like the turnaround on changing an idea was so quick.

642
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:24,242
It was very similar to developing a video game in process,

643
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,322
but it was just so much faster

644
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:27,322
that we got it done really, really quickly.

645
00:29:27,403 --> 00:29:29,323
Like it was a month and we had a really solid game.

646
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,744
So yeah, I don't know if I wanna make another board game.

647
00:29:33,664 --> 00:29:34,684
I haven't had any good ideas.

648
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:36,985
So that's kind of the key for me.

649
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:38,905
I'm messing with VR now, we'll see.

650
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:47,085
So there was a question earlier about what the senators did,

651
00:29:47,145 --> 00:29:49,287
and Max had tweeted about it just like literally minutes

652
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:50,087
before you started your talk.

653
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:50,688
Yeah, I saw that.

654
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:51,228
Yeah, it was like,

655
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,589
a pitted staffers against one another

656
00:29:52,689 --> 00:29:53,650
on both sides of the aisle

657
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,851
over who would get to keep their copy.

658
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:56,212
Yeah, I don't know if that means

659
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:57,333
they got the packages already,

660
00:29:57,353 --> 00:29:58,774
because a lot of people were telling us

661
00:29:58,794 --> 00:30:00,015
they don't even open their packages,

662
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:02,036
and so we'll probably just get them all back,

663
00:30:02,056 --> 00:30:03,477
which is like, that's fine with me.

664
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:04,218
We've got a ton of press,

665
00:30:04,258 --> 00:30:05,098
and we get our gains back.

666
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,459
That's free press, right?

667
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:11,922
But yeah, it seems like he has connections on the hill,

668
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:14,483
so he'll actually know before anybody else.

669
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,063
Yeah, really well done.

670
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,424
The production quality is incredible.

671
00:30:17,564 --> 00:30:17,944
Thank you.

672
00:30:18,044 --> 00:30:20,805
Yeah, we're really happy with it.

673
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:21,185
Hello.

674
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:22,085
Thank you for your talk.

675
00:30:22,185 --> 00:30:22,965
It was very interesting.

676
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:24,866
Thank you.

677
00:30:24,886 --> 00:30:28,827
We both agree that I think the fun is the most important factor.

678
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:33,148
So did you maybe spend more time on balancing fun

679
00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:34,869
instead of balancing the game?

680
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:35,609
Yeah.

681
00:30:36,891 --> 00:30:38,333
I probably ran through this in the talk too quickly,

682
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:41,856
but our focus was, Tommy and I sat down,

683
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:43,558
we were like, what are we gonna focus on?

684
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:46,081
And it's clearly high tension moments,

685
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:48,023
like creating moments where you have to make

686
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:49,204
a really difficult decision,

687
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:51,446
and you have a little bit of information on each side,

688
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:53,108
but you don't know which way to go.

689
00:30:53,128 --> 00:30:55,411
Yeah, I mean, because I think for me personally,

690
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:56,512
I think playing the,

691
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:01,044
fascist that is maybe more interesting because you can create all the chaos.

692
00:31:01,744 --> 00:31:05,625
I think it's more interesting for new players because lying is just immediately fun,

693
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:09,166
but I think it's really satisfying to play as a liberal too,

694
00:31:09,226 --> 00:31:11,826
just because the puzzle is kind of solvable.

695
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:14,927
Like it's almost, you almost have enough information to put it together

696
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:17,008
and I feel really good when I do that.

697
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:18,708
Thank you very much.

698
00:31:18,728 --> 00:31:19,188
Thanks.

699
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:21,089
Cool.

700
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:24,269
Alright, that seems like it's it.

701
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:25,710
Thanks everybody.
