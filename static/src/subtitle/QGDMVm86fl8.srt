00:00:03,247 --> 00:00:04,028
Hi, I'm Meg...

2
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:04,188
Pfft!

3
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:06,690
I'm Meg Giant and...

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,091
Pfft!

5
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:10,493
Hi, I'm Meg Giant, I'm a writer, a narrative designer,

6
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:13,416
I wrote 80 Days and I'm currently working on Sable

7
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:17,239
and I am so honoured to be your host for the IGF Awards this year.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,700
I can't wait to see you there. ðŸŽµ

9
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,479
Hey there, my name is Lach from Bazook Studio.

10
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,620
We made a little game called Just Shapes and Beats.

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,502
It's a game that goes a little bit like...

12
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:02,002
Wait for it...

13
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:03,343
THIS!

14
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:12,309
I'm very proud to say that we got nominated for the IGF Award 2019

15
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:14,770
in Excellence in Visual Art.

16
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,632
So, thank you very much and I hope to see you there!

17
00:01:22,977 --> 00:01:26,580
And my game, Grace Brooks and it Presents, The Haunted Island, a Frog Detective game,

18
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,302
is nominated in the student category of the IGFs.

19
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:31,284
So you have to come and watch.

20
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:37,148
At ThruLine Games, we are deeply honoured by the nomination for Excellence in Visual Art

21
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:39,350
at this year's Independent Games Festival.

22
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,094
Forgotten Anne's painstakingly hand-animated aesthetic is an homage to traditional animation methods,

23
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:49,598
and we're thrilled that so many of you appreciate the effort that went into making it.

24
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,080
We loved every second of the process.

25
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:56,281
We hope to see you all at the Pavilion in San Francisco, March 20th to 22nd,

26
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:00,523
where you can give Forgotten Anne, among a myriad other excellent nominees, a try.

27
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:03,784
Hi, we are part of the Do Not Be The Monkeys team,

28
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:08,906
and we're really honored that our game is a finalist at the IGF Awards,

29
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,087
with so many cool games we admire.

30
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:18,152
This is going to be our first time at IGF, so it's going to be an amazing experience for all of us.

31
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:21,874
We're really, really excited. So thanks a lot, and see you in San Francisco.

32
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,976
Hello, we are Gossamer Games.

33
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:31,620
We couldn't be more thrilled that Our Game Soul has been nominated for Best Student Game at IGF 2019.

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,324
Over the past few years, we've been hard at work on a deeply personal game that captures our emotional struggle as young artists.

35
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:44,605
We're so proud to be representing Drexel University, our home city of Philadelphia,

36
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:50,166
and its amazing indie community, without whom none of this would be possible. It is an honor

37
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:54,567
to be included in such an incredible list of nominees, and we hope you'll join us at this

38
00:02:54,607 --> 00:03:03,989
year's show. Thank you. Hi, I'm Geoffrof, founder of NovaVox and the writer of Sears Island. I'm

39
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,669
Nicolas, and I invented the art of Sears Island.

40
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:14,616
Sears Isle is an interactive graphic novel, or if you prefer you can call it a visual novel.

41
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:21,220
We are very happy that our game was nominated for the Excellence in Narrative Award at the Independent Game Festival.

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,822
We will have blessed meeting you all there, please come and visit us and try the game.

43
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:27,423
I can't wait to meet you there!

44
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,830
What The Golf

45
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:00,053
I'm Evan Greenwood.

46
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:01,573
And I'm Robbie Fraser.

47
00:04:01,894 --> 00:04:06,576
We're part of the team that works on General Adjusting here at Free Lives in South Africa.

48
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:11,098
Our game has been nominated for excellence in narrative, which is super exciting.

49
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:14,619
We're traveling all the way from South Africa to be at the ceremony.

50
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,641
We've been going many years just sitting in the crowd watching other people

51
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:23,143
walk on stage and get awards and be talked about and this year it's us!

52
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:28,106
Come to GDC, watch the IGF awards on stream if you can't be there.

53
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:28,546
Do it.

54
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,823
I'm Jeremy Gable, the creator of Watch Me Jump, which is nominated for the Excellence

55
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:40,883
in Narrative Award.

56
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:45,446
I'm thrilled and shocked to be nominated.

57
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:50,749
Watch Me Jump is the first game that I ever made, and the fact that the IGF sees something

58
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:54,651
in this micro-budget adventure proves why I love indie games.

59
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,893
Even when the resources are limited, it's the passion that shines through.

60
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:03,476
Wait, no, no, don't!

61
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:05,556
Come on!

62
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:08,979
En garde!

63
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:14,784
Greetings and salutations!

64
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:20,448
I am Julien Finoglio, and I would like to thank you on behalf of my companions and brothers in arms

65
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:23,511
for nominating En Garde as Best Student Game.

66
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:27,454
Since publishing our prototype, the reception has been tremendously good.

67
00:05:27,554 --> 00:05:29,176
The greatest video game ever made!

68
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:32,518
God bless you, game developer! God bless you!

69
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:34,000
If you have ever dreamt of panache...

70
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:38,104
of swashing buckles, arrowing flings and darting yawns.

71
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:49,187
Come try our game at the Independent Games Festival.

72
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:51,267
Hello.

73
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:54,228

IGF Awards.

78
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:09,710
Please come along and see it.

79
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:11,811
Or tune in.

80
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:13,932
On the internet.

81
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:17,575
And also see it.

82
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:35,562
Hmm, huh, hmm, oh, but I...

83
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:39,584
Hmm, one, whoa, one, I'm ha-ha.

84
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:41,265
Ooh, what I got? Ooh.

85
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:42,006
One, I'm ha-ha.

86
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:43,126
Ah-ha, eh, nom-a-te.
