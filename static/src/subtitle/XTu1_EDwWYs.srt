00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:08,299
Hello, I'm JJ, producer of UNO.

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,222
Today, I'm going to introduce the UX work of UNO

3
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:14,784
with our UX design leader, Sissy.

4
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,188
Before I start, I want to ask you a question.

5
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:21,190
Have you heard of UNO?

6
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,913
I believe most of you have played the UNO cards.

7
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:30,457
UNO board game was invented in 1971,

8
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:34,620
then has been enjoying its 40-year-long popularity.

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,612
And we just launched our UNO mobile game in 2019.

10
00:00:41,393 --> 00:00:45,435
The mobile game is a new platform for UNO.

11
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:51,839
It allows us to play UNO at any time even without carrying a deck of cards.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,642
After UNO mobile game launched in 150 countries,

13
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:04,486
we found 93% of UNO mobile game players have played other versions of UNO.

14
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:12,097
Obviously, most of the players are actually fans of classic UNO and very familiar with UNO.

15
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:21,523
This number really shocked us, but it also proved that we were using the right design approach in the development process.

16
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:27,808
So, what have we done to give players the classic and unique UNO?

17
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:33,912
And finally, make it available to players to play UNO all over the world.

18
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:42,970
We encountered some problems but finally found the corresponding solutions.

19
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:52,316
Next, Cici will talk about their UX strategies to adapt the classic UNO to mobile.

20
00:01:56,598 --> 00:02:02,202
Hello, I'm Cici. Let's talk about our design journey from a few keywords.

21
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:03,843
First, cars.

22
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:14,923
Initially, we arranged the cards in a tiled way, but it's a rigid design that makes you feel like you are playing with a robot.

23
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:24,769
Of course, this version of the design is very simple, quickly implemented, and the cost is very low.

24
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:29,211
Once the core gameplay has been verified,

25
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:35,134
We began to modify the way how cards present.

26
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:41,179
We need to study how players hold cards when playing Uno board games.

27
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:49,806
To tackle this problem, we organized a group of players to play Uno, and designers came

28
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:51,067
to observe them.

29
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:53,949
Then we took a photo like this.

30
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,492
Then the players hold cards.

31
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:04,090
Because of the palm structure and posture, the card will show a certain arc,

32
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:11,375
and in order to prevent opponents from picking, they will turn their hands sideways.

33
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:16,018
But cards in our game are laid directly on the table.

34
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,821
In real life, it's impossible to have such a situation,

35
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:26,325
because from this perspective we can't see the front of the card.

36
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,874
We tried to use law of closure to design the layout of cards.

37
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:40,440
When we find ourselves looking at 3D cards, it's natural to think of a hand holding them,

38
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:45,264
because it can remind us of playing Uno with our friends.

39
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:55,753
So we made an important decision, designing the cards in 3D on a table as if someone were holding them.

40
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:06,194
This took us a lot of development costs, but it's worth it, and the final effect is very nice.

41
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:16,861
After we solved the problem of holding cards, we started to look at the user interactions in different modes.

42
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:22,505
This is 2v2 mode and I can see my teammates' cards.

43
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:28,558
But when my teammate has a lot of cards, how can I see them clearly?

44
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:39,081
Tap to enlarge your teammate's card directly, or slow down and using the previous design approach.

45
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:45,862
Continue to study the behavior of Uno board game players when they are playing cards.

46
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:49,963
This is a picture of a player holding a hand of cards.

47
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:58,630
When playing Uno board game, people are used to deciding which color to play first, then

48
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:05,635
holding a visually-focused card close to themselves and picking it out individually.

49
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:13,039
We learned from Uno board game and designed our mobile game card viewing experience.

50
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,604
Just tap on the cards of your teammate, and the touched cards will be held by an invisible hand.

51
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:28,168
We let the four surrounding cards be lifted at the same time for comparison purpose.

52
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:39,315
After solving the card problem, make the core gameplay smooth becomes the next problem to be solved.

53
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:48,101
Uno's Corning Uno is the most exciting part of playing Uno. However,

54
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,911
It's not feasible for a mobile device to call in Uno directly.

55
00:05:53,672 --> 00:06:00,377
We can't recognize it perfectly by voice on the mobile phone platform.

56
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:06,882
And when players play mobile phones, it's not suitable to short all the time,

57
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:10,144
which is easier to scare others.

58
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:14,948
Because the players are not face to face, they are facing a phone.

59
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:18,250
For the design of calling Uno.

60
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:22,170
We designed the Uno button on the right.

61
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:27,434
Players tap of the button is calling Uno.

62
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:31,697
But we also considered players' habits,

63
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:36,160
especially when playing Uno mobile game offline with friends.

64
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:40,182
They may alert out Uno.

65
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:46,486
So we designed an extra voice recognition function Voice Uno.

66
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:52,865
Once opened, players can call Uno just like they do in Uno board game.

67
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:58,109
And kids can easily use this trick to call Uno.

68
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,452
But that's just an additional option.

69
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,914
You can turn it on and off.

70
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:08,397
Next, Rules.

71
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:12,280
This case is about rules.

72
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:17,164
Classical Uno is flexible and we can create new rules.

73
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:21,571
However, there are different rules in different countries.

74
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:31,435
In mobile device, it's impossible if we try to put 100 plus rules of game mode for all players to choose.

75
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:39,699
Therefore, designers need to figure out what is really good design to solve this problem.

76
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:46,121
In the beginning, game designers planned to apply such optional rule functions.

77
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:49,774
Where players can choose the roles they like.

78
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:53,978
This is a good idea, but not a good UI design.

79
00:07:54,818 --> 00:07:57,341
All the optional roles are listed above.

80
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:04,167
There are too many options and no space on a mobile screen to put more.

81
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:09,712
And when players start a new game with different group of players,

82
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:13,195
they will have to adjust the role options.

83
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:23,950
Hicks' law describes that with more options, the time for players to make decisions will increase.

84
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:33,435
For mobile games, our original design might have directly led to the loss of players.

85
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:43,061
We changed the way of thinking and tried to figure out whether we can use the design to solve the needs of all players for different roles.

86
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:51,671
And it turns out that we redefined different roles into different game modes, which makes

87
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:56,555
changing game modes much easier than adjusting different role options.

88
00:08:57,796 --> 00:09:05,043
We just provide roles and players are the real game designers because they can edit

89
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:06,364
their own game modes.

90
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:07,945
Meanwhile.

91
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:15,409
Editing roles and game modes by dragging cards are much easier for players to understand.

92
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:25,952
After such design improvements, there are fewer options and players can spend less time on selection.

93
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:33,134
Now players can make 488 different game modes with this.

94
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:38,615
We are planning to put more and more game roles into our game for better understanding.

95
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:49,998
The most important takeaway here is that we study players' habits of playing UNO card games,

96
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:54,839
and then turn them into designs suitable for mobile devices.

97
00:09:55,699 --> 00:10:00,160
We do creative designs based on mobile device features,

98
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,381
but not just simply restore the classic UNO.

99
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:12,606
If you want to put a classic game on another platform and make it more popular, try to

100
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:20,988
think about how players experienced it on previous platforms and what the core experience

101
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:21,309
is.

102
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:28,291
Then keep the core experience and make your own innovations, so you may be able to figure

103
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:31,292
out where is your direction of design.

104
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:32,652
Thank you.

105
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,413
If you want to play Woono,

106
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:36,402
Any time, any will.

107
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:38,469
