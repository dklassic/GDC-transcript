00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,961
Hi, everyone, and welcome to Disrupt the Game Industry

2
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,261
Culture for Good, starting from square one.

3
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:18,282
My name is Trinidad Hermita.

4
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:20,882
I'm the head of diversity and inclusion at Niantic.

5
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:23,563
And I would like to get this party started

6
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:28,344
by jumping in, quite frankly, into the deep end.

7
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:30,665
And we're going to start with square one.

8
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:41,132
In order for us to really truly dig deep into this conversation around culture around diversity and inclusion and equity, we really have to get on the same page.

9
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:51,443
And I'd like to use this exercise of asking a couple of questions that are questions that we might not ask every day, but are telling on where our journey is.

10
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:56,014
Question number one, diversity asks, who's in the room?

11
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:59,436
Equity responds, who is trying to get in the room but can't?

12
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:02,158
Whose presence in the room is under constant threat

13
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:02,818
of erasure?

14
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,221
Inclusion asks, have everyone's idea been heard?

15
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,504
Justice responds, whose ideas won't be taken seriously

16
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:13,305
because they aren't the majority?

17
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:15,326
Diversity asks.

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,801
How many more of black people in a group

19
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:23,962
do we have to have this year or encourage in recruiting

20
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:27,403
or how many more Latinx hires do we need?

21
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:31,244
Equity responds, what conditions have we created

22
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,225
that maintains certain groups

23
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:35,365
as the perpetual majority here?

24
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:40,007
Inclusion asks, is this environment safe for everyone

25
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:41,247
to feel like they belong?

26
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:48,293
and justice challenges? Whose safety is being sacrificed and minimized to allow others to

27
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:55,221
be comfortable maintaining dehumanizing views? Pretty tough questions, huh? But

28
00:01:55,561 --> 00:02:00,926
these are the questions that we need to tackle in order to disrupt game industry culture.

29
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:06,629
I'd like to start with a quote from one of my favorite Pokemon, Wink Wink.

30
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:12,972
Of course, I work with Pokemon Go, but Mewtwo is one of the strongest Pokemon.

31
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:20,095
And in all of my interactions with Pokemon Go, I love catching Mewtwos,

32
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,516
because I feel like if I got the strongest Pokemon in my deck,

33
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,817
then I can conquer and do anything.

34
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:30,238
One quote is, I see now that the circumstances of one's birth

35
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,219
are irrelevant.

36
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:35,180
It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.

37
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,762
And I'd like to unpack that a little bit with what is our gift.

38
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:43,404
As humans, we all have a genius inside of us.

39
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,946
And that genius is something that the universe has given us

40
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:48,427
as a gift to the world.

41
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:50,508
And how are we using that gift?

42
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:55,811
Let's go back to those questions and talk about how we can use our gift.

43
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,862
to counteract and use our privilege to counteract

44
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:00,782
some of these questions.

45
00:03:01,422 --> 00:03:04,184
Question number one was, who is trying to get in the room

46
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:04,684
but can't?

47
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:09,686
How can I use my privilege or access authority

48
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:10,927
to fix the problem?

49
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:12,727
Who's in the room?

50
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,089
If I see everybody who looks like me in the room,

51
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,470
how do I create access for people

52
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,392
who don't look like me, who can bring a diverse thought

53
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:25,233
to who can bring different ideas that

54
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:26,513
can make us more innovative?

55
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:30,585
whose presence in the room is under constant threat

56
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,286
of erasure.

57
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:35,928
How can I stand up and be an ally advocate for this person?

58
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,830
If you're in a meeting and someone is saying a great idea

59
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,552
and then people just overlook it and keep on going

60
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:46,734
as another person in the room who noticed this great idea,

61
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:49,716
you can stand up and say, wait, wait, wait, wait,

62
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:52,758
let's take a moment to hear Laura's idea.

63
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:55,219
Let's take a moment to hear Sam's idea.

64
00:03:56,366 --> 00:04:00,427
That's using your privilege, your access, your authority

65
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,228
to create space for someone else.

66
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:06,169
Another question, whose ideas won't

67
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,250
be taken as seriously because they aren't in the majority?

68
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,751
Thinking back to myself, how can I

69
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:16,552
back up innovative thinkers who don't have support because they

70
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:17,752
are not in the majority?

71
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,914
How do I open doors for people who have great ideas

72
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:25,234
but just don't have access?

73
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:27,866
Seems so simple, doesn't it?

74
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:32,489
Next, what conditions have we created

75
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,291
that maintain certain groups

76
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:36,373
as the perpetual majority here?

77
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:39,135
I'd like to talk about the systematic cracks

78
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:41,957
that are blocking the minority to access stretch roles,

79
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,199
promotions, or even clearance

80
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,040
to go to the next round in interviews.

81
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,865
How are we utilizing these systems and saying,

82
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,526
you know what, there's some cracks in here

83
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:55,408
that are blocking people with access.

84
00:04:56,762 --> 00:05:00,983
Have you ever thought that maybe, maybe just maybe,

85
00:05:01,263 --> 00:05:04,804
bringing someone on site who doesn't look like you,

86
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:07,705
maybe the interview didn't go as right

87
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:10,246
or a perfect as you'd like it, but saying, you know what?

88
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:11,967
I'm gonna pass them through

89
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,627
so that they can have an onsite interview.

90
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,128
Maybe they'll do better in person.

91
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:19,349
Next, which I do not wanna look over

92
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:22,190
because as you know, right now in the game industry,

93
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,531
we are grappling with a lot of things.

94
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:28,539
Whose safety is being sacrificed and minimized

95
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:31,141
to allow others to be comfortable maintaining

96
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:32,402
dehumanizing views?

97
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:36,505
How can I support people who are bringing up ideas

98
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,827
that might threaten the majority on their practices?

99
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,451
How can I support people who have ideas

100
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:46,532
that might threaten other people?

101
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:51,196
I think that's something that we sit back

102
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,637
and we think about, and I'm like, wow,

103
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:56,891
Me as a woman in the industry that is majority men,

104
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:59,972
you know, I go out to a happy hour

105
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,434
and I'm in the happy hour and I feel uncomfortable.

106
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:04,835
So I leave.

107
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:07,496
When I bring that up to someone,

108
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:09,497
are they gonna say, you know what?

109
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,958
You shouldn't have felt uncomfortable.

110
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:11,818
Let's address it.

111
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:13,439
Let's call on the people and make sure

112
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,441
that you feel safe working in this environment.

113
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:18,562
That's an ally.

114
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:19,542
That's an advocate.

115
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:23,190
The opposite is pushing it under the rug

116
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,951
and not giving the right energy towards something

117
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:29,952
that could eventually help generations to come.

118
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:34,133
So I'd like to move on from that,

119
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:37,014
but I just want you to know that there's no way

120
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:40,455
that you would ever hear me say that this is okay.

121
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:43,216
I truly believe that if anything,

122
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,797
our jobs and our opportunities in the game industry

123
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:47,577
should be safe.

124
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:50,878
Just that little tidbit.

125
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:56,769
Now, let's talk about ways that we can move it to action.

126
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,271
I did talk about some questions and some questions

127
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:01,253
that had answers on how to be an ally,

128
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:06,617
but a lot of us are stuck in either one of these places,

129
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:08,519
head, heart, and hand.

130
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,463
Head is, I'm convinced that we need to change,

131
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:14,744
but it's stuck in my head.

132
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:16,466
I know that there's data out there.

133
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:17,747
I know that

134
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:20,674
I've heard it on Harvard Business Review.

135
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:21,915
I've heard it on Bloomberg.

136
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:22,735
I've heard it everywhere.

137
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:24,517
There's so much that we need to do,

138
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,158
and it's going to help our bottom line.

139
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,101
This is stuff because we have facts on facts on facts

140
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:32,204
that this diversity and inclusion and equity work

141
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:35,587
will increase your bottom line, will make your employees

142
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:39,170
happier, will create an innovative workspace.

143
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,772
But if it's stuck only in my head,

144
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,275
how am I going to get to action?

145
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:52,125
So moving on to the heart, there's a distance between the head and the heart. It's a little

146
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:58,689
bit shorter than the heart and the hand, but this is where I observe, I feel, I want to change.

147
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:03,852
Like, hey, everything that's going on in the world right now with the Black Lives Matter commitment

148
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:14,418
and we can see that it's wrong. People are dying without any type of regard for human life.

149
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:19,484
Wow, I want this to change. That's when we get to the heart.

150
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:25,727
But if we want it to change and we stop right there, no action is actually done.

151
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:32,369
So how do we get from the heart to the experience to actually try and change?

152
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:39,212
The capability to change. That's a vulnerable place, y'all. So many times we

153
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:46,369
in this industry love to fast fail. Let's try a new game and see if it works. Put all the effort

154
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:51,833
behind it. Put it out there and watch it. But when it comes to humans, when it comes to people,

155
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:57,297
we're a little bit more apprehensive to actually empowering that change and that ability to fail.

156
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:05,684
We are going to fail. Just wanted to let you know that. There is no silver bullet to this.

157
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:09,407
As we move forward and try new things,

158
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,949
We may not do it exactly the right way,

159
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,232
but does that stop us from actually doing something?

160
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:22,715
You see, one thing that businesses really focus on

161
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,497
is the bottom line revenue.

162
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:27,058
But one thing I can say about Niantic

163
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:28,599
is we focus on our mission,

164
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,561
which is to get people out active in communities.

165
00:09:32,682 --> 00:09:34,644
And at Niantic, we focused on,

166
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:36,385
we wanna reflect the communities

167
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,546
that we've supplied these games for.

168
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,080
What do these communities look like?

169
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,722
Well, they look 50% female and 30% underrepresented minority.

170
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:48,543
But do we look like that internally?

171
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:51,364
Are we building the infrastructure internally

172
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:55,766
so that we can make sure that whatever we design and create

173
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:58,007
has our players in mind?

174
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:01,208
It's a work in progress, y'all.

175
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:03,449
But we can do it together.

176
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:10,451
The reason why I brought up the head, heart, and the hand is because in education, it's called the

177
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:18,437
activation trinity. There has to be a process, whether you start with acting like, hey, I want

178
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:22,781
to go protest. I want to get out there. And that's your activation. And then your heart's connected.

179
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:27,585
And then your head, you're like, wait, I get the understanding. I know what information's out there.

180
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:34,350
But if you don't have some form of understanding, feeling, you are not going to be effective in

181
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,071
your actions.

182
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:38,379
So what does that look like?

183
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,942
So let's talk about how we develop our games.

184
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:45,144
When you look at the lifecycle of a game,

185
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:46,765
you think of the concept.

186
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,608
You go in depth on research on how much you

187
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:53,430
want to make sure that this is applicable to the environment

188
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,592
and to the people who are going to be playing this.

189
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:58,834
You don't cut corners.

190
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:02,874
And one thing when you're coming into the DEI work

191
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:05,615
and culture work, a lot of companies

192
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:07,856
love to focus on low-hanging fruit.

193
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:09,296
Why?

194
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:12,357
Because low-hanging fruit gives you that direct access

195
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,078
to external media.

196
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,119
Oh, y'all are doing great giving back to the community.

197
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:20,900
Y'all are doing great with your employee resource groups.

198
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,841
These are things that are low-hanging fruit

199
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:26,802
because they're easy to accomplish with less overhead.

200
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:31,714
but they are not sustainable for the long systemic change.

201
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:34,957
High-hanging fruit is not sexy.

202
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:38,340
High-hanging fruit means looking at your board

203
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,162
and seeing is there any women on your board?

204
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:43,624
Is there any underrepresented minorities on your board?

205
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:47,528
High-hanging fruit is looking at your leadership team

206
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,970
and saying, hey, do we have any black people

207
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,332
who are a director or above?

208
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:54,734
Quick question.

209
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:01,041
These are things that could be done, but once you recognize that there's a lot of work after that that has to happen.

210
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:15,306
So I would like to actually go through each. I'm going to give a couple examples of what high hanging fruit is and what low hanging fruit is and give some examples on how we can address these things. Are you ready for the journey?

211
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:17,647
I am. Let's go.

212
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:19,888
Low hanging fruit.

213
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:36,272
By no means am I talking negatively about anything on this chart, but what I'm saying is that these low hanging fruit examples are not going to continuously create systemic change within your company.

214
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:39,511
Employee resource groups are amazing.

215
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:43,295
They're great to gather people together collectively,

216
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:47,000
to get people excited about the business imperative

217
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,744
of having a balanced workforce, and giving people power

218
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:54,589
and the ability to assemble and educate people.

219
00:12:55,903 --> 00:12:58,924
At Niantic, our pillars are commitment, community

220
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:00,745
and partnerships, and culture.

221
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:02,905
And in our employee resource groups,

222
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:05,706
their leadership focuses with those pillars

223
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:08,647
on how to educate, how to reinforce commitment,

224
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,988
and how to create a safe culture for everybody.

225
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:13,389
Is that important?

226
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:14,149
Yes, it is.

227
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,091
But is that systemically going into the cracks

228
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:21,272
and using power to change up things

229
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:23,133
that have been going on for so long?

230
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:24,813
Not at all.

231
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,467
Another thing is sponsoring diversity conferences.

232
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:31,349
I believe conferences are great for development,

233
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,390
empowerment, and getting people out.

234
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,152
One thing that I love about Afro Tech

235
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:38,394
is that as a black person in tech,

236
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:40,175
I can go to this conference

237
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,236
and see people who look just like me

238
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:44,437
in so many ranges of different places

239
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:48,119
and different levels and senior leaders.

240
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:51,241
And I'm like, wow, okay, I need you to be my mentor.

241
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,262
I need you to be my mentor.

242
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:53,343
It's fun.

243
00:13:54,213 --> 00:14:00,539
But it's not addressing the fact that we struggle at hiring people of color in tech

244
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,184
and not addressing the reasons why we struggle hiring people of color in tech.

245
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:09,387
Compensation evaluation.

246
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,751
I think if your company hasn't done this, this is a great start.

247
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:20,077
Checking your comp eval and seeing where people of color fall, where women fall.

248
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:25,757
Are women and people of color being promoted as fast as everybody else?

249
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:31,241
This is a complete overhaul of going in to benefits.

250
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:34,383
You know, some companies have better benefits than others.

251
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:39,327
And if I'm, if I'm a company and I'm like, Hey, okay, this other company over

252
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:43,250
there is getting all the talent because they have childcare, I'm going to think,

253
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,551
okay, that's a low hanging fruit.

254
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:47,253
Let's just get some childcare and then we'll get some more

255
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:48,615
people that will want to work here.

256
00:14:50,360 --> 00:15:01,023
Community partnerships. Again, I'm not knocking any of these things. These are all very important, but it's very easy to partner with community organizations that are doing the hard work.

257
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:12,867
And you just provide funding and you think that you should receive all the praise because you're just providing funding. That's a great thing. You're providing funding. But what are you doing internally?

258
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:22,730
Are you utilizing these tools and these things that this community organizers are using to impact the backyard of your company?

259
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:38,796
Are you bringing them in? Are you creating access? It's one thing to provide funding for a community partnership. It's another to create an internship program where there's direct access from that community into your organization.

260
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:42,357
Social impact.

261
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,241
We all love to give back.

262
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:51,245
I promise you, whenever we think about donating

263
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:55,267
our time or our resources, it's usually

264
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:57,028
something that's near and dear to our heart.

265
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:01,731
And what I'm fighting for in this call and this talk

266
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:05,874
is that DEI and having a balanced workforce

267
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:09,236
becomes our passion, and it's near and dear to our heart.

268
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:12,943
just like saving the world so that we can live here.

269
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:16,845
Obviously, we want to make sure that we have air, water, food.

270
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:22,847
But also, sometimes it's easier to impact a culture

271
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:27,590
outside of your own because you can provide resources instead

272
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,672
of looking hard in the mirror at yourself and saying,

273
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:35,533
what am I physically doing in my space to empower people?

274
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,501
Another thing is socializing culture values.

275
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,563
If a company, if you're going into a company

276
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:46,084
and you don't know their values,

277
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:49,485
this is a problem because you are not necessarily

278
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:51,727
seeing leadership resemble them.

279
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:55,469
So re-looking at company values is important

280
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:57,150
and being able to say,

281
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,652
are we practicing what we preach as leaders?

282
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:03,693
Are we practicing what we preach as middle management?

283
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:06,255
And being able to sit back and say, wow.

284
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:11,050
You know, our values are trust, accountability.

285
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,111
And guess what?

286
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:13,672
I have all those things.

287
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:15,354
That's an A plus right there.

288
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:18,696
But if your organization, if your employees

289
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:21,658
see these values and they don't see them emulated

290
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,800
in their leadership through action,

291
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,002
it's just lip service.

292
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:28,103
And guess what?

293
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:31,026
The next generation to come

294
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:32,787
actually cares about these things.

295
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:36,716
They look into companies, evaluate, and say,

296
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,997
where best should I take my talent?

297
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:43,219
And as a company that provides entertainment,

298
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,481
so to speak, for people, you definitely

299
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:50,203
want your employees to feel empowered, valued,

300
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:53,004
so that they're bringing their genius to work.

301
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,666
Let's talk about some high-hanging fruit.

302
00:17:57,947 --> 00:17:59,147
I said not as sexy.

303
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:03,170
The board and executive leadership seats.

304
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:09,949
If your studio doesn't have an underrepresented minority,

305
00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:14,131
a woman or a person of color and a director level or above,

306
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:16,933
then you have a problem.

307
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:19,595
Because as someone like me,

308
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:21,636
who may be an individual contributor,

309
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:23,778
if I'm looking into the company

310
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:26,099
and I see no internal growth,

311
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,681
you're not gonna be able to keep me for long.

312
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:33,244
So understanding also promotions.

313
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,742
Are people of color and women getting promoted less

314
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:40,263
than their Asian and white counterparts?

315
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:43,385
I think you should check into that data.

316
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:45,567
It's pretty telling.

317
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:50,230
Also with attrition, regretted versus non-regretted.

318
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,232
Are people leaving faster as they're coming in?

319
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:57,614
It's one thing to take so much effort into recruiting

320
00:18:58,135 --> 00:18:59,816
and then to getting people in through the door.

321
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,006
But if you haven't changed your management

322
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:04,990
and changed your leadership on how to empower, develop,

323
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,434
and actually give feedback to people,

324
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:10,058
they're going to run out the back door.

325
00:19:10,078 --> 00:19:13,684
And there goes all the hard effort and time

326
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:15,407
that you've put into recruiting people.

327
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:19,269
I talk about middle management all the time.

328
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:20,709
I call them the frozen chosen.

329
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:22,890
I know it's not the best term,

330
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,731
but I call them the frozen chosen

331
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:28,092
because middle management has so much weight

332
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:31,753
on their shoulders to manage, to evaluate,

333
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:34,193
to promote, to develop,

334
00:19:35,194 --> 00:19:39,315
but they're the most under-resourced employee.

335
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:43,276
Are we giving our middle management the right training?

336
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,864
Are we empowering them with coaches so that they know how to get to the next level?

337
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:55,306
Are we giving them the ability to really look at the whole nucleus of the company

338
00:19:55,746 --> 00:20:00,988
and see how they are imperative to the bottom line of our company's resources?

339
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:10,671
Middle management education and realignment is imperative to seeing if your company can actually practice what they preach.

340
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,702
There are times when in my career,

341
00:20:16,602 --> 00:20:18,964
it's been hard for my manager to give me feedback.

342
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:20,725
And I've always thought,

343
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:23,047
why is it so hard to give me feedback?

344
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:26,730
But I realized I'm very different,

345
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:28,971
I'm very vocal,

346
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:32,114
and I'm not afraid of leadership.

347
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:34,455
And that could be intimidating.

348
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:38,058
So one thing that I, in my own journey

349
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:39,999
throughout corporate America,

350
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,560
throughout the game industry,

351
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,153
has been to remind my manager that feedback to me

352
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:48,135
means that you care about my development

353
00:20:48,195 --> 00:20:50,657
and you care about me growing within the company.

354
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:52,978
If you don't give me feedback,

355
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,800
if you don't give your employees feedback,

356
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,921
you're not truly invested in their growth.

357
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:00,384
And sometimes that feedback may be hard,

358
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:05,307
but the fun fact is that if you tell me as a manager

359
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,928
that you would love to develop me

360
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:09,891
and you're giving me opportunities to do that,

361
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:16,230
I am now more invested in this company because this this company is invested in me.

362
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:21,192
And then guess what? I'm going to bring all my innovative ideas.

363
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:26,153
I'm going to go above and beyond because I know that you have my back.

364
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:33,415
I'd like to highlight the bad apples. How many times do we go into companies

365
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:38,237
and we see people who are bad apples and we just go, oh, they're untouchable.

366
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,152
They're untouchable.

367
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:44,735
They're just making a muck, but they're untouchable.

368
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:45,576
And guess what?

369
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:46,577
That's a problem.

370
00:21:47,197 --> 00:21:49,720
One way to build trust with your workers,

371
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,761
with your community, with your employees,

372
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:55,304
with your partners, is to identify those bad apples

373
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:58,887
and make a stand that you value

374
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:01,489
and whatever the values are of the company,

375
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,712
cross the board, you're going to make the right decision.

376
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:09,019
That's a tough one, because guess what?

377
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,260
That decision might be your best friend.

378
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,381
That decision might be someone who

379
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:16,621
helped you start the company.

380
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:18,901
But guess what?

381
00:22:19,101 --> 00:22:21,002
If you engage with your board, if you

382
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,762
engage with your executive leadership team,

383
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:27,283
and you make a plan, it doesn't have to end all bad.

384
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:29,063
It doesn't have to end in a scandal.

385
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:33,044
It doesn't have to end in a media frenzy

386
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:35,865
because something that was done in the dark

387
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:36,685
is now in the light.

388
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:41,368
Getting rid of the bad apple sooner than later

389
00:22:41,388 --> 00:22:45,010
will prevent not only a huge PR issue,

390
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,211
but it will prevent you having to use lawyers

391
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:50,552
and different things, different executives in that state

392
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:52,713
to make statements, to cover up

393
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:55,414
or to justify situations that have happened.

394
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:57,976
Our industry is hurting right now

395
00:22:58,556 --> 00:23:01,277
and we need people who have integrity.

396
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:04,018
We need people who are willing to step down

397
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:05,819
if they know that they're not the right person

398
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,500
for that position,

399
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,340
or they've reached their.

400
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:10,542
their journey's end.

401
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:14,245
I'd like to dig a little deeper.

402
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:15,806
I put some random stuff on here,

403
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:17,307
but I'd like to dig a little deeper

404
00:23:17,327 --> 00:23:18,627
into the green light process.

405
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:21,349
When a game is coming to green light,

406
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,912
what are the questions that are being asked?

407
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:28,994
Are we asking about the environment that it's gonna be in?

408
00:23:29,335 --> 00:23:31,496
Are we asking about the people that it's gonna touch?

409
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:34,358
Are we asking about the team that's gonna be creating it?

410
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:36,119
Is it a balanced team?

411
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,761
Is it a team that is open?

412
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:47,263
to unconventional ideas? Is it a team that's open to constructive criticism and feedback?

413
00:23:48,944 --> 00:23:55,486
These are all things that are imperative to building a world-class game. Now granted, when I

414
00:23:55,566 --> 00:24:01,788
say that, in my head, the counteract is, well, the game industry has been predominantly white

415
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:08,010
and Asian over the last 20 years, and they've created world-class games. But at the same time,

416
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:11,775
You have to understand that your people are your capital.

417
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,076
Your players love the game, loving the game,

418
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,057
coming back with feedback, taking that

419
00:24:17,097 --> 00:24:18,417
and actually implementing it.

420
00:24:18,717 --> 00:24:20,257
That's what makes you agile.

421
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:24,118
That's what makes you someone who can fast fail.

422
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:28,899
Another thing I'd like to talk about is product development

423
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:30,000
and evaluation.

424
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:33,218
When we're dealing with products,

425
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:35,819
we know that products have a life cycle

426
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:38,580
from the beginning to the end with the death

427
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,321
or maybe another reiteration of it.

428
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,503
But at each step within that life cycle,

429
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:47,664
where are we asking the questions of who's not in the room?

430
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:52,126
Where are we asking questions on how's this product,

431
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:55,227
this game, this platform going to affect the people

432
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:56,168
who are engaged?

433
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:00,510
That leads me into accessibility.

434
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:05,299
Accessibility in games is huge.

435
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,201
Just because the majority have access

436
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:13,183
to using both hands, both feet, being able to walk,

437
00:25:13,623 --> 00:25:15,064
being able to dance, doesn't mean

438
00:25:15,124 --> 00:25:16,864
that differently-abled people might not

439
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:18,485
have struggles in those areas.

440
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:22,847
And if we really want to build world-class games

441
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,128
and build a world-class culture, we

442
00:25:25,168 --> 00:25:26,849
have to make sure that our culture is

443
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:28,130
accessible to all people.

444
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,972
And when we're building games, not leave people out

445
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:35,932
just because it's a little bit more difficult to develop.

446
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:44,274
We have these timelines that we create because we're so excited

447
00:25:44,314 --> 00:25:47,035
and we have crunch time and all these different things.

448
00:25:48,976 --> 00:25:53,997
But I beg you to think about all the people in the world who

449
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:57,198
love entertainment, who love playing games, who

450
00:25:57,238 --> 00:25:58,178
may be in a wheelchair.

451
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:00,414
who may be colorblind,

452
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:04,475
who may not be able to use one or both of their hands.

453
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:07,296
What are some things that we're doing

454
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:10,637
in this innovative space with augmented reality,

455
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:15,298
with virtual reality, with AAA games

456
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:17,239
and all these different games that we have?

457
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:19,499
Like we, the world is our oyster.

458
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:23,520
So why not start making that a business imperative

459
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,821
and making that part of even the green light process?

460
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:32,437
Are you asking in the green light process, is this game accessible?

461
00:26:32,597 --> 00:26:33,859
Is this platform accessible?

462
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:36,662
So all that to say is.

463
00:26:37,436 --> 00:26:39,716
There's a lot of things that we can work on here.

464
00:26:40,116 --> 00:26:42,317
And honestly, I've only had 30 minutes

465
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:45,177
to share with you, which is not enough time.

466
00:26:45,197 --> 00:26:47,738
I can't boil the ocean in 30 minutes.

467
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:50,278
And I also can't write a book in 30 minutes.

468
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:53,519
But I really do believe that these are all great principles

469
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,880
that we can take, that I would love

470
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,760
to discuss with you further in the future

471
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,061
to really create opportunities for change in this space.

472
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:08,987
We are a special industry, an industry full of creatives, an industry full of people who love to

473
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:17,775
have fun and get excited around community. Let's start allowing our internal community to look like

474
00:27:17,795 --> 00:27:24,802
the communities that we live in. And let's start allowing people to have access without jumping

475
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:25,483
over hoops.

476
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,672
I strongly believe that there are a ton of people out there

477
00:27:29,712 --> 00:27:33,716
who don't even know that the game industry is a thing.

478
00:27:34,878 --> 00:27:37,420
Growing up, I used to play Nintendo.

479
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:42,045
Don't talk trash, but you know, I wanted to make a game.

480
00:27:42,065 --> 00:27:45,749
And at that time, my parents were like,

481
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:48,152
no, you need to be a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, a preacher.

482
00:27:49,347 --> 00:27:54,991
Why? Because those were things in their head that they thought was sustainable.

483
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:57,633
Like if I become a doctor, then I can provide.

484
00:27:57,673 --> 00:28:00,335
If I become a preacher, I'll have a job forever.

485
00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:06,000
You know, if I become a lawyer, I can get access to areas that I wouldn't have access to.

486
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:12,245
But I'm telling this generation, stop playing the game and start creating the game.

487
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:18,570
With all that said, there's more to come, so holler at me.

488
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,982
Here's my information.

489
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:23,245
I would love to hear from you.

490
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:26,088
And I would love to also work with companies

491
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:27,989
that are interested in starting the journey.

492
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,612
So let's get this party started.

493
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:32,394
And thank you for your time.
