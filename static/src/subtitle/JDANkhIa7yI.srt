1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,460
Thank you for joining me.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,461
This is finding and engaging a great artist,

3
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:15,082
a non-artist primer covering tons of info today.

4
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:20,764
Getting your ducks in order before you even start searching

5
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:24,985
where to search, how to search, reaching out, paying.

6
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,928
giving feedback, all kinds of stuff.

7
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,871
A little quick info about me before I start

8
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:34,195
so you know where that info is coming from.

9
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:37,638
I am the co-founder and art director of Chickadee,

10
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,880
which is a visual design and art production studio

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,662
that I run with my wife, Sarah.

12
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:44,625
I'm also an artist at Spry Fox.

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:50,579
maker of triple town and alpha bear and other amazing happy

14
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,022
games that help you fill your joy quota.

15
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:57,445
And finally, I'm an educator at Maine College of Art, which

16
00:00:57,445 --> 00:01:00,468
is a small fine arts school in Portland, Maine, which is the

17
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:02,310
original Portland, except for.

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,673
probably at least one in the UK.

19
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:07,535
So I have a lot of jobs,

20
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:11,278
but just so the About Me section isn't just

21
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:12,099
like the jobs I do,

22
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:14,662
that's sort of a shallow view of a human being,

23
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:16,364
here's like a little fun fact.

24
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:18,546
Last year, I gave a talk,

25
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,528
and I wore this exact same shirt.

26
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:26,369
They, oh my god, thank you so much, I feel the same way.

27
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,610
And it's, but there's a reason, it's not just like a shtick,

28
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,930
like, oh hey, that's black shirt guy.

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,052
It's because this is the only shirt I own

30
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,733
that doesn't make me look like a cartoon lumberjack.

31
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,755
And that is, all of my other shirts are plaid flannel,

32
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:41,096
which is like a super common look in Maine.

33
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:44,958
But in the Bay Area, you look like out of work L.L. Bean

34
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,700
model, or like guy who knows a lot about World War II.

35
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,022
So let's dive in now.

36
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:51,202
Woo-hoo!

37
00:01:51,202 --> 00:01:51,542
Okay.

38
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:57,587
What you need to do before you start searching.

39
00:01:57,587 --> 00:02:02,671
A prototype is just about the most valuable thing you can have.

40
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,433
Since I'm assuming you don't have an artist at this point,

41
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:07,674
don't worry about making it look pretty.

42
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:13,679
Just use Game Jam rules, grey box, asset store stuff,

43
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:15,280
royalty-free assets, that's all good.

44
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:20,430
You'll also need an idea about the work you want done,

45
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,051
because that's gonna dictate the type of artist

46
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:24,472
you need to look for.

47
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:28,333
You know, a concept artist to help shape the vision,

48
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,594
or a modeler to model characters and props,

49
00:02:30,594 --> 00:02:33,955
or a painter, or an animator, art director, et cetera.

50
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:39,017
Now, this maybe seems like a, yeah, no shit kind of point,

51
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:39,558
but it's...

52
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:42,899
It's actually a pretty fine point.

53
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:45,260
When Chickadee started working with Spryfox,

54
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,281
it was because we answered a help wanted ad that said,

55
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:52,022
hey, we need a modeler for our next project

56
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:53,423
and bonus points if you can animate.

57
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,424
But what they actually needed.

58
00:02:57,124 --> 00:03:02,366
was someone comfortable moving through the visual development process,

59
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:06,768
someone who could do concept art, who could plan pipelines, who could do VFX,

60
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:08,788
who could do a whole bunch of stuff.

61
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:13,810
It was their first 3D project, and they sort of yet didn't know what they didn't know.

62
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,893
And so if you're thinking like,

63
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,535
oh, I thought I knew what I wanted,

64
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:20,656
but maybe I don't now,

65
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:24,780
try searching for a generalist or just a game artist.

66
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,022
That's gonna be someone who's comfortable

67
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:26,762
wearing a lot of hats.

68
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:31,505
Reference of other work is also good to have.

69
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:35,067
Reference that hits close to the emotional mark

70
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,229
or kind of like the vibe you're going for.

71
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,330
It's useful to have something to show,

72
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,874
to get a potential artist in the same headspace as you.

73
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:47,736
So go ahead and make a Pinterest board,

74
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:49,177
just fill it up with stuff that,

75
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:52,880
even if it's like, oh, this isn't the style of character

76
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,801
we actually want.

77
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:57,522
This, it feels right, right?

78
00:03:57,522 --> 00:04:00,002
It's okay to get emotional on that.

79
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:02,222
Other media, this, kind of related to the last point,

80
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:05,863
other media like music is sometimes really useful too,

81
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:09,784
because it's useful to kind of sometimes make a,

82
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,644
like a playlist and say,

83
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:15,305
hey, this sounds the way the art should look, right?

84
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:17,705
Get them in the same headspace as you.

85
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:21,366
If you have, obviously, soundtrack samples or something,

86
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,346
be ready to send those along.

87
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,226
That's all good stuff.

88
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:28,330
A list of verbs or adjectives is also good to have.

89
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,332
Stuff that describe what the player should be feeling

90
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:34,334
when they're playing the game or stuff,

91
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:36,155
or what they should be thinking

92
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:37,576
when they look at a screenshot.

93
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:38,957
You know, I think verbs and adjectives,

94
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:42,620
that's sort of like a common game design thing,

95
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,281
but it's also really good for visual design.

96
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:45,542
You know, and finally,

97
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,643
you're gonna need a sense of your budget,

98
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:48,864
and that is a big topic,

99
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:51,786
so let's dive down into compensation, cha-ching!

100
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,609
Come on, that was better.

101
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:56,390
Give a little more.

102
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,611
Okay, fine, I'll move on.

103
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,392
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

104
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:03,454
Okay, so the easiest, right, the most straightforward way

105
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:06,336
is like to pay an artist is just to have an art budget,

106
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:08,397
which is maybe not fair in an IGS talk.

107
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:13,780
But right, like, hey, I need art, and here is the money,

108
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,821
and then now I thank you for the art.

109
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,892
But again, IGS talk, let's talk about other stuff.

110
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,154
Royalties, profit sharing, that kind of stuff,

111
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:24,035
that's also an option.

112
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:27,677
Obviously that takes away the upfront burden of payment,

113
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:29,458
or at least eases it.

114
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,760
But it's something to consider.

115
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,263
If you're offering royalties without having proof

116
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:37,504
that you've successfully shipped a game,

117
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,725
that's sort of gonna make...

118
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:45,571
that in an appealing payment scheme because there's risk that that payment never comes.

119
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:54,678
There's a few points in this whole talk where your work history or your reputation in the

120
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:56,219
community, it's going to add a lot of weight.

121
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:57,240
This is one of those points.

122
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:01,544
uh... if people have good things to say about you or they have a positive

123
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:02,565
impression

124
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,767
of the past games you've made

125
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:08,350
uh... that's going to take some that risk out of the prospect of royalties

126
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,953
you know and and you shouldn't be afraid of

127
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,674
of using that that's a tool in your tool kit

128
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:15,814
Again though, if you're just maybe starting out,

129
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:17,134
you don't have that reputation yet,

130
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:20,815
you're still building up, still there's other options.

131
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,235
You know, if you don't mind going with someone

132
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:26,276
who has maybe less experience than you'd like,

133
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:27,696
depending on the laws in your area,

134
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:29,176
you might be able to get an intern for free

135
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:31,436
so long as they're doing it through their university,

136
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:32,917
they're getting credit.

137
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,517
You know, they get experience, you get art,

138
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:37,938
it probably will need to be touched up

139
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,718
because again, they're just starting out,

140
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:43,038
but you know, it gets the ball rolling, you have some art.

141
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:48,034
Beyond that though, this is such an important point.

142
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:52,235
Offering credit or experience or exposure

143
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:54,836
is like flagrantly shitty.

144
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:55,756
Just don't do it.

145
00:06:55,756 --> 00:07:00,777
Don't be afraid to get creative with payment.

146
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:01,918
One option is working for trade.

147
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:03,538
Now the obvious thing is like, oh hey,

148
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:08,695
Maybe you both have side projects and like you trade code for art or something like that.

149
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,355
But I think you can get more creative than that.

150
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:13,916
I one time did, this is true, I one time did

151
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:18,217
not a ton of work, but a good amount of work

152
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:21,998
for a bunch of super delicious home-brewed beer.

153
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:24,819
And I personally think I got the better deal

154
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,780
because I got drunk for like many days and they just got some assets.

155
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:30,402
But we were both happy.

156
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:32,045
The point is that we were both happy

157
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:33,046
with the arrangement, right?

158
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:34,709
That's creative, we felt good.

159
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:35,850
Especially me.

160
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:43,046
So another option is to allow the artist to retain rights

161
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,007
to the work they make.

162
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,769
When I was starting out, I did a bunch of work

163
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,951
for different studios with me retaining the rights

164
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,452
to the assets I produced.

165
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:54,673
And then after the game shipped or after the contract

166
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:57,715
was over, I would package up some of that art

167
00:07:57,715 --> 00:07:59,877
and I would sell it in asset stores.

168
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:03,119
And they got a lower cost or a lower price because of that.

169
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,880
because I was able to make up the difference

170
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,521
selling to third party markets, right?

171
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:13,382
So let's talk briefly about experience

172
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,342
as it relates to budget.

173
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:19,084
An experienced artist, someone with a bunch of ship titles,

174
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:22,365
they're gonna have a higher rate.

175
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:25,807
than someone who's more junior, I think obviously.

176
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:28,429
But their experience can ultimately save you money

177
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:32,111
because they're not gonna be hitting,

178
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,213
they'll be jumping over hurdles

179
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,955
that someone more junior might hit.

180
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:39,197
In that regard, they're sort of getting more done

181
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:40,778
in less time.

182
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:42,499
But going with someone more junior,

183
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:43,560
it actually might be the start

184
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,962
of a really long and fruitful relationship.

185
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:48,564
Junior people are gonna cost less,

186
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:51,286
they're gonna make more mistakes,

187
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:51,786
but.

188
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:55,536
Everybody gets better with time, right?

189
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,838
So if you're talking to someone, they don't quite

190
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,061
have the experience you wish they did, but you really get

191
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:03,665
along with them on a personal level, consider putting that

192
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:06,288
time in to help them grow.

193
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:07,549
OK, let's keep moving.

194
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:12,044
Where to search for your new artist?

195
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:16,546
So first and maybe most obvious, your own network.

196
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:17,867
People you've worked with in the past,

197
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:21,489
people you've met at local meetups or stuff like this.

198
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:28,332
These people are resources and you can mine that resource.

199
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:30,453
It's sort of the whole point of a network, right?

200
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,102
sort of related to that, recommendations, right,

201
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:39,406
they're sort of actually my favorite way of finding people.

202
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:41,627
You know, if a friend or a dev I respect

203
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:44,029
is singing the praises of someone,

204
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:48,433
they immediately get a million bonus de grande points

205
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:52,456
when I'm weighing them against other people.

206
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:55,918
This is another place where having good reputation,

207
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:56,999
it can really help you out.

208
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,435
If one of my favorite people is looking for someone,

209
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,039
I'll excitedly scan my own network

210
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,982
to see if I can find a matchup.

211
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,286
Just the thought of these two people working together,

212
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:12,109
it's like, oh, that's gonna be sweet.

213
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:15,795
So social media, another thing.

214
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:18,496
There's, you know, on Twitter, obviously,

215
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:21,237
there's a ton of, you know, creative hashtags,

216
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:24,238
hashtag game art, hashtag visible women.

217
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:27,899
You know, use that stuff to send out your own

218
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,300
help wanted ad. You know, chickadee, like I said.

219
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,162
We started working with Spryfox because of just a tweet.

220
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:37,543
And that was almost two years ago.

221
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:39,023
So it's a powerful tool.

222
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,183
And again, this is a place where good reputation,

223
00:10:46,183 --> 00:10:48,265
it's super useful, right?

224
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:49,986
You know, just like with recommendations,

225
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:52,568
you know, if I see a friend's studio

226
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,770
is looking for people, signal boost.

227
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,152
You know, if I see a studio's looking for people

228
00:10:58,152 --> 00:10:59,393
and I don't know a soul there,

229
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,755
I just am a huge fan of their work, signal boost.

230
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:08,841
And so finally, you can look through industry sites

231
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,824
for work you like the look of,

232
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:15,547
or maybe artist-seeking work ads.

233
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:17,849
Polycount, if you're looking for high-res.

234
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,391
High-fidelity 3D stuff, polycount,

235
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:21,491
you kinda can't be beat.

236
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:24,694
Cartridge is sort of like social media site

237
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:27,276
mixed with portfolios, sort of a weird one,

238
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:29,318
but you can look at stuff like that.

239
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:31,460
Forums, if you're using like Unity or Unreal,

240
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,782
you know, forums usually have,

241
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:38,005
hey, I'm looking for work, or hey, I need work.

242
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:39,526
It's a good place to look.

243
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:42,338
Okay, keep it moving.

244
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:44,600
What are some other things?

245
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,482
Just random extra stuff that needs to be considered.

246
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:51,326
So, hey, is this full-time or is this a contract?

247
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,208
And if it's a contract, for how long?

248
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,252
Personal connection is going to become way more important

249
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:59,874
the longer you're going to be working with someone.

250
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:04,700
you know if you're looking for you know just a handful of models

251
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,543
you can probably focus solely on skills

252
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:10,751
uh... you know if you're looking for something that's going to take months or

253
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:11,512
maybe years

254
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:15,158
uh... you're gonna wanna like this person on a personal level

255
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:20,116
Another thing, how specialized are your needs?

256
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:22,977
You know, if you're making a pixel art roguelike game

257
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:25,297
or something, at this point there's a lot of people

258
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:26,718
who can do that.

259
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:28,678
You know, but if you're making something

260
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:30,679
maybe more avant-garde, like hey,

261
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:34,640
this is a video-based narrative exploration game

262
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,280
or something like that, that's way more specialized.

263
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,681
You're gonna have a hard time finding someone to do that.

264
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:41,941
You will probably have to pay them more as well.

265
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:46,089
If your schedule is tight, you're gonna wanna find

266
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,210
someone with experience.

267
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,572
Again, you'll pay more, but the artist won't need

268
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:55,154
as much guidance, and as I stated before,

269
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,695
they're gonna avoid obstacles that someone more junior

270
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,156
might hit, which obviously is gonna help you

271
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:02,117
hit that deadline.

272
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:05,519
And then, how senior is the position?

273
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,920
A production artist with a couple years experience,

274
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,683
that's easier to find and pay for than,

275
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:12,943
hey, I need an art director.

276
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:21,918
So, if, sort of dive down into that, you know, if you're searching for someone like that,

277
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:22,780
someone with a lot of experience.

278
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,138
There's sort of no way to cut it.

279
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,100
You're going to have to be prepared for a long search.

280
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,221
There are just more boxes to check off.

281
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:34,784
You need to find someone you enjoy working with, who has

282
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:39,367
the experience you need, who you can compensate fairly, who

283
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:43,750
is willing to move to your area, or if they're not

284
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,212
already there, and someone, obviously, who's interested in

285
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:49,173
working on your game.

286
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:53,036
The rub here is that senior people like that.

287
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:57,999
you know, are often already spoken for or they have roots planted someplace and they

288
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:02,101
don't want to, you know, disrupt their family with a move, you know, or they're just more

289
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:05,363
expensive than you can pay for.

290
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:09,865
So long search, but a few suggestions, because that's the point of this.

291
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:15,660
First, use every search method you have available.

292
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,604
You should be doing all of the stuff that I already said.

293
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:22,907
Search your network and recommendations and put up ads

294
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:27,011
everywhere, social media, et cetera, et cetera.

295
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,314
Again, probably obvious.

296
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:30,475
But another thing to consider.

297
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:34,655
And, you know, I think this bears repeating,

298
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:36,436
I alluded to this before, you know,

299
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:39,457
if there's a person that you really like working with,

300
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:40,958
but they're more junior than you'd like,

301
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,399
you know, really consider giving them

302
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,280
a chance to prove themselves.

303
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,521
Progress on your game will be slower,

304
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:50,483
at least at the start, but you know, everybody gets better.

305
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:59,953
One important note on that though, if you go this route, be sure they have a firm grasp

306
00:14:59,953 --> 00:15:08,038
of visual design topics like color theory or composition or wrestling with visual hierarchies.

307
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:10,639
These are all fundamental art issues.

308
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,122
I would say maybe additionally make sure they have a knack for problem solving and lateral

309
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:17,123
thinking and stuff like that.

310
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:22,181
And so I sort of just alluded to this.

311
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:26,226
I personally think really good art directors for games

312
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:29,550
are basically really good traditional artists

313
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,232
that have an understanding of technology.

314
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:35,958
And while interactivity is pretty unique to games,

315
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,040
there are other mediums that.

316
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,273
you know, have that mix of traditional art and technology.

317
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:46,535
You know, graphic design, animation, two examples.

318
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:51,179
Those fields require you to understand visual design.

319
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:52,700
You know, they're multi-step processes

320
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,263
that often involve, you know, various teams of specialists.

321
00:15:56,263 --> 00:16:01,607
They require you to get X done and Y time for Z budget, right?

322
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,288
That stuff is all very similar to games.

323
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:09,391
So besides asking your dev peers for recommendations,

324
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:12,232
consider asking friends from other related industries,

325
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,353
if you have them, for recommendations.

326
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:17,534
There might be a graphic designer out there

327
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:21,536
that when paired with a lower-experienced generalist

328
00:16:21,536 --> 00:16:23,017
or tech artist or something

329
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:25,018
to help explain what can and can't be done

330
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,198
in the realm of games,

331
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,119
that might be a really, really great combination for you.

332
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:31,346
So, last point in this section,

333
00:16:31,346 --> 00:16:35,330
and this is sort of like the most important.

334
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,432
Whichever route you go, whoever you go with,

335
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:40,535
you generally, I think you want to shoot for rapport.

336
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:43,317
You'll need to critique this person's work,

337
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:47,281
and that is gonna be like way smoother,

338
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,924
you know, if you both respect each other

339
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:51,325
and you both enjoy each other's company.

340
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:54,123
Okay, let's keep going.

341
00:16:54,123 --> 00:16:57,784
So let's say you have found a specific artist

342
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,585
you wanna work with, you know,

343
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,525
and you need to reach out, what do you do?

344
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:04,206
If you know someone that knows both of you,

345
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:06,407
consider asking for an introduction.

346
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:08,867
It's super, it's nice and easy, right?

347
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,528
There is sort of an instant level of trust

348
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:14,029
because of that shared connection.

349
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:16,109
Again, another benefit of having, you know,

350
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,250
like a wide network and a good reputation.

351
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:24,914
regardless if that introduction can be set up,

352
00:17:24,914 --> 00:17:27,296
I would say just be professional,

353
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,258
but make sure your tone is still friendly.

354
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,801
The professional thing is maybe more a point

355
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,923
for younger professionals right now.

356
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:37,645
I personally have gotten emails

357
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:39,206
that have like LOL, OMG in them,

358
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:43,329
and it's like, that's cool, I hope your game does good,

359
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,511
but I don't think we're gonna work out.

360
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:46,692
So professional.

361
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:54,729
So, here is like a big list, and I'll be sharing my slides with this, so take a picture if

362
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:57,891
you want to, but you can also probably download this later.

363
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:03,033
So write two or three paragraphs that include, you know, what you need done, key dates, platform,

364
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:08,395
engine, if there's an existing art team or art director or just like a lone artist even,

365
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:11,496
because it's good to let a new person know who they'd be working with.

366
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:19,079
you know, if there is an absolutely non-negotiable budget, include that.

367
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:21,100
Obviously, info about your game.

368
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,420
This is a sales pitch, right?

369
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,161
Make that person interested.

370
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:31,884
And finally, it's good to let them know if there's a specific problem you're trying to

371
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:33,064
solve by bringing them on.

372
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:39,930
Like, oh, our characters need to feel more lifelike, or oh, we had a few interns and

373
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,014
they got the ball rolling, but we need someone now to kind of tie it together and form a

374
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:48,257
stronger thread that runs between everything.

375
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,559
If you have a press kit set up, send that.

376
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,342
That usually includes a lot of that kind of baseline information.

377
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:59,938
You know, and finally, I think it's good to end with something like, you know, if you're

378
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:04,879
interested, you know, I'd love to send you more info or screenshots or video, et cetera,

379
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:07,520
as well as answer any questions you may have.

380
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,062
It's inviting, but it's also maybe a little bit of a call to action.

381
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:14,322
Okay.

382
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:19,844
What if you don't have someone specific, you need to like blast the Internet with a help

383
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:20,204
wanted ad?

384
00:19:22,185 --> 00:19:27,848
If you're casting that wide net, create a page on your website with a job listing that

385
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:34,810
includes all of that information that I just mentioned, even if you are using social media

386
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:40,012
to say, hey, we're looking for blah, more information here, link to this site.

387
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,734
It's all that information, what you need done, key dates, blah, blah, blah.

388
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,914
You can leave budget off this.

389
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:48,835
I know that that's maybe an uncomfortable thing

390
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:51,177
to broadcast, or maybe it even messes up

391
00:19:51,177 --> 00:19:55,739
like a contract with a publisher or something like that.

392
00:19:55,739 --> 00:20:02,083
But if that's not the case, it's still useful to include.

393
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,684
Also, include info about an art test

394
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:05,725
if you're requesting one.

395
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:09,647
This is sort of like, can be anyway, a sticky point.

396
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:10,527
Art tests are...

397
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:22,308
Our tests can be considered rude or even insulting if A, they're not paid or there's actually

398
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:22,949
not a B to that.

399
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:23,949
I just got sidetracked.

400
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:28,572
It can also sort of feel like being...

401
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:32,195
made to jump through hoops.

402
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:34,417
So I sort of think a good rule of thumb

403
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,038
is to really only request one

404
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:39,362
if it's like a uniquely technical gig

405
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,484
or the artist would have to use

406
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:44,767
like a special in-house toolkit or something like that.

407
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:48,510
Otherwise, I think it's appreciated

408
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,492
if you go just by portfolio

409
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:52,894
and work history and recommendations and stuff.

410
00:20:53,467 --> 00:21:00,311
And, you know, finally this is like a small point, but it can save a ton of time.

411
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:03,773
Request that all inquiry emails have the same subject.

412
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:08,737
So like, animation position, or artist wanted, or something like that, because it's just

413
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:13,520
going to make sifting through, you know, when you have like a hundred replies, sifting through

414
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
that's going to be a lot easier.

415
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:18,530
Okay, boom, home stretch.

416
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,792
You found your artist, here are some tips

417
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,754
for giving them feedback.

418
00:21:25,754 --> 00:21:30,597
So be clear and direct, polite and friendly.

419
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:33,378
You don't have to give two put ups for every put down,

420
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:36,080
just clear and direct, polite and friendly.

421
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:42,203
One thing we teach students when they're learning to critique

422
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:44,104
is that the feedback they're giving

423
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:48,046
is not about the person who made the work,

424
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:49,267
but the work itself.

425
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,568
You're not saying this work is bad

426
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:54,150
and therefore you're a bad artist.

427
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,771
You're saying this work doesn't yet accomplish

428
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,152
all that it needs to,

429
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,433
and so it just needs an iteration.

430
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:02,454
So don't be bashful, I think that's the point.

431
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:08,776
I think you can help yourself a little bit if you do a little research about art fundamentals.

432
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:14,964
So you know, visual design basics, the 12 principles of animation, these are things

433
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:17,367
that artists know, maybe you don't.

434
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,959
There are countless resources on the internet

435
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:25,841
that will quickly explain a lot of this stuff.

436
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:27,762
You can probably scale up in an afternoon.

437
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:30,443
For example, you know the 12 principles of animation

438
00:22:30,443 --> 00:22:33,745
are, in case you don't know,

439
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:37,046
sort of the guiding principles that were formalized

440
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:38,647
in the early 20th century,

441
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:41,448
and now if you are an animation student,

442
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:42,349
these are like...

443
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:46,736
This is like, you know, geometry and calculus and blah, blah, blah.

444
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:51,518
This is all like that kind of core math that you would learn as a computer science major,

445
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:52,639
right?

446
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,780
That's what artists learn.

447
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,362
And you can, there's videos that explain all of this stuff in about 30 minutes.

448
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:02,843
So internet, do some research.

449
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:06,045
you know, even if you don't understand art,

450
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:09,409
don't be afraid of just trying to work through feedback.

451
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:12,553
Don't worry about looking stupid or sounding stupid.

452
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:14,896
Just sort of stumble through it

453
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:18,019
because an artist is not really gonna expect

454
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:21,203
that you understand all that formal stuff.

455
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:22,645
You go to college to learn that.

456
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:31,789
Very early in my career, I got a piece of feedback that a powerup I made didn't feel

457
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,029
pointy enough.

458
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:40,112
And I remember it made me so effing angry, because what does that mean?

459
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:40,512
After...

460
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,246
I was an asshole when I started my career.

461
00:23:45,246 --> 00:23:50,188
So after I calmed down, I started a dialogue with this

462
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:51,369
particular programmer.

463
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:55,991
And we sort of figured out that what he was trying to

464
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:57,952
say was it didn't feel fast.

465
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,653
It was a speed powerup.

466
00:24:00,653 --> 00:24:04,815
And didn't feel pointy enough was I don't get a sense of

467
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:05,756
speed from that.

468
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:09,860
So again, just stumble through it.

469
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:15,466
This shape or color or whatever reminds me of Doritos

470
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:18,390
and it's not good that that's the first thing I think of

471
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,073
when I look at this, right?

472
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:28,522
stumble through it, but I would say a really important point is try to avoid subjective language.

473
00:24:28,522 --> 00:24:32,764
This isn't cool or this isn't edgy enough is not as

474
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:37,527
informative or helpful as this doesn't feel imposing, right?

475
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:44,439
Something to consider, and this is perhaps a little subjective,

476
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:50,322
but I feel the high-level purpose of all art in games

477
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,884
is to act as visual communication

478
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:58,106
about the design and goals and rewards and threats

479
00:24:58,106 --> 00:25:00,188
and setting and all that kind of stuff.

480
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:02,569
So if art looks bad,

481
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,910
it's often that it's not saying the right thing.

482
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,954
This art says X to me when really it should say Y.

483
00:25:09,954 --> 00:25:14,357
This shape looks slow, but it needs to look fast.

484
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:18,960
This posture looks threatening, but it needs to be more passive.

485
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,343
These colors remind me of the fall, which makes me feel cozy,

486
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:25,865
but we want the player to feel stressed here.

487
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:28,267
So it's worth asking yourself...

488
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:34,911
what the art in front of you is saying and then compare that to what the game's design

489
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:37,492
requires it to say.

490
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:43,895
And then finally, if you find an artist that you really enjoy working with, you know, let

491
00:25:43,895 --> 00:25:44,536
them know.

492
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:47,657
Mention them in your weekly blog or Twitch stream or whatever.

493
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:51,940
Give them a shout out on Twitter because it's always nice to know that their work is hitting

494
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,281
the mark.

495
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,221
And that's it.

496
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,001
Thank you so much.

497
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:55,722
Questions?

498
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:56,002
Questions?

499
00:25:56,002 --> 00:25:56,282
Questions?

500
00:26:01,553 --> 00:26:04,975
Thanks Adam. If you have a question for Adam, please go to the mic.

501
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:16,120
So I'm from the AAA background, so I know approximately how much artists work salary-wise,

502
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,281
but how do you turn that into a budget for a contract?

503
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:21,302
That is an excellent question.

504
00:26:21,302 --> 00:26:22,143
So, um...

505
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:29,826
What's the difference basically between an artist's salary and, hey, I'm contracting

506
00:26:29,826 --> 00:26:32,469
someone, how much is all this stuff going to cost?

507
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:39,959
That's an excellent question and it's actually very big, with a potentially big answer.

508
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:40,579
What I...

509
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:46,232
There are a few different ways to do it.

510
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:50,054
So what I often do when I get an inquiry

511
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:53,095
is we try to build sort of,

512
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:57,096
first try and find out what exactly this client

513
00:26:57,096 --> 00:27:00,377
is looking for, the total scope,

514
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:04,798
and then sort of see how far along

515
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:07,079
in the project already is.

516
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,299
You know, is this...

517
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,623
Do they already have an art style defined and I'm just doing an environment set or something

518
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:16,606
like that, or is this a total package?

519
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:28,075
If it is just assets, I usually try and find a flat rate that is based on an hourly rate,

520
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:30,477
but like, hey, for this...

521
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,441
snowy mountain art set, it's gonna cost blah.

522
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:36,562
And this happens like in a dialogue

523
00:27:36,562 --> 00:27:38,543
between me and a client, right?

524
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:44,285
If it's visual design across a whole project,

525
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:47,126
I try to figure out

526
00:27:48,587 --> 00:27:50,928
get a rough sense of schedule and stuff like that,

527
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:53,709
but in that regard, it's really,

528
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:55,670
there's a lot more just like back and forth,

529
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,271
and it's just a discussion, I think, at that point.

530
00:27:58,271 --> 00:28:02,112
And if it's something really, really big,

531
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:05,034
I personally, that's when rev share royalties,

532
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:06,534
I think, really start to play in,

533
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:09,275
because otherwise, it's not sustainable.

534
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:13,277
I know that there are artists out there

535
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:16,979
that try to extract as much money as possible

536
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:17,639
right up front.

537
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:24,981
But I would prefer not to do that because I want the game to ship as much as anybody.

538
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:31,283
So it's really, I just try and work with a client to figure out something that's fair and sustainable.

539
00:28:31,283 --> 00:28:33,184
One last question.

540
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:37,785
So I had a related question, and it's in a sense unfair.

541
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,699
I don't know how to put together a budget.

542
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:43,480
I don't know how much the work would be.

543
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,882
Yet I still want to know, well, what should I pay a junior

544
00:28:45,882 --> 00:28:47,763
artist per hour or range?

545
00:28:47,763 --> 00:28:51,906
What should I pay a senior just as information?

546
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:54,208
What is that kind of stuff going to cost as I try to put

547
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,690
together the budget for the whole thing?

548
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,230
I've never shipped a game, I'm just starting.

549
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,350
Okay.

550
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,791
You know, I don't know what,

551
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:05,252
I've been in indie games my whole career,

552
00:29:05,252 --> 00:29:07,612
which I think is a little, you know,

553
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,993
salaries and stuff are a little different

554
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:14,074
in that space versus AAA.

555
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:15,714
I feel like last time I saw

556
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,975
the like,

557
00:29:20,077 --> 00:29:27,959
game developer, you know, like, hey, here's the salary range of all these various disciplines.

558
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:31,380
In entry-level artists was maybe $40,000 or $50,000.

559
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:38,621
But again, that's like salary at like an established studio, and it goes up from there.

560
00:29:49,618 --> 00:29:52,199
So just to do that into the, thank you so much,

561
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:54,639
just to do that in the microphone,

562
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,120
if you go to the Polycount wiki,

563
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,381
there is all of that information there.

564
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,302
I'm now forgetting, just broke into,

565
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,522
oh, freelance mounts.

566
00:30:04,522 --> 00:30:07,743
So again, that's another resource, yeah.

567
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:09,204
Is that our time?

568
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:10,424
Thank you so much, everybody.
