1
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:09,904
Hello? Hello? All right. Hello, everyone. Welcome to my talk. A

2
00:00:09,904 --> 00:00:14,747
little bit of boilerplate stuff to get out of the way. So turn

3
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:18,970
off your cell phones, obviously. You guys all got e-mails for the

4
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,251
survey as you checked in. So don't forget to fill those out.

5
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:21,791
They're important.

6
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:26,754
And also during the talk, if you guys want to stay for the

7
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:29,655
portfolio review after, there's a blue shirt dude in the back

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:33,357
called Grant. He's holding his hands up now. He has a USB key.

9
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:35,998
So you can just drop your portfolio onto there and then

10
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:38,279
we'll review that stuff over lunch hour. Cool? All right. So

11
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:43,121
with no further ado, let's get a little bit of a look at the

12
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:49,912
So to start off, I want to get a couple things out of the way. I

13
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:52,693
wanted to set expectations for this talk just so you guys know

14
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:56,874
what you're getting into. So first of all, what this talk is

15
00:00:56,874 --> 00:01:00,154
going to be about, we're going to be talking about linear

16
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:04,515
progression versus open world progression. So as you design

17
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:09,096
your mission, it's going to be about a visualization tool. So a

18
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:12,037
method to look at your data, to look at the content that you're

19
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,798
creating to evaluate if you're

20
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:18,219
spacing things out properly. You'll understand when we go

21
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:22,902
through it. It's also a starting point. This is not going to be

22
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:26,664
an end all solution. It's going to be how you start your design

23
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:30,846
and start looking at how you're going to lay things out. And

24
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:33,267
it's also like for a lot of you that are already doing this

25
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:36,869
stuff, it's just framing things you're probably already doing

26
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,630
but didn't necessarily put the vocabulary to it.

27
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:44,705
On the flip side, just so you don't come out of here

28
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,486
disappointed that you didn't get the information you were

29
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:50,989
looking for, we're not going to be talking about block out. So

30
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:54,232
like how to create your 3D set up at first. This is something

31
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:57,034
another talk should be about. We're not going to be talking

32
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,556
about mission scripting either. So how to set up the perfect

33
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:03,719
mission more like technically. This isn't going to be about it.

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,964
And most importantly, this isn't your holy grail.

35
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:07,705
So don't see this.

36
00:02:07,705 --> 00:02:10,170
Don't expect it to be like a panacea like that.

37
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,316
If I do this, my entire mission design problem is

38
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:13,977
going to be solved.

39
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:16,762
This is just one part of the process.

40
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:21,817
All right. Now, let's get on to it. So I wanted to do a little

41
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:25,818
bit of personal background. It's helpful to understand the flow

42
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:32,020
of the conversation. So this used to be me. I used to work

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,421
in waste water management. So technically I used to shovel

44
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,001
shit for a living.

45
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:43,324
So it wasn't the most glorious career. I was very well paid, but at a certain point after an

46
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:48,386
unfortunate event I decided I can't really do this anymore and decided to go back to what I

47
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:55,329
loved when I was a kid, which was designing games. So I went back to school, got a couple

48
00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:00,391
training programs in game design and level design. I specifically focused on level design and

49
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:03,913
eventually got a really nice job at Ubisoft and I've been there now for 15 years,

50
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:05,913
specifically in Montreal.

51
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:09,084
These are the games I worked on.

52
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:11,585
So I started my career on Prince of Persia Sands of Time.

53
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:14,006
This was a dream job for me.

54
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:16,647
I played the old Jordan Mechner games when I was a kid.

55
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:21,949
And when I got the opportunity to work on the new generation of it back in the PS2 days,

56
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:25,630
I was like, yes, I'm jumping ship, I'm going there.

57
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,013
followed through with prince of Persia war within. I worked on

58
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:33,334
chaos theory afterwards and had a short stint on snowboarding

59
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:37,417
and for the most part I would say more than three quarters of

60
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,759
my career has been on assassin creed games just focusing on

61
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,560
open world design in those environments. Specifically

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,102
mission design. I'm currently working on a project I'm not

63
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,383
allowed to talk about but maybe in the next couple of years in

64
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:50,043
GDC I'll be here.

65
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,241
What I want to focus on today were these three games. Prince

66
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:58,302
of Persia, splinter cell and assassins to explain the

67
00:03:58,302 --> 00:04:04,525
progression between those three. All right. So starting with

68
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:08,566
prince of Persia. So for anybody who is not familiar with it, so

69
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,928
this is my first AAA game experience. I worked in MMOs

70
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:19,250
things nobody has heard about. This is my big thing. So I got

71
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,574
to UB working on this. This is like, it's a standard old school

72
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:27,917
linear progression game. It's a platformer. For anybody who has

73
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:32,442
done classical level design, it's just going through a tube

74
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:33,963
and setting beats, right?

75
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:39,445
Our inspirations on the NAV side were ICO. So ICO was like a

76
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:46,452
beloved project for us. Combat wise we're looking at Mark Cree

77
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,735
but game structure wise it was much closer to the Jack and

78
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:52,137
Daxter games. That was our inspiration as far as level

79
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:53,899
design stuff goes.

80
00:04:54,359 --> 00:05:05,830
What that means is there's not really options in the path, so the player, like, once he gets into your level, he goes through, like, what you orchestrated as a level designer, so you're really controlling his experience on a second-to-second basis.

81
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:14,578
It's really directed content, and as I said, like, the player's, like, whatever you put forth, this is what the player is gonna go through.

82
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:19,969
Now, afterwards I jumped on to Chaos Theory. This was the third

83
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:26,892
in its series. It was a little bit different for me. It was a

84
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:30,773
multi-path stealth game. Now, what I mean by that is, you

85
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:39,596
So when you were going through the game, the different environments were more, like you had a single objective in any given room and you had more options to get through.

86
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:44,818
So we would just give players options, a whole bunch of ingredients and tools that he could use, and he would make his own way through it.

87
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:52,020
We would have profiles, like player profiles, so like the more aggressive player or the more stealthy player, and give them tools that complied to that.

88
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,442
and he found his own way through that environment.

89
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,603
But it was still limited in size.

90
00:05:57,603 --> 00:05:59,303
It was still enclosed spaces,

91
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:02,585
or very small outside like courtyards or things like that.

92
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:04,566
So it was fairly focused.

93
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:07,527
So you're still controlling the player's approach,

94
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:09,568
but instead of being on a second to second basis,

95
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:11,308
maybe more on a minute to minute basis.

96
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:20,611
and what that means is you can't really rely as much on the pacing or controlling your player as much

97
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:26,333
you're guiding him but a little bit more loosely than you would in a straight linear game

98
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:30,154
and that led me afterwards to Assassin's Creed

99
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,581
most of the team that worked on this, we were a lot of people

100
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:38,382
that just finished sands of time and jumped on to it for the

101
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:42,184
conception phase. As I said, I went on to chaos and came back

102
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:46,867
with my original team afterwards. So what we started

103
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:51,269
working on wasn't what you guys saw in the end. Initially we

104
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:55,031
were a lot more inspired by the pop game that we were working on

105
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:59,333
before. So the first version we had was more of an epic

106
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:06,254
linear action adventure game. It was meant to be linear

107
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:10,618
platformer on steroids with multi-path. That was the

108
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:14,782
approach. A lot of the splinter cell stuff I talked about was

109
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:17,785
there in our design so the different bubbles you go into

110
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:20,027
would have a little bit more multi-path but you were still

111
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:23,230
going from tunnel hub, tunnel hub, tunnel hub.

112
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,722
and the scope was humongous on that thing. Because for the

113
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,443
first year or two we didn't have an engine, we didn't have

114
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:34,023
anvil, so a lot of it was paper design. As you can imagine, you

115
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:37,465
just go crazy. It's just free imagination. You don't have

116
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:40,405
constraints. We didn't know what the console specs were for the

117
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:46,227
360 or the PS3 or PS2. So we just went out. We just drew a

118
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:49,648
whole bunch of things on the board, wrote a whole bunch of

119
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:54,650
scopes. Our original version had 72 missions in it. It was just

120
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,014
We had, like, one of the missions we had was, like, in the crack of Chevalier, so, like, this

121
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:06,920
big Templar citadel in the middle of the desert. We had, like, this dynamic light tower that would

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,384
invert as you played through it. So, like, this big thing that would then go down, like, a funnel

123
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:18,630
and then go back up. We even had, like, this giant snake ride. So, in the sewers under Acre. It was

124
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,253
like a whole bunch of Corey Mayer writers just went crazy when he wrote this shit.

125
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:26,956
so a lot of it was cool. We were super inspired by it but then

126
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:30,438
reality checked in and we got the first version of mandel. Oh,

127
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:33,219
we can't do a third of this. Okay. We'll re-scope and

128
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:37,722
eventually we realize we can't do two-thirds of this. And we're

129
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:42,144
like, okay, we're sort of screwed. We need to re-we need

130
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:45,026
to look again at what we designed and focus a little bit

131
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:49,349
more on our design. So...

132
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:55,195
that led us to what you guys eventually saw. By looking at

133
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:58,976
what we already had, we realized that navigation was our fun

134
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:04,177
breakthrough. That was what was cool about playing the game. The

135
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,958
other aspect of it was the crowds. It was the first time as

136
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,299
far as I remember where we could get a lot of NPCs on screen and

137
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,219
they were actually game play ingredients. People you could

138
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,800
play around with. They had reactions. So those two factors

139
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,681
combined, navigation and crowds, were what we decided to focus

140
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,421
on for what eventually became the game.

141
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:28,065
and so that led us to like a densely populated tight

142
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:32,528
environment and we decided, okay, so cities. Cities is the

143
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:35,630
way to go. This is how we're going to use these two features

144
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,792
as much as possible. And that led us to the open world 360

145
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:45,236
degree assassination profile. So we decided to focus on

146
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:48,337
assassination because we were assassins after all so there

147
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:48,537
was.

148
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,825
decision to make. Player free of ‑‑ sorry.

149
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:58,472
So what that meant, though, is with this approach, it meant

150
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,913
that if I was going to open world, I could not control my

151
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:05,894
player as much as what I was used to in the past. So I had

152
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:10,175
to get used to that idea again and recheck, okay, what does

153
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:14,177
that mean for my progression? And in a sense, we were making

154
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:17,377
our first open world game at Ubisoft, so there was a lot of

155
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:20,438
questions that we needed to answer before we could move

156
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:20,638
ahead.

157
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,806
So I was left with this question. How do I manage my

158
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:30,630
progression? Now, in the past I was used to, once again, a more

159
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:38,515
linear approach. And going into this big open world, I needed to

160
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:40,536
check what that meant for it. Sorry.

161
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:50,151
So my first inclination because of my past experience was to

162
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:52,974
say, okay, I'm going to design player paths. I'm going to

163
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:55,896
design a stealth approach. I'm going to design an acrobatic

164
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:58,178
approach and I'm going to design a fight approach into each of my

165
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:03,103
set ups. That was a bad idea. Because I realized with the open

166
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:06,906
world, there was so much landscape or so much areas to

167
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:10,209
cover that I couldn't handle it all. There was just too much

168
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:10,749
data.

169
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:19,185
I have too many notes. I realized there was no way I was

170
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:23,428
actually going to cover all this stuff. I need to reassess once

171
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:29,432
again what it meant to do open world progression. So I started

172
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:37,538
thinking back to my pop experience. So if I was going to

173
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,632
You consider the path that the player takes.

174
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:46,157
Most of the time, when we would draw out the progression in the

175
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:48,841
map or the player path, we all do a golden path.

176
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,146
It's where the player comes into your area and where he's

177
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:52,386
going to go.

178
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:54,850
This is one of my examples from Sands of Time.

179
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,992
It was the water reservoir.

180
00:11:56,932 --> 00:12:02,715
So the start of that spline is where he comes in and the end

181
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:05,176
arrow is where he gets out of it. And I can sort of define

182
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:08,178
that path through one simple spline. There's very little

183
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:10,078
branching other than for collectibles in there and

184
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,060
there's no expression on the player standpoint. So it really

185
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,041
comes down to one simple line. If I take a bunch of random

186
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:22,459
the open world set up, usually what will happen is you'll set

187
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,681
where your mission location is or like your target or your

188
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:31,606
objective, and then you draw this like circle or blobby area

189
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:34,068
around it and that defines the general area that your mission

190
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:35,009
is going to take place in.

191
00:12:37,908 --> 00:12:41,993
And if we apply the previous knowledge, then you can sort of

192
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:45,216
represent the shortest path, your objective, as the radius of

193
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:48,180
your circle or like a single line that goes from the outer

194
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,585
edge of your area down to the creamy center where your main

195
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:53,907
objective is going to be.

196
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:59,010
what your player is going to be doing. There's no way he's

197
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,211
going to be going straight from the outside to the inside.

198
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,013
Because he's going to be exploring. He's going to get

199
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:05,134
familiar with the ingredients you have in there. He's going to

200
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,796
move left and right. He's going to go backwards. He's going to

201
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:10,238
circle around your objective. At some point he's going to commit

202
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:14,702
and go down to the center. And that became super interesting.

203
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:21,607
Okay. The area is where things take place. So how do I do

204
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:26,050
make sure that the player can feel a progression from that outer edge

205
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,692
to the inner edge.

206
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:31,735
With the circumventing that he does, it's not a direct pass.

207
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:33,076
So it became a little bit harder.

208
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,778
And this here, I'll give an example, like an actual in-game

209
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:42,799
example of what that means. So this is an example from AC1.

210
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,420
This is the C-brand assassination in the port of

211
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,942
acre. So we had already defined where the assassinations were

212
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:53,383
going to take place at the beginning of the project. So I

213
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:55,884
already knew this guy, he's going to be in the port. That

214
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:58,465
already knew. We already done like a sort of block out for the

215
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:03,426
area. That was mainly inspired by architecture and like just

216
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,890
historical references that we found. So we just mocked up a

217
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,754
thing, made sure it looked like a port with boats and shit in

218
00:14:09,754 --> 00:14:12,657
there. And this is what it gave.

219
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,491
And now in there, I place my target.

220
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:20,712
So it's that little crosshair at the bottom right on the boat.

221
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:24,113
So that I knew, or I had established that this

222
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,855
is where I want my final moment, the crescendo to happen.

223
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:29,135
Because it was in the middle of the water.

224
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:32,036
The character didn't have any swimming abilities back then.

225
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,016
He would automatically die.

226
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:33,957
So it was my lava pit.

227
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:38,164
So it just made sense to have everything progress towards there

228
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:42,071
And it was a nice like amphitheater setup if I did that right like from the outer edge of my city

229
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:46,419
And I'm leading towards everything sort of naturally focused around there, so it just made sense

230
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:50,581
Afterwards what I did is I defined a zone around it.

231
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:52,383
So as I said earlier on, that's my mission area.

232
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:54,765
So that's that dotted line around the whole thing.

233
00:14:54,765 --> 00:14:56,266
So in a sense, the port.

234
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:58,528
The port is where most of my gameplay is going to be.

235
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,850
Anything that's outside of there is an approach.

236
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,211
I'm not going to control it.

237
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:04,473
I'm going to use the systems of the game in there.

238
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:06,655
But I'm not going to put anything really in place to

239
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,938
sort of complement my mission right away.

240
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm going to focus mainly on the port here.

241
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:18,346
And as I said earlier on, the shortest path is from the entrance of the port directly to the boat.

242
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:23,127
Right? Like, that's gonna be, like, if you want to do the mission inside of five minutes or less,

243
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:25,367
that's probably the best path.

244
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:28,868
But really, most players, they approach from anywhere in there.

245
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:31,888
And so you're gonna get these, player stories are gonna be different,

246
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:33,949
everybody's gonna have their own way.

247
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:35,209
And in a way, you sort of have to embrace this.

248
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,470
This is, like, you're making an open-world game, and this is what you want.

249
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,910
You want everybody to have their own story.

250
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,470
You want everybody to, um...

251
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,916
tell you how they did it and then the next day you do it in a completely different way

252
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,900
and that's the upside of doing an open world setup.

253
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:03,792
So with this in mind, that led us to take it on a more systemic approach.

254
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:08,539
Because the whole area could be used, there's no way I could control the whole thing.

255
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:13,225
So using systemic ingredients, where we would prepare a whole bunch of either ingredients

256
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:16,850
or ingredient setups, we would create a list.

257
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,992
that we can just distribute through there and the player

258
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,334
that can then interact with all these toys. So similar to what

259
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:25,556
we would do in a small multi-path room in splinter cell,

260
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:27,157
we would do this on a wide scale in a large area. The one thing

261
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:30,460
we're scared about, though, is as opposed to splinter cell where

262
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,801
everything is focused in one small room, being a large area,

263
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:36,224
you can lose the focus. You can lose the ability to interact

264
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:39,466
with the toys. So we're going to have to figure out how to

265
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,989
the intent that you're trying to go for. And in the end there's

266
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:48,031
a risk that it might seem random. So once again I need to

267
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:52,513
think, okay, how do I sort of redo that sort of progression

268
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:57,696
curve that you could have in a linear game in this set up. And

269
00:16:57,696 --> 00:17:01,998
so that brought me to segmenting my areas.

270
00:17:03,395 --> 00:17:08,378
So if I was to divide my mission area into multiple concentric

271
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:12,281
zones, then I could sort of have a similitude of what I was

272
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,582
doing in the open world progression.

273
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:16,344
Because normally they are in the linear progression where

274
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:18,786
you'll have beats for each given room as you progress

275
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:19,727
towards your objective.

276
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:23,529
I could do that more in an area using this approach.

277
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:26,672
Now I'll give you an actual example of this.

278
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:26,912
So.

279
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,572
I'm going to use Assassin's Creed again.

280
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:35,894
We're going to use the same example from what you saw earlier on, but we're going to go a little bit more in depth.

281
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:38,155
So first, you need a rough layout.

282
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,756
If you don't have a rough layout, you're going on a blank slate.

283
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:43,377
You're just going to hit your head against the wall.

284
00:17:43,377 --> 00:17:44,537
At least try and block out...

285
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:49,679
A general idea of where your mission takes place, I've done

286
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,461
versions of this that only has like five blocks in it.

287
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:53,902
And in the ground.

288
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:55,362
Just to have something to work with.

289
00:17:55,362 --> 00:17:59,024
If you don't have anything, it's going to be too long, and

290
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,085
you won't get any good results.

291
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:03,046
So just at least try and do your block out first.

292
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:06,468
And so here, this is a much more complex block out than

293
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:07,008
what you need.

294
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:10,130
This is one of my final versions, but I couldn't find

295
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,470
the older ones.

296
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:19,258
content in there and still look like a port. Next step is

297
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:24,464
identifying where your goals are going to be. So in this case,

298
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:28,769
as we said earlier on, we had the dude on the boat. I knew

299
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:29,730
that's where it was going to be.

300
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:34,851
you define your approach zone. So we already talked about that

301
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:39,153
one. So just define your area. Now, the size of the approach

302
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:42,435
is basically it's up to you. It's dependent on your game. I

303
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:45,076
can't tell you the size of it because it's like the character

304
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:48,458
movement, the speed that he goes at. What type of objective is

305
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,799
your mission? Or even the mission time. Like say it's

306
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,061
something that you all have to agree upon on your project. Like

307
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:56,142
do we want our missions to be five minutes, ten minutes, 15

308
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:59,683
minutes or an hour. And that defines the area that you're in.

309
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:04,607
And then from that point on, once you have a general area,

310
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:06,789
then you want to segment it up just

311
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:11,353
to create sections that progressively lead you

312
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:12,373
towards your objective.

313
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:17,658
Now, you might want to avoid creating too many of these areas

314
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:20,620
because the more you have, the less contrasted

315
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,782
you can make them be.

316
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,738
the larger your area or the lesser you have,

317
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:29,360
the more distinct you can make them all be.

318
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,784
That progression or the passing from one area to another

319
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:40,253
will be easier to indicate or make the player feel.

320
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,185
Now you can see here also that it's not concentric. In this

321
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:57,446
case, as I said earlier on, I built an amphitheater set up so

322
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:01,168
everything leads towards the boat. This just came about

323
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:04,069
because of the environment I had. Everything, like the water

324
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,671
I can't navigate in, so it just made sense to sort of progress

325
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:10,712
towards it. In a case like, let's say an outpost from Far

326
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:14,014
Cry, where it's in the middle of a field or a much more open

327
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:17,075
area, then you'll probably have concentric zones that like circle

328
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:19,056
in the middle and then you approach from any given

329
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:20,137
direction. So...

330
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:27,179
I guess here what I want to say is take inspiration from your world as well as from your abilities

331
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,240
and have fun with your zones.

332
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,900
They don't have to be concentric geometric shapes.

333
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,862
Really take inspiration from the geometry you already have and you can use that to sort

334
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:40,463
of guide your player without once again trying to limit him too much.

335
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:42,924
And this is a good thing to know.

336
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:46,447
you're once again in open world, like try and not limit the

337
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:49,290
player's options. Try and give them as many options as humanly

338
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,713
possible so that he, like you can get more player stories

339
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:57,758
basically out of it in the end. All right. Now, the next step,

340
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:04,585
this might seem a little bit like cosmetic, but it's not.

341
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:09,917
I like to add color to this. This is mainly to improve

342
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:14,041
readability of your design document. Because if you don't

343
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,683
do it, like ultimately in the end you're going to have a lot

344
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:20,907
of information layered on this. And if you don't do that color

345
00:21:20,907 --> 00:21:24,350
coding, it just will make it much harder to read. So I just

346
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,793
like to have this to like when I can take a top view of my whole

347
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:29,715
thing, I can see the contrast a little bit better.

348
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,401
All right.

349
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:36,743
Now the next step, which is the, I guess, where we actually

350
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:39,084
start getting into gameplay stuff, ingredient

351
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:40,325
distribution.

352
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:43,267
So I'll go into details about ingredients a little bit later

353
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:43,807
on after this.

354
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:47,470
I just want to give you guys a really quick view of how the

355
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,271
method works first.

356
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:52,753
So basically what you're doing here is you're laying down the

357
00:21:52,753 --> 00:21:55,675
different ingredients that are complementary to your mission

358
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:58,257
within your different progression sectors.

359
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:03,359
Now, these ingredients can be anything from existing gameplay

360
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,901
objects that you already have in your object bank.

361
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:08,441
They could be art assets.

362
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:11,162
They could be sound events.

363
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:15,884
They could be gameplay patterns that you want to use.

364
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:20,706
Pretty much anything is OK as long as it is complementary

365
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,487
to the theme that you're trying to represent

366
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:23,948
or the type of progression.

367
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:26,389
And we'll go into details on that a little bit later on

368
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:27,129
as well.

369
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:33,647
And here what you want to do is basically, like, the closer you get to your objective,

370
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:40,799
well, either the harder the ingredients become, or the stronger the emotional ingredients,

371
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,841
or like the stronger...

372
00:22:42,677 --> 00:22:47,361
the closer they are to the target emotion you want to get,

373
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:49,363
depending on, once again, the theme that you're going for.

374
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:54,087
One thing to be careful of is don't increase the number of

375
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:55,628
objects in each and every zone.

376
00:22:55,628 --> 00:22:57,850
Think about density, not about number of objects.

377
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,232
Because naturally, as you get closer, the zones become

378
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:01,953
smaller and smaller.

379
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:05,896
So if you have more objects, you'll just have way too many

380
00:23:05,896 --> 00:23:06,917
ingredients in there.

381
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,979
And it'll be chaotic in the end.

382
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:11,341
So just be weary of that notion.

383
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:18,940
All right. And really, this is where it gets important. This

384
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,222
is all document. This is all theory. But you're making a

385
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:25,464
game. So everything has to be an engine. As soon as you can, you

386
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:29,046
want to drop this theory into your engine and start playing

387
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:32,429
around with it. This is where the magic happens. But this is

388
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:36,191
where the game is, right?

389
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,424
So usually what I would do is I would take that theory, so the stuff I would set up,

390
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:47,747
and then drop it directly into my world layout, and then adapt as I go.

391
00:23:47,747 --> 00:23:51,611
Now the first thing you're going to notice is you are using a 2D tool.

392
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:54,894
So the 3D component to your game is just completely busted.

393
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:55,394
You won't like...

394
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:55,894
You'll...

395
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:55,994
You'll...

396
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:56,155
You'll...

397
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:56,495
You'll...

398
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:57,075
You'll...

399
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:57,175
You'll...

400
00:23:57,175 --> 00:23:57,396
You'll...

401
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:57,556
You'll...

402
00:23:57,556 --> 00:23:57,716
You'll...

403
00:23:57,716 --> 00:23:57,816
You'll...

404
00:23:57,816 --> 00:23:57,916
You'll...

405
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,898
you'll distribute stuff evenly because you're top down

406
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:06,021
approach and like verticality won't be considered. You'll

407
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:10,144
notice that distances are off so then you start distancing

408
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:13,586
objects from one another. Especially when it comes to

409
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,527
mobile ingredients like enemies.

410
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,752
because you'll get aggro, so if you aggro an enemy and you bring him to another enemy

411
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:22,876
then the difficulty just increases exponentially.

412
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:25,899
So this is stuff you'll notice right away as soon as you start dropping stuff in.

413
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,262
So space it out as soon as you get in the engine.

414
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:32,147
Don't spend too much time on documentation, just do it directly in the engine.

415
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:37,346
This is the actual final layout that we ended up with. This is

416
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:41,191
the mission, this is the map that was in game. So a lot of

417
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:45,155
the geometry I just readjusted afterwards. The guard placement

418
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:48,580
also I removed guys from my initial plan because it was hard

419
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,604
to understand the contrast between them.

420
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:58,006
elevation. This is where we realize that enemies cannot see

421
00:24:58,006 --> 00:25:01,730
beyond a certain threshold too much. It was cool if you're

422
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,013
trying to do a stealth approach. If you want to navigate on top

423
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:08,376
that means enemies on the floor cannot see you. But it also

424
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:11,058
meant if you were planning something that had a lot of

425
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:14,821
verticality, your intentions might not work in the end

426
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:18,565
because enemies couldn't see you. So it's just stuff once

427
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:20,586
again directly in the engine you're going to notice this.

428
00:25:24,073 --> 00:25:26,523
Now, I talked about it a little bit earlier on, but how do you

429
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:28,992
choose your ingredients?

430
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,796
So in your game, you probably already have an existing list

431
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:38,318
of ingredients, hopefully, or preparing the process of

432
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:39,278
designing these things.

433
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,799
So you probably have a really wide selection of, there's

434
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,960
just a lot of things that you can choose from, from the art

435
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,081
assets, from the sound cues, to any small, little scripted

436
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:51,901
events.

437
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:55,202
There's a lot of objects that are in front of you.

438
00:25:55,202 --> 00:25:56,883
And so how do you choose which ones best

439
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,443
complement your mission?

440
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:05,228
So what I like to do first is come to a common understanding

441
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:08,250
on your project of what you want to challenge the player on.

442
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,152
Like what's your, I'm calling it a dimension here, but really

443
00:26:12,152 --> 00:26:18,035
what is your, what is the value that you want to see a

444
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:22,218
progression on during your entire game? More often than

445
00:26:22,218 --> 00:26:25,640
not, we choose difficulty. Difficulty is the one that we

446
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,142
often refer to. And it's a great one. I highly suggest using it.

447
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:35,364
but there's other ones that you can use as well. The mission

448
00:26:35,364 --> 00:26:39,606
phase is what that means is like for a lot of military games you

449
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:43,328
have the approach zone, the infiltration zone and then the

450
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:48,270
encounter zone. So you can use that as your progression

451
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,111
parameter. Game play focus is another one. So I'll give

452
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:54,552
examples from Far Cry a little bit later on. But if you choose

453
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:57,254
a game play object or a game play feature in the game and

454
00:26:57,254 --> 00:26:59,915
design an entire mission around there.

455
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:04,058
could be another dimension that you're choosing to focus on.

456
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:06,561
Emotional theme. I'll talk a lot about these as well. This is

457
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:10,184
one thing that we do a lot of on the older ACs where we choose I

458
00:27:10,184 --> 00:27:16,150
want to do vertigo or I want to do fear. I want to do risk.

459
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:23,354
these are another type of approach. And finally, here,

460
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:26,937
there's probably a lot more that you guys can come up with. But

461
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:30,079
one I've had a little bit of experience working with was the

462
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,762
narrative acts. So this is like a lot of our background was work

463
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:36,524
like just writing. We had a lot of writers on our team. So we

464
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:40,587
used a three-act structure to sort of inspire ourselves on

465
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:42,188
mission progression. So we would design.

466
00:27:42,848 --> 00:27:46,870
introduction zone so how you get where you get familiar with your concept then

467
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,811
the catalyst being the event or the cinematic that led you into the

468
00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:56,212
development phase of your mission so where the story sort of progressed so

469
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:59,153
the area where that happened and then the conclusion phase with the catalyst

470
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:02,754
in between which was once again another cinematic or something that led you into

471
00:28:02,754 --> 00:28:06,275
the final epic battle so it was neat intellectually

472
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:10,958
but where it fell apart is all those choke points in between the catalysts where we were sort of

473
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:18,081
breaking the appeal that open world had. Because, like, if everything is open world but then

474
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:21,843
you're choke pointing your player through a specific point, then you just lost everything

475
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:26,466
that you've worked for. So that one I would actually, if you can do it where you're not choke

476
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:27,726
pointing your player, I would actually recommend that.

477
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:31,489
It's way better, so think about it, but if you have to choke

478
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:34,892
point your player into specific moments, then you're really

479
00:28:34,892 --> 00:28:38,535
throwing the open world approach out the window, so probably not

480
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:42,078
the best thing to do. Now, in the previous example I showed

481
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:46,061
you before, we used two dimensions, so this is also a

482
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:50,045
possibility. It becomes harder to sort of visualize your data,

483
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:54,348
but it's something that you can do. We were using here, so

484
00:28:54,348 --> 00:28:55,129
difficulty progression.

485
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:57,391
as well as emotional progression.

486
00:28:57,391 --> 00:29:00,574
So in this case, I was using exposure as my emotion.

487
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,516
So the further you went out to the water,

488
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:05,639
the less objects you had to sort of

489
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:06,740
block line of sight with enemies,

490
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,901
and you were on water.

491
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:09,523
So the closer you got to the enemy,

492
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:12,806
the more exposed you were to the different enemies,

493
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:15,308
and also the risk of falling in the water and whatnot.

494
00:29:15,308 --> 00:29:17,090
So it's just one way to.

495
00:29:18,035 --> 00:29:23,899
progress things. Now, once you have your dimension isolated,

496
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:26,800
choose a theme. So this is the flavor. This is so if we were

497
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,141
talking about emotions earlier on, well, okay, like we

498
00:29:29,141 --> 00:29:32,103
generally on the project decide emotions are what we're going to

499
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,625
bank on, then is this mission going to be about vertigo or is

500
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:38,527
this mission going to be about love? Is this mission going to

501
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,688
be about like eating? I don't know.

502
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,957
this is just like the subset. It's the flavor you want to

503
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:49,061
choose for your given mission. The example I gave here is for

504
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:53,987
gameplay focused on AC, like the main pillars were acrobatics,

505
00:29:53,987 --> 00:29:58,073
stealth or fight. So we could decide this specific mission

506
00:29:58,073 --> 00:30:01,897
we're going to make it a stealth mission. So this is what I meant

507
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:02,178
by this.

508
00:30:04,684 --> 00:30:07,668
And finally, listing your appropriate ingredients.

509
00:30:07,668 --> 00:30:11,394
So this is taking all the ingredients you already have

510
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:14,618
in your bank, and then picking and choosing the ones that fit

511
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:17,242
the theme that you're going for.

512
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,786
As I said earlier on, these can be anything from like actual

513
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,927
game ingredients you already have in your bank. They could

514
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:29,908
be scripted events. So just a conversation between two people.

515
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:35,030
Explosions, things falling apart. They could be sound cues.

516
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:40,911
So just hearing like a bird chirp or like people screaming

517
00:30:40,911 --> 00:30:45,253
out in the distance. The wind. Like that type of stuff.

518
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:49,285
art assets. So like bioshock for instance, like all of the

519
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:52,227
graffiti that they would have in there, like the environmental

520
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:55,489
storytelling set ups that you could do, that fits pretty well

521
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:58,712
in the art assets section. Game play patterns, so this is more

522
00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:02,454
of an amalgamation of multiple game play objects together. So

523
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:05,216
when you see like, when I was talking about exposure in the

524
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,458
previous mission, we had a lot of moments where we would put

525
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,782
what we call troublemakers, so they were the crazy dudes,

526
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:16,168
they would just push you, put those next to really narrow

527
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:19,492
platforms, so that was for me a gameplay pattern where

528
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:22,256
putting guys near narrow platforms where I can fall,

529
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,758
I can re-instance that a couple places,

530
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,140
and that became a gameplay pattern.

531
00:31:27,588 --> 00:31:30,570
And finally, also list things that don't exist.

532
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,031
Like you don't have to go through the list of things that are there.

533
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:38,014
If you find that you're missing stuff in your list, like on any of these

534
00:31:38,014 --> 00:31:40,475
standpoints, you can propose things, right?

535
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:44,097
You can come up to any manager or content.

536
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:50,403
organizer and say, you know what, I'm missing ingredients for this type of motion, I'm missing

537
00:31:50,403 --> 00:31:54,826
ingredients to challenge a player on this type of gameplay focus, so just come out with

538
00:31:54,826 --> 00:32:00,952
your own proposals, prototype them if you can, and then you can help develop that list

539
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,973
of ingredients that can then be shared by other people.

540
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:08,616
Now the more variety you have in this, the better off you'll be.

541
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:10,657
Like the more objects you have, the better off you'll be,

542
00:32:10,657 --> 00:32:15,859
because especially when you're dealing with an open environment,

543
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:19,900
if you're reusing the same object over and over and over and over again,

544
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,961
that's cool in the sense that the player is going to recognize it

545
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:24,601
and be able to deal with it,

546
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:27,022
but you end up having the Flintstones syndrome

547
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:29,163
where it's just the same thing repeating over

548
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:32,044
and you notice the pattern and it becomes less compelling.

549
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:33,424
So the more...

550
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,021
deep your list goes, I think the more flexibility you guys will

551
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:40,883
have in the end. One thing you might want to do is also create

552
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:43,985
subcategories in there. So if you choose a given emotional

553
00:32:43,985 --> 00:32:48,768
theme or whatever, choose things that will complement the

554
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:50,850
progression in there. So things that are like

555
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:55,394
emotional state to stronger emotional state or something

556
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:59,878
that like flips to something that is like a different

557
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:04,242
dimension of those over time so that you then once you start

558
00:33:04,242 --> 00:33:08,646
applying it in your 2D method you can actually segment it per

559
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:09,186
world area.

560
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:15,281
And also, a neat thing that you can do with this is this is

561
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:18,405
where, as I said earlier on, you can notice this gameplay

562
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:22,109
thing is completely understaffed in ingredients, or

563
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:25,352
I don't have enough objects to represent this type of

564
00:33:25,352 --> 00:33:26,714
gameplay focus.

565
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:30,277
And on the flip side, you can actually notice the stuff that

566
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:31,939
you're using way too much.

567
00:33:31,939 --> 00:33:33,160
So it's a way to sort of.

568
00:33:33,732 --> 00:33:36,578
do an evaluation on the objects you have in your bank

569
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:39,744
and get an idea of like, do we have enough?

570
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:40,726
Do we not have enough?

571
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:43,251
So it's just another way to evaluate your own content.

572
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:50,065
Now here's an example I wanted to give for emotional things. I

573
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:53,588
mentioned vertigo. This is an example from assassin's creed 2.

574
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:56,110
It's the San Genniano assassination in Tuscany. So we

575
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,792
tag this mission as a vertigo mission. So going through the

576
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:01,694
list, we have a list of the things that we can do. We can

577
00:34:01,694 --> 00:34:04,396
do the things that we can't do. We can do the things that we

578
00:34:04,396 --> 00:34:06,177
can't do. We can do the things that we can't do. We can do the

579
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:10,419
objects we had, we isolated a couple ones that seemed to

580
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:13,481
complement that a little bit better. And so we ended up with

581
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:18,203
the swing pole. So the idea that you had like these poles that

582
00:34:18,203 --> 00:34:20,284
only your hands would touch, so that meant your feet were not

583
00:34:20,284 --> 00:34:22,845
touching the ground. So all of a sudden you lost a lot of your

584
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:26,647
security. So it played a little bit more with vertigo. Corner

585
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,208
swing, which was those objects that just like turned a corner

586
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:32,210
90 degrees. And so that one, you're putting your

587
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,473
your livelihood in the hands of the designer. Because you

588
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,596
didn't know where that was going. Just hoped that it led

589
00:34:38,596 --> 00:34:42,279
to something. Because there's a way, if the designer knew his

590
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:46,483
job, there's a real risk that you could jump onto those and

591
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:49,006
fall to your death afterwards. So.

592
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,068
that was another one that helped us a lot.

593
00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:52,989
Archers, so as you climb up,

594
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,692
having archers on opposing towers that could spot you,

595
00:34:55,692 --> 00:34:57,614
put you super exposed, and once again,

596
00:34:57,614 --> 00:35:00,476
you became very conscious of the lack of floor

597
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:02,438
underneath you.

598
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:04,400
Tightropes, so this is an easy one,

599
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,883
just having these really exposed tightropes between towers

600
00:35:07,883 --> 00:35:09,885
that you can just plunge underneath.

601
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:13,682
and once again exposed to those archers was a really good combination.

602
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:17,586
High buildings, so as you progress, and this is a feature of the San Gennaro towers,

603
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:23,834
like these are like really tall towers that like peak out from the really low horizon on all those buildings,

604
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:26,216
so that already just in its architecture helped us out.

605
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,961
on the less game play side we put in flying birds. So the

606
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:34,862
higher up you went you ended up like, oh, wow, I'm climbing

607
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:38,344
amongst a whole bunch of flocks of birds. So you became very

608
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,745
conscious of how high you were. Normally you wouldn't see those.

609
00:35:41,745 --> 00:35:43,967
They would be so high they were just background elements. When

610
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:48,429
you saw them next to you, oh, shit, I'm really high now. And

611
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,810
finally the wind ambiance. So going from a more

612
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:55,553
city atmosphere when we're at the bottom and then progressively

613
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:59,015
switching that to wind atmosphere once we got high up,

614
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:03,297
same thing, made you really conscious about the risk you

615
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:07,740
were now taking. Now here's an example of my game I never

616
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,422
worked on, but like I'm sure you're all familiar with the

617
00:36:11,422 --> 00:36:14,164
Fort Frolic mission from Bioshock 1.

618
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:19,603
talking with the mentors, they gave me a little bit of insight

619
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:21,944
on the mission. I found it really interesting and actually

620
00:36:21,944 --> 00:36:26,606
very appropriate. So the Fort Frolic mission came to in a

621
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:27,627
moment in the game where

622
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:37,119
you were getting pretty confident with your skills as well as the eerie nature of Rapture.

623
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:43,183
And so it was put in here to sort of destabilize you from that position of safety you were sort of

624
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:49,987
getting. So from my understanding, the intent from Jordan, the level designer on the mission,

625
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:53,509
was to destabilize the player. And to do so, he went through a bunch of different

626
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,468
in a way these enemies did not exist because they're not used

627
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:02,790
anywhere else in the game. This was like a unique place where

628
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,312
these are used. So up until now the player has been encountering

629
00:37:06,312 --> 00:37:08,953
dudes with guns. For the most part it's just a whole bunch of

630
00:37:08,953 --> 00:37:12,595
dudes with guns. And here you start encountering enemies that

631
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:13,055
can teleport.

632
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:17,376
they mainly attack you in melee. Like the only other enemy that

633
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:21,379
attacks you in melee was the big daddy, right? He was like a big

634
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:24,321
thing. So you already associated to something that, oh, man,

635
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:28,044
like this is not going to be comfortable. The fact that he

636
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:30,206
walked on walls, like, was not something you were used to

637
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,908
either. You were used to aiming at eye level and just ‑‑

638
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:36,130
shooting heads, right? And because they could walk on any

639
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,533
surface, that put you at ease. Like your aiming needed to

640
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:43,436
adjust. And finally, they used smoke grenades as well. And

641
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:46,518
they could disappear on top of that. So it just put you

642
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:52,862
completely uneased. And finally, the graffiti, like they used

643
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:55,764
that in the rest of the game, but it just helped to

644
00:37:55,764 --> 00:37:57,085
complement that really, really well.

645
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:03,879
And finally, this is my last example. I want to give an

646
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:06,941
example from Far Cry 4. Once again, I didn't work on this,

647
00:38:06,941 --> 00:38:10,423
but I sat down with my colleagues from Far Cry, so

648
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:13,845
Nicolai Duclos, their level design director, as well as

649
00:38:13,845 --> 00:38:16,726
Danny Paquette, their outpost designer. He's the guy who

650
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:19,588
designed pretty much all the outposts in Far Cry 3 and Far

651
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,129
Cry 4, so he knows what he's doing.

652
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:28,502
So here we have an outpost. The example I wanted to talk about

653
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:33,264
is the Shanath training ground in Far Cry 4. So this is the,

654
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:36,586
for anybody who's played, it's the dog kennel outpost.

655
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,674
Now, their focus here, it was a game play focus. They decided to

656
00:38:42,674 --> 00:38:47,758
focus on dogs. Now, dogs were really different object from all

657
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,000
the other enemies because they're animals. They're not

658
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,004
human beings. They don't have weapons other than their teeth.

659
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:58,447
And so the specific game play nature of them where they're

660
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,529
They're basically meat missiles, right?

661
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:04,191
They see you and they just run at you and chow down at you.

662
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:07,052
And they don't have as much strategy

663
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:08,033
as the other enemies have.

664
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:09,273
They won't take cover.

665
00:39:09,273 --> 00:39:12,335
If they see you, they jump at you and try to bite you.

666
00:39:16,797 --> 00:39:19,459
to find the best environment to sort of suit this game play

667
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:22,241
focus. Now, this is something the Far Cry team works a little

668
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:26,463
bit different than what I was used to on AC. But what they'll

669
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:30,826
do is they'll do Google map scouting. So when they know the

670
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,427
general area that their game takes place in, they go and

671
00:39:33,427 --> 00:39:37,130
take satellite footage of different areas and try and find

672
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,991
something that they find neat, like a distinct feature and

673
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:42,393
try to reproduce that in layout. So here like they found a

674
00:39:43,553 --> 00:39:48,615
some farm set up. I don't know exactly where this is, but

675
00:39:48,615 --> 00:39:52,256
somewhere. And so we took a screen shot and then, okay,

676
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,017
we're going to try to reproduce this. And then what I was saying

677
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,838
earlier on about like very simple block outs, like this is

678
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,700
a version of that. There's six blocks in here plus one cliff

679
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,862
difference. And you could start designing stuff with

680
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:14,500
block of it is this simple. So they reproduce that image that

681
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,902
we just saw. And then they started applying mission

682
00:40:18,902 --> 00:40:23,463
content onto it. So this setup is way simpler than what I

683
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,724
showed you earlier on. And that's intentional. It's just to

684
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,245
focus on something that's maybe easier to approach.

685
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:35,428
you can already see it just from this layout. I think you can

686
00:40:35,428 --> 00:40:39,392
sort of define how the areas are going to go. So let's see if you

687
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:45,157
guess properly. So when you start mocking it out, you can

688
00:40:45,157 --> 00:40:48,800
see the initial, that center zone which is that big open area.

689
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,022
Now, that's really appropriate for dogs. It's a big wide open

690
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:53,824
area. As soon as you get in there, they can spot. There's

691
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:55,986
nothing to really block them from approaching you. They can

692
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:56,906
run directly at you.

693
00:40:57,527 --> 00:41:01,630
and that secondary zone around it is basically the roadside.

694
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,753
And so this has more line of sight blockers. Dogs will have

695
00:41:05,753 --> 00:41:08,836
a little bit more problems seeing you. However, if they do

696
00:41:08,836 --> 00:41:12,679
see you, they can go through that geometry and try to get at

697
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,061
you, which makes it a little bit harder for you to shoot that.

698
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:16,522
And we'll get to that a little bit later on.

699
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:24,739
So here you can see also like, we're going to color it.

700
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:28,100
There's less zones than the previous examples that I gave.

701
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,640
Because it's an outpost.

702
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,021
It's not a mission.

703
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:34,322
The missions from AC, they were meant to be 15 minutes long.

704
00:41:34,322 --> 00:41:38,503
Outposts in general, you target about five minutes

705
00:41:38,503 --> 00:41:40,363
as a general rule.

706
00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:44,324
So you'll naturally have less zones in there.

707
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:49,231
And so an interesting thing here is like only the red and

708
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:51,993
yellow zones are actual gameplay zones in here.

709
00:41:51,993 --> 00:41:54,255
The green zone is what I was talking about a little bit

710
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:56,457
earlier on.

711
00:41:56,457 --> 00:41:57,638
It's an approach zone.

712
00:41:57,638 --> 00:42:01,182
It's an area that has no direct challenge to the player.

713
00:42:01,182 --> 00:42:04,765
It's more a get familiar with your environment zone.

714
00:42:04,765 --> 00:42:10,510
So I'll give a couple examples of that in the next slides.

715
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,051
But as I said, it's really an area that you can use to your

716
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:17,451
advantage to sort of get the player familiar with the

717
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,352
general things he's going to encounter without necessarily

718
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:21,992
challenging him. And you don't want him, you don't want to put

719
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:25,193
anything in there that's going to like alert his presence to

720
00:42:25,193 --> 00:42:27,033
the enemies. Unless like he's being stupid and throwing

721
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:28,973
grenades everywhere in the middle of the forest and trying

722
00:42:28,973 --> 00:42:33,614
to kill trees for some reason. Like this is really just like

723
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:36,895
get the layout of the world. And so for anybody who's played

724
00:42:36,895 --> 00:42:37,995
any of the Far Cry games,

725
00:42:39,576 --> 00:42:44,081
It's also where you usually get your points of view. So

726
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:48,086
elevated areas that you can just get higher ground and see what

727
00:42:48,086 --> 00:42:52,971
the hell is going on. In safety for the most part, there's very

728
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,955
little risk of exposure. And this is where you will make your

729
00:42:55,955 --> 00:42:56,615
plan as a player.

730
00:42:58,277 --> 00:43:00,879
So here like there's like basically three elevated zones

731
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:03,501
around the area where the player can do that.

732
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:04,502
Once again, it's an open world,

733
00:43:04,502 --> 00:43:05,583
so you need to prepare for that, right?

734
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,603
You need to prepare that the player

735
00:43:06,603 --> 00:43:07,864
is going to be approaching like here,

736
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:11,407
there's a weakness on the left side.

737
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:12,788
If I'm approaching from the west side here,

738
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:16,070
there are no Vista points in there, right?

739
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,312
So luckily there's three other ones.

740
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:19,173
So like as you approach,

741
00:43:19,173 --> 00:43:20,574
you can see that there's higher levels.

742
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:21,915
And so the player can just circumvent

743
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:23,696
and try and like go around the setup

744
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:24,577
to eventually get to there

745
00:43:24,577 --> 00:43:25,858
if he wants to have more information.

746
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:29,143
or he could just go in guns blazing without the information

747
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:31,748
needed. And that was intentional here actually. The main road

748
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:34,914
leads into there. So it was like the way to go the fight route

749
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:35,314
in here.

750
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:42,073
Now, once you have that approach zone sort of set up, this is

751
00:43:42,073 --> 00:43:44,533
where now you can start distributing ingredients in

752
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:46,494
there. So we said it's dogs. This is the focus of this

753
00:43:46,494 --> 00:43:49,475
mission was dogs. So the center there was the penultimate area.

754
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:51,335
It's multiple objectives here. You have to kill everybody

755
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:53,616
basically to win the challenge. So the majority of the dogs will

756
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:55,196
be present in that little area. Fighting more than one dog is

757
00:43:55,196 --> 00:43:56,736
obviously harder. And that's away from the screen is what

758
00:43:56,736 --> 00:43:58,877
it's going to be. I'm going to click on run and I hope that

759
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:01,057
something happens. That's the point. And thinking about

760
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:03,718
what to do and trying to capture what's going on and how to

761
00:44:03,718 --> 00:44:06,038
distribute that to the sub-routes. Exactly. You're

762
00:44:06,038 --> 00:44:08,699
going to see the forest is, yes, getting our tools for the

763
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:14,665
and they have little geometry to sort of block them from seeing you.

764
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:17,006
Now on the outside, a little bit less dogs,

765
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:18,847
they're isolated one from the other.

766
00:44:18,847 --> 00:44:21,349
The two at the bottom there are actually in cages,

767
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:22,429
so they can't really get to you.

768
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:24,670
You can shoot them through the cage,

769
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:27,131
or if you're unlucky, then you just broke the cage

770
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,972
and they start running after you.

771
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:32,154
But this is where you get familiar with the GameBly object

772
00:44:32,154 --> 00:44:33,955
and you're able to take it out by yourself

773
00:44:33,955 --> 00:44:36,216
without it warning anything else, hopefully.

774
00:44:38,485 --> 00:44:43,629
Now next step is putting in your guards. Here the designer put in only one single

775
00:44:43,629 --> 00:44:47,092
human guard in there and that was intentional. Once again, the focus is on

776
00:44:47,092 --> 00:44:51,135
dogs. You don't want to dilute their presence by adding too many enemies

777
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:55,158
because at that point it becomes a game about guards that have dogs instead of

778
00:44:55,158 --> 00:45:00,141
being a setup that is about dogs with

779
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:04,681
a couple guards around. So that was intentional here. And this

780
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:08,646
is the hardest guard in this general setup. Not in the game.

781
00:45:08,646 --> 00:45:12,069
It's just a second level guard. But of the area, this is going

782
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:14,192
to be the hardest guard. So it just makes him stand out from

783
00:45:14,192 --> 00:45:16,214
all the other ones and he acts as a handler.

784
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:22,450
Now, he added the weakest guards in the game are these three

785
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,592
guys that he added. These, they mainly act as warning bells,

786
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:29,834
right? Like for the guards. Like if these guys detect you, they

787
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:32,655
will alert the guards, the dogs and then the dogs come running

788
00:45:32,655 --> 00:45:37,377
after you. And he placed them in areas really close to the

789
00:45:38,418 --> 00:45:42,240
stealth entrances. So they're really easy to take these guys

790
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,682
out. So anybody who's done the job of properly scouting can

791
00:45:45,682 --> 00:45:49,104
take these guys out individually and then he's left to just

792
00:45:49,104 --> 00:45:52,986
dealing with the dogs. And then afterwards he just did the

793
00:45:52,986 --> 00:45:57,989
passive, like the boilerplate stuff, the reinforcements, any

794
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:01,111
flammable surfaces and the alarm bell.

795
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:04,154
So a lot of this, you can imagine, is reverse engineering

796
00:46:04,154 --> 00:46:05,916
of what some guy did.

797
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:06,717
He didn't do this job.

798
00:46:06,717 --> 00:46:08,479
He did it instinctually.

799
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:11,883
Most of the defining of the zones, he did that just by

800
00:46:11,883 --> 00:46:12,604
looking at the content.

801
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,647
So as I said at the very beginning, this is probably

802
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,809
stuff that a lot of you are doing.

803
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:19,052
But it's just by adding that visualization layer, you can

804
00:46:19,052 --> 00:46:19,672
realize.

805
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:22,895
if you're doing your job correctly or not, and if there's

806
00:46:22,895 --> 00:46:27,259
stuff that's missing. So here, by doing this exercise and

807
00:46:27,259 --> 00:46:31,222
talking to the designer, we realized that that green zone

808
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:34,085
could have been used a little bit more than just a general

809
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:36,967
approach zone. Like we could have dropped in empty cages.

810
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:45,413
to warn the player that, hey, there might be dogs coming up or mangled beasts or civilians that

811
00:46:45,413 --> 00:46:50,957
had been mauled by the guards or like just those weaker guards again that are just like calling

812
00:46:50,957 --> 00:46:55,600
out and trying to find their lost dog or something like that, right? So you're just warning the

813
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:01,805
player that these ingredients are coming without, once again, creating any form of conflict or any

814
00:47:01,805 --> 00:47:02,485
challenge area.

815
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,121
and then you get into the engine and you adapt. You need to

816
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:13,402
actually build this thing, right? So as soon as the guy

817
00:47:13,402 --> 00:47:16,543
had planned it out, they spent about a week less on this

818
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:19,284
document. Same thing for assassins. We don't spend that

819
00:47:19,284 --> 00:47:21,685
much time on the actual documentation phase. It's more

820
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:25,866
to get your brain juices flowing. So they dropped it in,

821
00:47:25,866 --> 00:47:28,007
started building. This is the final set up. This is what it

822
00:47:28,007 --> 00:47:31,908
looks like. Now, one thing they noticed, I mentioned earlier on

823
00:47:31,908 --> 00:47:32,548
was that.

824
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:36,772
Covers are really, really, really shit when it comes to

825
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:39,274
dogs because the dogs, they're lower, right?

826
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:41,537
And the player, as I said for the Bioshock example, you're

827
00:47:41,537 --> 00:47:43,899
used to aiming like at head level.

828
00:47:43,899 --> 00:47:46,562
And so the dogs are so much lower, so you're actually

829
00:47:46,562 --> 00:47:48,263
aiming down, and that's really, really hard for the

830
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:48,784
player to do.

831
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:52,631
If they're coming in a straight line, you have a chance.

832
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:54,934
You can actually track them and shoot them down,

833
00:47:54,934 --> 00:47:58,178
but if they're dodging and darting through geometry,

834
00:47:58,178 --> 00:48:01,282
that makes it super hard, because it's just something

835
00:48:01,282 --> 00:48:03,324
that enemies don't do normally.

836
00:48:03,324 --> 00:48:05,087
So they ended up removing all the cover,

837
00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:08,511
and then more focusing on when you try and...

838
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:13,212
that central area, creating lanes that you can sort of dart

839
00:48:13,212 --> 00:48:16,673
into and then when the dog is coming at you, it's just a

840
00:48:16,673 --> 00:48:18,993
straight tunnel. It's actually just a shooting fish in a

841
00:48:18,993 --> 00:48:23,074
barrel almost. And once again, this is the only stuff they

842
00:48:23,074 --> 00:48:28,996
could realize once they got into the engine.

843
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:34,224
Now, what sucks about this method? I've been using this for

844
00:48:34,224 --> 00:48:40,030
ten years now. I'm well aware that it's not perfect. It really

845
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,132
is a set of like a starting point. There's a whole bunch of

846
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:44,074
things that like don't work so well about it.

847
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:48,838
really dependent on your block out. As I said at the

848
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:51,520
beginning, if you don't have a block out, you can't do much

849
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,183
with this. So you need to actually create content before

850
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:58,645
you can start even thinking about applying this. Same thing

851
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:01,828
for the game play ingredients. If you don't have a list of

852
00:49:01,828 --> 00:49:04,069
game play ingredients, you're a little bit screwed. You're

853
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:07,972
going to get blank page syndrome. So I highly suggest

854
00:49:07,972 --> 00:49:10,194
getting some of that stuff out of the way before you start

855
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:12,015
applying the method.

856
00:49:15,765 --> 00:49:21,849
sorry. Like any documentation, it gets quickly outdated. I'm

857
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:26,652
sure you've all worked on documents that nobody reads or

858
00:49:26,652 --> 00:49:31,035
that like if you look up your final documentation in

859
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:33,917
comparison to the final game you created, like they don't match

860
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:34,817
really, that's okay.

861
00:49:35,518 --> 00:49:39,321
don't worry about that. That's actually a good thing. Documentation is not meant to be kept.

862
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:44,546
It's meant to be thrown away. It's mainly meant for your brain to get used to the idea and

863
00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:49,070
start playing around with shit. As soon as you have that, get into the engine and start

864
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:53,855
building stuff. So this is actually, yes, it's a downside that's quickly outdated, but it's

865
00:49:53,855 --> 00:49:55,296
not the end of the world. However,

866
00:49:55,857 --> 00:49:59,078
There are interesting things that can be done. The firecracker

867
00:49:59,078 --> 00:50:01,578
team actually developed a thing internally where they call

868
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:06,080
atlas. It's a visualization tool that keeps in sync with the

869
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,561
engine. So any time you move around enemies or like any

870
00:50:10,561 --> 00:50:13,222
gameplay object, there's actually like a position that is

871
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:15,703
known that is sent to the tool. So

872
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:19,525
you can do your prep work in that tool, go into the engine,

873
00:50:19,525 --> 00:50:23,168
move things around, and then as soon as you move it around, it's

874
00:50:23,168 --> 00:50:31,835
updated to the actual file. So it's a way to sort of keep your

875
00:50:31,835 --> 00:50:37,920
document alive and living, but once again, don't rely too much

876
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,743
on it. And in game is better. And finally, oops, sorry.

877
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:46,953
it's not 3D. That's the biggest problem with the tool. It's all

878
00:50:46,953 --> 00:50:51,034
2D. So for the most part, like on AC and on far cry, it's not

879
00:50:51,034 --> 00:50:53,675
the end of the world because yes, the game is 3D, but it's

880
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:57,216
not really. In ratio when you look at your world, everything

881
00:50:57,216 --> 00:51:00,958
is so spread out that the height difference does not match really

882
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:04,019
the spread that you have on things. So the 2D method is not

883
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,320
the end of the world. It actually functions in the state.

884
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,921
where it doesn't work as well is if you have a lot of

885
00:51:11,921 --> 00:51:16,623
verticality. So if you're like the towers in fallout, like all

886
00:51:16,623 --> 00:51:21,705
those really high sky rises that are networked in fallout, like

887
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:23,926
you wouldn't be able to do this. You would lose a lot of that

888
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:27,988
verticality info in there. The high rise section in sunset

889
00:51:27,988 --> 00:51:31,129
overdrive, that was the same thing. Everything is so high

890
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,770
that you end up actually looking at your level more like on a

891
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:36,991
profile view than on a top view. Or like...

892
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,712
anything like in space, right? Like if you're using star

893
00:51:39,712 --> 00:51:43,994
citizen where it's really 366 axis approach where you can

894
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:47,896
approach it top, bottom, left, right, any direction, you can't

895
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:51,657
apply this. This does not work for that. So...

896
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:58,499
Looking towards the future, I'd be curious about trying the 3D

897
00:51:58,499 --> 00:52:02,080
approach, so using a 3D mockup tool, so either SketchUp or 3DS

898
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,562
Max. If you can do it in your engine simply by putting colored

899
00:52:06,562 --> 00:52:10,583
volumes and whatnot in there and creating really a 3D sphere as

900
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:13,844
you get closer, obviously these are geometric shapes. Oftentimes

901
00:52:13,844 --> 00:52:16,045
when you look at triggers, you want to be able to make

902
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:19,626
composite shapes that lead up towards it. But in the future,

903
00:52:19,626 --> 00:52:21,927
I'd like to try this using this type of approach.

904
00:52:24,615 --> 00:52:31,697
And in conclusion, these are the steps that we went through for

905
00:52:31,697 --> 00:52:37,038
the approach. So starting with your top down, identifying your

906
00:52:37,038 --> 00:52:39,838
zones in there, listing ingredients that are

907
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:43,319
complementary to your machine design, distributing the

908
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:46,920
ingredients and then most importantly getting in the

909
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,500
engine and actually building the thing. Thank you. That's it.

910
00:53:00,713 --> 00:53:01,712
And now we'll take questions.

911
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:14,133
Hi, thanks for the talk. I really loved Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Assassin's Creed 2, all those games, big fan.

912
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:26,000
I was wondering, as a level designer you're building gameplay on top of blockout architecture, and you're naturally drawn to the paths that architecture elicits from you.

913
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,743
And I was wondering, like, landmarks draw players towards them, bridges draw you underneath.

914
00:53:31,144 --> 00:53:38,667
And I was wondering if you had any tips or tricks for that kind of 3D architecture stage of the level design.

915
00:53:39,731 --> 00:53:42,074
So on that standpoint, usually what I try to go through is

916
00:53:42,074 --> 00:53:48,179
creating like a grid of landmarks that are like the main

917
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:51,002
navigation points between objects. So like especially in

918
00:53:51,002 --> 00:53:55,146
things like in assassin's creed or even fallout where you're

919
00:53:55,146 --> 00:53:57,448
recreating a real environment. There are landmarks that you

920
00:53:57,448 --> 00:53:59,790
sort of expect to see. But if you're not doing that, a lot of

921
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:03,654
the multiplayer games do it with landmarking certain

922
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:07,096
regions of it and everything in between is more like the lanes

923
00:54:07,096 --> 00:54:09,817
that go in between them. So by creating those points of

924
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:12,939
interest that you go from one point navigating to the other.

925
00:54:12,939 --> 00:54:16,421
So if I'm any given point I can see a landmark or this is where

926
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:19,802
I'm going to go. And then you end up creating a grid, right?

927
00:54:19,802 --> 00:54:23,464
So when I was on assassins the general rule we had is

928
00:54:24,085 --> 00:54:28,509
on any given landmark, if I'm near one, I can see at least two

929
00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:31,332
other landmarks from that position that are going to be

930
00:54:31,332 --> 00:54:35,916
like 100 meters away. And that creates like my meta navigation

931
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:39,079
method that I can just move from one point to the other.

932
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:40,580
That sounds great. Thank you.

933
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:47,651
all right and my question is so kind of especially with

934
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:50,894
assassins creed where you kind of have these especially round

935
00:54:50,894 --> 00:54:53,636
environments usually in a city and you're usually kind of

936
00:54:53,636 --> 00:54:56,999
targeting one area of the city and there's a lot of these kind

937
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:59,562
of side objectives and side missions. How do you

938
00:55:00,943 --> 00:55:03,924
how do you keep that interesting for the player when they're

939
00:55:03,924 --> 00:55:07,446
kind of intended to go from point A to point B but you're

940
00:55:07,446 --> 00:55:10,248
trying to keep them interested in moving around, kind of doing

941
00:55:10,248 --> 00:55:14,350
a lot of what sometimes can seem very repetitive.

942
00:55:15,544 --> 00:55:17,805
to cut you off for a second. We're going to do a few more

943
00:55:17,805 --> 00:55:21,587
questions for Felipe's talk. But if you're here for the portfolio

944
00:55:21,587 --> 00:55:24,409
review and you have materials that you need to get on USB

945
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:28,491
drive, Grant standing here behind the mic, he has a thumb

946
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,173
drive that you can use to drop your files on to. We can get all

947
00:55:31,173 --> 00:55:34,335
that stuff prepared so we have minimum amount of bumps as we go

948
00:55:34,335 --> 00:55:36,056
into the lunchtime review.

949
00:55:37,177 --> 00:55:41,063
So basically what we do for that is, so you have your main line

950
00:55:41,063 --> 00:55:41,944
structure view, right?

951
00:55:41,944 --> 00:55:45,610
Like going from one main mission to the next main mission to the

952
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,153
next mission, or even parts of a main mission to another one.

953
00:55:48,153 --> 00:55:50,457
And those are going to be distributed throughout your city

954
00:55:50,457 --> 00:55:52,259
or your general game space.

955
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:56,168
and so good practice is actually have like a lot of distance

956
00:55:56,168 --> 00:55:59,331
between those so that the player is then navigating through your

957
00:55:59,331 --> 00:56:01,912
open world, your systemic environment, and then creating

958
00:56:01,912 --> 00:56:04,755
opportunities or just distributing opportunities in

959
00:56:04,755 --> 00:56:08,517
there for him to sort of pique his curiosity, right? So if I'm

960
00:56:08,517 --> 00:56:11,580
leaving here to there, then putting like a, like

961
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,242
pick pocket challenge or a couple treasure chests on the

962
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:18,245
way. And that creates like the first game I remember doing that

963
00:56:18,245 --> 00:56:21,187
is playing crackdown where I was going to mission objective and

964
00:56:21,187 --> 00:56:24,489
then seeing like those glowing orbs and then realizing two

965
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:28,673
hours later that I was still on my way to that given objective,

966
00:56:28,673 --> 00:56:31,275
right? So it's good practice to do that. Just space things out

967
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:35,178
so you give a chance to the player to actually experience

968
00:56:35,178 --> 00:56:36,078
your game world.

969
00:56:37,482 --> 00:56:41,743
you. No problem. Thanks for the talk. First off I just had a

970
00:56:41,743 --> 00:56:45,565
quick question. What are your thoughts on, you know, as the

971
00:56:45,565 --> 00:56:48,846
port for an example, you'll maybe spend an hour or two in

972
00:56:48,846 --> 00:56:52,488
there outside of a mission and that will have an established

973
00:56:52,488 --> 00:56:54,308
structure to it that the player will learn.

974
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:58,373
what are your thoughts on subverting that structure for

975
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:02,077
the sake of the narrative. If you have established zones and

976
00:57:02,077 --> 00:57:06,041
those aren't supported in the neutral structure, kind of

977
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:09,165
changing that rule set and catching people off guard.

978
00:57:09,165 --> 00:57:09,946
It's interesting.

979
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:14,069
For the most part, you don't want to change it too much

980
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:17,031
because the player has gotten a bit of experience

981
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:17,751
in your game space.

982
00:57:17,751 --> 00:57:19,552
So you want them to have that advantage.

983
00:57:19,552 --> 00:57:21,313
Because I've mastered this area, I now

984
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,395
have a little bit of ownership onto it.

985
00:57:23,395 --> 00:57:26,517
It's totally cool to have something that just changes

986
00:57:26,517 --> 00:57:29,238
the setup, so just to put them a little bit on ease.

987
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:32,340
As long as it's explainable, it makes sense that it happened.

988
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,301
So he understands why it happened.

989
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:36,363
It's different than what he went through earlier on.

990
00:57:36,363 --> 00:57:38,004
So that's totally cool to do that.

991
00:57:41,107 --> 00:57:47,888
I had another point on that one. Yeah, I completely forgot.

992
00:57:47,888 --> 00:57:50,889
But no, like it's totally okay to actually flip stuff around.

993
00:57:50,889 --> 00:57:54,890
Just make sure that, like, your engine supports it. Like, stuff

994
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:58,271
that we try to do, like, switching things dynamically

995
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:03,032
just is much harder to do in open world space because, like,

996
00:58:03,032 --> 00:58:05,412
there's, you know, geometry, nav mesh and whatnot to consider.

997
00:58:05,412 --> 00:58:07,973
So it's the ‑‑ you have to deal with the technical

998
00:58:07,973 --> 00:58:10,253
difficulties about doing that.

999
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:15,559
Ideally what you want, though, and this is the hardest thing to

1000
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:18,723
do technically or memory wise, is that if there is a change in

1001
00:58:18,723 --> 00:58:21,986
the world, you want to save that game state so that when you come

1002
00:58:21,986 --> 00:58:24,589
back, like, there's memory of what the player did in there.

1003
00:58:24,589 --> 00:58:27,032
And so, like, one of the first ones I remember is, like,

1004
00:58:27,032 --> 00:58:30,897
playing old GTA games where I had a mission and the whole

1005
00:58:30,897 --> 00:58:31,998
building, like, went on fire.

1006
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,320
so every time I came back to that area, I was driving my car

1007
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,841
and said, this is the building where shit blew up. So creating

1008
00:58:38,841 --> 00:58:43,223
that memory space inside of your game is also pretty good

1009
00:58:43,223 --> 00:58:44,944
practice. No problem.

1010
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:53,763
I have a question about Assassin's Creed Black Flag. How exactly did you guys do the layout for

1011
00:58:53,763 --> 00:59:01,025
the islands and like the distance in between islands to where you keep the player interested

1012
00:59:01,025 --> 00:59:07,407
but you also give them a chance to just zone out for a bit while sailing?

1013
00:59:07,407 --> 00:59:11,848
So I didn't personally work on Black Flag so it's, I'm gonna guess.

1014
00:59:13,836 --> 00:59:15,797
but it's the same thing as what I was saying earlier on where

1015
00:59:15,797 --> 00:59:20,342
like you create a discovery grid where you space out your main

1016
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:23,585
objectives between things and in between those objectives you

1017
00:59:23,585 --> 00:59:28,049
want to distribute opportunities or points of interest on a

1018
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:29,310
fairly regular basis.

1019
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:33,312
when I was on brotherhood our general rule was like you want

1020
00:59:33,312 --> 00:59:39,034
to create opportunity points like every 50 meters on a grid.

1021
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:42,295
And then black flag is probably bigger because especially in the

1022
00:59:42,295 --> 00:59:45,356
naval stuff, your speed of travel is much bigger. So

1023
00:59:45,356 --> 00:59:47,937
there's probably a correlation to be done with like amount of

1024
00:59:47,937 --> 00:59:51,758
time I need to move before encountering something else as

1025
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:52,618
well as the mini map.

1026
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,122
so making sure that you're teasing these opportunities on

1027
00:59:56,122 --> 00:59:59,206
that mini map so that at any given point I have like two or

1028
00:59:59,206 --> 01:00:02,589
three things that are there that can draw my attention. And

1029
01:00:02,589 --> 01:00:07,034
don't go overboard because at some point it just becomes like

1030
01:00:07,034 --> 01:00:11,780
icon stuff. No problem. Cool. All right. One more.

1031
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:19,913
So, with open world, you kind of often have to reuse a lot of the same systems for people

1032
01:00:19,913 --> 01:00:25,636
to understand what they're doing, which can often maybe lead to boredom, which is like

1033
01:00:25,636 --> 01:00:26,637
irrepetitiveness.

1034
01:00:26,637 --> 01:00:34,361
And do you have any thoughts on how to balance the player knowing what they're doing versus

1035
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:35,442
being bored of it?

1036
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:41,315
something I'm still struggling with in general. Trying to find

1037
01:00:41,315 --> 01:00:43,580
the right formula to expose the player to these things.

1038
01:00:44,717 --> 01:00:46,958
Right now, I'm sort of like, there's a couple camps, right?

1039
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,860
There's the camp where just give everything to the player and

1040
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:52,441
let him go at it, which is good.

1041
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:54,042
I mean, it's an open world game, right?

1042
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:57,003
Like, you want the player to have access as much of the

1043
01:00:57,003 --> 01:00:58,304
content as you can.

1044
01:00:58,304 --> 01:01:01,225
However, the risk you have with that one is he can get

1045
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:03,647
familiar with a lot of it really, really quickly.

1046
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:06,988
And you're left with no more cards in your deck.

1047
01:01:06,988 --> 01:01:09,830
So there's nothing you can surprise him with.

1048
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:14,232
My current standpoint on that one is to just, yes, put a lot

1049
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:17,734
of cards on the table when you start, but keep at least half

1050
01:01:17,734 --> 01:01:20,876
of your deck hidden so that as you progress throughout the

1051
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:24,138
game, as the player gets more skilled, you don't have to do

1052
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,499
it on a linear standpoint.

1053
01:01:25,499 --> 01:01:26,460
You can do it in branches.

1054
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,544
all the stuff from the Skyrim games where you have the mage's

1055
01:01:31,544 --> 01:01:34,086
guild, depending on how far they are in there you can start

1056
01:01:34,086 --> 01:01:38,070
introducing new elements or new gameplay features in there. But

1057
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,652
I tend to want to hide some stuff that I can just gently

1058
01:01:40,652 --> 01:01:43,955
expose as the player goes on. So you're always giving them

1059
01:01:43,955 --> 01:01:46,737
surprises. A kind of follow-up question is when do you think if

1060
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:53,823
you have categories for missions very clearly set up like how you

1061
01:01:53,823 --> 01:01:54,744
develop them?

1062
01:01:55,885 --> 01:02:01,971
do you think that can affect the repetition of things if you have them very clearly set up?

1063
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:07,617
Like these are outpost missions, these are assassination missions with this. Do you think

1064
01:02:07,617 --> 01:02:10,080
there might be a point of obfuscating that in development somehow?

1065
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,902
I think like as long as you have enough

1066
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:16,085
tools to create variety on top of that, it's not a problem.

1067
01:02:16,085 --> 01:02:20,848
Because like patterns are good. Patterns are your friend.

1068
01:02:20,848 --> 01:02:24,771
Players like to see things that are like, oh, I know how to do

1069
01:02:24,771 --> 01:02:28,374
this. But then inside of that this, inside of that content,

1070
01:02:28,374 --> 01:02:30,615
so the now post, for instance, that's where you start playing

1071
01:02:30,615 --> 01:02:32,317
with the ingredients I was mentioning earlier on and

1072
01:02:32,317 --> 01:02:37,020
layering them to create surprise and differences. So play with

1073
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,600
the objective type, but

1074
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:44,129
having a couple like recurring game play objectives is actually

1075
01:02:44,129 --> 01:02:48,738
a good thing. Thanks a lot. No problem. Cool. Thank you all.
