1
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:07,270
All right, good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,592
Welcome to Far Cry 4, Gameplay Team Workflow,

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,573
Iteration, and Philosophy.

4
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:14,195
Now I was asked to tell you guys to please turn off

5
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:18,858
your cell phones and rate the session after we're done.

6
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:21,520
Now that this is done, let's get started.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,702
So first of all, I'd like to introduce myself.

8
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:26,063
My name is Marc-André Saunier.

9
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:32,402
I graduated from École Polytechnique de Montréal in 2009, software engineer.

10
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:34,803
I worked in some smaller games early on in my career.

11
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:40,707
I joined Far Cry 3 as a core gameplay programmer, where I worked on navigation, combat, and

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,010
takedowns and all this stuff.

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,052
Now in Far Cry 4, I acted as a lead gameplay programmer, which is what I'm here to talk

14
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:49,814
to you about.

15
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:51,135
Now why am I doing this talk?

16
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:56,262
Not gonna lie, it's pretty cold in Canada right now.

17
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:59,643
I just wanted to get down here in the heat.

18
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:03,103
I mean, anybody else in the room coming from, like, a really cold place?

19
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:04,944
Yeah, oh, okay.

20
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:06,544
So I'm not the only one who had this idea.

21
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:07,684
Okay, great, I like it.

22
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:11,105
In all seriousness, though, the reason why this talk is...

23
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:15,465
So over the course of the last five years on the Far Cry gameplay team,

24
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:17,806
we've really refined our production workflow,

25
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:21,226
and we eventually came up with something that allows us to iterate very efficiently

26
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:21,907
and be quite flexible.

27
00:01:22,628 --> 00:01:26,330
It's kind of almost as if we were a small team even though we're a very big team.

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,972
Now, there's kind of a lot of stuff going on.

29
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:32,514
I'm going to be talking a little bit about management, a little bit about production,

30
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:33,674
some game design.

31
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:38,617
What you should get away from this presentation is when you leave you'll have a really good

32
00:01:38,617 --> 00:01:43,979
idea of how the gameplay team on Far Cry works, how we operate, how we're structured, how

33
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,461
we build our features really from start to finish.

34
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:50,063
And hopefully you guys can walk away with some ideas maybe that you could try on your

35
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:50,423
own projects.

36
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:58,036
Now, before we get into the too deep stuff, I just want to clarify some things just to

37
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:01,598
make sure we're on the same page. I'd like to talk about what the mandate of our gameplay

38
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:06,080
team is. So the very first things, I mean, the stuff that's very in your face, right?

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,123
So the weapons, the vehicles, all the player abilities and the skills, such as the takedowns

40
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:14,684
or if you heal yourself, all this nice stuff.

41
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:18,048
interactive objects like the new grapple tool we introduced in Far Cry 4,

42
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:23,295
and everything that is destructible objects, actually, just the game systems behind them,

43
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:27,681
and also the assets, and so basically this is all part of the gameplay team mandate.

44
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,505
There's also the stuff that's not as in-your-face.

45
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:35,676
So we did the arena on Far Cry 4, all the player replication,

46
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:39,320
the systems that are underlying, such as the saving,

47
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,523
the input systems, the player replication,

48
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:42,744
the scripting system.

49
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:46,388
Basically, what I'm trying to get at is it's kind of a big

50
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:46,989
band-aid.

51
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,111
We do have a big team, but we still need to be structured in

52
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:50,693
this way to be able to really pull through.

53
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:56,456
Now, this is the only slide where I'm going to really talk about project structure.

54
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:59,880
And this is for you to really situate what the gameplay team does

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,043
and how it works with other teams within the project.

56
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:06,428
Now, what you'll see here is our project is really divided into many different teams.

57
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:09,371
And the different teams have ownerships over different areas of the game.

58
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,153
The gameplay team being one of them,

59
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:12,975
you now know where the mandate for the gameplay team is.

60
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:14,936
And there are other teams that we interact with.

61
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:17,176
AI is separate from gameplay in our case.

62
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:18,996
I know several productions like to have

63
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:20,377
them included together.

64
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,437
In our case, we separate them.

65
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:24,718
We have missions teams, which would be the guy that would be

66
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:25,898
crafting the missions for the game.

67
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:29,138
And the presentation team is what I guess what people

68
00:03:29,138 --> 00:03:30,119
typically call UI.

69
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:34,859
So they do menus, HUDs, maps, and all this fancy stuff.

70
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,660
One important thing here is that every one of those teams

71
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,101
really have definite ownership over their

72
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:42,801
various areas of the game.

73
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:48,049
Now, in terms of gameplay team structure, if you look at the diagram on the right, you

74
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:52,771
might think, okay, this is, this is a fairly standard organization, you know, so your project

75
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:57,613
has management, and then you have the different departments. But this is not, this is not

76
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:03,155
a project structure, this is really the team structure. So the key thing is, on the gameplay

77
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:07,416
team, we have our own animators, we have our own programmers, our own game designers.

78
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,126
We have our own testers, actually.

79
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:11,006
Well, it's dev testers.

80
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:13,708
I'll get into the details as to what they do later on.

81
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,209
So we have all our resources.

82
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,790
And what's great about this is we're really masters of our

83
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,731
own planning.

84
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:21,152
We don't have to wait or rely on an outside department.

85
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:23,714
Or if there was, for example, an animation department that

86
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:27,616
relies on, that actually serves the whole project, if

87
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,697
they're really busy working on something else for another

88
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:31,418
team, then we can't necessarily have support.

89
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:34,440
So if we have our own people, we're masters of our own

90
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,242
planning, we can iterate very efficiently.

91
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:41,603
I need help from animation, I can just poke my buddy who's right next to me, he's on the same team.

92
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:42,904
Hey, could you unblock me on this?

93
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:45,765
And then we can get the ball rolling really fast.

94
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:48,946
Now, like I said,

95
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:54,208
one very important thing is the team really has ownership over gameplay.

96
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,550
So we decide the gameplay, what goes into the game,

97
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,550
and I'll get into the details of how we do this.

98
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,493
I want to talk about the floor plan a little bit.

99
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:06,974
And this sounds, I guess this might sound a little bit goofy,

100
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,555
but I want to talk about this because it makes a very big difference in

101
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:13,535
how fast you can iterate and what your production workflow is going to look like.

102
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:18,456
So what you see here, we have the various disciplines within the gameplay team.

103
00:05:18,456 --> 00:05:20,837
Just, by the way, I might say gameplay cell every now and then.

104
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,337
Cell and team are really the same thing.

105
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:24,218
I just might, you know, say one or another.

106
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,340
So within the team we have the various trays.

107
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,001
Like you see on the top, that would be the windows.

108
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,623
Then we have meeting rooms down there.

109
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:31,425
So the key thing is the people are seated together

110
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,647
all in the same area.

111
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:35,449
Now, what we want to do is really

112
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,991
try to make it so the people that

113
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:39,333
interact the most together to be seated nearby.

114
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:42,936
A very good example would be gameplay programmers and gameplay animators.

115
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:46,559
We want them to sit back to back or really right next to one another.

116
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:50,682
And as ridiculous as this sounds, we found that sitting people just right next to one

117
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:55,085
another instead of like five seats away will really significantly increase the production

118
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:58,828
workflow because they're essentially, like you're always more buddies with the guy sitting

119
00:05:58,828 --> 00:05:59,689
right next to you at work.

120
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:00,469
You spend like 40 hours a day.

121
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:06,714
You're buddies and you talk and it just becomes very natural to share the information.

122
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:06,754
So.

123
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:13,200
I was, this is, this is not necessarily the best floor plan that we've ever had.

124
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,562
The reason behind this is, like you can tell that the different disciplines are still a

125
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:21,363
little bit segregated, like programmers a little bit together, animators a little bit

126
00:06:21,363 --> 00:06:22,703
together.

127
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:30,166
So, think, I guess think a little bit more Christmastree and a little bit less Megazord.

128
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,467
I was asked, I was asked by someone.

129
00:06:33,374 --> 00:06:37,518
how do we overcome space issues on a production floor?

130
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:40,120
And really the great thing about everyone working

131
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,062
on the same roof within the gameplay team

132
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:45,105
is our dependencies are really within the team.

133
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,886
If you have 25 people on your team,

134
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:49,348
all you really need to do is to secure an area

135
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:51,290
of the floor space that can contain 25 people,

136
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,193
and then you kind of manage that way.

137
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:59,057
Now, obviously, project-wide, like I was talking earlier,

138
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:00,358
we do talk and...

139
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:04,806
we do collaboration with various teams within the project.

140
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:10,031
So what we try to do is really book the teams that interact the most together to be near one another.

141
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:13,874
That's not always possible, obviously, because you're always going to work with like 5, 6, 10 different teams.

142
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:17,217
And nobody—you can't always be right next to one another.

143
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:21,020
In terms of gameplay, we try to be closer to the UI team and the AI team

144
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,022
because they're the ones that we interact the most with.

145
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,803
Now I want to talk about team philosophy. This is, this is a little bit of game design,

146
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:35,451
I guess, and a lot of projects would call this design pillars. Now, really the underlying

147
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:40,396
idea behind all of this is love the player. And the four pillars will really illustrate

148
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:45,482
that. The first thing is embrace systemic. What this means is

149
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:48,644
So when you go to E3 and you showcase your game,

150
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:52,425
and the guy showcasing the game will walk up to an elephant,

151
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:55,426
get on the back of the elephant, and start ramming vehicles,

152
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:58,047
hitting NPCs, the player, when he buys the game

153
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:00,328
or when he plays the demo, he's going to be able,

154
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:02,868
like he's going to expect to be able to do this in the game.

155
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:04,509
You don't want this to be just for show.

156
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:07,570
Same thing for the vehicle takedown,

157
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,030
which is a new feature that we added,

158
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,831
where you're driving right next to another vehicle.

159
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:14,372
You can jump aboard, I mean, kill the driver, eject him,

160
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:16,012
and then you can take control of the vehicle.

161
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:19,649
We could do them as like one-time sequence.

162
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:20,590
It would be cheaper.

163
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,092
But we really make this choice.

164
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:25,717
We'd rather have less features, but make them work throughout the game,

165
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:27,939
because this gives you a very rich experience.

166
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:31,303
The second key point is really to respect the player choice.

167
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,247
The biggest example I can give for this is

168
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:38,704
Our gameplay loop, which really illustrates,

169
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:42,286
you know, you have, you can always attack, when you attack an outpost, you can always go

170
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:45,027
the stealth way, so you can do takedowns, use some silent weapons,

171
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:49,970
but you can always go guns blazing with explosives and vehicles,

172
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,630
and this is,

173
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,193
this is some choice, like, that some players like to make, you know, sometimes they like to go stealth, sometimes they like to go guns blazing,

174
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:58,775
and we really try to add more features

175
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,336
to respect both areas,

176
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:03,297
and whenever possible, we want the player to be able to make his own choices.

177
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,581
The third thing is gameplay first. Now this is kind of a big buzzword. A lot of people

178
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,264
are talking about this. But what does this really mean? What it means for us is that

179
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:19,210
the gameplay is more important than the visual quality of the game, I say. Visual fidelity,

180
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,733
I guess, would be a better way to put it. I have a very good example for this one. In

181
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,315
the vehicle takedown that I just discussed, we found that

182
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,880
When we were tweaking the feature, like I said, we want it to be accessible.

183
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,800
We want the player to be able to do it throughout the game.

184
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,721
And what this means for us is we had to have some pretty big interaction angles and interaction

185
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:41,802
distance because if it's very too narrow and always looking for the perfect scenario, the

186
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:44,843
player's always going to try to do it, he's never going to be capable, and he's going

187
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:46,303
to think it's just bad.

188
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:50,344
In this case, what it meant to make this choice to really push the gameplay, make sure we

189
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:55,244
have these opportunities, is that unfortunately the feature, if you look at it in third person,

190
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:56,105
it looks kind of goofy.

191
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,833
Now, I don't know if you guys play the co-op,

192
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,214
but if you are driving a vehicle and you see your buddy

193
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:03,816
jumping outside of the vehicle and jumping in another one,

194
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:06,698
it warps, but it's a choice that we make

195
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:10,201
because to us, the feature being available

196
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,962
and just generally good on the gameplay side

197
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:13,863
is way more important than having it look perfect

198
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,384
in all scenarios.

199
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:16,665
Lastly, quality matters.

200
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:17,606
Again, sounds very obvious,

201
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:20,248
but what it means is,

202
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:22,869
as soon as we start discussing features very, very early on,

203
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:29,799
we really focus on making sure that we can realize this feature to a full quality,

204
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:33,922
and we are dedicated to it. When we have a feature in the game,

205
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:37,424
what we do is, if it takes longer because we want it to push to full quality,

206
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:40,325
what we'll do is we'll take the time to really push it to the right quality

207
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:42,427
so it doesn't clash with the rest of the game,

208
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:45,308
and we'll actually maybe scope down on some features,

209
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:46,929
or even cut other features completely,

210
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:49,751
because we want what we ship the game with to be very solid.

211
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:55,118
The next thing I want to talk about is our development process. It's very,

212
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:58,701
this is how we work and how we build the, how we build the game.

213
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,143
Now, we have a mix of bottom-up and top-down.

214
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:01,924
What I mean by that is,

215
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:05,467
so there are sometimes some requests that come from, from higher up.

216
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:08,349
For example, the world in Far Cry 4, Kirat,

217
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:10,631
is a very vertical world, some big mountains,

218
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:14,574
and there's a lot of verticality to it, as opposed to Far Cry 3, which was a little bit more flat.

219
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:19,638
Now what this means is we were requested to have some more tools to really explore this verticality.

220
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:25,122
And what the design and the gameplay team came up with is two new features amongst the other things.

221
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:31,646
The first thing would be the buzzer. So that's the one-man gyrocopter that you can navigate and go anywhere,

222
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:34,588
which is a feature that people enjoy so far.

223
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:36,969
And the other thing is the grapple hook.

224
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,374
which is another way or another more fun way, I guess,

225
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:43,156
if you needed to climb a very big distance,

226
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:45,117
instead of just having ladders,

227
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:46,198
you could have grapple hooks.

228
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:50,280
So this really came from up, from bottom, I mean,

229
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,121
but there was an initial request that came from top.

230
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:55,183
Now, the second point is everyone is a game designer.

231
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:55,883
This is...

232
00:11:57,205 --> 00:11:59,366
We really strongly believe that everyone on our team,

233
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:01,007
in the gameplay team, are gameplay experts,

234
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:02,807
and we want to leverage this resource.

235
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,308
Why limit yourself to just having two or three game designers

236
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,309
decide what the game's gonna be?

237
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,429
Well, you could have a team of 30 people

238
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,430
all putting in what, like, their expertise,

239
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,491
and, like, this is essentially what you want, right?

240
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:16,892
So, we have a lot of great examples,

241
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:19,453
as in, a question that we ask to people a lot is,

242
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:20,693
what would you like in your game?

243
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:24,156
The grapple hook initially was supposed to be just a vine.

244
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:26,599
You would just have an area where you would just plug the hook

245
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,681
and then you could climb much like you would do with a ladder.

246
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:32,085
But the process of the programmer and the game designer

247
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,007
doing a lot of back and forth between them

248
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:36,249
and challenging each other eventually made it

249
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,912
to fully fledged physics systems, which is really cool.

250
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:44,187
Now, promote ownership and empower the team is very much in that same line of thought.

251
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:48,190
The question we ask to the guys is, is this fun to you?

252
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,573
When you work on a feature, it's not a matter of just implementing the feature at the request

253
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:53,274
of the game designer.

254
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:57,477
No, it's your feature, it's your baby, it needs to be awesome, you need to think it's

255
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,298
awesome.

256
00:12:58,298 --> 00:13:01,580
Because if it's not good enough, then is it going to be good enough for the players?

257
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,783
So really push for the guys to have ownership and, like I said.

258
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:11,706
If you go to E3 and it's your feature and you had ownership on it and it goes on stage

259
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:15,570
and you do, I don't know, you get on the elephant and you start ramming vehicles, I can tell

260
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,633
you when the crowd starts cheering that the guy who worked on the elephant is going to

261
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:19,533
have nerd chills.

262
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,651
Finally, lots of iteration.

263
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:26,111
I mean, we iterate a lot.

264
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:28,232
I guess we iterate a lot more than we'd like to admit.

265
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:31,854
But this is a direct consequence of being heavily

266
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:32,614
focused on quality.

267
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:35,336
We want to ship our features to be very good.

268
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:39,217
And what this means is, well, sometimes you need to iterate

269
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:39,858
a little bit more.

270
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:43,519
Now to illustrate all these points, I'd like to walk you

271
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,880
guys through the eight steps of a feature.

272
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,662
So it starts from really an idea of a feature all the way

273
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,983
to a shipped product.

274
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:52,123
So let's go to the first step.

275
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,447
The first step is really an idea.

276
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,629
Now, the thing here is, like, you know,

277
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:01,013
everybody has cool ideas, but what we try to aim for

278
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:04,437
is ideas that really have a good,

279
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:05,818
a good game design purpose.

280
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,648
Two examples would be, oh, clicker's losing batteries.

281
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,770
So first thing would be, for example, the buzzer.

282
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,151
In co-op, you have this one-man gyrocopter,

283
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:19,993
and we added the co-op, the grapple point on the gyrocopter

284
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,073
so that at any given time,

285
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,614
instead of having to break the pacing of the game,

286
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,995
have to go down and you stop the gameplay,

287
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,496
pick up your buddy, go up,

288
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:29,357
well, at any given time, you can just fly by,

289
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:31,038
your friend can just grapple.

290
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,378
So yes, it's a cool feature,

291
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:34,259
but it helps you really maintain the pace.

292
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:39,700
Now, I mentioned earlier about embracing systemic, and one of the great consequences of really

293
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,463
embracing systemic is that since these systems are made to be robust and work throughout

294
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:46,865
the game, we can do these kind of things like really quickly, instead of taking weeks.

295
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,807
This took us just like a couple days just to tweak the minor details.

296
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:53,290
So this is, this is definitely a big win.

297
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,773
Another great example of something that is a cool idea that has a game design intention

298
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:58,534
is the vehicle takedown.

299
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:00,756
Now we made a big effort to really merge.

300
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:06,309
I really try to, yeah, I'd say merge, I guess, vehicle and combat.

301
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:10,913
One of the things we added was the drive and shoot for this regard, but the vehicle takedown

302
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:14,956
is another great one where you have this really strong action within a vehicle and it's not

303
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:19,940
just driving, and it has another purpose, which is, again, instead of running around

304
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,123
the world, if you have a broken vehicle, you don't have to necessarily get out, repair

305
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,604
it, and get back in and break the pacing.

306
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:30,448
You can just find somebody, do a vehicle takedown, and you recuperate his vehicle, which is in

307
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:31,229
great condition.

308
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:35,094
Our designers on the team are required to be very technical.

309
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:38,156
And this is great because

310
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:40,977
I don't think, I don't think I've ever heard in the past five years on Far Cry,

311
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:43,078
I've never heard somebody or a game designer say,

312
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:44,279
just do it this way because I said so.

313
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,240
This is not the culture that we promote.

314
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,241
Like I said, in a culture where everybody is a game designer,

315
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:53,083
what happens when the game designers disagree with the programmers and the animators

316
00:15:53,463 --> 00:15:56,506
is these are really great opportunities for your game designers to coach

317
00:15:56,506 --> 00:16:00,451
your programmers and your animators on really what makes great game design

318
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:04,015
and vice versa. You want to use that opportunity for your programmers and your animators to

319
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:07,979
to teach each other and really try to grow this, this knowledge.

320
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:11,543
We kind of expect everyone to try to have this curiosity and really push it forward.

321
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:15,519
The second step would be the gut checks.

322
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,881
So, once you have your cool idea,

323
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:20,502
what you want to do is really go around the floor,

324
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:22,984
talk to the people, and see what they think, right?

325
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:24,766
So we try to eliminate the crazy ideas.

326
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:27,728
Uh, the great thing is we try to hit for,

327
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:30,490
obviously, higher return and investment.

328
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,071
Not buzzword.

329
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:38,985
What this means is, by including the people, all the programmers will be implementing the feature,

330
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:41,146
sometimes, yes, you're going to get some ideas that might be too crazy,

331
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:44,369
but sometimes they'll come up with some great ideas that are actually very quick wins,

332
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:48,292
because they're the ones that have the technical expertise to build those features.

333
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:51,654
Now, you see this nice, very sweaty arm-shake thing?

334
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:56,478
What I'm trying to illustrate with this is, at this stage,

335
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:58,399
I think it's very, very important to have...

336
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:04,355
a very, very strong person argumenting for game design, and a strong person on the production

337
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:06,856
trying to, you know, hold game design back.

338
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:12,820
Because what happens is, if your game design really overpowers production, you risk having

339
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,442
a game that's, yes, very good, but that might never ship, because you always go into crazy

340
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:16,582
ideas.

341
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:21,305
And on the other side, if you have production that really overwhelms game design, and it's

342
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:25,008
like, no, we're just gonna do this because it's the only thing that's safe and fits,

343
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:28,110
then you risk having just a very bad game because it's not design-driven enough.

344
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:33,411
I can give you some examples, some features that were cut at this stage of production.

345
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:34,131
I'll give you one.

346
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:38,995
On Far Cry 3 we had vehicle, well water takedown, sorry, so when you're in water and there's

347
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:40,696
somebody you can stab the guy, whatever.

348
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:43,378
And we wanted to make it more systemic.

349
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:45,891
or if you're in water at any given time,

350
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:48,272
so there's somebody else in the water, somebody else nearby,

351
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:50,732
we'd like to be able to do these takedowns.

352
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:52,773
We chose not to do so because, I mean,

353
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:54,973
honestly, Kerat doesn't have that much water,

354
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,674
and we felt that the time invested there

355
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,294
was not that much return on investment

356
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,135
because there's not going to be

357
00:18:01,135 --> 00:18:02,735
that many opportunities for the player.

358
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:05,436
We'd rather, you know, spend our time on something else

359
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:07,016
that'll be able to be done throughout the game

360
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:08,736
that might feel more epic.

361
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:11,677
Third step would be the FSO process.

362
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:16,695
Acronyms, yeah. Now FSO stands for feature sign-off.

363
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:21,678
Uh, I could, I could probably do a whole talk of an hour on this, but I'll go over it quickly.

364
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:26,141
The idea is, the feature sign-off is a document, typically written in Excel,

365
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:30,905
where the game designer will go over the various things that a feature can do.

366
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:34,007
Uh, and if there's any risk, potential risk there, you want to highlight them.

367
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:38,630
And this document will be sent out to all the various technical leads of all the teams on the project.

368
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,647
Now remember, the first step before, I said gut checks, where you go around and you see

369
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:45,368
people, for example, on the gameplay team.

370
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:49,190
But what this is really great at is because this document is sent out large, and people

371
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,211
meet like all the various technical leads of all the teams on the project will meet

372
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,552
and sit down and make sure that they go through every line.

373
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:55,852
What it does is...

374
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,431
Yes, on the gameplay team, we do have the technical expertise for the gameplay stuff,

375
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,432
but we might not know what everything means for AI.

376
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:06,613
For example, if we decide to add elephant riding, what does it mean for AI?

377
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:10,354
If an AI walks in front of a player on the back of an elephant, what is he going to do?

378
00:19:10,354 --> 00:19:12,055
Is he going to be scared?

379
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:14,535
Is he going to shoot the player, shoot the elephant?

380
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:19,477
And then if you drop the elephant in the middle of nowhere, and it gets, and AI regains control

381
00:19:19,477 --> 00:19:23,238
over the elephant, how is he going to be able to path back to like a proper, proper nav

382
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:23,818
mesh?

383
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:26,719
By having this process, which is formalized and forces us.

384
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,192
to really include everyone in the project,

385
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:32,396
these, we don't have these bad surprises later on.

386
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:35,259
Everybody knows what's, what's happening.

387
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:41,066
Now the next step is the prototype stage,

388
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,968
which I'm sure you're all familiar with.

389
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:44,891
There are certain things about this is,

390
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:47,073
are prototypes actually

391
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,250
So it's not necessarily step 4. It could be step 3.5.

392
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,134
What I mean is, this process is not entirely linear.

393
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:55,475
Some steps will happen at the same time.

394
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:57,658
And we're comfortable doing this, starting the prototype

395
00:19:57,658 --> 00:19:58,699
as the FSO process is not over,

396
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:02,523
because, you know, we have experience, and...

397
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:06,807
Eventually, you don't have these crazy surprises anymore.

398
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:09,409
We rarely completely cut anything anymore.

399
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,932
So our prototypes have functional assets.

400
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:13,833
So we don't just, for example, if you want to throw a knife,

401
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,615
we wouldn't just play, like, a random reload animation

402
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:16,916
that would toss a green cube.

403
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,657
We like to have some basic assets,

404
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,159
and it's very easy for us to do so

405
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,900
because, like I explained earlier,

406
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,142
within the team, we have all the people that we need

407
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:27,665
to really fully realize the content.

408
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:28,906
Now, one thing you're gonna talk,

409
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:31,708
you're gonna hear me talk a lot about is de-risking first.

410
00:20:32,626 --> 00:20:36,569
When we work on features, when we do our planning, we always focus on de-risking.

411
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:41,012
So much that we'll actually prefer de-risking lower importance features than actually iterate

412
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:44,295
on high importance features that don't have risks anymore.

413
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:46,276
This is very important.

414
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,318
Now, there are various types of risks.

415
00:20:48,318 --> 00:20:52,981
You get realization risks such as, how are we going to make this look good?

416
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:53,722
Game design risks.

417
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:54,422
Is this going to be fun?

418
00:20:54,422 --> 00:20:55,323
How's this going to work?

419
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:56,624
Technical risks.

420
00:20:57,162 --> 00:21:01,123
This is going to work with our engine within a reasonable amount of time.

421
00:21:01,123 --> 00:21:04,464
Balancing risk. If I have this new weapon like the Mortar, is it going to make the game too easy?

422
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,664
Am I just going to break the game whenever I use it?

423
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:09,444
So these risks need to be addressed first before we move forward.

424
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:11,445
And this is what we try to do with a prototype.

425
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:15,446
And when the prototype's in the game, it's also a very good meat for discussion.

426
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:17,826
When you have something in the game, it's concrete.

427
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:20,447
People can, can look at it, feel it, play it.

428
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,467
And that's really great fuel for discussions.

429
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:25,287
Now let's look at some features in their prototype stage.

430
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:26,848
I hope this works.

431
00:21:29,743 --> 00:21:31,744
Okay, so this is the drive and shoot.

432
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:33,164
Now you'll see this is very, very basic, right?

433
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:37,166
So there's no look around, you just aim forward.

434
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,907
The hand on the left is completely,

435
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:42,007
like, badly animated.

436
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:44,168
But this gives an idea of the intention

437
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:45,848
behind the drive and shoot.

438
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:47,629
Now this feature is the buzzer.

439
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:49,649
Now you'll see the asset is obviously very placeholder

440
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:51,590
with a nice checker, a temporary texture.

441
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,350
And there's not much stuff going on.

442
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,631
There's not much look around, the inputs are very clunky,

443
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:58,752
but still, I mean, you can get on the buzzer,

444
00:21:58,752 --> 00:21:59,472
you can fly around.

445
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:03,516
Lastly, the grapple, again, very, very basic,

446
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:05,917
where you just climb onto an object,

447
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:07,859
and when you get to the top, you leave.

448
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,100
Very little realization.

449
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,142
So that typically, that's what our prototype stage looks like.

450
00:22:13,142 --> 00:22:17,444
So at this point, we did a prototype in the engine,

451
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:20,006
and we have a good idea of, you know, what's the really,

452
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,847
what's the potential for the various features.

453
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:25,329
So what we do at this stage is we scope.

454
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:28,471
So we discuss, so what works, what doesn't work.

455
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:30,152
We get some feedback, and...

456
00:22:31,544 --> 00:22:35,726
It's a great, it's a great time to really start doing playtests also when you're at the prototype stage.

457
00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:37,867
So we do two types of playtests.

458
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:41,849
So we have the typical playtest where you'll grab somebody on the production floor

459
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:45,450
and just say, hey dude, I'd like you to try this feature, you know, somebody that hasn't tried it.

460
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:51,253
And you can really try to observe the person, see what he's doing with it, and see what's not understood, mainly.

461
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:59,876
And the other thing we do is at Ubisoft, we have a playtest lab where some people from outside the studio will come in and we'll try out unfinished games.

462
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:04,238
The biggest thing here, you want to get those guys involved as soon as possible.

463
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:10,021
If you have some big features that are going to be iconic for your game, you want to get this tested as soon as the prototype stage.

464
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,002
You don't want to wait until the very end, right? You want to de-risk this stuff.

465
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:15,603
And the guys at the playtest lab are really good at...

466
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,284
aggregating all the feedback and really giving you tips on

467
00:23:18,284 --> 00:23:21,885
what it is that you could do to improve certain features and de-risk.

468
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:26,887
So I can give you some examples at this stage of

469
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:30,008
some features that were cut, unfortunately, when we got to the prototype stage.

470
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,629
The first thing would be the vehicle takedown from boat to boat.

471
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:37,310
And the reason why we cut this one is because

472
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:43,020
we realized when we did the prototype for the vehicle takedown that the animations were actually very

473
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,364
complicated to do, like several NPCs, they're very long, so there's a significant cost there.

474
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:51,608
So to scope down on this feature, we actually removed the boat-to-boat part,

475
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:56,513
and this is really only for animation costs, because the code was there, it was working.

476
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:59,896
But then again, little return on investment there, because

477
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,499
there's not much water in Keurets, so we try to be smart about it.

478
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,941
Another thing that we cut at that point is we had a shooting gallery.

479
00:24:05,941 --> 00:24:08,183
Now you know what shooting galleries are, many games have had them.

480
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:10,885
So you have panels and you shoot with like weapons.

481
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:14,947
And the reason why we cut those, again the code, the prototype code was working,

482
00:24:14,947 --> 00:24:18,950
is because we figured that it was going to be so long for level designers

483
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,453
to do all the setups in all the various areas of the world and all the various weapons.

484
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:26,675
And honestly, it's not a big innovation.

485
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:29,737
It's not necessarily that fun, it's not that far cry.

486
00:24:29,737 --> 00:24:31,158
So we decided to just get rid of it.

487
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,739
Now the next step is the alpha step.

488
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:40,241
The alpha for us, it's really a road map to the final quality of the game.

489
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:43,822
So once you get to alpha, all your major risks should be eliminated.

490
00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:49,243
And when I say risk, again, I'm always going to try to really push to de-risk first.

491
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:53,284
Sometimes what we'll do to de-risk is we'll create what we call strike teams.

492
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:56,045
So our strike teams are composed of, you know, many people.

493
00:24:56,918 --> 00:25:01,419
And sometimes we're going to have multiple people of the same trade trying to de-risk the same problem.

494
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:06,380
Uh, there, it happened two times. Like, two significant strike teams that we had on Far Cry 4 was for,

495
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,321
uh, the elephant riding was one, because, like, you want to, you want to be able to drive the elephant,

496
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:15,923
but you still want it to feel like a living animal. This is, this has a huge set of problems of their own.

497
00:25:15,923 --> 00:25:23,104
So this was one of the strike team that we did, and we really tried to shield these people as much as possible,

498
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:26,525
so they can really blitz on making sure that all these risks are eliminated.

499
00:25:27,563 --> 00:25:33,188
Now, one of the peculiar things about Far Cry is that we really try to have all the

500
00:25:33,188 --> 00:25:34,729
features alpha at the same time.

501
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:38,773
And the reason for this is we have a very big feature matrix.

502
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:44,738
So the more we add features, the longer they are to make, really, because, like I said

503
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:48,362
earlier, when we expect the player to, when the player expects to be able to do something,

504
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:49,403
we want to give it to him, right?

505
00:25:50,502 --> 00:25:54,626
So again, what this means is the more you add features, the more you have dependencies

506
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:55,487
with other features.

507
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,690
And these are very, very hard to predict.

508
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,134
So before we move on to polish and to beta, we try to get everything in the game in alpha.

509
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:05,117
We want to let this stuff really marinate in there.

510
00:26:05,117 --> 00:26:06,398
So let's take a look at some features.

511
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,240
Well, the same features as earlier in their alpha stage.

512
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:11,958
So first thing should be drive and shoot, yes.

513
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:14,259
Now you can see, like animations are okay.

514
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:17,979
You can look around, you can aim on the right,

515
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:19,300
you can kill some guys.

516
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,020
Now the aiming seems very difficult,

517
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,481
but now the gyrocopter, again, you can shoot.

518
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,021
Now it's hard to tell

519
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:27,782
because you don't have the control in your hands,

520
00:26:27,782 --> 00:26:29,702
but the control's already much better.

521
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:30,622
You can move around.

522
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,063
And the grapple, you can tell that right now it has physics.

523
00:26:33,063 --> 00:26:33,803
You can swing around,

524
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:35,223
and it's not just like a straight rope

525
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:36,303
that doesn't really do much.

526
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:41,055
So at this stage, the alpha, like I said,

527
00:26:41,055 --> 00:26:42,816
you have a really good understanding

528
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,279
of what the feature means for the game.

529
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,800
What is it gonna be?

530
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,341
What's the potential?

531
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,702
And all the big risks are no longer there, really.

532
00:26:51,702 --> 00:26:54,944
Now you're never gonna guess what comes after alpha.

533
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:55,064
Anyone?

534
00:26:55,064 --> 00:26:55,945
Beta, yeah, okay.

535
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:56,625
Not bad, not bad.

536
00:26:56,625 --> 00:27:00,048
So the particular thing about our beta

537
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:04,010
is that it's really as far as most features will go.

538
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,553
the bulk of our stuff is really only gonna make it to beta

539
00:27:07,553 --> 00:27:09,115
and we're gonna ship in this stage.

540
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:11,738
And this is actually a very nice comforting thing

541
00:27:11,738 --> 00:27:14,542
where you're trying to ship, you got bugs and everything,

542
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,983
and you know in the back of your head,

543
00:27:15,983 --> 00:27:17,806
okay, all the stuff that we have in beta,

544
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:18,947
you know, it can ship in this state

545
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:19,848
and that's always good to know.

546
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:25,371
Earlier I did mention that we have, for the prototype, that we have several people working

547
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:28,073
on a, on a, like the prototype at the same time.

548
00:27:28,073 --> 00:27:31,096
Like you want art assets, animation assets, and programming.

549
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:33,238
And we really reiterate everything together.

550
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:38,603
For example, if you work on, well I don't know, on the buzzer, you want to improve the

551
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:41,665
animations, you want to make the mesh look better, you want to have the programming.

552
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:45,969
So I know, I know some people like to push, for example, the programming all the way until

553
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:48,171
the end, and then just wait.

554
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:51,853
whenever animation is available to really polish the animations.

555
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:55,575
We avoid doing that because you always get kind of bad surprises there

556
00:27:55,575 --> 00:27:57,896
where animation starts doing polish, for example,

557
00:27:57,896 --> 00:27:59,457
when you realize that you need some code support,

558
00:27:59,457 --> 00:28:02,859
and you always keep going back to the features that you thought you were done with.

559
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:04,580
And again, this is very easy for us to do

560
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,181
because we do the planning for all the people on the gameplay team,

561
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:11,283
including the artists, the game designers, the animators, and the programmers.

562
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:16,787
Now this stage of the project, it's very, very important to take a close eye on the

563
00:28:16,787 --> 00:28:21,931
playtest results. During the heat of production, we actually have playtests from, like, people

564
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:27,836
outside of Ubisoft coming to test their games. We have that every two weeks. And if you keep

565
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,919
a close eye on the playtest results, like, you're gonna know if one of your features

566
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,162
doesn't work. For example, for us, the drive-in shoot is one of the ones that really went

567
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:40,446
until the very end, where, okay, it worked. Like, as devs, we worked on it, so we knew

568
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:41,107
it was okay.

569
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,510
But there was a...

570
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,011
People had a really hard time

571
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:47,312
driving and shooting at the same time,

572
00:28:47,312 --> 00:28:48,432
being able to hit targets

573
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:49,732
and not hitting trees in the process.

574
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:53,174
So by keeping a close eye on the playtest results,

575
00:28:53,174 --> 00:28:55,675
you make sure that whatever it is that's in your game,

576
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:57,095
it's solid, people understand it,

577
00:28:57,095 --> 00:29:00,116
and it's really important that they be kept in the loop.

578
00:29:00,116 --> 00:29:02,097
Again, re-scope is necessary.

579
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:04,578
We don't just re-scope earlier on.

580
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:05,959
We re-scope throughout the production

581
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:08,339
because we want to make sure that we don't dig ourselves,

582
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:09,940
like, in a big grave in a huge pile of stuff

583
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,760
that we can't get through.

584
00:29:11,842 --> 00:29:14,164
Let's look at some, well the same features in their beta stage.

585
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:17,666
So the first thing is the drive-in shoot.

586
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:22,088
Now you can see that it feels like it, well it's hard to say because you don't have the

587
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:23,769
controller again, but it's pretty good.

588
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:27,291
We have the auto-drive that's going to prevent you from like hitting trees and all this stuff.

589
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:31,233
You can look out the window, we have some nice aiming assists, so this is, this is pretty

590
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:31,353
good.

591
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,075
I mean we could probably ship with this aside from some minor bugs, you know?

592
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:35,316
Same thing with the buzzer.

593
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:40,798
Buzzer at this point, you can shoot, you can navigate around, I mean the controls are super

594
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,239
tight. Whenever you put your stick in a direction, it's going to smoothly turn, and you know,

595
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:48,500
you get really the full experience. You could probably ship in this state.

596
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:58,083
The last thing is the grapple. So you can see now you got the fully realized

597
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,204
jump, the rope, some minor rope hoppings, just a bug.

598
00:30:01,204 --> 00:30:03,765
Aside from that, I mean the experience is pretty solid.

599
00:30:09,378 --> 00:30:15,480
Now, the last step of a feature is the gold and all-in.

600
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,260
So like I said earlier, most of the features

601
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,601
will only make it as far as beta.

602
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,981
The features that we still work on past beta

603
00:30:21,981 --> 00:30:26,422
are really the ones that we find are not necessarily understood

604
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:29,003
enough or come out in the playtest results

605
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:29,883
as being problematic,

606
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:32,263
and the ones that are tagged as all-in.

607
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:36,873
So, early on in the production process, the game design team will write what we call a

608
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:40,380
master features list that contains all the features that they want to have in the game,

609
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,226
and these features will be ordered by importance.

610
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:47,817
The ones that are all-in are the features that are really the most iconic,

611
00:30:47,817 --> 00:30:51,520
and that we know right from the get-go, that we're going to work on until the very end.

612
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,563
I think the elephant is the biggest example of this.

613
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:57,866
Like, if you think Far Cry 4, I mean, the elephant is so iconic,

614
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:01,289
and everybody keeps talking about the elephant because it's so great and it's different.

615
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:03,370
But this is one of the features that we know. It's an all-in feature.

616
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,073
I mean, it's good. In beta, like, it's good enough.

617
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,574
Maybe we could ship with this.

618
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,055
Nah, we're going all the way with this one.

619
00:31:09,838 --> 00:31:14,301
Drive and shoot is an example of another one that we wanted to push forward, where we really did a lot.

620
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:20,805
In the middle, you got the corpse. The reason for this is the moving bodies is an example of a feature that we really...

621
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:26,469
that was a low importance feature, but it wasn't all that great,

622
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:30,131
and there were some issues with like dropping it, making it drop at the proper location.

623
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:34,614
So we still gave it a good pass at the end just to make sure that it didn't clash with the rest of the game.

624
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:37,576
Again, commitment to quality.

625
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:38,036
Now...

626
00:31:39,003 --> 00:31:41,065
I'd like to talk about planning, and...

627
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,148
Okay, I hear you guys.

628
00:31:43,148 --> 00:31:45,251
Ah, this guy's not gonna talk to us about planning, really?

629
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:45,411
Okay.

630
00:31:45,411 --> 00:31:48,054
The reason why I wanna talk about planning is because this is...

631
00:31:48,054 --> 00:31:49,556
Depending on how you do your planning, I think...

632
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:55,023
I think it can be a great tool to really build a strong team that is united.

633
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:55,343
And...

634
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:57,935
I'm going to explain this.

635
00:31:57,935 --> 00:32:01,537
So first of all, we do sprints during production.

636
00:32:01,537 --> 00:32:03,158
They're two-week sprints, very flexible.

637
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,979
We do two-week sprints because we

638
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:07,280
want to be synchronized with the rest of the production floor.

639
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,181
It's also nice when we have play tests every two weeks

640
00:32:09,181 --> 00:32:10,902
because we're synchronized.

641
00:32:10,902 --> 00:32:14,284
And because, honestly, if you have two-week sprints,

642
00:32:14,284 --> 00:32:15,785
you have a small list of tasks.

643
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:18,626
And for the people working on their tasks,

644
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:20,607
it feels like it's always achievable.

645
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,388
As opposed to having, for example, four weeks,

646
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:23,289
we have this huge list.

647
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:25,070
And it always feels like, oh, I've got to do all this, man.

648
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:28,612
The second thing is aim for 11-12 days of work.

649
00:32:28,612 --> 00:32:30,574
That's just a formula. Don't worry too much about it.

650
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,896
Essentially, when we plan, we always round up.

651
00:32:33,896 --> 00:32:36,999
So if we think something's gonna take half a day,

652
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:38,300
we'll put one day.

653
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,320
If we think something's gonna take 3.5-4 days,

654
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,682
we'll put five days.

655
00:32:40,682 --> 00:32:41,402
And we add up to 11-12 days,

656
00:32:41,402 --> 00:32:43,163
and that's how we do our planning.

657
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:45,185
So I know some people like to do, for example,

658
00:32:45,185 --> 00:32:47,066
realistic estimates and multiply by 2,

659
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:47,707
multiply by 1.5.

660
00:32:47,707 --> 00:32:49,969
If you're struggling with your formula,

661
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,771
maybe try this one, maybe not.

662
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:55,113
When we manage our sprint, when we planify...

663
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,909
when we planify, plan our sprints.

664
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,670
We like to, planify, nice.

665
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,272
We like to synchronize the various trades.

666
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:05,773
Again, this is very easy for us

667
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:07,094
because everyone's under the same roof

668
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:08,315
and we do the planning for everyone.

669
00:33:08,315 --> 00:33:11,897
For example, if you want to add a new weapon,

670
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:14,058
you probably want your artist to model

671
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,419
at least the first pass of the weapon

672
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,360
and then you can have programming and animator

673
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,342
do a pass maybe the next week or something.

674
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:20,562
But this becomes super easy.

675
00:33:21,203 --> 00:33:24,985
Again, de-risking first, always de-risking first.

676
00:33:24,985 --> 00:33:28,527
And lastly, the priority is always to unblock your coworkers.

677
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:29,647
So we do, we do have goals, right?

678
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:32,448
This is the things that we'd like to hit this sprint.

679
00:33:32,448 --> 00:33:34,049
But regardless of whatever you're working on,

680
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:36,951
you're taskless, if one of your coworkers is blocked,

681
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:38,111
you want to unblock him.

682
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:41,993
So again, I have my animator right next to me,

683
00:33:41,993 --> 00:33:44,514
and he's blocked and he's trying to do something.

684
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:46,155
He's like, eh, I need code support for this.

685
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:46,756
Okay, no problem.

686
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:47,916
And I'll just shove whatever I'm doing,

687
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:49,757
as long as it's not, like, too complicated process.

688
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:53,439
I'll give you what you need, and then he gets unblocked.

689
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:55,820
And the great thing about this is this is a great

690
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,940
team building and team spirit thing, right?

691
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,341
Where it, it really feels like your coworkers have your back.

692
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:05,342
So when you help your friend, you unblock him the next time around,

693
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,903
like he gets unblocked, or you unblock somebody else,

694
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:11,624
and this is a great way to, to really handle this.

695
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:15,604
Now, now is this guy really gonna talk to us about bug tracking?

696
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:15,664
Yes!

697
00:34:15,664 --> 00:34:18,685
Uh, the reason for this is...

698
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,591
your bug and task tracking system is probably going to be the only tool

699
00:34:22,591 --> 00:34:25,693
that every single person on your production floor will use.

700
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:28,815
Now we use JIRA. I don't want to get into the

701
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:30,696
like what is JIRA and everything.

702
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:34,038
What I'm trying to picture this here is

703
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,660
how we use those systems to really have a workflow

704
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,061
that is dynamic and really build a good team.

705
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:41,403
Now on the left, what you look in, so you see there are two columns.

706
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:45,045
The left column would be your typical list of tasks

707
00:34:45,045 --> 00:34:46,506
that you need to hit from top to bottom.

708
00:34:47,006 --> 00:34:50,568
So the top part would be your must-fix issues, like the stuff that's blocking production.

709
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:54,630
Then you got playtest issues. We prioritize those because

710
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,091
you probably want to have your result of the playtest as soon as possible,

711
00:34:57,091 --> 00:34:58,592
and they're every two weeks. So if you wait,

712
00:34:58,592 --> 00:35:00,513
then you might get them in four weeks instead of two weeks.

713
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:01,822
etc. etc.

714
00:35:01,822 --> 00:35:05,346
Where the magic happens is on the right side,

715
00:35:05,346 --> 00:35:08,449
which is essentially a mirror of your own list of stuff

716
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:10,271
that you need to do, but for your team.

717
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:13,475
So what this does is having everything on one page,

718
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:15,637
it's good because, well, people will typically not switch

719
00:35:15,637 --> 00:35:17,279
between two pages, so you have this one page.

720
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,781
And when you go on there and you look,

721
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:21,442
hey, what do I need to do today, you know?

722
00:35:21,442 --> 00:35:23,503
Oh, I have this bug with, like, the elephant writing.

723
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:24,083
OK, I'll get on that.

724
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,904
And then you glance at the top, right?

725
00:35:25,904 --> 00:35:27,705
You see, oh, man, my buddy Johnny

726
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:29,306
has got, like, three must-fix issues.

727
00:35:29,306 --> 00:35:31,227
What are we gonna do about that?

728
00:35:31,227 --> 00:35:33,128
It's like, yeah, I'm curious. I'd like to know what he has.

729
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:33,288
Click.

730
00:35:33,288 --> 00:35:35,809
And then you see, oh, he has these three problems.

731
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:37,230
I could probably help him out with this one.

732
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,171
So you can help him out.

733
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,591
Now, this sounds very naive, but...

734
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:43,459
or very idealistic, should I say.

735
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:46,381
But the reason why it works is because we encourage people

736
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:47,622
to help each other out,

737
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:49,363
we provide them the tools to do so

738
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:51,565
and have this easy flexibility,

739
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:54,287
and because somebody somewhere started doing it.

740
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:56,428
If you get your buddy Johnny out of trouble,

741
00:35:56,428 --> 00:35:58,530
when you're in trouble next time around,

742
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,112
your buddy Johnny's gonna get you out of trouble.

743
00:36:01,112 --> 00:36:01,352
Again,

744
00:36:02,185 --> 00:36:09,448
This sounds very simple, but these are all very great tools that you can implement to make sure that your team really helps each other out and is very

745
00:36:09,448 --> 00:36:17,691
dynamic and solid. And we always have these days, managers, where we're kind of stuck in meetings all day long. I mean, it happens.

746
00:36:17,691 --> 00:36:21,772
And you don't want to have to always be there at your machine to really dispatch if something goes up.

747
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:29,395
Like, this really gives you a good idea to quickly see at a glance what everybody's doing on your team, what's keeping them busy.

748
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:31,436
For upper management,

749
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:36,299
like, obviously, they like to have a good idea of where the team is.

750
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:40,943
We have some internal software that lets you know for a set milestone,

751
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:43,925
for example, the list of stuff that we have remaining to do.

752
00:36:43,925 --> 00:36:47,187
We have our velocity, so it gives them an idea of, like, when we can finish.

753
00:36:47,187 --> 00:36:52,171
And we can scope regularly.

754
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,392
Daily stand-up meetings.

755
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:58,415
Our daily stand-up meetings have, like, 15 to 20 people and last 3 minutes.

756
00:36:58,415 --> 00:36:59,436
That's it. He's lost it.

757
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,836
no, really. I want to talk about this because

758
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:04,938
I've heard a lot of people say that this

759
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:08,642
is impossible, or it, like, standup meetings should not

760
00:37:08,642 --> 00:37:09,122
be this large.

761
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:15,090
So first thing first. When we call a standup meeting, we actually have a gong at the office.

762
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,610
And, yeah, it's pretty big.

763
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:21,093
So the idea is, instead of, for example, having your standup meeting at 10.30

764
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:26,916
and having people just stand there, waiting 5 minutes for everybody to get there because people are not on time,

765
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:29,817
we just ring the gong. When people hear the gong, they'll just go up to the standup.

766
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:31,959
And this is very nice.

767
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:36,441
Some other teams eventually synchronize their standup meetings to be at the same time as ours,

768
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:39,022
because it's easy. Hey, standup's when you hear the gong.

769
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:39,683
And, yeah.

770
00:37:40,786 --> 00:37:44,347
So, what goes on in a 20-people stand-up meeting for 3 minutes?

771
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:46,108
What information can be conveyed?

772
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:50,409
The first thing you want is whoever's calling the meeting,

773
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,330
the stand-up meeting guy.

774
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,431
You want to go over certain goals, certain objectives,

775
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:57,312
and I guess I'll give you a walkthrough of

776
00:37:57,312 --> 00:37:59,673
what a typical stand-up meeting could look like.

777
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,991
So for example, I'll start and call the meeting.

778
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:04,131
It's like, okay, good afternoon, guys.

779
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:06,692
Good morning, guys.

780
00:38:06,692 --> 00:38:08,373
Okay, today, this week, it's evaluation,

781
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:11,414
so please try to take some time to do your auto-appraisals.

782
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,174
Also, there was some issues with stability

783
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:14,194
in the build yesterday,

784
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:16,555
which was affecting some of our partner studios.

785
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:17,856
Please try to be careful.

786
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,916
If you submit anything risky, be extra, extra careful.

787
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:23,697
And now the next person would really think keywords.

788
00:38:23,697 --> 00:38:25,518
So it would say, all right, today I'll be working on,

789
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:27,518
you know, a problem with camera

790
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:29,299
when getting on the back of the elephant.

791
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:29,519
Okay.

792
00:38:30,346 --> 00:38:35,790
For me, I'll be working on transition from one vehicle to another and the vehicle take down and somebody would say I'll be working on more

793
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,871
to our explosion impacts

794
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:42,154
And it really doesn't need to take that much more time than this the idea is for everyone to have a good snapshot of what?

795
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,776
Everybody else is working on and when you need to talk to somebody

796
00:38:44,816 --> 00:38:48,337
one because for example the mortar guy I worked on some stuff that might be

797
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:51,858
related because I worked on explosions last week what I do is I could just say

798
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:54,798
simply I'll talk to you after the stand-up or sometimes you don't even need

799
00:38:54,798 --> 00:38:57,699
to talk he sees you so you just nod and you point him and they get it you know

800
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:01,920
so then you synchronize you sync up after the stand-up it's very important

801
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,481
that it stays within three minutes because if it's more than three minutes

802
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:10,542
people simply stop listening so keep it short keep it nice I mean give the

803
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:13,483
information you need to do and you probably even have time to sing happy

804
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:14,143
birthday in there

805
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:19,465
Since our sprints are small, so two-week sprints,

806
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:22,727
it's a very good motivational tool.

807
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,309
What I mean by this is, you know I was saying earlier that

808
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:27,370
it's a finite list, it's a small list of stuff.

809
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,273
For example, for your sprint, you'd have eight tasks,

810
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:33,014
and you have two weeks to do it.

811
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:34,435
And it kind of forces people

812
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:37,297
to really go, oh, OK, so I have these eight items.

813
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:40,039
I'd like to get those, like, six out of the way this week.

814
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,840
I only have, like, two items left next week.

815
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,521
Like, you want to be a winner.

816
00:39:43,521 --> 00:39:45,463
You want to be that guy, like, in front of everybody else.

817
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:51,143
or not necessarily in competition, but you want to be the guy that finishes on time, right?

818
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:51,323
So,

819
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:57,187
one mistake we did on Far Cry 4 is stopping sprints a little bit too early.

820
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,709
When we were in the debug phase later on,

821
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:03,572
we stopped sprints and we just, OK, this is the pile of bugs that we need to get through.

822
00:40:03,572 --> 00:40:05,233
But this was a mistake because...

823
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:08,779
When you have sprints like this, you can put bugs in there.

824
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:10,700
It doesn't have to be tests. You can put, like, a list of bugs.

825
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,042
You're essentially giving your team a chance at being a winner every two weeks,

826
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,724
as opposed to being a constant loser

827
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:20,646
that just crumbles under a pile of bugs that just keeps piling.

828
00:40:20,646 --> 00:40:23,168
You don't feel like you see the end of it, right?

829
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:27,430
So this is—this, again, can be a great motivational tool, if done right.

830
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,353
When finishing sprints early, the guys will debug, stabilize.

831
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:33,934
Stabilizing is good, because we have playtests every two weeks.

832
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:34,555
And—

833
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:39,239
The guys would probably appreciate your game better if it doesn't crash in their face.

834
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,863
And the big, big, big thing is help your friends.

835
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:46,066
Now I said earlier that we always prioritize unblocking co-workers.

836
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:50,911
Unfortunately, what this means for you is if somebody on your team gets blocked,

837
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:53,114
well, you want to unblock them as soon as possible,

838
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:55,796
that means you're kind of delaying your sprint tasks.

839
00:40:55,796 --> 00:40:56,217
But that's okay.

840
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:59,418
because some people will finish early and then they can help you out.

841
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:02,859
And what happens when your friend Johnny comes to see you and says,

842
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:05,339
hey, I'm out of tasks and I see you have a lot of stuff left.

843
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:06,519
I think I can help you out finish on time.

844
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:09,340
Next time around when Johnny's in trouble, you're going to help him out.

845
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:16,002
Now, the big danger here is wanting to finish your sprint so much on time.

846
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:20,743
That that's that's all you really focus on, right?

847
00:41:20,743 --> 00:41:22,983
So some things will slip.

848
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:25,504
You need you need to accept the fact that some some things will slip.

849
00:41:26,404 --> 00:41:30,853
Now, I'm not going to say that it's fine that you don't hit your objectives.

850
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:31,915
We always try to be better.

851
00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:32,697
We always try to do good.

852
00:41:32,697 --> 00:41:32,757
But...

853
00:41:34,737 --> 00:41:37,098
If you know why certain tasks are slipping,

854
00:41:37,098 --> 00:41:38,199
or if you unblock somebody else,

855
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,761
it's work that you would have done later on anyway.

856
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:43,302
The key thing is, if you're ever unsure,

857
00:41:43,302 --> 00:41:45,644
always go back to this one question, which is,

858
00:41:45,644 --> 00:41:47,585
what should I be working on right now?

859
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:49,807
Does this make sense for me to do this?

860
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,389
You're not, you're not trying to hit, like, 50 sprints on time.

861
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:53,970
You're trying to make a game.

862
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,532
So try to, try to keep this on the back of your head,

863
00:41:56,532 --> 00:41:58,913
because it's, it's easy in the heat of production

864
00:41:58,913 --> 00:41:59,974
to look at sprints and say,

865
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:01,415
ah, I just want the sprints to match.

866
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:02,796
I want to hit the sprints on time.

867
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:03,757
But you're making a game.

868
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:08,118
Now, I mentioned development testers.

869
00:42:08,118 --> 00:42:10,905
How are they different from, I guess, more traditional testers?

870
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:12,589
Well, first, they are embedded within our team,

871
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:13,511
and we task them.

872
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:18,888
The gameplay experts, for example, the gameplay testers, would be gameplay experts.

873
00:42:18,888 --> 00:42:23,831
So they'll know the subtleties between different systems, and when something that's very subtle

874
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:25,832
is broken, they might be able to tell.

875
00:42:25,832 --> 00:42:28,834
Another great thing about them is they're technical, so we can give them some technical

876
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:29,594
tasks.

877
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:33,876
One of our testers in Far Cry 4 was responsible for doing the animation memory profiling,

878
00:42:33,876 --> 00:42:37,618
so we didn't have to take some animation, some programmer time for this, and we always

879
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:41,320
knew quickly where we were standing in terms of an animation budget.

880
00:42:42,157 --> 00:42:44,399
They also have Visual Studio on their machines.

881
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:48,263
So if you have a changelist that you want to test as soon as possible,

882
00:42:48,263 --> 00:42:49,285
you can shelve it, send it to them.

883
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:51,848
They can unshelve it, compile, and all is good.

884
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:57,494
A great tool that we had on Far Cry 4 to test is what we call preflights.

885
00:42:58,897 --> 00:43:04,058
The, I guess, the simplest way to put it is PreFlight's really a mini-build that is built

886
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:06,039
with a changelist that you put forward.

887
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:09,580
So I'd like to have this mini-build of this version, but just add this changelist.

888
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:14,802
And this is especially useful for us because we shipped on five platforms, so the two Playstations,

889
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:15,943
the two Xbox, and the NPC.

890
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:22,247
And, uh, you, when you, when you work on some major changes, you probably don't want your

891
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:25,609
programmers in the heat of production to have to spend the time to, like, test all five

892
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:26,229
consoles.

893
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:30,632
So you can just do a preflight, the devtesters will go through it and make sure it's fine.

894
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:31,992
Same thing for the difficult repro steps.

895
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:36,875
Just the fact that we added the online co-op component to the game made it so that we have

896
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:37,515
to have...

897
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:43,103
we have to add, like, twice the amount of testers that we had on Far Cry 3.

898
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:45,544
So we went to two to four, because the co-op, like,

899
00:43:45,544 --> 00:43:47,646
it's difficult to test co-op problems alone.

900
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:51,529
And, like, the idea is you want to keep your programmers programming,

901
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,730
you want to keep the animators animating,

902
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,411
and you want to keep the testers testing,

903
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:56,993
because they're the best at it.

904
00:43:56,993 --> 00:44:00,335
How many times have you had a programmer try to test a mission, but

905
00:44:00,335 --> 00:44:02,717
he just fails because he's not good?

906
00:44:02,717 --> 00:44:03,497
That happens, you know?

907
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:10,876
Now this would not be a proper GDC talk if I did not talk about

908
00:44:10,876 --> 00:44:12,977
improving technology to iterate faster.

909
00:44:12,977 --> 00:44:16,498
So it is, it is a focus that we had, right? So

910
00:44:16,498 --> 00:44:19,478
we had better tools, but we also had some pretty crazy stuff in there.

911
00:44:19,478 --> 00:44:21,539
So we got, we got some new systems.

912
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:24,340
So RT-PAL allows us to synchronize

913
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,620
or stream game versions instantly.

914
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,761
We had DevPatcher that allows us to

915
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:31,581
patch data in, in big files also instantly.

916
00:44:31,581 --> 00:44:35,362
And we had FastBuild which reduced our compile time by like

917
00:44:35,362 --> 00:44:36,863
a factor of ten. It's, it's insane.

918
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:42,472
Now, you're probably wondering right now, hey, Marc-André, this sounds

919
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:46,693
unbelievable and, unbelievable and amazing. Where would I go to

920
00:44:46,693 --> 00:44:51,493
find more information? Well, luckily for you, tomorrow morning,

921
00:44:51,493 --> 00:44:54,214
my colleague Rémi Quirinet is doing a talk on this stuff.

922
00:44:54,214 --> 00:44:57,255
So, yeah. Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. Don't miss it.

923
00:44:57,255 --> 00:45:01,915
There's truly some unbelievable stuff in there. I. . .

924
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:04,356
Go see it. It's worth it.

925
00:45:04,356 --> 00:45:04,576
Now. . .

926
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:07,946
The last thing I want to talk about is co-development.

927
00:45:07,946 --> 00:45:13,072
Far Cry 4 is an effort between six studios around the world.

928
00:45:13,072 --> 00:45:15,715
We did a couple key learnings in there.

929
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:19,379
And the first thing you're going to notice is I'm talking about co-development.

930
00:45:19,379 --> 00:45:20,781
I'm not talking about outsourcing.

931
00:45:20,781 --> 00:45:24,705
And the reason is we really try to build a strong partnership.

932
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:28,157
with the other studios that are working with us.

933
00:45:28,157 --> 00:45:30,419
It's about understanding that these studios

934
00:45:30,419 --> 00:45:33,101
could be making their own AAA games

935
00:45:33,101 --> 00:45:35,963
and it's not because of a lack of skill

936
00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:37,804
that they share this project with you.

937
00:45:37,804 --> 00:45:39,185
They could do their own stuff.

938
00:45:39,185 --> 00:45:42,028
It's a matter of realizing that there's no B team.

939
00:45:42,837 --> 00:45:47,121
We work together and we can be, we can make some really great projects this way.

940
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:51,526
One of the key learnings we did, something that worked very well for us, is we had on

941
00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:56,711
the floor in Montreal, we had a co-dev team which was a group of people that were essentially

942
00:45:56,711 --> 00:45:59,714
responsible for managing the collaboration between the different studios.

943
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:03,516
Like these guys are on the floor with us, they're in the stand-up meetings with us,

944
00:46:03,516 --> 00:46:06,198
and they actually act as communication coaches even.

945
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:08,279
Like you work with other studios around the world,

946
00:46:08,279 --> 00:46:11,341
not everybody has the same way of working, not everybody has the same culture.

947
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:15,363
How do you deal with this stuff? We're not necessarily all trained for this.

948
00:46:15,363 --> 00:46:17,725
Now these guys are very good.

949
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:17,825
So...

950
00:46:18,258 --> 00:46:23,663
What we try to do is whenever we have interaction with other studios, we just put them in CC, you know, when we send emails,

951
00:46:23,663 --> 00:46:27,267
and they can read everything and see if there's any potential problem there.

952
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:31,210
You know that email that you send on Friday evening before leaving, and you say,

953
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,473
I don't know, just do it this way, don't do this, you know?

954
00:46:33,473 --> 00:46:37,216
And then you leave and all is good, because you understand that the intention you had were good,

955
00:46:37,216 --> 00:46:40,660
but the other guy on the other end of the line will read your email.

956
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,801
and think, oh my god, this guy, what a douchebag.

957
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:43,741
He's like telling me what to do.

958
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:47,243
And this, these guys are really good for this

959
00:46:47,243 --> 00:46:49,924
because they'll see these problems

960
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:51,805
and they'll flag them forward.

961
00:46:51,805 --> 00:46:54,126
So you probably want some guys to be dedicated

962
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:55,086
to collaborating.

963
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:56,107
It's like six studios.

964
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:58,048
It's not, it's not a small thing.

965
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,868
Another thing is FaceTime is very important.

966
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:02,690
They say that 97% of the information that

967
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:05,271
is conveyed in conversations is really done

968
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:06,671
through the non-verbal stuff.

969
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:10,857
Now, you may or may not believe this number, whatever,

970
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:13,720
but it's still a fact that there's a lot of non-verbal in there.

971
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,744
So what we did is, key people at different studios

972
00:47:16,744 --> 00:47:18,626
met several times in person throughout production.

973
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:20,488
You want to build some good relationships.

974
00:47:20,488 --> 00:47:22,310
And if you ever wonder if it's worth it...

975
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:27,135
to send people, or if you're not sure if it's worth it to have people meet in person,

976
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,738
then if you're not sure, it probably means that it is worth it.

977
00:47:29,738 --> 00:47:31,960
So really, take these opportunities.

978
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,825
The next best thing, which I wish we did more on Far Cry 4, is webcams.

979
00:47:36,825 --> 00:47:38,888
Webcams are super cheap nowadays.

980
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:42,291
There's no reason why, like, not everybody on the floor could have one.

981
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:44,954
So really, buy webcams, encourage people to talk, and...

982
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:50,475
This is, I guess this is kind of all obvious stuff, but it's good to think about it.

983
00:47:50,475 --> 00:47:55,140
And you need to make a conscious effort where, you know when you work with people in person

984
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,943
and you talk to this guy, you have this feeling in the back of your head that, oh, maybe he's

985
00:47:58,943 --> 00:47:59,584
not feeling too good.

986
00:47:59,584 --> 00:48:00,285
What's going on there?

987
00:48:00,285 --> 00:48:03,748
Is there something, some friction under there?

988
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:05,190
And you gotta make sure that...

989
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:10,351
you have the opportunity to see this stuff. So again, webcams, good, build some good relationships.

990
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:16,492
Likewise, if you have problems with somebody and in your workplace, it'll eventually fade away

991
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:20,473
because you meet this guy, you talk with this guy every day, it's like, hey, how you doing,

992
00:48:20,473 --> 00:48:23,934
you know, let's go for some coffee, and then you come back and eventually your problems fade away.

993
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,475
But that's not going to happen with Codev because you don't see these guys on a day-to-day, you

994
00:48:27,475 --> 00:48:31,396
don't see them face-to-face. These problems need to be addressed and your best friends to detect

995
00:48:31,396 --> 00:48:33,477
these problems are the Codev team, again.

996
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:43,492
Yes. OK. Lastly, I want to talk about boundaries. Boundaries are very good. You want, you want

997
00:48:43,492 --> 00:48:48,654
to have a certain area of the game that you really give to your code at studios so that

998
00:48:48,654 --> 00:48:53,135
they can really take ownership and feel empowered in there. I really want to push it forward.

999
00:48:53,135 --> 00:48:58,357
But the boundaries should never be an obstacle to collaboration. The best example I can give

1000
00:48:58,357 --> 00:49:02,098
you is the example of, I got to work one morning.

1001
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:06,632
And Brian from Toronto. So the Toronto team was responsible for Shangri-La.

1002
00:49:06,632 --> 00:49:09,395
You know, the red sequence with the tiger and all this stuff.

1003
00:49:09,395 --> 00:49:11,737
So they're responsible for this. Great job, by the way.

1004
00:49:11,737 --> 00:49:13,419
So Brian pokes me and tells me,

1005
00:49:13,419 --> 00:49:16,582
hey, Mark, you know, we have some bugs left and everything,

1006
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,984
but in the grand scheme of things, the bugs that we have, they're not,

1007
00:49:18,984 --> 00:49:22,248
they're not that important, you know. It's pretty minor stuff.

1008
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:24,950
Could we help you with your stuff?

1009
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,627
When does that happen?

1010
00:49:27,627 --> 00:49:29,828
I got nerd chills just thinking about it.

1011
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:32,089
That's, that's, that's what's going on, right?

1012
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:36,472
So if, if you respect your partner studios, like, you give them a chance of really feeling

1013
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:42,716
empowered and you entertain this relationship, this is the kind of stuff that can happen.

1014
00:49:42,716 --> 00:49:44,036
You can have a Brian story.

1015
00:49:44,036 --> 00:49:49,159
Now the last thing I want to talk about is.

1016
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:55,736
I guess it's a wrap-up. I'd like to mention a little bit quickly the different, the different key,

1017
00:49:55,736 --> 00:50:01,577
key takeaways of, of what I'm trying to say today is what we try to do is we really try to empower

1018
00:50:01,577 --> 00:50:09,298
our team. So find ways for your team members to have opportunities to really take ownership and

1019
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:13,819
especially help each other out. This can only lead to great things. You have a solid team that can

1020
00:50:13,819 --> 00:50:15,840
have each other's back and this is.

1021
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,632
completely underrated. Well, maybe not, but anyway, you should aim for that.

1022
00:50:20,632 --> 00:50:25,374
Secondly, be flexible always. You're not trying to hit sprints, you're trying to make a great

1023
00:50:25,374 --> 00:50:29,437
game. So whenever you're in doubt as to, are you working on the right thing, you probably

1024
00:50:29,437 --> 00:50:34,219
want to think of, does it make sense for me to work on this right now? Is this really

1025
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:39,002
my highest priority? Then, when working on features, you always want to de-risk first,

1026
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:42,864
no matter what. So de-risk, de-risk, de-risk when you plan. This is very important. You

1027
00:50:42,864 --> 00:50:44,585
want to scope often also. You don't want to...

1028
00:50:45,262 --> 00:50:48,323
You don't want to wait until you're at the very end of your production cycle,

1029
00:50:48,323 --> 00:50:51,503
where you're crumbling under a pile of issues that you haven't resolved,

1030
00:50:51,503 --> 00:50:54,504
and then you need to scope features out completely that you can't ship,

1031
00:50:54,504 --> 00:50:57,104
unfortunately, because you didn't scope before.

1032
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:58,305
So scope regularly.

1033
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,245
Again, gameplay first.

1034
00:50:59,245 --> 00:51:03,025
And lastly, have fun.

1035
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:07,026
We, we make a living creating games that countless people will enjoy.

1036
00:51:07,026 --> 00:51:09,747
To me, that is nothing short of amazing.

1037
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:10,267
Should be fun.

1038
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,327
And there's always a way to make it so.

1039
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:34,874
So? Questions? While we get set up for questions, I'd like to take a selfie with you guys, if that's okay.

1040
00:51:34,874 --> 00:51:36,775
Hang on, how does this work?

1041
00:51:36,775 --> 00:51:40,015
Press the button.

1042
00:51:40,015 --> 00:51:44,316
Camera, how's the... what? What? Oh, come on, man. I'm so bad at these things.

1043
00:51:44,316 --> 00:51:50,877
Okay, it's gonna happen. Can we all pretend like we just won 10 million dollars?

1044
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:55,098
So like, really, arms in the air, cheer. Can we do that?

1045
00:51:55,098 --> 00:51:55,478
Okay, let's go, guys.

1046
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,061
Good.

1047
00:51:59,061 --> 00:51:59,641
Thank you so much.

1048
00:51:59,641 --> 00:51:59,681
OK.

1049
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:02,343
Let's hear it.

1050
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:03,584
Yeah.

1051
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:05,826
Nice talk, Marc-André.

1052
00:52:05,826 --> 00:52:08,228
A question for you.

1053
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:14,272
The gameplay team seems to be a pretty autonomous pod.

1054
00:52:14,272 --> 00:52:16,754
How did you handle the communication

1055
00:52:16,754 --> 00:52:19,196
with the rest of the group for other departments?

1056
00:52:19,196 --> 00:52:19,796
OK.

1057
00:52:19,796 --> 00:52:23,319
So every single team on the floor, does this still work?

1058
00:52:23,319 --> 00:52:23,839
Yeah, we're good?

1059
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:26,896
Every single team on the floor has definite owners, right?

1060
00:52:26,896 --> 00:52:29,616
So the gameplay team will have some gameplay owners.

1061
00:52:29,616 --> 00:52:30,916
AI will have their own owners.

1062
00:52:30,916 --> 00:52:34,957
And these guys are kind of always in constant collaboration

1063
00:52:34,957 --> 00:52:36,997
and constant communication.

1064
00:52:36,997 --> 00:52:39,658
So when we do work on some new systems,

1065
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:41,838
these guys will talk with you.

1066
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:43,519
I kind of skipped over it a little bit.

1067
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:45,659
But our lead game designer, in our case,

1068
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:47,019
was the gameplay owner, was really

1069
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:49,920
responsible to make sure that the whole gameplay was solid.

1070
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,360
AI, for example, had their AI owner.

1071
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,560
And these guys are in constant collaboration.

1072
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,945
Now when we do our sprints, we send the sprint out to all the various leads so we know what

1073
00:52:58,945 --> 00:52:59,945
every team is focusing on.

1074
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:04,249
And what I mentioned earlier about unblocking coworkers, it's just not people within your

1075
00:53:04,249 --> 00:53:04,789
team.

1076
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:08,572
If, for example, AI team is stuck on something, you unblock them and next time around they're

1077
00:53:08,572 --> 00:53:09,513
going to unblock you.

1078
00:53:09,513 --> 00:53:11,995
So this is a very key thing.

1079
00:53:11,995 --> 00:53:13,577
Does that answer your question?

1080
00:53:13,577 --> 00:53:14,257
Yes, thank you.

1081
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:14,517
Yes?

1082
00:53:14,517 --> 00:53:15,098
Awesome.

1083
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:23,196
Hi. So when you were talking about sprints, it sounded like you guys are doing a version

1084
00:53:23,196 --> 00:53:28,959
of Scrum, and part of Scrum is retros, and I was wondering, do you guys do that at all,

1085
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:33,862
or why not, if not? Part of Scrum is what? Retros, like retrospectives, where you talk

1086
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:38,524
about that sprint. Okay, so you mean when we're finished, should a sprint reflect on

1087
00:53:38,524 --> 00:53:39,645
what we did? Yes.

1088
00:53:41,274 --> 00:53:46,339
What we did as an exercise is, so when we do the planning for the next sprint, what we like to do is,

1089
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:51,425
well, it started off as poker plannings, but it took too long, didn't work so well.

1090
00:53:51,425 --> 00:53:52,906
So what we eventually do is...

1091
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:57,459
When we finish a sprint and we try to plan the next one,

1092
00:53:57,459 --> 00:53:58,820
we have a meeting with the team.

1093
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,001
So we'll take like 20, 30 minutes.

1094
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:02,323
And this is where we'll sit down with the guys,

1095
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:04,405
and we're going to communicate the objectives

1096
00:54:04,405 --> 00:54:05,706
for the next sprint.

1097
00:54:05,706 --> 00:54:08,408
And we can also take this time to really pinpoint the stuff,

1098
00:54:08,408 --> 00:54:10,550
for example, that slipped in the next sprint,

1099
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,631
and reflect on our wins also.

1100
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:13,512
So we try to do it with the team.

1101
00:54:13,512 --> 00:54:16,274
But one thing that's important for me

1102
00:54:16,274 --> 00:54:18,836
is I really want to try to maximize.

1103
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:22,509
to maximize the time that the guys have to work on their stuff.

1104
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:26,172
So I try to keep these meetings short and like the stand-up meetings,

1105
00:54:26,172 --> 00:54:30,835
I like to keep them to three minutes, just, you know, as short as possible.

1106
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:33,757
So, so yes, we do, we do take time to do some retrospect,

1107
00:54:33,757 --> 00:54:35,658
but it, but it's not really a formal process.

1108
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:42,007
We're very, I guess Scrum is a little bit more, you know, structured.

1109
00:54:42,007 --> 00:54:46,994
We try to be very, very flexible, like I said, because it is what works best for us.

1110
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:48,777
Does that answer your question?

1111
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:49,237
Yes, thank you.

1112
00:54:49,237 --> 00:54:49,938
Okay, thank you.

1113
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:52,832
Hi, first of all, great talk.

1114
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:53,833
Thank you.

1115
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,833
I was curious, as a programmer point of view,

1116
00:54:55,833 --> 00:55:00,015
when you're working on the proto phase of a feature,

1117
00:55:00,015 --> 00:55:02,376
are you taking time to do clean code,

1118
00:55:02,376 --> 00:55:03,996
even if it's taking more time?

1119
00:55:03,996 --> 00:55:06,397
And maybe if you scrap the feature,

1120
00:55:06,397 --> 00:55:10,679
or are you just hacking it and make it work just to test it?

1121
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,322
We don't really do throw away code, and the reason why we're comfortable doing this is

1122
00:55:17,322 --> 00:55:22,383
because there's this process, you know, before it where we're already doing the gut checks

1123
00:55:22,383 --> 00:55:25,845
and the FSO process has already started where the other departments are involved.

1124
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:32,187
So what typically happens is like 98 percent, I'm not going to give a number because that's

1125
00:55:32,187 --> 00:55:38,770
ridiculous, but the vast, vast majority of the features that we do, they're in the game,

1126
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:38,890
right?

1127
00:55:39,372 --> 00:55:44,553
So, what will typically happen is this prototype, it's going to evolve into some things sometimes

1128
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:48,634
completely different, but we really do try to have a good foundation.

1129
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:50,835
We don't want to have to code something and then have to code it again.

1130
00:55:50,835 --> 00:55:54,756
Like I said, we're comfortable doing that because of the steps before and we've gotten

1131
00:55:54,756 --> 00:55:59,897
used to making sure that the crazy ideas are filtered out a little bit earlier on, but

1132
00:55:59,897 --> 00:56:03,778
then there's nothing telling you that when you start working on this prototype that maybe

1133
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:07,759
like it can change completely or it's supposed to be this and it can be scoped down to this.

1134
00:56:07,759 --> 00:56:08,559
But no, we try to have...

1135
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:12,881
a decent foundation. I'm not going to say the code that we do in Proto is going to be final,

1136
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:16,923
but we make it so that we don't have to rewrite the whole thing if we do keep the feature.

1137
00:56:16,923 --> 00:56:18,244
Alright, thank you. Cool.

1138
00:56:18,244 --> 00:56:24,006
Hi, it all sounds a little bit like a fairy tale to me.

1139
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:24,527
Yes.

1140
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:25,967
Like everything was peachy and all went well.

1141
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:26,448
Yes.

1142
00:56:26,448 --> 00:56:32,991
But can you mention like maybe one big mistake or problem you did during development that you would wish you didn't?

1143
00:56:32,991 --> 00:56:33,971
One big mistake?

1144
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:38,373
I don't know if I could say big mistakes, I mean...

1145
00:56:39,241 --> 00:56:46,848
The mistakes overall, the stuff that we really learn from, you know, like...

1146
00:56:46,848 --> 00:56:47,709
These are all...

1147
00:56:47,709 --> 00:56:56,177
To me, mistakes are really opportunities to learn stuff.

1148
00:56:56,177 --> 00:57:00,862
And if you learn something from a situation, is it really that much of a mistake, really?

1149
00:57:00,862 --> 00:57:04,405
I mean, the process that you see here...

1150
00:57:05,498 --> 00:57:09,180
It's kind of the result of iteration over several years.

1151
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:13,662
So the mistakes are really the problems that

1152
00:57:13,662 --> 00:57:14,923
happen that we try to solve.

1153
00:57:14,923 --> 00:57:18,645
So in this case, a problem that would happen early on,

1154
00:57:18,645 --> 00:57:20,686
before we had this process, would be, hey guys,

1155
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:21,146
what's going on?

1156
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:24,548
We have a hard time iterating because we have a hard time,

1157
00:57:24,548 --> 00:57:26,268
for example, getting support from animation

1158
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:29,110
because they're busy with some other top priority stuff.

1159
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,371
So that, to me, I guess, would qualify as a mistake.

1160
00:57:31,371 --> 00:57:32,551
And it's these things that we try

1161
00:57:32,551 --> 00:57:33,712
to address with this process.

1162
00:57:34,546 --> 00:57:36,238
So in this case, if...

1163
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:41,467
I guess if you're asking me if there's one thing that would really improve in the process,

1164
00:57:41,467 --> 00:57:44,568
if I knew I would have tried it already.

1165
00:57:44,568 --> 00:57:50,549
What I'd like really for us to do is try to find even more ways for the guys to really

1166
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:52,949
take ownership and push the feature forward.

1167
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:57,210
So well I guess it's one of the things that I really tried to hammer, where you want people

1168
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,011
to really have each other's back and help each other.

1169
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:03,832
And whenever there's areas where we can improve in this regard, then those are the ones that

1170
00:58:03,832 --> 00:58:06,512
you should really look out for and try to.

1171
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:13,616
try to improve. Any other questions? We good? Alright, thank you so much.
