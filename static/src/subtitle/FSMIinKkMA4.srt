1
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:09,389
My name is Vivian Tan. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Beast Inc.

2
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:14,811
And I just want to apologize in advance if I need to cough and my voice is cracking because I'm getting over a flu.

3
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:17,193
I'll try to keep that down.

4
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:25,157
So I want to start off by telling you a little more about our company and what we do.

5
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:31,220
We are a San Francisco-based startup, and we make AI-driven virtual pets.

6
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:39,623
We are the creators of Beast Pets, which is a VR sandbox experience and pet dragon simulator.

7
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:42,685
It's currently out in early access on Steam.

8
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:48,949
It's this friendly little world where you can go into and play with five baby dragons

9
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,771
and they each have their own unique personalities.

10
00:00:52,231 --> 00:01:01,037
And our goal for Beast Pets is to create your best virtual pet friend for VR and AR.

11
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:07,920
So over the past few years, my team and I have put a lot of work into creating these

12
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,122
lovable, believable little creatures.

13
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:17,748
And in this process, we discovered that body language plays a huge role in creating very

14
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:21,311
believable and compelling AI characters.

15
00:01:27,204 --> 00:01:31,328
You don't really need a lot of hyper-realism to create a believable character,

16
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:36,293
but you do need to look at a lot of nuanced movements and presence.

17
00:01:38,676 --> 00:01:41,239
So what do I mean by body language?

18
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:46,646
Here I'm not really just talking about animations

19
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:49,326
or what we traditionally think of as body language.

20
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:51,727
I'm using it in a more holistic sense,

21
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:56,567
especially in a very spatial medium like virtual reality.

22
00:01:57,148 --> 00:02:00,148
So body language in this particular context

23
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:04,989
could mean physical presence or spatial interactions,

24
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:09,650
eye contact, or even the player's gestures,

25
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,550
not just the AI character's gestures.

26
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,024
So why is body language important?

27
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:20,491
This is something, I admit, right off the bat,

28
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,816
we didn't realize that body language would play

29
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:25,201
such a huge role in creating our characters.

30
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:31,327
When we first started putting together this wishlist for making awesome AI characters,

31
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:35,529
we looked at all the sexy tech, basically.

32
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:41,072
Like, we're like, okay, we're going to have this very sophisticated audio communication layer

33
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:44,274
with dynamic dialogue, chatbots, voice recognition.

34
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:48,336
And then we're going to add an even more sophisticated animation layer

35
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,718
with procedural physics-based animations and mocap.

36
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:53,839
And on top of that, hey, why not...

37
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:58,961
Computer vision, machine learning, and all this for creating contextual awareness.

38
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:03,283
And then we just dove right in, like not really knowing what we're doing,

39
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,464
except like all this text sounds really cool.

40
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:09,986
And then once we started building, we realized that we are missing something

41
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,727
much more fundamental.

42
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:14,488
Body language.

43
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:19,587
Body language, as I mentioned before, not just animations,

44
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:24,909
but how this character shares this physical space with the player.

45
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:28,250
How do these physical interactions play out?

46
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,591
And lots of other small things.

47
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,672
And in this process, we also realized that, you know,

48
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:37,273
this wasn't immediately obvious to us because...

49
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:42,544
If you think about our real lives, on a day-to-day level, we engage in body language all the time, right?

50
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:44,345
I'm moving my hands to communicate.

51
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:49,267
I stand a certain way or I stand a certain distance from other people or animals.

52
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:52,009
But a lot of this is subconscious.

53
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:56,311
We don't really actively think about what we are doing with our postures, with our hands.

54
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:57,892
Not for the most part.

55
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:03,175
But when you're building this creature or this humanoid, this character from scratch,

56
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:04,996
you have to build that in.

57
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:10,445
And then we realized that, and we kind of use that as a check now,

58
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:15,107
it's like, okay, if we're creating a character that can talk or do something more advanced,

59
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:18,489
but something still feels off, we kind of dial it back a lot.

60
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:19,950
We look at the foundation layer.

61
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,732
It's like, is there something about the character's body language

62
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,974
that's sending the wrong signals on the subconscious level?

63
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:32,435
Because usually those subtle little things is probably something

64
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:36,017
that can make or break the believability of a character.

65
00:04:37,429 --> 00:04:40,630
And as we spent more time on creating these foundational interactions,

66
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,011
we discovered two more things.

67
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:46,553
One, these actions are very much native to VR.

68
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:51,695
You now have this space in which you share with the VR character

69
00:04:52,135 --> 00:04:55,937
that wasn't previously available if you were designing games or interactions.

70
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:59,898
Even in 3D, if you're viewing it on a 2D screen,

71
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:01,699
that was not nearly as obvious

72
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,460
as when you're literally sharing the same physical space.

73
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:14,005
Two, this is great because that means all of these interactions are available to pretty much every VR designer out there, right?

74
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:20,768
You don't need to know necessarily anything about voice recognition or machine learning and all the extra layers,

75
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:25,431
but you can, by building in VR, you can still take advantage of body language.

76
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:32,723
So we doubled down on focusing on body language for our pet dragon characters,

77
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:41,428
and we also discovered, pleasantly, that you can convey a lot of emotion or context,

78
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:47,292
relationships, even without going into the other layers. So that's why we decided to

79
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:53,976
focus more on body language as a foundation, and that can serve as a baseline and a framework for

80
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:56,654
more advanced AI layers.

81
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:04,938
So through body language, we can provide a lot of context

82
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:06,599
for the player.

83
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,601
You can establish the power dynamics

84
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:11,302
between the player and the character.

85
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:15,684
You can explain the context of experience

86
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:17,185
without even using words.

87
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:19,946
You can convey the relationship between them.

88
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:24,109
And you can convey the intent of the AI characters.

89
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:29,417
You can prompt players to perform desired actions without explicitly telling them.

90
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:35,959
And very importantly, you can minimize reliance on dialogue, subtitles, and menus.

91
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,661
And on top of body language, you can build a foundation for more complex AI behaviors

92
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:44,102
like we were just talking about.

93
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:50,302
So I want to give you some tools and examples

94
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:53,943
that you can implement in your own VR experiences.

95
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,243
This is not intended to be a comprehensive,

96
00:06:57,303 --> 00:07:00,024
exhaustive list of everything you can do with body language,

97
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:04,525
because we're still learning and discovering a lot of things

98
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:06,825
about how we can use VR and build characters.

99
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:10,226
Nor do you have to include everything I just mentioned,

100
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:12,027
but this is kind of food for thought

101
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:14,947
and bring up more prominent examples

102
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:16,948
that you can hopefully integrate.

103
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,930
So first off, scale and power dynamics.

104
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,653
Scale is one of the most powerful things

105
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:31,195
you can use in VR to convey whether the player

106
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:35,358
or the AI character has more power and more control.

107
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,520
So on the two extreme ends of this

108
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,542
is you have a very large player and very small characters,

109
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:43,463
or vice versa.

110
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:49,797
So if you're in a space with tiny characters and a big player,

111
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:53,641
you are automatically conveying that the player has control.

112
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:57,245
And the player's roles could be a variety of things.

113
00:07:57,305 --> 00:08:00,408
You can build, you can guide the characters,

114
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,452
you can protect them, or you can manipulate the characters

115
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:05,693
or their environment.

116
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,954
And the relationship here could be benevolent or malevolent.

117
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:11,575
It really depends on the context of the game.

118
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:14,396
But the size differential already

119
00:08:14,436 --> 00:08:15,936
conveys a lot of information.

120
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:19,758
An example of this is Moss.

121
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:24,339
In the world of Moss, you, the player, are the guardian.

122
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,061
You are this benevolent being.

123
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:32,343
And your role here is to guide and protect

124
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:34,163
a little mouse named Quill.

125
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,341
So Quill's very cute. She has these really cute animations.

126
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:42,104
So all of those are cues that, you know, you have a friendly relationship.

127
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:43,024
You're supposed to protect her.

128
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:46,287
But right off the bat, even before you interact with her,

129
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:51,271
you already know the power dynamic based on the size differential.

130
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:57,595
The other extreme are giant characters and tiny players.

131
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:00,497
In this world, you tend to have very little control.

132
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:03,960
And your role is typically to observe.

133
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,746
to avoid or to learn.

134
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:12,210
An example of this is the big whale in the blue.

135
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,413
So the whale's not really an AI character, it's more of an NPC.

136
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:18,975
But I think it's just a good way to illustrate

137
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:22,077
how the size differential sets the context and the power

138
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:23,258
dynamic in this world.

139
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:25,640
So you're in the underwater world,

140
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,700
but you're kind of a tourist.

141
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,122
You don't have a whole lot of control or influence

142
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:29,883
over the environment.

143
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:39,612
And nothing demonstrates that more than when a big whale swims past you and you realize

144
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,773
that you're really just a very small part of this world.

145
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:48,015
Another example is the large life-size dragon in Skyrim.

146
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:53,716
So in this case, you aren't just a Meserver, you have to fight the dragon, but the size

147
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:55,997
differential tells you that you're not the boss here.

148
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,217
You have to fight the boss.

149
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:05,615
So, in between these two extremes, we have normal-sized characters.

150
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,922
They don't necessarily have to be the same size as the human,

151
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,984
but they're kind of a more realistic scale.

152
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:15,886
And this is where you have a lot of nuance.

153
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:19,408
So here on screen, you can see the representations, right?

154
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:23,811
The AI character, represented by the little robot icon,

155
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:26,513
can be slightly smaller or slightly bigger than the player.

156
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,095
And on a 2D screen, it doesn't make too much of a difference.

157
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,278
But in VR, that small size differential

158
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:42,266
could convey volumes about your relationship with the AI character and what your roles

159
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:42,486
are.

160
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:48,573
So, an example that I really like, that I came across a couple of weeks ago when I was

161
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:55,721
at OC6, and I sat in on a talk from the Oculus creators that created First Steps.

162
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:59,236
So First Steps is a really short intro app

163
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:03,479
on the Oculus Quest headset where you encounter a robot

164
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,103
and he, she, it walks you through a tutorial

165
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:10,625
to teach you how to use the controllers

166
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:12,206
and how to interact with the environment.

167
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:16,229
So this is a friendly relationship

168
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,671
in which you're supposed to be learning from this robot.

169
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:21,573
And the Oculus developers that created this,

170
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,054
they discovered that initially

171
00:11:23,094 --> 00:11:25,076
they had like a six foot tall robot.

172
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:29,207
But players come in all shapes and sizes.

173
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:31,808
So when they were testing this with players

174
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:34,668
that are about my size, and I'm five feet tall,

175
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:37,029
there's a robot that's towering.

176
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:39,150
It is sticking its hands in your face,

177
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,450
like, use these controllers.

178
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,411
And you're just like, dude, get away from me.

179
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,671
So that is not the relationship you

180
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:48,712
want to create when you want to have a friendly interaction.

181
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:56,563
I thought that was a really good example of, you know, when you are creating friendly characters,

182
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:05,296
you typically want to err on the side of having the friendly AI characters be slightly smaller

183
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:06,938
or shorter than the player.

184
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,262
Now, if the relationship is supposed to be antagonistic,

185
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,304
then you have a lot more freedom, right?

186
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:15,465
The enemy can be larger or smaller.

187
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:18,927
And if you want to dial up how threatening the enemy is,

188
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:20,648
you can just make them increasingly larger

189
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:22,629
and tell them the size of the dragon in Skyrim.

190
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,252
One tool that you can use

191
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:29,934
is to dynamically scale the character height.

192
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:32,382
to match the player.

193
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:37,283
So for instance, you measure where the average HMD height is

194
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:40,464
on the player, and then you can scale the character down

195
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:43,725
or adjust their height placement to match that of the player.

196
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:45,766
It's not always available,

197
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:47,946
but it's one tool that you can consider.

198
00:12:48,426 --> 00:12:51,047
And also, these are not hard and fast rules,

199
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:53,228
and I also believe that rules are meant to be broken,

200
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:55,208
especially as we're trying to discover

201
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,829
more and more things in VR.

202
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:58,789
But it creates a good baseline

203
00:12:58,829 --> 00:12:59,810
on which you can kind of...

204
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,510
Measure. You can set player's expectations and measure and test the results.

205
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:12,472
Another tool that's at your disposal in VR is vertical space.

206
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:19,493
Where you put AI characters conveys a lot

207
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,054
about how much threat they're posing to the player.

208
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:26,334
If they're coming in high above you,

209
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:28,674
they tend to pose more threat.

210
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:29,855
If they're...

211
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:34,425
Far below eye level and we're on the ground, they present low threat.

212
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,046
Sorry, I think I had that backwards.

213
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:40,669
Coming in high, high threat. Coming in low, low threat.

214
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:46,252
And at about eye level and chest level, they present a neutral level of threat.

215
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:51,655
So you can use other cues to represent if they're supposed to be friendlies or unfriendlies

216
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:52,816
if they're in the neutral zone.

217
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:55,078
Some example of this.

218
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,734
So all of these characters and entities on the screen

219
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:02,455
are roughly one cubic feet,

220
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,496
but they're starting in their default positions

221
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:08,157
say a lot about the threat level they present.

222
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:13,839
So up high, you have the space pirate trainer robots, right?

223
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,839
When you start playing in space pirate trainer,

224
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,040
you are on a platform

225
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,480
and a robot is hovering high above you.

226
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:22,501
Eventually the robots will lower to about

227
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:31,145
You're hiding, they zoom in towards you, but the starting position already conveys a lot about their intent and their relationship to you.

228
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,188
On the low threat level, you have a little robot dog in the VAL.

229
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:41,490
It's small, it's cute, but it's also on the ground, so it's not really presenting a lot of threat.

230
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:46,730
In the neutral zone is where we're putting our pet dragons, typically.

231
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,211
And I have the Beat Saber blocks in there.

232
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:53,113
I know they're not AI characters, but I think they're just kind of like the most recognizable

233
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:55,274
example of entities you can react with.

234
00:14:55,774 --> 00:14:58,376
And they're typically placed in the neutral zone.

235
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:03,018
And then the designers use other cues, such as the fact that you're holding sabers,

236
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:06,960
to convey to the player what you're supposed to be doing with them.

237
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,981
So in the neutral zone, you have a lot of leeway.

238
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:18,616
And what's funny is that we discovered through trial and error that the positioning conveys

239
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:25,442
so much about threat levels that even if your character design is that of a friendly being,

240
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:30,147
if they're placed high above, they become almost automatically threatening.

241
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,349
So initially we did not

242
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:36,055
limit how high our dragons can fly.

243
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:39,137
We're like, okay, well, they're the size of house cats.

244
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:40,497
They're meant to be cute and cuddly.

245
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:42,799
We have all of these contextual cues

246
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,419
telling you that these are friendly creatures.

247
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,981
But then we also noticed that

248
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:48,462
because we designed them to fly

249
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:49,622
into the player's field of view,

250
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:52,104
if players start looking up, the dragons fly higher,

251
00:15:52,124 --> 00:15:53,364
the players look up even more,

252
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:54,565
and pretty soon you would have

253
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:57,847
this swarm of dragons staring down at you.

254
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:00,313
And it doesn't matter if they're cute.

255
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:02,995
When you have five dragons just hovering above you,

256
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:04,456
it becomes really intense.

257
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:06,177
And that's when we learned, like,

258
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,259
okay, we need to put a limit on how high they can fly.

259
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,120
So right now we're aiming to keep them

260
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,302
at between, like, chest level and eye level,

261
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,983
so they can stay between the neutral to friendly zone.

262
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:24,688
Proximity plays such a huge role in context.

263
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,318
And it's one of those things in retrospect,

264
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,379
it's like, well, yeah, obviously, right, proximity.

265
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,381
But it's like, when we started breaking this down,

266
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:36,003
we noticed a lot of nuance and a lot of things

267
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:39,205
that we can play with, with only proximity.

268
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:45,769
So one, you can indicate which characters are active

269
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:48,591
or passive based on how close they are to the player.

270
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:53,014
So one of my favorite examples is Gorn.

271
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,276
So in Gorn, you play a gladiator,

272
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,979
and you're inside this gladiator arena

273
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,641
fighting other gladiators.

274
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:05,104
The arena is divided into two sections.

275
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:08,588
There's the pit in which you're actively

276
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,450
fighting these AI gladiators,

277
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,833
and then there's the spectator area

278
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:14,114
that I like to call the bleachers.

279
00:17:14,154 --> 00:17:17,638
That's elevated above the immediate play area.

280
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,801
So there are multiple contextual cues going on here.

281
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:23,962
So you have the players that you're immediately fighting,

282
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:28,324
and then you have these spectators that are up there,

283
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:30,225
and they're leering down at you.

284
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:32,246
They are not friendlies, right?

285
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:34,066
Hence, they are in the high-threat zone.

286
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,947
But they're also far away.

287
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:39,068
They're not in the immediate player area.

288
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:41,769
So you know by proximity that,

289
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,571
okay, those guys are not an immediate threat,

290
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,071
but they're also not friendlies.

291
00:17:47,984 --> 00:18:02,871
Another observation here is that the other gladiators you fight have limbs, so they can attack you because, you know, they have the ability to run towards you, they have the ability to wield weapons, whereas the spectators are just talking heads.

292
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:11,035
They have no bodies. So at first glance, you know that those guys aren't just going to start jumping into the pit and attacking you because they physically cannot.

293
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:17,756
So I just thought this is such a great example of multiple layers of body cues at play,

294
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:24,338
conveying the context, the intent, who your enemy is, who's a friendly or who's just a passive NPC.

295
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:33,579
You can also use proximity to prompt player movement, right? A character that's immediately

296
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:38,180
within the player's reach encourages the player to be stationary because you don't have to move.

297
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,343
A character that is slightly out of reach encourages the player to physically take steps

298
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,624
and walk towards the character.

299
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:53,648
And a character that is further away encourages the player to explore teleportations

300
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:59,812
or other virtual types of locomotion in order to get to that part of the play area.

301
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:06,416
Eye contact is also a very useful tool.

302
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:13,946
Especially in VR, instead of just having the character stare out to the screen,

303
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,588
kind of like breaking the fourth wall, as you would in 2D game,

304
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:19,930
they can make direct eye contact with the player,

305
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,392
and that conveys a lot of information,

306
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,354
and you can use that to accomplish a number of things.

307
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:31,278
And when you use eye contact in conjunction with field of view,

308
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:34,721
you can do a lot to direct the player's attention.

309
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:40,361
So when we first started building this, we were like,

310
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,622
oh, OK, well, eye contact is so cool.

311
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:45,225
We never had this before on a 2D screen.

312
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,307
Let's make sure the dragons acknowledge you,

313
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:49,248
look you into the eye.

314
00:19:49,448 --> 00:19:51,990
And we kind of overdid it a little bit.

315
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:55,653
So they wouldn't break eye contact with the player,

316
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,755
and that became really, really intense.

317
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:01,438
So like I said, all these little cues could

318
00:20:02,712 --> 00:20:06,073
and do your character design, your set design.

319
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:09,393
Because we had people cringing at the dragons.

320
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:11,054
We're like, reach out, pet them, they're cute.

321
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:12,154
They're like, they're staring.

322
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:13,795
So we're like, okay, all right.

323
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:15,555
Okay, we gotta break eye contact.

324
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:16,815
How do we do that naturally?

325
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:19,976
So now we kind of have the dragons just zone out

326
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:22,057
a little bit, they'll stare up into space.

327
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,818
They look at each other, they look at toys.

328
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,918
So they're no longer just staring at the player.

329
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:33,801
And another thing we did was that we wanted to give these little guys a life of their

330
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:34,002
own.

331
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:37,666
So even if you're not playing with them, they can be off playing by themselves or doing

332
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:38,287
their own thing.

333
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,911
The problem is the players don't know that there are dragons behind them.

334
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:43,372
And this is not just us.

335
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,955
VR developers complain all the time about, you know...

336
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:50,198
You want to encourage the players to turn around and explore their play space,

337
00:20:50,258 --> 00:20:53,719
but if you're new to VR, you just go in there and you stare straight ahead.

338
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,061
So this is where you can use a combination of eye contact and field of view to direct the player.

339
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:03,763
So what we do is we have the dragons occasionally check for the player

340
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:06,325
and just kind of fly into their periphery.

341
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:10,046
They don't have to straight on stare, but just kind of come into the side of field of view,

342
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:12,767
maybe flit out a little bit, and just little actions,

343
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:14,908
letting the player know it's like, hey, look to your left.

344
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:17,169
They are interesting things over here.

345
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:19,851
So it's a useful tool for getting players to follow

346
00:21:20,952 --> 00:21:21,512
or look around.

347
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:26,976
So another thing I like to talk about

348
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:32,640
is using the aforementioned tools in combination

349
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:35,983
to apply attention pressure to the player.

350
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:39,225
So we talked about proximity.

351
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,147
We talked about direct and indirect eye contact.

352
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,877
So these are two variables you can play with,

353
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:48,661
but you can also adjust the number of AI characters.

354
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:53,346
And by combining these three variables and adjusting them,

355
00:21:53,586 --> 00:21:57,751
you can accomplish a lot of nonverbal cues

356
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,953
to get the players to take different actions.

357
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:06,440
So, for example, if we dial up all three variables, right?

358
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:11,926
Lots of AIs, close proximity to the player, making direct eye contact.

359
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:16,128
You're creating high attention pressure and therefore high urgency.

360
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:21,372
This could mean that you want the players to fight them or that there's something

361
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:24,554
really important going on and you want the player to pay attention.

362
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:34,280
Conversely, low pressure would put the player more at ease and encourage exploration.

363
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:41,551
So in the examples I mentioned with us accidentally putting too much pressure on the player with

364
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:47,155
the dragons, we were kind of just making them cower and not really encouraging them to go

365
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:49,917
out and explore this friendly world we had built for them.

366
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:54,881
So we learned that by easing up on the attention pressure, right, kind of have the dragons

367
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:55,101
just...

368
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:57,184
Stay a safe distance away.

369
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:01,407
We're telling the players, like, you can navigate this world

370
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,048
at your own pace.

371
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:05,370
And we're inviting curiosity.

372
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,811
We're encouraging exploration.

373
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:10,213
You can also switch it up.

374
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:16,018
If you increase attention pressure and decrease it,

375
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:18,699
for instance, having a character come towards the player,

376
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,381
make eye contact, and then run away.

377
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:22,062
And by alternating that.

378
00:23:22,897 --> 00:23:24,797
you can create curiosity.

379
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:25,737
The player will be like,

380
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:28,458
hey, this AI is trying to grab my attention.

381
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:29,538
Maybe I should follow.

382
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:34,540
So yeah, so by combining all of these variables

383
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,661
and adjusting the parameters,

384
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:41,182
you can invite the player to take a lot of actions

385
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:43,842
without ever expressly telling them to.

386
00:23:46,483 --> 00:23:49,484
Lastly, I want to talk a bit about hand gestures.

387
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:54,186
So this is yet another tool that's available in VR

388
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,907
that we didn't quite have before

389
00:23:56,087 --> 00:24:01,990
when we were just creating for like a 2D screen play space.

390
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:09,053
So you can use hand gestures to reinforce the player's roles

391
00:24:09,153 --> 00:24:10,713
and also the character's roles.

392
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:16,956
One thing we learned is to treat hands as tools,

393
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:19,177
and I'll elaborate on that a little more in a second.

394
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:24,996
And two, hand gestures comply not just to the AI characters,

395
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:26,797
but to the players themselves.

396
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:30,579
So this is where you can have a lot more dynamic interaction.

397
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:37,604
One of the things we learned is to only allow the hand gestures

398
00:24:37,784 --> 00:24:39,765
you want the players to use.

399
00:24:40,205 --> 00:24:42,647
And this ties back to using hands as tools, right?

400
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:48,710
If you don't want them to attack the AI,

401
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:50,771
then don't give them a fist.

402
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:53,828
Because we learned the hard way, too.

403
00:24:53,848 --> 00:24:55,769
Like, if you give them a fist, they will use it.

404
00:24:57,431 --> 00:24:58,752
So a couple of examples.

405
00:24:58,952 --> 00:25:02,935
If you give them an open palm, that signifies friendliness.

406
00:25:02,955 --> 00:25:03,756
Because they can wave.

407
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:04,557
They can high five.

408
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:08,220
Closed fist typically signifies hostility,

409
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,281
because they can punch.

410
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:15,626
Two examples of this in Alchemy Lab's vacation simulator.

411
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:23,027
You have these cartoony hands, but you can wave at the robot characters,

412
00:25:23,427 --> 00:25:26,090
and that gets their attention, and they know that you need help,

413
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,211
so they come to you for help.

414
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:33,498
I don't have it on here, but in Rec Room, you can high-five other players.

415
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:39,344
They're not AI characters, but it's also just an example of how you'd be using hand gestures.

416
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:48,007
In boxing games like Creed, you have fists, you have boxing gloves, so you know that you

417
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:49,488
have an antagonistic relationship.

418
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:54,254
But as we learned in Creating Our Dragons, even if you don't have gloves...

419
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:58,337
Just the fact that they can form a fist, people will use it.

420
00:25:58,477 --> 00:26:03,441
So, again, kind of the incongruousness of the body language

421
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:06,364
is compared to the context you're trying to, the tone you're trying to set.

422
00:26:06,424 --> 00:26:09,607
Like, in our game, we wanted a friendly relationship,

423
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:12,249
but when we put people in there, they had fists, they were punching the dragons.

424
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:14,631
We're like, okay, well, time to take those fists away.

425
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:19,875
Because that was not the relationship we wanted to reinforce.

426
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:24,972
And I should also mention that when we defined hand gestures,

427
00:26:25,132 --> 00:26:29,613
this was using the HTC Vive controllers or the Oculus Touch

428
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:30,234
controllers.

429
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,454
So you could limit hand gestures.

430
00:26:33,094 --> 00:26:35,735
Now that Oculus has introduced hand tracking,

431
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:38,076
you pretty much have the full range of motion.

432
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:40,836
We have not yet looked into that, what that means,

433
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:43,157
because now people can form fists if they want to.

434
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:45,918
So that will be a really interesting area

435
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,638
to explore as we move forward with this.

436
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:56,401
Last but not least, so how do you know that any of these tools, tips, and tricks actually work?

437
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:03,023
It really just comes back to doing a lot of playtesting. I feel like as developers we're kind

438
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:07,664
of primed to think about things a certain way already, so what we ended up doing was just

439
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:12,465
testing it across lots of different people, people who are not in our genre, people who've never

440
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:13,265
played in VR.

441
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,427
So we can get their immediate visceral reaction.

442
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:21,951
We were talking about body language operating on such a subconscious level.

443
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,853
It actually works really well to test with first-time people because

444
00:27:25,373 --> 00:27:28,576
that's the level they're reacting on and you can get a lot of useful feedback.

445
00:27:29,796 --> 00:27:36,881
So that wraps it up for today and if you'd like to get in touch with me,

446
00:27:36,941 --> 00:27:38,943
that's my email and my Twitter.

447
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,505
And we're opening up to questions.

448
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:55,951
You know with the hand tracking, I wonder if it would be possible to game it so to speak,

449
00:27:55,991 --> 00:27:59,754
not to make too bad a pun, so that no matter what you did, no matter what the sensor was

450
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:02,296
picking up, it would never show a fist.

451
00:28:02,756 --> 00:28:03,917
Couldn't you do that somehow?

452
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,579
Program it that way?

453
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:09,760
That's a really, really good observation.

454
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,662
I'm sorry, let me repeat the question in case other people didn't hear it.

455
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:19,865
The question is, can you limit the hand motion range even with hand tracking?

456
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,506
So, like, even if you're forming a closed fist in real life...

457
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:23,707
All you'd see would be...

458
00:28:23,947 --> 00:28:25,527
Right, all you'd see is this.

459
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:32,291
Yeah, that's really interesting because one of the reasons we didn't look into hand tracking yet

460
00:28:32,391 --> 00:28:34,291
is because we wanted the haptic feedback.

461
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:38,554
But then I've been told by a lot of developers that you get this sort of ghost sensation,

462
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:44,057
even though you don't have haptics. And so I wonder how much incongruity that would create,

463
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:47,699
like if your real hands don't match your virtual hands.

464
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:51,541
It would be like forcing people to be friendly. And it would be interesting to observe what

465
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:54,943
effect it has on them. If your anger can never find the muscular expression.

466
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,604
How will that affect you ultimately?

467
00:28:56,624 --> 00:28:58,265
And it could be an interesting psychological tool

468
00:28:58,285 --> 00:28:59,065
as part of the game.

469
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:01,307
That is, that is really interesting.

470
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:03,108
We would, when we get into hand tracking,

471
00:29:03,128 --> 00:29:04,109
we would definitely test that.

472
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:04,990
Thank you.

473
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:09,273
Any other questions?

474
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:15,217
Anybody?

475
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:16,258
Okay.

476
00:29:23,657 --> 00:29:28,122
So, you indicated that you tried to get the dragons to play around with toys.

477
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:33,748
Did you give any audio cues that the dragons were playing around, interacting, that the

478
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:36,711
player could listen to and try to direct their attention to the audio?

479
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,388
That's a really good question.

480
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:40,608
I'm just going to repeat it.

481
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:45,590
So you're asking if we looked into using audio cues

482
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,151
to indicate what the dragons are doing

483
00:29:48,171 --> 00:29:49,471
and what direction they're coming from.

484
00:29:49,491 --> 00:29:50,011
OK.

485
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:52,552
Yeah, so that's something we tried a little bit,

486
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:55,273
and I thought about including the presentation.

487
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,094
I didn't, so thank you for bringing that up.

488
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:03,118
We have. It didn't work as well as we thought it would.

489
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:11,464
One, your 3D spatial audio in VR right now is not entirely reliable.

490
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:16,747
It's still very subtle, so visual cues...

491
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,470
are at this point are more powerful.

492
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:24,733
I have heard of like really good audio designers

493
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:29,757
creating entire experiences using only audio cues as guides.

494
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:33,819
But I think to accomplish that, you need one really good audio designer

495
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,221
because it's much more subtle than visual design.

496
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:43,821
And two, the player perception is still not as consistent.

497
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:46,623
Like, we kind of, we tried out audio cues on me,

498
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:50,206
because I have trouble picking up where sound is coming from,

499
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:53,229
like even in real life, like if an explosion goes off that way,

500
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:55,030
I can't really tell.

501
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:59,852
Like, I'm probably an extreme example, but I'm just not as sensitive to audio cues as I am visual cues.

502
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:04,534
So we do—to answer your question, that was long-winded—we do use audio cues,

503
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:07,855
but we don't find them nearly as reliable as visual cues.

504
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:09,376
Thank you.

505
00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:09,976
Thank you.

506
00:31:16,318 --> 00:31:21,560
Hi, I'm Eric. So I recently have been doing a lot of playtesting for the tutorial of my game,

507
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:24,182
and just as a design principle,

508
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:29,305
I challenge myself to have zero text and no, you know, like panels or anything like that.

509
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:36,167
And you know, throughout the different iterations, no matter how streamlined and how many guides

510
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:38,247
there were, and only like one event at a time.

511
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:42,368
I too like to play test with people who are completely new to VR.

512
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:46,970
And even if it's just the most obvious single visual slash audio cue right in front of them,

513
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,150
they might miss it because they're so.

514
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:53,372
over one with the environment. I was just wondering if you could share any sort of best

515
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:59,664
practices of onboarding or tutorial techniques without, you know, overt text to guide them

516
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:00,967
or voiceover.

517
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:04,366
Yeah, that's a really good question.

518
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:08,248
So to repeat it, you want to know if there are some best practices

519
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:11,811
for onboarding new players without relying on text.

520
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:12,591
Or voiceover.

521
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:13,452
Or voiceover.

522
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:13,852
OK.

523
00:32:14,512 --> 00:32:16,154
Yeah, so we have some insight into this.

524
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:20,256
In our initial product, we actually built it for VR arcades.

525
00:32:20,637 --> 00:32:23,839
So we were expecting a lot of new players.

526
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,940
And we tried to minimize the amount of text.

527
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:33,524
Full disclosure here, unfortunately we had to add a menu and things later on, so what you described is something we're still struggling with,

528
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:38,546
trying to minimize the amount of text and voiceovers entirely, but we still haven't.

529
00:32:39,187 --> 00:32:43,709
But some of the things that we discovered that really worked well is to...

530
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:50,716
Control the environment your players are in.

531
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:57,762
When we first started, we would drop players in this very lush, green environment

532
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:00,845
with birds chirping, lots of things going on, dragons flying around.

533
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:03,027
And we're trying to get them to pay attention to the tutorial.

534
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,769
And they're not. They're like, there's a dragon. I want to go over here.

535
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,230
They're doing all sorts of things.

536
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,294
So what we do is we drop them now off in a starting zone.

537
00:33:11,814 --> 00:33:12,855
No teleportation.

538
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:19,413
virtually nothing to interact with other than the thing we want to pay attention to.

539
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:24,637
So one way you can think of it is kind of like stage lighting, right? If you black out the rest

540
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:27,959
of the stage and just put the spotlight on the thing you want the audience to watch,

541
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:35,083
you can recreate something similar in VR using that. It doesn't mean you need to have a blank

542
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:42,248
background, but the proximity we're talking about, right, in this sense, think of scenery, right?

543
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,997
out of reach, fading into the darkness, or something like that,

544
00:33:46,117 --> 00:33:49,326
and just focus the players on the thing you want them to interact with.

545
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:53,086
Oh, another thing, and I didn't mention this in the talk,

546
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:55,848
is when we're talking about coming into the field of view,

547
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,869
even in that situation, your player will probably

548
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:00,710
still look around.

549
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,530
It's funny, like, they don't look

550
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,511
when you want them to look.

551
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:04,851
When you don't want them to look,

552
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:05,992
they're looking all over the place.

553
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:09,493
So have whatever you want them to interact with

554
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:12,575
just inch its way into their field of view.

555
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:14,976
So we not only do that with the dragons,

556
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,856
we also do that with the menus sometimes,

557
00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:18,557
just to have it come within their field of view.

558
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,014
Okay, thank you. You're welcome.

559
00:34:23,237 --> 00:34:24,980
Okay, cool. Thank you very much.
