1
00:00:07,677 --> 00:00:10,979
My name is Michał Staniszewski. I came from Poland.

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,602
I was active on the demo scene since 1997.

3
00:00:18,863 --> 00:00:24,166
I was presented there by a hand with a bonsai from Plastic.

4
00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:34,091
Today I will talk a little bit about the creative process of making our recent project Bound.

5
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:42,012
So I will show the trailer of the game so you will have like,

6
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:45,695
you will know what I will talk about later on.

7
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:21,983
Okay, so who is Plastic?

8
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:30,993
Plastic is a small studio in Poland specializing in making really experimental stuff, different experiences.

9
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:41,724
We have roots in the demo scene since 1997 and we've made a couple of demos that were nicely received in Europe.

10
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:48,257
And then Santa Monica Studio External contacted us in 2006

11
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:53,960
and asked us to make an interactive something for PlayStation 3

12
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:59,464
because they wanted to create a digital community on PlayStation 3

13
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,809
and asked several groups, Temosin groups, for help.

14
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,190
And we made Lingering Shadows.

15
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,852
Some of you may remember it.

16
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:18,579
And then we've made Datura, which was another experimental production

17
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,781
designed for PlayStation Move.

18
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:32,367
And at that point, we were having tiny experiences with very early virtual reality.

19
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:38,491
And it was too early for that game, for that time.

20
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:43,113
Okay, so after Datura, we were thinking what to do next.

21
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:47,299
And we've made Godzilla to refresh the engine.

22
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:53,362
So the thing is that we are really a weird studio that

23
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:57,465
makes an engine for each of our projects, which is pretty

24
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,005
crazy, but it actually works.

25
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:05,189
And we're thinking that what we are good at, and we went

26
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:07,610
back to the productions from the demo scene.

27
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:12,112
And we were still looking for a new direction.

28
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,092
We knew that we were good technically.

29
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:18,994
We could make a lot of stuff on screen dynamic

30
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:22,755
without too many problems and fighting with the technology.

31
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,937
But at the same time, Journey was released,

32
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:28,818
which was a great emotional game,

33
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:32,099
maybe more an experience than a game.

34
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,920
And I always wanted to make a game

35
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,882
with a strong female character, like in Miyazaki movies.

36
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:43,551
But most importantly, my son was born.

37
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,714
It was six years ago.

38
00:04:47,475 --> 00:04:50,418
And this got me thinking into a family theme.

39
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,123
So at first I called it Equality.

40
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:58,466
And the code name for it was The Princess.

41
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:07,318
It was a narrative, it's supposed to be narrative, not game with a fragility of the family as a main team

42
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:09,760
presented in a form of metaphor.

43
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,426
But it was like a very ambitious on paper, so actually it also contained persistent multiplayer world

44
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:23,212
with structures based on a lot of iterations from different players.

45
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:27,230
But we also were thinking about speedrunning element,

46
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:33,055
because we were working with different digital communities.

47
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:34,737
We were working with Demoscene.

48
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:37,099
We were working with Katsila, which

49
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,201
is the overclockers community.

50
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:43,625
And right now, we wanted to work a little bit with speedrunners.

51
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:47,568
But the most important thing was the concept

52
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:51,392
of showing the story in a way that the players will

53
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,172
have a different view on it and they would judge on its own.

54
00:05:56,292 --> 00:06:00,954
So, in the family problem presented in the game,

55
00:06:01,254 --> 00:06:06,115
we didn't want to show anyone from the family as particularly bad

56
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,936
and leave the interpretation to the player.

57
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:14,967
So at some point we had the first working prototype.

58
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:18,808
Like I said, we are rewriting engine for every project.

59
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:24,489
So we had those design blocks and tools

60
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:26,049
written from the scratch.

61
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,330
So these are like simple shapes with physics and working camera

62
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,831
around the character, like the TPP camera,

63
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:36,331
the events that change the camera.

64
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:38,231
But the thing was that I...

65
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:44,903
For the 3D platformer, I needed more depth and visibility,

66
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:49,927
so I asked one of the programmers to add me a lighting.

67
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:54,572
And we got the first look of Unreal World.

68
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:58,916
I always wanted to have in this project the red sky

69
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:05,642
and the ocean of cubes that would cover the distances between the architecture.

70
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,543
The Red Sky is inspired by a demo scene production from 2002 called Chimera by Halcyon.

71
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:21,028
And it's a very, very important production because it's a milestone in terms of dividing a moment

72
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:28,332
where the demo scene was not mostly about competing programmers and competing artists, but...

73
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,085
the demo started to,

74
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,026
they wanted to present some kind of content

75
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:38,387
and some kind of meaning, and to became an art form.

76
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:42,507
And Halcyon was done by, in 2002,

77
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:45,588
it was supposed to be shown

78
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:47,588
on one of the biggest demos in parties,

79
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,269
but it was disqualified because it was too abstract

80
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:57,570
and organizers didn't feel that it fits into the category.

81
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:04,686
The interesting thing about Chimera is that the music for it, like the ambience, was done

82
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:11,730
by Jako Izalo, a croaker, and he's one of the original authors of Angry Birds.

83
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,771
So he designed the characters in Angry Birds.

84
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:19,753
So you can start with such design to go completely different places.

85
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:28,533
And the Ocean of Cubes is inspired by a 64K intro, Texas, from 2008, made by Keyboarders.

86
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:34,156
It was the first production on the Demos team that used geometry shaders.

87
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:45,814
We had lighting in Unreal world, but we were still thinking that what will be the actual look.

88
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:51,039
We were at this point thinking about those as not the actual graphics,

89
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:57,144
but we knew that the long shadows are very important for a production.

90
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:01,028
On the other front, I was trying to design a mechanic.

91
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:06,751
that will cooperate with the story where the character wipes away her memories

92
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,532
and thus making the world disappear.

93
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:14,695
So this concept was pretty unique, actually I felt it was unique,

94
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:20,678
but later on I discovered that 3D Mario World has exactly the same mechanic

95
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:24,020
in the more difficult levels.

96
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,621
But this kind of look didn't...

97
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:41,811
I asked for showing it in a different way and we've changed it to dividing the cubes

98
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:42,852
that we already have.

99
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:51,078
into smaller chunks, and actually we were surprised that it worked so well, and it was

100
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:51,819
pretty simple.

101
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:59,184
So the thing is that we didn't have any kind of physics in there, just mathematics that

102
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:05,908
just displays the blocks if they are more distant from the character.

103
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,876
No physics was used because the maths are just faster and we could show a lot and a

104
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:14,258
lot of those chunks.

105
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:23,108
And we were iterating on those elements and we got inspired by modern art.

106
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,771
I will talk about it later on in the talk.

107
00:10:26,654 --> 00:10:31,599
But we had to design some extra mechanisms, like control zones,

108
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:38,945
who tell the designer what parts of the world are more visible.

109
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,988
And there was tons of parameters.

110
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:45,351
But in the end, we've managed to shrink it just

111
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:47,233
to the minimum and maximum distance

112
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,957
when the displacement happens, and minimum and maximum distance

113
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:52,078
when the scale happens.

114
00:10:54,518 --> 00:11:02,585
But we also had zones to maintain the architecture of the Unreal world if we wanted to show some

115
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:04,848
kind of buildings in the distance.

116
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:13,796
And also we had a scripting, a simple scripting of the destruction so we could use it in cutscenes

117
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:20,342
and completely hide them or to reveal them or simple things.

118
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:30,792
But our game also is about memories, so we started to write another piece of code with

119
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:36,458
the fragments that come together when you get closer, so you could see what's inside

120
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:37,940
the memories of my character.

121
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:42,019
The funny thing about it is that it was running entirely on GPU,

122
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,700
but together with the gameplay mechanics.

123
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,182
So actually, GPU, we've checked on GPU which chunks got into their places,

124
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:55,084
and based on that, we've opened the door to the next parts of the game.

125
00:11:56,704 --> 00:12:00,866
The chunks were pre-processed, but it was very, very fast, so...

126
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:01,886
Whoa.

127
00:12:03,186 --> 00:12:04,927
Thank you.

128
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:13,655
And we had to iterate more on the memories because black and white was like grayscale,

129
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:20,862
was really hard to read by the players and we've added diffuse lighting so the characters

130
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:22,904
could be seen as different.

131
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:29,911
The overall design of the memories is mostly influenced by Gone Home.

132
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:42,170
So environmental storytelling works best when the items are placed in the places where they actually should be.

133
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:48,935
But it was still hard for the players to read what's happening in there.

134
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:57,803
And we ended up going back with the textures that have pre-baked lighting.

135
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:03,561
and to make the characters more distinguishable from each other.

136
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:10,281
We had to use the standard uniforms for kids, so blue and pink,

137
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:16,844
change the haircuts so players will exactly know that this is a boy and there's a girl.

138
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:20,926
And we had a lot of work with balancing those memories,

139
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:27,310
so none of the characters would be felt that it's always bad,

140
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:33,733
or at some particular moment that it's like domestic violence is happening.

141
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:38,881
Okay, so we had the first solid prototype,

142
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:43,163
and it had like an animated character,

143
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:47,026
and the Unreal world was mostly working.

144
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,269
We've changed the name of the equality project

145
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:52,450
to Yorkingdom.com.

146
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,952
So it took us around 20 months to get there

147
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:58,294
with three programmers and me.

148
00:13:58,314 --> 00:14:02,877
Okay, so right now I will talk a little bit

149
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:04,358
about the modern art.

150
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:15,236
So, for that prototype that you have seen, we had a biggest problem of that the world

151
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:23,442
was looking mostly constantly the same, and we decided to explore the modern art since

152
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,644
at some point it was based on the primitive shapes.

153
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:30,567
And we found that Piet Mondrian's work

154
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:38,365
would work great because it's based on the squares and there are just five colors, red,

155
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:42,827
white, yellow, blue, and black, and it worked.

156
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:47,950
So if we used those colors in the Unreal world, it was really working nicely.

157
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:55,573
But the thing is that, more importantly, we had those elements that reminded me of the

158
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,054
paintings from Suprematism.

159
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:08,093
These paintings are really interesting because they have a special way to do them.

160
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:15,899
So the thing is that the picture needs to be looked at as a whole and not as some fragment

161
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:16,440
elements.

162
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,063
So if we had in this middle painting a red line...

163
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,301
Normally, your eyes would go in that direction,

164
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:29,524
so it's balanced in a way that there are added black squares in the bottom.

165
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:37,769
But the most important thing about the suprematism is not actually the painting itself,

166
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,350
but the idea.

167
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:43,573
So it's a form of conceptual art that arised,

168
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,775
and like Kazimierz Malewicz was saying,

169
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:49,497
it's the supremacy of pure artistic feeling.

170
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:53,476
So I will concentrate a little bit on that,

171
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:58,861
because I know there's a lot of people that have problems with modern art

172
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:00,783
because they think that it's just simple

173
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:07,268
and why they should be excited about the black square on a white background.

174
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,572
But actually, to understand the modern art and conceptual art...

175
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:14,706
You need to look at the context.

176
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:22,872
So in case of supremacy, you need to go back to the whole art that was created by man since

177
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:29,356
the cave ages and understand that the human was trying to reach the realism.

178
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:37,425
And when he finally did it, he knew that we as a human race can do it, and we can deconstruct it.

179
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:41,529
And then the Impressionism arrived, and then Cubism.

180
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:49,038
In the end, the Suprematist was created, and this is the context for that.

181
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:55,672
But in Bound, we were mostly concentrating on how it looks.

182
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:59,934
So, except for the paintings, we were looking at the modern art,

183
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:02,575
like Bauhaus for architecture.

184
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:08,057
And we discovered that the modern art museums

185
00:17:08,297 --> 00:17:13,118
are made from the shapes that can be recreated in the game.

186
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,998
And actually some parts of those museums are in the game.

187
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:21,888
You can try to search for them.

188
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:28,548
But we still had this problem that those blocks looked similar and similar.

189
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:38,853
So we've implemented a simple decal projection system that was putting little paintings on

190
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:46,957
those shards in Unreal World, and it was implemented in such a way that when the shards got dissolved

191
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:49,838
and displaced, the painting stayed on them.

192
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:57,171
So for each of the levels, we decided to make a tribute for modern artists of 20th century.

193
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:04,316
So for example, Laszlo Mahalinaš, in one of the levels, he was using simple geometric

194
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,158
shapes involving transparency.

195
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:13,023
But Laszlo has a lot of great works in conceptual art.

196
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:14,464
For example, think about this.

197
00:18:15,064 --> 00:18:16,445
One of his performances.

198
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:21,167
involved calling his friend on the telephone

199
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:24,909
and telling him to draw a painting.

200
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,931
And when the painting was done, based on his descriptions over the phone,

201
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,453
he asked if the painting was actually his art or his friend's.

202
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:34,433
Think about it.

203
00:18:35,804 --> 00:18:39,166
And next is August Herbin, for example.

204
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:46,011
He was like concentrating on triangles and spheres and mixing them, inverting,

205
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:49,233
and they got into one of the levels of the game.

206
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:55,216
But also Yayoi Kusama, who is also a great conceptual artist,

207
00:18:55,657 --> 00:19:00,120
and she is in love with circle shapes and polka dot patterns.

208
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,291
So, the implementation was very simple.

209
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:12,156
We had those kind of simple paintings stored in an array of texture with colors and transparency

210
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:17,840
and we projected the coordinates and stored in a vertex attributes of those flying shards.

211
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:24,604
But now I will go to dance, which is another part of my presentation.

212
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,452
The princess in the very beginning was not a dancer.

213
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:33,594
The design was made by Jakub Jabłoński from Platycimic

214
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:35,816
and she was presented as a runner.

215
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:38,137
It was a part of the story of the game.

216
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:42,959
I will spoil it if I will tell why,

217
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:45,661
but if you will play the game, you will understand.

218
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:50,901
So we were iterating on the designs of the character

219
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,904
and we decided to choose the delicate direction.

220
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:58,029
And at first we wanted the princess to go through her life

221
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,911
and portray as a woman,

222
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,875
becoming stronger and faster.

223
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,378
But in the end, because of...

224
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:07,473
production.

225
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:11,434
We didn't want to make all those animation sets

226
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:12,455
and all those characters,

227
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,096
so we decided to have just one,

228
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,997
but she was still a runner.

229
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:21,859
And we hand animated her.

230
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,480
And all animation system is written by hand.

231
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:28,822
It doesn't involve any blend shapes, blend trees,

232
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:31,403
because I thought that they were not needed

233
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,764
and I felt comfortable with such approach.

234
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:39,403
And at this point, Santa Monica sent us their feedback

235
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:41,124
and it was pretty devastating.

236
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:46,627
So designers did not feel like the character

237
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:48,968
was expressive or felt like a female.

238
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,110
We need to amp up her animation

239
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,612
so that she feels like a unique character.

240
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,754
So the character felt like a game character

241
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:00,975
and we were making a game after all.

242
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:01,356
Thank you.

243
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:13,780
And I was lucky because one of my friends sent me a movie with a dancer, with a contemporary

244
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,743
dancer, and she was having those kind of emotions in her dance.

245
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:20,685
So I had to do a super fast curse.

246
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:28,912
Luckily, I was training dance with my wife for a couple of years and it helped me a lot.

247
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:36,552
So I started to study on ballet, contemporary dance, gymnastics, and even ice figure skating.

248
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:42,736
I started from ballet and Tchaikovsky was a best start.

249
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:48,420
Swan Lake and Nutcracker are the obvious ballets to watch.

250
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,623
But ballerinas have a rigid classical set of moves.

251
00:21:52,943 --> 00:21:58,446
They are very rarely doing floor parts, actually, if you watch it closely.

252
00:21:59,327 --> 00:22:04,711
So it's easy to show the beauty of motion with ballet,

253
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:07,413
but it's really hard to present emotions.

254
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:12,297
Those moves were designed during a lot of years,

255
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:13,919
and they are really strict.

256
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,662
But they have a good glossary because of that,

257
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:21,825
and it was easier to communicate with the choreographer.

258
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:30,638
On the other hand, contemporary ballet has a lot more emotions into it,

259
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:35,260
and dance is presented in a more literal way.

260
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:43,705
And finally, contemporary dance, there's a lot of references on YouTube,

261
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:45,786
and it's easier to go through them.

262
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:52,533
And I found a lot of great, let's say amateur dancers,

263
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:59,395
or dancers who were in a contest like So You Think You Can Dance,

264
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:06,497
like Lydia Phillips, Megan Branch, Olga Kurajeva, many, many more.

265
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:17,872
And at some point I was understanding the dance to this point that I could predict who will win another season of Surfing Who Can Dance.

266
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:26,041
But there were problems with glossary, because it's really hard to find it on the internet

267
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:31,528
to show exactly what move is which one, and it was harder to communicate with the choreographer,

268
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:39,718
so I had to cut those moves into tiny pieces and then use a tablet to show what I'm talking

269
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:40,059
about.

270
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:49,571
But I was also going through gymnastics and this was like a very interesting time.

271
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:56,495
From gymnastics I wanted to take the cartwheel move and I discovered that the balance beam

272
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:58,617
motion is really, really interesting.

273
00:23:59,317 --> 00:24:05,981
But there is one thing, the gymnastics from the 80s were great, like Olga Korbut and her

274
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:09,904
performances during the Olympics and also Nadia Comaneci.

275
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:16,853
So those gymnasts from the 80s were adding a lot of graceful motion and balletic moves

276
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:19,814
in between the figures.

277
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:27,377
And right now, it's just the points and figures, so I actually didn't take anything from current

278
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:30,478
gymnastics performances, and it's really sad.

279
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:38,260
On the other hand, ice skating is really great, and especially for me, Julia Lipnitskaya.

280
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:42,677
And from that I took the motion in the middle.

281
00:24:44,677 --> 00:24:52,919
So going back to the game, the first attempt was like adding dense figures to the character

282
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:53,439
motions.

283
00:24:53,619 --> 00:25:01,701
I still was using a hand-written system so I could add procedural elements in there based

284
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:07,702
on an overbroad presentation by David Rosen so the character could look where she walks.

285
00:25:09,182 --> 00:25:12,603
This is how the ballerina walks, if you can see.

286
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:18,605
So the thing is that when it's really hard to find a running or walking ballerina,

287
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:25,427
and they usually go more like this to enter the stage.

288
00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:32,130
And this is the one moment when you can see them without making actual dance movements.

289
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:38,412
So like I said, the character was still hand animated, hand programmed.

290
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:42,348
And this was the first prototype of dance that we did.

291
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:46,756
It was very, very rigid, but it was promising.

292
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:06,697
So from that point I knew that there would be a responsiveness and the beauty of motion

293
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:08,197
and they don't work together.

294
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:15,058
So if we want to have a responsive character, then I would have to cut down the blending

295
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:21,660
between the poses and if I would like to have a nice movement, then I would need to take

296
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,860
off the responsiveness.

297
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,421
And I decided to go with the beauty of motion.

298
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:35,996
So we were iterating on this and we were finding new poses and trying to animate them by hand,

299
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,717
but at some point it was really, really hard.

300
00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:45,079
It was hard to find the reference of a dancer, for example, walking on a ledge, or a dancer

301
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:45,980
walking on a ladder.

302
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:52,222
So there are things on the Internet that are still not there.

303
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,703
There are still some things that you can't find on the Internet.

304
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,741
And we got more and more feedback from the players that they wanted to dance.

305
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:07,183
So if we will give them possibilities of dancing, then they will just dance in a game.

306
00:27:07,403 --> 00:27:08,123
And it was great.

307
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:18,886
So it was like the best decision that I did during the project to finally contact the

308
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:21,027
real dancer and choreographer.

309
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:28,574
So we wanted a dancer that knows classical ballet, modern contemporary dance,

310
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:34,979
and would be flexible enough to perform all those cartwheels and gymnastic movements.

311
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:39,522
And we have chosen Maria Udot and choreographer Michał Gural.

312
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:42,123
It was like the best pick.

313
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,193
And the first motion capture session was really good.

314
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:52,897
The dancers were preparing in the hall with mirrors

315
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:56,660
for one week based on the materials I provided.

316
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:59,583
And after that, we were performing the session.

317
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:04,027
It was the first session that we did as a studio, so I was a little bit scared.

318
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:12,234
And also, it was the first day at work for our new animator, and he didn't work with

319
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:16,598
motion-captured animation before, so I was double scared.

320
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,021
But in the end, it was really, really superb.

321
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:33,718
And it was so good that we decided that we need a second mock-up session.

322
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:37,000
And we decided to change everything.

323
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:44,845
So all the hand animation that we got in the project was replaced with the motion captured ones.

324
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:45,966
So including jumps.

325
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:53,827
But also we recorded cutscenes and they were hard to perform actually.

326
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:59,711
So what we wanted to have is that in cutscenes the character would behave in a balletic way,

327
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,654
like in an actual ballet stage.

328
00:29:04,615 --> 00:29:08,878
And it was really hard to mock up because we had only animatics,

329
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:12,100
but thankfully we also had the choreographer,

330
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:21,865
so he was looking at the animatics and in fly he was like showing up the moves to Maria, how to do them.

331
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:26,308
And also we recorded full 25, 30 second sequences.

332
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:33,306
So for players to play with them in a fun way.

333
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:37,349
And those sequences were different for each of the levels.

334
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:53,700
And now I will go to the next stage of my presentation about emotional design.

335
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:02,243
So this is the part of the game that I'm mostly proud of.

336
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:05,084
So emotional design.

337
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:11,947
At first we had the first design doc, which was called Equality and was 56 pages long.

338
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:22,857
And there was everything. Like I said, it's supposed to be a multiplayer game with a persistent world and so on.

339
00:30:23,598 --> 00:30:28,626
But from that design doc only 10% landed and was implemented in the final game.

340
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,272
And the next design doc was just 11 pages long.

341
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,913
We changed the title to Your Kingdom Come.

342
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:39,135
And we had also an art guide, which

343
00:30:39,195 --> 00:30:42,658
was based on Vimeo stuff pics that I was collecting.

344
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:46,100
But at this point, we didn't have ballet and modern art.

345
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:52,524
And the third design doc was the actual presentation

346
00:30:52,604 --> 00:30:54,105
for the pitch at Santa Monica.

347
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,207
And we discovered that.

348
00:30:58,546 --> 00:31:03,890
Probably the VR was the thing that got the biggest attention.

349
00:31:06,872 --> 00:31:08,593
But back to the emotional design.

350
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:11,435
So the most important thing,

351
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:13,116
you probably know about it already

352
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:14,397
if you go to the other session,

353
00:31:14,637 --> 00:31:17,159
and it's good to tell it more and more and more,

354
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:18,340
is play testing.

355
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,902
When we were doing Linger in Shadows,

356
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:23,343
we didn't do any play test at all.

357
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:25,505
You can believe me that we shipped the game

358
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:27,566
without testing it with any player.

359
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:32,611
And it's because we were coming from the demo scene,

360
00:31:33,232 --> 00:31:38,315
and on demo scene, you didn't show your demo to anyone

361
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:41,296
because it would ruin the competition.

362
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:44,578
So actually, it was element of surprise

363
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,580
that could make you win the competition.

364
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,842
And that's why you're not supposed to show it to anyone.

365
00:31:54,007 --> 00:32:00,970
And we delivered that in Shadows, but by our surprise, people still enjoyed it.

366
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,753
But Datura had only two playtests, and we made the first playtest when we had like 80

367
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:11,255
or 90% of the game, and when we did it, we knew that it was a disaster.

368
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:15,977
So the second playtest didn't change anything at all.

369
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:22,519
So in Bound we decided that we need to playtest from almost the beginning when we had the

370
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,824
working prototype and we had around 50 of them.

371
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:29,369
But it's important to make it properly.

372
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:34,715
So it's not in a way that the whole team stands in the back of the playtesters.

373
00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:41,760
Of course, you do it in a normal playtest, like during the jams or during the showcasing

374
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,280
your game.

375
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:49,146
But when you make an emotional game, it's really important that the tester is alone

376
00:32:49,186 --> 00:32:49,766
with the game.

377
00:32:51,827 --> 00:33:00,152
Because every single joke, every single word, and every single explanation will break the feeling of the game.

378
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:04,214
So it's good to prepare a playtest room.

379
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:12,278
So this is a room from Santa Monica, but probably if you're a small developer, you will not be able to use it.

380
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:21,983
But you can just have a single place, like separated place, and use private streaming to another place where you can review it.

381
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:31,007
It's super easy on PS4, it's also very easy on PC, and I encourage you to do it from the start.

382
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:41,332
And also a good thing is to prepare a questionnaire in a networked form, so you could have those answers and send them to your team.

383
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:53,003
And during this playtesting, during the last ones, we managed to notice that actually the

384
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:54,243
game started to work.

385
00:33:54,383 --> 00:34:01,785
It was very late in the production, but this is something that we wanted to achieve and

386
00:34:01,845 --> 00:34:02,825
it started to work.

387
00:34:03,306 --> 00:34:06,166
So basically we divided the players into two groups.

388
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:11,548
Those that were emotionally connected and those who were emotionally disconnected.

389
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:18,887
So emotionally connected people were those who had similar life experiences like our

390
00:34:19,127 --> 00:34:20,227
character in the game.

391
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:27,792
And from this group we've extracted a group of players that had cathartic emotions at

392
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:32,174
the end of the game, for some working in a therapeutical way.

393
00:34:33,995 --> 00:34:35,256
And players from that group

394
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:38,615
were not playing the game, they were not playing the princess.

395
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:42,116
It was princess that was playing their lives.

396
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:45,518
That was known from the beginning that the main character,

397
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:49,279
she's a kind of ballerina and modern dancer at the same time.

398
00:34:49,299 --> 00:34:53,781
But the story I got to know when I arrived here,

399
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:55,222
just before we started working,

400
00:34:55,402 --> 00:34:57,703
and also the story is a bit touching to myself,

401
00:34:58,523 --> 00:35:00,284
is about the woman.

402
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,202
who wants to go on with her life and solve her family issues with her parents.

403
00:35:05,742 --> 00:35:10,183
Her father left the family and now she has to decide if she wants to see him

404
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:13,804
or she wants to continue be with her mother or other way around.

405
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:18,605
So I have it myself, my parents unfortunately have separated as well.

406
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:23,727
An inner fight is quite close to me, also in that age when I'm trying to make decisions.

407
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:26,768
Whose fault was that and what should I do with it?

408
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:36,216
I think it's nice also that the people who are going to play the game, they will have them to make their own decision because it's a big decision.

409
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:41,481
In the beginning I had a chance to see myself put into the skin of the character.

410
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:52,097
It's very funny to see something else moving like you.

411
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:55,279
It's a bit abstract, I would say.

412
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,581
But at the same time, we have a very similar body.

413
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:02,063
She moves as I move, so I make it.

414
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:04,424
It's going to be looking really cool.

415
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:20,464
Okay, so in the next part of my presentation I would like to talk a little bit about Bound in VR.

416
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:27,866
So, with VR we had a very first Morpheus prototype.

417
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:33,548
It was Santa Monica Studio who sent us their prototype and it was really nice,

418
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,409
but I broke it like in five days.

419
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,671
It shattered in my hands.

420
00:36:39,692 --> 00:36:43,615
But it was enough for us to play the game and run it.

421
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:49,319
And I've seen that the camera system works for a third-person perspective.

422
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,064
You just need to make it static for those that are experiencing motion sickness.

423
00:36:55,985 --> 00:37:02,210
And because the game was showing the actual performance of a dancer,

424
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,613
we made the camera in such a way that you can get close to the character.

425
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:15,261
But the game was PSVR compatible, it was not PSVR exclusive, so it was really hard to deliver

426
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:16,722
that message with the players.

427
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:22,724
They were mostly prepared that the game is VR or the game is not VR.

428
00:37:23,385 --> 00:37:30,868
And we've made the trailer for the PSVR launch, but we didn't decide to show that trailer

429
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:37,851
because it actually looked like a normal 2D game, but with a shaking camera.

430
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:38,842
Take a look.

431
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:55,102
But, like you have seen in the very last cut of this video, we've made the princess to

432
00:38:55,162 --> 00:38:57,783
look at you when you look at her.

433
00:38:57,863 --> 00:39:01,645
So basically in VR you don't feel like you are the character.

434
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:04,666
You feel that you are a third person around her.

435
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:09,989
and you have a visual connection and you can feel the presence.

436
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:13,911
And when you have a performing artist,

437
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:19,415
you can feel the presence of the artist in a very close distance.

438
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:24,958
So this is an important find because normally when you go to a ballet or opera,

439
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:27,820
you can see the performer in a long distance.

440
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,181
Or maybe if you have a very good ticket.

441
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:38,747
Normally you sit in a distance and it doesn't feel different like a TV screen, but with

442
00:39:38,787 --> 00:39:39,528
better audio.

443
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:45,894
And during the motion capture session, we felt that it's really great to be so close

444
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:52,861
to Ballerina and we've managed to represent the same emotion inside the VR game.

445
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:55,463
And players really love that.

446
00:39:56,233 --> 00:40:02,479
So, like, this is a comment, the VR mode in this game is incredible and elevates the experience

447
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:04,982
leagues beyond the 2D mode of play.

448
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:14,631
But I've also discovered, like, recurring messages like this, in VR it's almost a religious

449
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:15,993
experience at times.

450
00:40:17,394 --> 00:40:18,255
So what's happening?

451
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:19,136
Like, what happened?

452
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:26,413
I was thinking about the presentation of Genova Chen a couple of years back on GDC,

453
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:31,896
when he was talking about the spiritual feelings inside a game.

454
00:40:33,445 --> 00:40:38,986
And when we live in a city and see a lot of human creations,

455
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:42,647
it's really hard to get this spiritual feeling.

456
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:48,628
So it's easier to get it in the mountains,

457
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:55,350
where you can't see any kind of human-made structures.

458
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,590
Or in a space station,

459
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,951
where you can see the Earth from a distance.

460
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:09,195
And in Bound we have a word that is based on pure mathematics, so maybe it worked such

461
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:12,077
way because the mathematics is the language of nature.

462
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,104
Okay, so if you have some questions, then you can use the microphones.

463
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,251
Hi, great, great talk.

464
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:43,012
Nicole's are from Z design.

465
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:47,796
I was curious on the emotion palette, the other emotion architecture, the profile,

466
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:53,860
what were the emotions that were easiest to get in that great combination between

467
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,182
the, you know, the character and the, you know, the environments.

468
00:41:58,012 --> 00:42:00,433
You mean it's like emotions to evoke in a player?

469
00:42:00,453 --> 00:42:02,533
Yeah, I mean like were there... did you...

470
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04,574
Actually, that might be just the question itself, it's like...

471
00:42:04,854 --> 00:42:09,716
Did you have like a list of specific emotions you were trying to target and then you...

472
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:13,177
Did you make adjustments to, you know, to get towards that?

473
00:42:13,557 --> 00:42:15,758
So, in terms of like...

474
00:42:16,658 --> 00:42:20,479
Emotions in dance, I really started from the basics, like the movement.

475
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:26,920
And we were expanding this, but the choreographer, Michael,

476
00:42:28,661 --> 00:42:32,301
was like, enlightened me about it, how it should be done.

477
00:42:32,962 --> 00:42:36,462
And actually, we didn't design those emotions.

478
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:41,043
They were there after we got the performance captured.

479
00:42:41,723 --> 00:42:44,244
And yeah, so we were not concentrating on that.

480
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,404
So it's like emotion in terms of the expression of the character, not necessarily going after

481
00:42:49,624 --> 00:42:53,107
fear here or joy here or curiosity there.

482
00:42:53,367 --> 00:43:00,592
Yeah, we had just a couple of places where, for example, fear at this point and so on.

483
00:43:02,174 --> 00:43:06,977
And also we got those elements where she was fighting with her fears.

484
00:43:07,998 --> 00:43:11,399
And this is something that we designed actually,

485
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,079
and then it was made by the choreographer.

486
00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:16,720
So for example, when we had the pearls

487
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,681
that represents one of the fears of the character,

488
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:25,882
then the motions contain those kinds of movements.

489
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:29,583
And for example, another one has the paper plane,

490
00:43:29,683 --> 00:43:32,964
so she was hanging her arms.

491
00:43:33,064 --> 00:43:36,464
So yeah, I think that that actually answers your questions.

492
00:43:36,764 --> 00:43:37,025
Thank you.

493
00:43:37,985 --> 00:43:38,345
Thank you.

494
00:43:42,346 --> 00:43:44,967
Absolutely beautiful game. It's amazing. Thank you.

495
00:43:45,827 --> 00:43:52,269
You said when you were playtesting that you found that there were some people who felt attached to the game and some people who felt detached.

496
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:58,730
Is this kind of like the attached ones liked the game, the detached ones were giving negative feedback of the game?

497
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:01,157
Yeah, it's a really good question.

498
00:44:01,777 --> 00:44:06,779
So, those that were emotionally connected and based on their life experiences,

499
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:12,682
there was a part of players that really liked it,

500
00:44:12,822 --> 00:44:14,863
and there was another part that really hated it.

501
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:18,485
Because, I don't want to spoil the ending of the game,

502
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:20,125
but there is a decision in the end,

503
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:25,008
and some of them already did that decision in their life.

504
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:27,994
And we asked them to make it another time.

505
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:29,417
And that's why they hated it.

506
00:44:30,078 --> 00:44:32,323
But those who didn't make this decision,

507
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:35,449
they've seen it in a game, so they could make the first step.

508
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:39,805
And then they could try to do it in real life.

509
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,506
And like I said, we made a questionnaire.

510
00:44:42,706 --> 00:44:45,046
And in this questionnaire was something like,

511
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:48,147
what decision you made in the end?

512
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:51,449
And they were answering this, but another question is,

513
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,349
why did you make this decision?

514
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,590
And this is the moment when they revealed

515
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:00,252
what they felt about the game and their true feelings.

516
00:45:02,672 --> 00:45:03,793
Do you feel like...

517
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:21,075
I would imagine it's a bit of a controversial game in the sense that it's not a gamey game with enemies and points and respawn and all the usual things that people sort of demand out of games.

518
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:24,859
And when you kind of like divide your

519
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:30,364
response groups into like the likes and the dislikes, you just discard the dislike?

520
00:45:30,584 --> 00:45:36,690
Yeah. Or are you saying like, how do I get more of those dislikes into the like pile? Or you just say, good

521
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,833
I've identified who doesn't like the game and I don't care about them anymore.

522
00:45:39,853 --> 00:45:44,017
I have to make the game for those who have, you know, who I'm, they're kind of on my side.

523
00:45:44,637 --> 00:45:59,369
So the thing is that that was one of the biggest bad decisions that I made in the game to make this kind of polarized audience, one contained with players that are real players, hardcore players like those speedrunners.

524
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:07,757
and those who just want to experience the audiovisual feelings and emotions in the game

525
00:46:08,078 --> 00:46:11,341
and they don't want that game mechanic at all.

526
00:46:11,942 --> 00:46:12,883
And the thing is that...

527
00:46:13,263 --> 00:46:19,429
So, what I was thinking, if we will deliver things for the players and things for non-gamers...

528
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,732
then they will find their path.

529
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:25,377
But the problem is when they were crossing paths

530
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,520
and those who don't usually play games

531
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:32,026
went to a moment when it required some skills,

532
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:33,769
then they got frustrated.

533
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:35,371
And those who...

534
00:46:37,233 --> 00:46:42,838
just want to play a game and didn't find those places where it actually needs some skill

535
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:47,283
were also frustrated because they thought it's like it's easy game without the mechanics

536
00:46:47,323 --> 00:46:47,623
at all.

537
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:55,190
And there's like a big mechanic for speedrunners because the game can be passed in 120 ways

538
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:58,193
and one of the ways is the fastest.

539
00:46:58,473 --> 00:47:03,398
And we got like a very tiny small speedrunners working on that.

540
00:47:04,198 --> 00:47:08,642
and they've managed to beat the game in 27 minutes

541
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:13,646
and it's nicely designed because they drop it like a couple of seconds more and more.

542
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:17,630
It requires a lot of work and they spend hours in the game

543
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:21,893
and they are really happy that they discovered that and they think that it's a game.

544
00:47:22,434 --> 00:47:27,238
But in VR mostly, people enjoy the audiovisual,

545
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,321
like the presence of the game and they concentrate on the story.

546
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:36,864
Even though those players... so VR works differently on real players.

547
00:47:37,865 --> 00:47:44,809
So you say, are you actually concerned about the parts of the game that require a skill

548
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:45,929
mechanic?

549
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,030
Is that actually fighting the intent?

550
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,471
I guess where have you decided to land?

551
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:50,632
Who is your perfect player?

552
00:47:52,993 --> 00:47:59,238
Yeah, I was thinking that if we'll manage to get most players from different sides,

553
00:47:59,258 --> 00:48:05,262
it would be the best, but I think I would go in the direction where those players seeking for

554
00:48:05,402 --> 00:48:13,368
emotional narrative storytelling without any skills, because they are already tired of solving

555
00:48:13,448 --> 00:48:20,373
puzzles, fighting and so on, and just contemplate on the audiovisual and story side. I think that

556
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,295
these are our players.

557
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:23,639
Great, thank you very much.

558
00:48:24,224 --> 00:48:24,486
Thank you.

559
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:38,020
Hi. Could you talk a bit about the final locomotion system that you put together after you got

560
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:45,766
the mocap session and how it was informed by your aesthetic understanding? Like, does

561
00:48:45,786 --> 00:48:50,871
the technical implementation, like, was it influenced by your aesthetic understanding

562
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:55,375
of ballet and dance and do you have a specific example of that?

563
00:48:56,822 --> 00:49:00,218
So the locomotion system is actually really easy, but we...

564
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,841
We motion captured everything, including the walking, running,

565
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:05,321
and so on.

566
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:09,683
We just needed to add the loops for it.

567
00:49:10,443 --> 00:49:12,084
And it's really, really simple.

568
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:14,405
I mean, we are just blending one animation

569
00:49:14,445 --> 00:49:17,006
to another without any sophisticated tools.

570
00:49:17,066 --> 00:49:19,347
We don't need blend trees because we

571
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:23,409
have one single character without any items.

572
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,271
We don't divide the movement between hands and legs.

573
00:49:27,751 --> 00:49:31,073
So in this term, it was really simple, but still.

574
00:49:31,893 --> 00:49:38,737
What I wanted to do is to have a maximum flow of blending those animations, including when

575
00:49:38,777 --> 00:49:42,059
you walk on a ledge or jump.

576
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,561
So this was what I was concentrating on.

577
00:49:45,961 --> 00:49:48,903
But as for implementation, it's really a black box.

578
00:49:49,723 --> 00:49:53,526
And you wouldn't take anything from that implementation.

579
00:49:53,566 --> 00:49:55,487
It's just like writing and hard coding.

580
00:49:56,047 --> 00:50:00,070
And if I would do it one more time, I would do it exactly the same.

581
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:02,297
Okay, interesting. Thanks.

582
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:03,358
Thank you.

583
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:10,852
Okay, so if there are not many more questions, then thank you.
