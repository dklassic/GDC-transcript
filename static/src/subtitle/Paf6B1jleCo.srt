1
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:07,084
All right, here we go.

2
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:08,805
Good morning, everyone.

3
00:00:08,946 --> 00:00:11,728
Thank you for being here today this early

4
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:14,170
and for your interest in UX and the brain.

5
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:15,491
My name is Celia.

6
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:18,834
I have a PhD in psychology and the director of user experience

7
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:19,655
at Epic Games.

8
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,898
And I have previously worked at LucasArts and Ubisoft.

9
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:26,121
This session is meant as a follow up to my last year

10
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:31,065
at GTC, plus you talk about how neuroscience and UX can impact

11
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:31,425
design.

12
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:34,327
Since it seemed to generate some interest,

13
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:37,469
I wanted to do a deeper dive on one

14
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:40,190
of the critical aspects of a game's user experience,

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,972
the UX of onboarding and player engagement.

16
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:47,054
Lots of stuff to do, so I'm going to speed up a little bit.

17
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,695
As in an introduction, I will quickly

18
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:53,057
reintroduce some neuroscience notion as well as UX notions

19
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:55,238
that I tackled last year, just to make sure everyone

20
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:56,219
is on the same page.

21
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,840
So I apologize for the repetition here.

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,183
But the user experience entails how a person perceives

23
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:06,566
and interacts with a product, and the satisfaction

24
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:09,588
and emotions elicited by this interaction.

25
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:12,090
It takes its roots in cognitive science,

26
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,632
human factors, and human-computer interaction.

27
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:20,915
UX also designates an umbrella discipline whose objective is to evaluate and improve

28
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,297
the experience of the targeted users of a product in development.

29
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:31,040
It includes UX design, interaction design, user research, UX strategy, etc.

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,503
Although UX should not be the concern, should be the concern of everyone on the team, not

31
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:38,084
just a UX team.

32
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:41,762
Quick reminder about how the brain learns.

33
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:43,944
Discovering and mastering a video game

34
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:45,925
is a learning experience for the user.

35
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:47,986
It requires mental efforts.

36
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,747
This is why it's important to understand how the brain learns

37
00:01:51,188 --> 00:01:53,309
to craft a compelling onboarding experience,

38
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,150
one worth putting effort into,

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,131
one that will matter to the audience.

40
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:04,802
Anything the brain processes and learns originates from a perceived input and changes the memory of the subject.

41
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:11,665
The quality of the processing, therefore the quality of the retention, depends highly on the attentional resources applied,

42
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:15,568
which are also dependent on the emotions and motivation felt by the players.

43
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,690
In sum, to improve the experience of the players,

44
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,692
video game developers must take into account

45
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:24,035
the perception, memory, and attention limitations

46
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:26,297
of the brain, as well as the emotions

47
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:28,959
and motivation felt by the player.

48
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,562
Disclaimer, this is highly simplified.

49
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:35,584
The brain doesn't work in that sort of buckets.

50
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,747
The brain is even more complex than game development.

51
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,108
So imagine.

52
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,493
So, regarding perception, I'm going to quickly remind a little bit of each.

53
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:53,559
Perception involves all the mental processes that allow us to sense our environment and

54
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,381
construct our own mental representations of it.

55
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:59,604
Perception is not a passive window to the world.

56
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:02,866
It is a construct of the mind into meaningful patterns.

57
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:09,172
Perception is highly influenced by previous knowledge, expectations, or, like in this

58
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:10,172
example, context.

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,847
The input at the center can be perceived as a B or as a 13 depending on the context you read it.

60
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,733
Another example illustrating that perception is subjective.

61
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,132
Contrary to older people like me,

62
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:30,314
the save icon doesn't mean anything to the youngsters,

63
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:33,116
as they do not have a mental representation

64
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:37,339
based of previous experience with this object from the past

65
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,681
until they learn what it symbolizes

66
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:40,842
when using a computer.

67
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:43,484
So designers have to keep in mind

68
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:45,686
that what they perceive might not

69
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:48,068
be what their audience will perceive exactly.

70
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,516
About memory, memory allows us to encode, store,

71
00:03:53,696 --> 00:03:54,796
and retrieve information.

72
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:56,977
There are three components of memory.

73
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:59,798
You have the sensory memory, it's part of perception.

74
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:02,678
It retains sensory information for a very short period

75
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:05,079
of time, such as a fraction of a second,

76
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,660
without it being consciously processed.

77
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,020
For example, the persistence of vision

78
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,361
is due to sensory memory, and it allows us

79
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:14,822
to perceive a 24 image per second display

80
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,922
as an uninterrupted animation.

81
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,868
It requires attention for the information

82
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:24,009
to go to working memory, which is a short-term component

83
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:26,970
that allows for temporary storage and manipulation

84
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,450
of a very limited amount of new or already stored information.

85
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:33,571
The system maintains active mental representation

86
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:35,392
necessary to perform a task.

87
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:38,713
The working memory requires heavy attentional resources

88
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:40,533
and therefore is very limited.

89
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,654
It is also easily disturbed, so please put your phones

90
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:44,634
in silent mode.

91
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:50,545
Long-term memory is a multiple system component

92
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:55,007
that allows us to store knowledge of events and facts,

93
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:58,988
as well as skills, the know-how, and conditioned responses.

94
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:02,650
The long-term memory has no known limits in space,

95
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,491
and it can potentially store information for a lifetime.

96
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:08,572
However, memory lapses are fairly common.

97
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:12,606
Talking about memory lapse, here's the forgetting curve,

98
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:15,974
illustrating how memory retention declines exponentially

99
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:16,516
with time.

100
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:23,731
Retention of information, especially if not engaging emotionally or meaningfully, can be very fragile.

101
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:28,813
Some variables have an impact on the strength and quality of the encoding and storage of information,

102
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:32,955
such as the level of processing and the amount of repetition over time.

103
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:39,658
Not only the brain is prone to memory lapses, but it can also distort memories. Because of these limitations,

104
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:44,320
developers cannot really rely on players' memory. They shouldn't.

105
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:54,203
About attention, our senses are continuously bombarded by multiple inputs from our environment.

106
00:05:55,123 --> 00:06:00,485
Attention entails allocating more cognitive resources to process selected inputs while

107
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:01,906
the others will be ignored.

108
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:03,546
That's selective attention.

109
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:06,830
The brain's attentional resources being very limited,

110
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:10,973
we do not methodically process all the available information

111
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:11,813
from the environment.

112
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,334
We don't scan the environment.

113
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:16,416
Instead, attention works like a spotlight,

114
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,118
focusing resources to process and retain particular elements

115
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:24,880
and neglecting the other inputs, such as when you're at a party.

116
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,961
It's called the cocktail effect.

117
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,489
Cocktail party effect, in a loud party you can focus to just listen one conversation

118
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:33,313
and ignoring all the rest.

119
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:37,402
Unless there's a fire alarm that rings and it's going to draw your attention away from

120
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:37,462
it.

121
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:43,575
So when elements are unattended, they're

122
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:46,356
unlikely not perceived at all in a phenomenon called

123
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:48,877
inattentional blindness.

124
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:50,778
This phenomenon was best illustrated

125
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:53,280
in the well-known gorilla experiment, in which you

126
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,841
have to count basketball passes of the white team,

127
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:58,262
leading you to not see the gorilla passing by.

128
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:01,584
I usually show that video, but now everybody knows it,

129
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,465
so it's not fun anymore.

130
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:06,188
But even though a lot of people now

131
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:08,149
understand that multitasking is a myth,

132
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,151
there are still a lot of games that

133
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,093
fire multiple inputs at the same time during the onboarding.

134
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:16,135
Like games where an NPC is talking to you

135
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,137
while you learn how to drive a car, for example.

136
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:21,439
When multitasking or cognitive overload occurs,

137
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,942
it affects engagement, focus, and therefore hinders

138
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:27,924
the quality of learning, which can affect your player's

139
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:28,365
engagement.

140
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:32,955
So I did my session last year showing some UX heuristics

141
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:34,516
or guidelines for usability

142
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:36,517
and for what I like to call the game flow.

143
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:39,138
I can help you remember what elements are important

144
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,399
to avoid confusing your players

145
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,680
and to increase the fun potential of your game.

146
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:45,482
Today we're going to look more deeply into the onboarding,

147
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:46,983
the first time user experience.

148
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,945
So, there you go.

149
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:52,146
Why is onboarding important?

150
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,906
Here's a chart showing the cumulative playtime in Warframe.

151
00:07:57,387 --> 00:07:59,768
Note that the data is compressed on the x-axis,

152
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:01,370
so the hours are not linear.

153
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,172
It shows that 80% of all players ever

154
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,294
kept playing after one hour,

155
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:10,116
which means that in a free-to-play game,

156
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:13,278
you will lose about 20% of your audience

157
00:08:13,438 --> 00:08:15,540
during the first-time user experience, the onboarding.

158
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:18,638
And this is a pretty good example.

159
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:21,859
Warframe is successful at 2P game.

160
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,300
So imagine how this curve looks like

161
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,781
for a less successful game.

162
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:27,742
I didn't want to poo-poo on anyone,

163
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:30,263
so just to show a dramatic chart,

164
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,583
but I do encourage you to go to Steam Spy

165
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:34,304
to figure it out by yourself

166
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:35,825
if you haven't done so already.

167
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,332
Engaging your audience within the first minutes of play

168
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,473
is a delicate endeavor and has become

169
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:44,676
a critical aspect of development in the area of free-to-play

170
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:44,976
games.

171
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:48,098
If your game fails to captivate your audience's attention

172
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,940
quickly, there won't be any retention challenges

173
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,801
to even care about.

174
00:08:53,122 --> 00:08:53,882
Don't get me wrong.

175
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:56,164
Great onboarding is not a guarantee for success.

176
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:59,667
After the short-term engagement, mid- and long-term engagement

177
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:01,528
will be tremendously important, too.

178
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,710
But we'll focus more on the first hour of play here.

179
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:08,715
So during the onboarding part of your game,

180
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,177
you need to get your message right when the players are

181
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:15,079
discovering the game and remove barriers.

182
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,501
Then you have to make sure players can quickly

183
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:20,923
learn the main mechanics of your game

184
00:09:22,024 --> 00:09:25,286
and engage them through clear goals and progression

185
00:09:25,326 --> 00:09:26,547
path they need to take.

186
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:29,008
Too often, the transition from the

187
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:34,120
tutorial part to the real game is not engaging because it lacks meaning.

188
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:39,225
So these elements are not really separated and they're not even linear.

189
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:44,330
The player can discover, learn, and get immersed at any time, even long after the onboarding

190
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:44,951
part of course.

191
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:48,322
So it doesn't mean that you should not be preoccupied

192
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:51,503
with motivation mechanisms during discovery part,

193
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,363
the very first steps, or that players cannot be immersed

194
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:56,044
within the first minutes of play.

195
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:59,145
Also, learning is a central part of the onboarding here,

196
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:01,805
but it happens in all the steps, all the time.

197
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,146
Because playing a game is a learning experience.

198
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:07,606
That's why learning principles are going to be

199
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:09,267
at the core of this presentation.

200
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:10,887
Bless you.

201
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:19,840
Developing effective materials that facilitate learning requires an understanding of the principles underlying how people learn which are

202
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,704
The first one is the behavioral psychology principle. It's basically conditioning

203
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:27,466
which affects

204
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:32,169
Implicit memory so Pavlov, Skinner, Thorndike, you've heard these names

205
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,953
They only looked at stimuli and rest senses, the input and the output

206
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:40,896
Without really bothering with what happens in the mind, the black box

207
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:47,738
Dominance of behaviorism began to wane in the 70s and cognitive psychology took over.

208
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:53,101
They wanted to look into the black box with an information processing approach.

209
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:56,104
Perception, attention, memory, all the stuff we just talked about.

210
00:10:57,344 --> 00:10:59,986
They also introduced the notion of an executive control.

211
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,712
Lastly, according to the constructivist viewpoint,

212
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:07,434
learning is a process of people actively constructing knowledge.

213
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,056
So that's people like Jean Piaget, if you've heard of him,

214
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,779
or Seymour Papers, research with logo.

215
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,601
You remember the logo programming language

216
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:18,402
with the turtle?

217
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,163
Yeah, I'm not that old.

218
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,924
I guess you are old, like me.

219
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:25,907
So that's active learning.

220
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,048
Sorry for the lame picture here, but just try to Google search active learning.

221
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,671
There's pretty lame pictures in there.

222
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:39,336
Anyway, so these different learning principles will be used as perspective throughout this presentation.

223
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:48,756
So the first part of the talk will emphasize on one of the most important aspects of the brain with respect to onboarding.

224
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:55,979
Managing the player's attention. Learning to play a new game necessitates a different cognitive effort than mastering a game.

225
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:02,121
A new player is not necessarily deeply motivated to play and has many new things to understand.

226
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:05,842
So the game must engage its audience quickly and efficiently.

227
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:10,066
Every point of fiction can turn the player away at that stage,

228
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:12,448
especially, again, with free-to-play games,

229
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,889
since they don't require previous commitment.

230
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:15,929
You don't buy the game.

231
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:21,072
So, to remove barriers,

232
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,153
you need to manage the player's attention.

233
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:26,735
To do that, you need to understand how working memory works,

234
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,796
the component that stores and manipulates information.

235
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,718
It is composed of two slave systems.

236
00:12:33,762 --> 00:12:38,172
One system is responsible for processing visual, spatial, and motor tasks.

237
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,301
Another is responsible for processing phonological tasks.

238
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,324
So it's nearly impossible to do two tasks from the same slave system.

239
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:54,006
And usually to show that, I bring people, someone on stage,

240
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:59,029
ask this person to sing a song while trying to spot verbs in a text.

241
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,312
Can't do that at GDC here, but my colleagues at Ubisoft have been...

242
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:05,954
experiencing that painfully.

243
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:08,976
And this is where you can actually

244
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:11,679
see that it's very difficult to do two tasks

245
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,441
from the same bucket, in that case, phonological task.

246
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:17,564
You can do one of each.

247
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:21,167
So I also ask the person to sing a song with lyrics,

248
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:23,970
but instead of spotting verbs, I ask

249
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,391
the person to draw a picture.

250
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:30,015
In that case, it's much easier, but still less efficient

251
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,437
as just doing one task.

252
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:36,442
It can be trained, but only to a certain limit.

253
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:39,543
When attention is divided, for example,

254
00:13:39,743 --> 00:13:42,263
when driving while having a conversation over the phone,

255
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:45,204
it requires more cognitive load to process

256
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:47,524
the different information, therefore leading

257
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:48,865
to more fatigue and mistakes.

258
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:51,345
The more demanding a specific task

259
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:54,366
is in terms of cognitive load, for example,

260
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,927
mental calculation, the less people

261
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,187
can allocate mental effort to accomplish another task,

262
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:01,228
even though simple, such as pressing a button

263
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:02,728
when a red light goes off.

264
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,728
By the way, this is a real experiment

265
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:05,469
from Kahneman in 1973.

266
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,632
Subsequently, the more attention is allocated

267
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:14,937
to a task or information, the better it will be retained.

268
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:17,359
So if you want to teach the player something,

269
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:20,303
you really want to avoid divided attention.

270
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:24,847
All right, so here's an example of divided attention,

271
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:27,851
or when we try to require divided attention

272
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:29,933
on a player from Fortnite.

273
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,421
Fortnite is an action building game with RPG elements.

274
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,101
It's currently in live alpha stage.

275
00:14:36,662 --> 00:14:39,302
Disclaimer, the footage shown in this video

276
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:42,483
is from UX testing, so it's super compressed

277
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:44,743
because we don't need to have high resolution images.

278
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:48,604
And of course, it's very early in development.

279
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:51,205
And in all the videos I will show you,

280
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,465
you will see a red circle overlay.

281
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,685
This is eye tracking.

282
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:57,086
So it's showing where the players are looking at,

283
00:14:57,126 --> 00:15:00,167
which is super important for attentional resources.

284
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,824
So in this video I'm going to show you the player chose to play as a constructor

285
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:07,905
so his role is to stay close to the fortifications

286
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,765
to repair them and reinforce them.

287
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:14,186
However, he's running around because, well, smashing zombies is pretty fun.

288
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:17,746
So you'll see an important message popping at the top

289
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,047
telling the player that the fort is being attacked

290
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:22,207
and that he should go back to repair it.

291
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,248
But the player does not even look at this information

292
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:28,508
which is an important mechanic to be successful in the game.

293
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:32,557
he's not dividing his attention, because dealing with enemies

294
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:35,980
is taking all his attentional resources, just like in the gorilla experiment.

295
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:47,771
Therefore, it is critical during the discovery part of the game

296
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:50,134
to draw the player's attention to the elements

297
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:52,556
that they need to learn to enjoy their first steps.

298
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,233
Given that all of our mental processes

299
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:57,333
are using the same limited attentional resources,

300
00:15:57,893 --> 00:15:59,994
the developers must mind the cognitive load

301
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:02,054
the game demands from the player,

302
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:04,395
especially, again, during the onboarding part

303
00:16:04,515 --> 00:16:07,656
when the players have a lot of new information to process.

304
00:16:10,876 --> 00:16:13,277
So according to the cognitive load theory,

305
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:16,278
learning can be hindered if it requires

306
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:19,618
cognitive resources exceeding the working memory limits.

307
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:25,162
A working memory span is three, more or less, items on average.

308
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:29,968
An item can be an action or a thought process

309
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:30,990
that requires effort.

310
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,371
It's very vague.

311
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,214
I'm sorry I cannot be more specific than that.

312
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:42,632
But three items processed at the same time is really the maximum when in learning mode,

313
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:43,913
so discovering everything.

314
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:49,116
Because new tasks have a much higher cognitive load than familiar or automated ones.

315
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:54,359
Think about the efforts it took you to learn how to drive the first time.

316
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:59,402
You really had to mentally process everything to build up attentional resources.

317
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:06,605
But once trained, like later, when you really have that going, you can just sing along while

318
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:11,586
you drive, it's automated, so you don't have to really allocate too much resources in there.

319
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:13,747
So the same thing with the player.

320
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:17,728
The first time he learns about a mechanic, it's going to require a lot of cognitive load.

321
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:24,330
Later down the line, when the player really had that going, it's trained to doing it,

322
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,472
it's more automated, it does not require as much cognitive load.

323
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:31,103
So three items could be one, using an ability

324
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:33,804
to react to an enemy attack,

325
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:35,965
like analyzing enemy movement pattern,

326
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:38,566
while three, dodging enemy projectile.

327
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,487
That's already three.

328
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:43,369
So if the controls of your game are peculiar,

329
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:45,690
that would count as another item.

330
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,452
So check this UX test video from Paragon.

331
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:52,753
So Paragon is our MOBA.

332
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,731
Again, very early, it's UX test footage.

333
00:17:59,512 --> 00:17:59,952
Check out that.

334
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:03,492
So this is the very first game that the player is playing.

335
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:04,953
And so it starts.

336
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:07,813
It's entering the arena right away.

337
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,414
Even though we have that big, flashing red thing telling the

338
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:14,975
player, hey, you can actually have an ability right now.

339
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:16,355
You can upgrade one here.

340
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,176
But the player doesn't even look at it.

341
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:19,756
He just jumps right into the arena.

342
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:23,226
It's flashing, we're really trying to draw attention to that.

343
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,308
And he's trying a few things.

344
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:26,490
Oh, there's an enemy there.

345
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,933
He's running towards the enemy, trying to figure that out.

346
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,616
Aiming, dodging the enemy's attacks.

347
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:34,297
Some minions.

348
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:38,141
Sometimes he's going to pop down,

349
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:39,642
looking at the thing that is going,

350
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:42,105
but he's not even going to process this information at that time.

351
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:49,758
So during onboarding, minding the cognitive load is critical.

352
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:54,386
Because the challenge will not be seen as mastery by the player, it's going to be seen

353
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:55,168
as annoyance.

354
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,733
Or worse, the player will be put in a failure comp.

355
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:01,153
This is likely going to create stress

356
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:04,154
that now we can capture with biometrics tools.

357
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:06,855
So we can actually see that stress.

358
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,856
And that can lead the player to simply stop playing.

359
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:12,537
And he's going to blame it on the game.

360
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:16,678
So F2P game must mine the cognitive load

361
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:17,438
in working memory.

362
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:22,553
There are many ways to reduce the cognitive load here,

363
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:25,435
such as distribute learning over time,

364
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:26,516
which we're gonna see later.

365
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:29,778
You can also use affordances to limit the cognitive load.

366
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:32,540
What is intuitive does not need to be learned,

367
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,261
therefore requires less attentional resources to process.

368
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:38,584
In design, an affordance gives or provides something

369
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:40,385
that helps a user to do something.

370
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:43,487
Now, four kinds of affordances in UX design.

371
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,668
I'll give an example of each right after.

372
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,678
You have physical affordance.

373
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:49,298
That's a feature that helps users

374
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:51,839
in doing a physical action in the interface.

375
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,200
For example, a button that is large enough

376
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,360
so that users can click on it accurately.

377
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,901
You have cognitive affordance.

378
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:01,481
It enables thinking, learning, understanding,

379
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,741
knowing about something.

380
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,622
For example, a button label that helps user

381
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:07,843
know what will happen if they click on it.

382
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:10,843
Form follows function is a cognitive affordance.

383
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:12,834
You have sensory affordance.

384
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:15,515
It's a design feature that helps users sense something.

385
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:17,597
For example, a label, font size,

386
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:18,718
large enough to be discerned.

387
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,959
And you have functional affordance.

388
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,902
It's a design feature that helps users accomplish a task.

389
00:20:24,302 --> 00:20:27,044
For example, a sort functionality in an inventory.

390
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:29,666
There's a subtlety.

391
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:33,048
The perceivable part of an affordance is a signifier.

392
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:36,871
So as a designer, you care about placing signifiers

393
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:39,293
to enable the players to perceive the affordances.

394
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:46,528
So physical affordance facilitates physically doing something, such as a handle on a door

395
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:48,831
physically helps you operating the door.

396
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:53,816
So you want a button to be large enough to tap on it, to click on it, or you want two

397
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,779
buttons to not be too close to each other to avoid misclicks.

398
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,802
See the Fitts' Law for these things.

399
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:02,726
Or on mobile, interactive areas to be comfortable to reach.

400
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:10,991
A cognitive affordance, like we saw facilitates or enables thinking about something, they help users to know what to do.

401
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:16,476
So the pull handle offers both cognitive and physical affordance

402
00:21:16,856 --> 00:21:22,981
because it provides a physical means for pulling as well as a visual indication that pulling is the required action.

403
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:29,607
In Fortnite, you have three different symbols representing three types of materials. Remember you can build and craft.

404
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,246
and how many of each the player has.

405
00:21:34,107 --> 00:21:36,853
So that helps players understand what they can do with it.

406
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:41,593
Cognitive affordance can go wrong.

407
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:43,314
This is called false affordance.

408
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:45,376
It is when the perceived affordance is not

409
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,277
the one intended, given the functionality.

410
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:51,861
Here's the example of the axe in Fortnite.

411
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:55,363
So you have a lot of weapons and tools.

412
00:21:55,744 --> 00:21:58,806
You actually have one tool that is really

413
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:00,487
effective for harvesting, just one.

414
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:01,288
It's the pickaxe.

415
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:05,391
But you have all the other items you can have are melee weapons.

416
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:07,032
So the axe is a melee weapon.

417
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:13,055
Of course, originally it was not the design intention to put an axe in the player's hand

418
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:15,697
and say, no, you cannot actually chop off trees with that.

419
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:21,862
Initially they wanted to have one specific tool for each specific thing you can harvest,

420
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:25,845
like the axe for the tree, the sledgehammer for a wall, and stuff like that.

421
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:29,928
But it was too demanding, players didn't like that, it was not really fun, so they removed

422
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:30,608
that functionality.

423
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:34,871
And there you end up with a false affordance because of that,

424
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:36,532
because now players can have an axe,

425
00:22:37,313 --> 00:22:39,374
but it has to be used for meleeing

426
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,375
and not for chopping trees.

427
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:45,398
So false cognitive affordance misinform

428
00:22:45,418 --> 00:22:46,399
and mislead the players,

429
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,140
and then it makes it much harder

430
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,861
to teach them the right thing.

431
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:51,902
And it's frustrating for the players on top of it.

432
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:54,104
So you really have to pay attention to that.

433
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:57,266
That's really the sort of things that happen just.

434
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,998
It happens because the design changed,

435
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:05,281
so you have to stay focused on that.

436
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,823
Sensory affordance, easy one,

437
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,584
helps players sense in something,

438
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:10,285
seeing, hearing, feeling.

439
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:12,687
This is what we call the perceptibility

440
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:13,628
of sounds and feedback.

441
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:16,551
It includes noticeability, discernibility,

442
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:17,972
legibility in case of text,

443
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:19,873
and audibility in case of sound.

444
00:23:21,054 --> 00:23:23,775
So in that case, of course that's a bug, it's not by design.

445
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:33,920
When you die, you can click to respawn, but the text is hidden behind a health bar,

446
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,961
and so the player cannot perceive it.

447
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:39,443
Also, there's a more subtle one.

448
00:23:39,943 --> 00:23:42,964
In Fortnite, you have a home base and you have buildings.

449
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:48,007
And these buildings increase your stats, and you can even more increase your stats

450
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:49,648
by slotting workers in there.

451
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:53,728
So when you click on the plus button there to slot a worker,

452
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:56,629
it was showing the workers you could slot,

453
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:59,310
including the ones already slotted elsewhere.

454
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,371
Suddenly indicated by that red corner mark.

455
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,252
I'm sure you saw it, right?

456
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:06,833
Of course players didn't see it.

457
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:08,853
And on this video you're going to see,

458
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:11,374
you'll see the player going back and forth

459
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:13,955
in the two buildings trying to slot a worker,

460
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:16,516
not realizing he's slotting, un-slotting

461
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:18,516
the same one over and over.

462
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:20,940
my home

463
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,122
and work for you

464
00:24:23,202 --> 00:24:23,382
elders

465
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:26,404
gone from the hospital

466
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:29,147
uh...

467
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:35,672
so we have to pay attention to that

468
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:55,125
Functional affordance, this is one that ties usage to usefulness.

469
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,347
This is when you add a functionality, such as sorting

470
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:01,249
and categories to help the player find something.

471
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,532
Filtering, in that example you see, well, there's filtering,

472
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:09,375
but there's also a pinning mechanism,

473
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:11,516
so it can help player craft something faster.

474
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:13,618
You want something, you can pin it on the HUD

475
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:15,980
so you don't have to do that again and again.

476
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:19,519
So designers have to make sure, this is really useful,

477
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:23,060
but you have to make sure that the functional affordance

478
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,881
you're designing is really gonna be useful to the player,

479
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:28,541
and not just add noise or complexity.

480
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:31,042
Refer you to the Pareto principle,

481
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,603
it's like the 80-20 principle.

482
00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:37,224
80% of the time, people use only 20% of the functionalities.

483
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:39,524
So be careful not to add too much stuff

484
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:40,765
that peers are not gonna use.

485
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:46,428
Some interfaces feel easy to use while others drive us nuts

486
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:49,530
and requires manuals or sticky notes, in that example.

487
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:52,332
It will greatly help remove barriers

488
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:54,253
for your players' first steps in your game

489
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:56,354
if you have good affordances,

490
00:25:56,715 --> 00:25:58,376
or should I say, good signifiers.

491
00:25:58,816 --> 00:26:01,758
Because if it doesn't, you'll need tutorial texts,

492
00:26:02,258 --> 00:26:04,159
or players will have to make an extra effort,

493
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,081
which they often don't, won't do it,

494
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:11,244
to figure out on forums how to use a certain functionality.

495
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:15,970
So the key takeaway here for discovery

496
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,632
is you have to mind the attention limitations

497
00:26:20,752 --> 00:26:22,473
and the cognitive load for the player.

498
00:26:22,974 --> 00:26:24,835
Your main objective is to make sure

499
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:26,976
that your game's gonna be easy to make sense of

500
00:26:27,797 --> 00:26:28,997
and to remove barriers.

501
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:33,060
And this is by design, but if it's not by design,

502
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,601
remove all the barriers at that moment.

503
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:38,303
Use, and this is an example, the usability principles.

504
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:41,925
So we saw a lot of UX design principles,

505
00:26:41,985 --> 00:26:43,526
actually the affordances, for example.

506
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,815
All right, so learning.

507
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,642
Although learning by doing is recognized as being one of the most efficient ways of learning,

508
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:58,524
especially when it comes to an interactive experience, tutorial texts are still frequently

509
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:00,305
used to teach the main components of a game.

510
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:01,706
That's easier.

511
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:08,409
Research suggests that we learn best when we are cognitively engaged and active, when

512
00:27:08,449 --> 00:27:13,132
learning experiences are meaningful and socially interactive, and when learning is guided by

513
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:14,152
a specific goal.

514
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:16,493
So let's take a look at active tutorials.

515
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,760
So we saw that last time, that it's really, really important.

516
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,082
So I'll put that here again, but I'm using a new example.

517
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:28,585
The deeper you're going to process an information, focus

518
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,446
your attention, the better you're going

519
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:31,327
to learn and retain.

520
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,349
So that means you need to give context to the player.

521
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:37,752
It means the player should be able to learn by doing.

522
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:39,793
And you need meaning.

523
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:43,276
It has to be worthwhile now for the player, for his life,

524
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:44,797
for his mission, for his goal.

525
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:49,227
All right, so here's an example where you don't have any context.

526
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:53,053
You cannot do the things you're taught at that moment, and there's no meaning.

527
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:55,297
So this is again from Perrigan Alpha.

528
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:56,619
This is the loading screen.

529
00:27:56,659 --> 00:28:00,105
So look at the eye tracking.

530
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,421
So the player is waiting for the game to load.

531
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:05,742
It's not really reading all the things,

532
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:09,125
and it's especially not reading the match basics.

533
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:11,746
It is really the most important information for him.

534
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:13,147
It's the first time he's gonna play the game,

535
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:17,650
so he needs to understand the subtlety of Paragon.

536
00:28:18,591 --> 00:28:21,653
It's just like going back in forest,

537
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,574
not really reading, he's just gonna look

538
00:28:23,654 --> 00:28:25,756
at a few controls and that's it.

539
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,332
Here's another example when you have context.

540
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:34,579
So it means that you can do it while you're taught.

541
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,843
But there's no meaning.

542
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:38,673
So in Fortnite, you can build.

543
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:43,015
And what we saw is that players were building walls

544
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:43,716
all around them.

545
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,277
And then we're like, oh shit, I can't get out.

546
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:49,679
You can edit doors in Fortnite, but they

547
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:50,440
didn't know how to do it.

548
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,441
So they were just sliding down a door.

549
00:28:53,562 --> 00:28:56,483
And so we really needed to teach them how to edit doors,

550
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:58,024
because it's really important to enjoy the game.

551
00:28:58,765 --> 00:29:02,810
And so this is what the team did at the beginning.

552
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,432
So you have context and no meaning.

553
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:07,796
Listen to what the narrator says in that example.

554
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:10,179
So players found the gate.

555
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,321
You found the gate.

556
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:12,622
Let's close it.

557
00:29:13,023 --> 00:29:16,087
Press E to deploy your Atlas storm suppression device.

558
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:21,795
Just a heads up, the husks aren't going to like it when you start closing that gate.

559
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:25,696
You might want to build up some strong defenses around it to slow the enemy down.

560
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:30,718
Just this one time, I'm going to project an area you should build in to protect your Atlas.

561
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,300
A good wall is a thing of beauty, but don't forget about doors.

562
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,761
Yes, doors. When there's a wall in the way, choose doors.

563
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:41,962
Brought to you by the Building Submenu Awareness Society and the letter G.

564
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,181
He heard us?

565
00:29:58,345 --> 00:29:59,166
Of course he didn't do it.

566
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:04,008
He built that box around the thing he had to protect,

567
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:07,530
and then when the enemies are coming,

568
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,371
he's actually like, oh shit, I cannot really see what's going.

569
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:14,573
So what he did is he placed a stairwell

570
00:30:14,953 --> 00:30:16,674
so he could climb up the enemies.

571
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,482
A lot of players were doing that, so we're like, shit,

572
00:30:20,782 --> 00:30:21,603
it's not working.

573
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:25,348
Still, you have context here, but it's not really meaningful.

574
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:27,391
And there's a lot of information going on here.

575
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:31,236
So what the team did afterwards, they

576
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,518
tried to bring more meaning.

577
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:33,600
And this is how it looks like now.

578
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:52,728
It's just beyond this wall.

579
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,451
Let's use edit mode to add a door.

580
00:30:56,112 --> 00:31:00,456
Hit G, click on the center panel and the panel below it.

581
00:31:00,516 --> 00:31:00,816
JL.

582
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:07,963
Success.

583
00:31:08,704 --> 00:31:10,646
So now we know that the player.

584
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:18,494
do it. And so it really processed information. It was actively doing it. So this is when you

585
00:31:18,574 --> 00:31:23,759
actually have meaning. So you want to avoid that as much as possible. Of course, you cannot avoid

586
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:29,744
that all the time. And you want to try to have more learning by doing. And if you can add meaning,

587
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:30,845
it's even better.

588
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:34,949
But sometimes it means that you have to put an obstacle in front of the player and he

589
00:31:34,989 --> 00:31:35,850
has to overcome it.

590
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:41,035
And usually players, they hate tutorials and they're like, this is bullshit, I hate it.

591
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:46,660
But the problem is if they don't have these tutorials, they are more likely to leave the

592
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:46,981
game.

593
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:53,327
So even if they don't like it, you might have to not make them happy, but at least they're

594
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:56,289
going to learn the mechanics of the game and keep playing.

595
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:02,150
Another thing to remember here, please, please avoid punishing states during onboarding.

596
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,071
During onboarding only.

597
00:32:03,992 --> 00:32:07,676
And I'm talking to you, Bloodborne and Dark Souls lovers out here.

598
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:13,930
If it's not clearly the main pillar of the game, punishments, you should never punish

599
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,412
while they are learning about something.

600
00:32:16,632 --> 00:32:20,556
You can punish later, it's totally fine, but not while they're learning it.

601
00:32:21,036 --> 00:32:21,317
Why?

602
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:27,483
Because players who die or are having difficulties during the onboarding are less likely to retain.

603
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:31,586
This is actually what we found out looking into analytics data from Fortnite's alpha.

604
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:34,688
without hardcore gamers out there.

605
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:40,431
So if they were having too much difficulty or dying too often,

606
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:42,252
they were actually more likely to leave the game.

607
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:44,834
Again, your hardcore players might whine

608
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:46,495
if they find the game too easy in the beginning.

609
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,636
Still, they will more likely keep playing.

610
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:52,438
So don't get crazy with your difficulty curve.

611
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,419
Learning about the game is already challenging enough

612
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:54,799
for the brain.

613
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:59,357
But sometimes you just cannot provide context.

614
00:33:00,098 --> 00:33:01,299
For example, in loading screens.

615
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,403
If you use loading screens to teach, which you should,

616
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:05,664
because loading screens are boring,

617
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:08,748
there are ways to make it easy on the cognitive load.

618
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:12,512
This is a screen, again, very, very early.

619
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:19,136
PVP prototype. It was the first time the team was actually trying to do a UX test with it.

620
00:33:19,216 --> 00:33:23,679
So they put a loading screen there to teach about how you have to do in that mode.

621
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,521
But the first loading screen, there was way too much information to read.

622
00:33:28,962 --> 00:33:32,464
And it was going too much into details that didn't make sense really to the players

623
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:33,945
or didn't know anything about this mode.

624
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:38,468
It was too much about the what, not enough about the why or how.

625
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:41,230
Players were actually looking more at the cool art.

626
00:33:41,844 --> 00:33:44,109
then I'll add the text.

627
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:50,054
So you want to have like, so again, they just like

628
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:53,715
hack that in last minute to make it, to remove some text

629
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:56,336
and trying to make it easier to understand.

630
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:59,216
Because of the curse of knowledge, we have a tendency

631
00:33:59,256 --> 00:34:01,777
to explain by getting too much into details.

632
00:34:02,737 --> 00:34:05,138
Probably doing that myself today, apologies for that.

633
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:08,319
So explaining more about how to do all the things

634
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,259
instead of mining the cognitive load,

635
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,540
explain more about how to do the things.

636
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:16,683
because you have to mind the cognitive load of the player.

637
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:18,325
They are discovering all these things,

638
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:21,588
so they care more about the why they're doing it,

639
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:22,669
not about the details.

640
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,271
So if you are using the loading screens,

641
00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:27,573
do not explain more than three things,

642
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:28,875
remember the working memory,

643
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:32,578
and try to focus on the why rather than the how, what.

644
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:39,287
Using looting screens to occupy players is a good thing though, because waiting is painful.

645
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:41,989
And it is also a matter of perception.

646
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:47,915
For example, waiting times will seem shorter if there is a progression bar that has animation on it.

647
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:53,119
If this progress bar accelerates rather than decelerates or stops us, that's dreadful.

648
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:59,565
So if players have something to do while waiting, it's better instead of looking at an empty screen.

649
00:35:00,586 --> 00:35:03,549
Do use the loading screen to convey information to players,

650
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,911
but they won't read it if there's too much.

651
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,933
Or if they do read it, they're not gonna remember it.

652
00:35:10,134 --> 00:35:12,016
So remember the working memory limitations.

653
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:14,738
Try to stick to three elements to process

654
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,900
and focus on the why.

655
00:35:18,674 --> 00:35:21,497
The why, why do you want to do that, the purpose of these things.

656
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:23,579
It's really meaningful to us as humans.

657
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,742
So think you're onboarding a tutorial through a player's lens.

658
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:32,006
It's more important to tease to the player the why, the purpose,

659
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:34,449
rather than get into the details.

660
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:37,592
If you motivate players enough, then they will pay attention

661
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:40,134
on how to accomplish a certain goal.

662
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,712
then they're going to look more into the details

663
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:46,992
and look at the interactive elements they need

664
00:35:48,053 --> 00:35:50,614
to play with to get to that goal.

665
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:55,556
And so when you test your game, also try

666
00:35:55,596 --> 00:35:57,276
to see if the players get to the Y.

667
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:01,611
So show what I do, for example, if they play the onboarding.

668
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:05,014
And in the survey at the end of their experience,

669
00:36:05,194 --> 00:36:09,198
I show a screenshot of the game with an interactive element.

670
00:36:09,218 --> 00:36:10,860
So for example, something the players

671
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,702
need to activate to do something in the game.

672
00:36:12,742 --> 00:36:14,123
So I show an image of it.

673
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:15,605
And I ask them, so what is this?

674
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:17,607
How did you use it?

675
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:19,629
Why was it important?

676
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:20,818
for your mission.

677
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:25,539
So I also asked the players what was the objectives

678
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:26,719
of the mission.

679
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:29,020
Did they get why they were doing all this?

680
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,981
Don't just ask them, did you find the objectives clear?

681
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,541
Because they're usually going to say yes.

682
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,422
But if you ask them, OK, so what were the objectives?

683
00:36:37,682 --> 00:36:39,082
They usually don't get it all right.

684
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:43,243
So always ask them about the purpose of completing a

685
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:45,303
mission to verify that they actually got it.

686
00:36:47,058 --> 00:36:48,900
Always make sure that the players get to the why.

687
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,601
That's really the most important thing.

688
00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:57,168
So, remember for all that you will teach,

689
00:36:57,628 --> 00:36:59,951
the deeper the process, the better the retention.

690
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:06,937
Numerous studies in psychology show that learning is not simply a passive registration of information.

691
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:11,603
Learning that sticks requires active, mind-zone learning.

692
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:18,571
Simply put, the more the brain puts efforts into something, the more it remembers and understands it.

693
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:22,533
So it's nearly scientific, but overall,

694
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:24,213
the more you process information,

695
00:37:24,293 --> 00:37:26,114
so if you really practice by doing,

696
00:37:26,574 --> 00:37:28,574
or teach others about something you learned,

697
00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:31,115
it's gonna be way more easy for you to remember,

698
00:37:31,135 --> 00:37:34,056
to retain that information that you just read about it.

699
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:42,697
So, even with all that science,

700
00:37:43,818 --> 00:37:46,978
the players are gonna be forgetting about stuff.

701
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:52,270
So we need to understand better how memory lapse works.

702
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:56,254
So if you remember, memory allows us to encode,

703
00:37:56,614 --> 00:37:59,516
store, and retrieve or recall information.

704
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:02,519
Therefore, three factors can lead to oblivion.

705
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:04,926
It can be an encoding deficit.

706
00:38:05,506 --> 00:38:08,468
This is when the information was superficially encoded

707
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:09,969
because of a lack of attention

708
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,110
or because of a failed elaboration process.

709
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:15,052
So workaround for that is draw attention,

710
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,254
make the player process information, do it,

711
00:38:17,314 --> 00:38:18,274
like be emotional.

712
00:38:19,595 --> 00:38:21,036
It could be a storage deficit.

713
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:22,977
The information was correctly encoded,

714
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:24,438
but it weakens with time.

715
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:28,941
So you need to give, to repeat all the mechanics

716
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,423
and try to make them repeat in different contexts,

717
00:38:31,503 --> 00:38:32,223
it's even richer.

718
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:37,135
And lastly, you can have a recall deficit.

719
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:40,478
This is when the information is available in memory,

720
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,120
but it's momentarily inaccessible.

721
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,241
You have a broken link.

722
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:45,903
So to avoid that, you can give reminders

723
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,765
to have the player remember about something.

724
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:51,308
So here is an example for each deficit.

725
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,311
So for the encoding deficit,

726
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:57,574
here's an example in from Fortnite.

727
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:02,638
In Fortnite, by design, you cannot repair weapons.

728
00:39:04,102 --> 00:39:06,883
And so we're live right now in early alpha.

729
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:11,405
And many players in the alpha population

730
00:39:11,845 --> 00:39:13,366
are asking how to repair weapons.

731
00:39:14,306 --> 00:39:16,207
They're posting down the forums all the time,

732
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:17,928
like how the hell do you repair weapons?

733
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:19,429
You can't.

734
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:22,230
So the team decided to put the player in a situation

735
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,452
where the weapon breaks right at the beginning of the game

736
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:28,673
so we can tell them, hey, you cannot repair weapons.

737
00:39:29,293 --> 00:39:30,734
So this is what you need to craft.

738
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,075
So that's the video of it.

739
00:39:38,747 --> 00:39:43,273
Your gun's broken. Your drone can't repair crafted items. So we'll need to craft a new gun.

740
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:46,878
Let's search the cave for the resources we'll need to craft a new weapon.

741
00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:52,474
All right, so the player experienced that,

742
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:55,076
the weapon is breaking, you hear it, you see it,

743
00:39:55,216 --> 00:39:56,057
you can't repair it.

744
00:39:56,737 --> 00:39:58,499
Here's what the player was saying after

745
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:01,381
that experience on the surveys,

746
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:04,343
they're like, I'm confused about how to repair objects

747
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,505
in Fortnite, there was no easy way to find

748
00:40:06,545 --> 00:40:07,866
how to repair weapons, and you're like,

749
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:09,647
ah, shit, it didn't work.

750
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:13,950
And this is because of an encoding deficit.

751
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,332
Again, it was not asking the player to put too much,

752
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:19,793
not enough cognitive load into that,

753
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:21,675
and so they didn't really encode it.

754
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:23,976
That was a beautiful sound it just made.

755
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:29,880
The storage deficits.

756
00:40:31,985 --> 00:40:33,806
A pinning functionality, for example,

757
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:36,367
allows the player to not store the information

758
00:40:36,387 --> 00:40:37,547
about what he needs to craft,

759
00:40:37,808 --> 00:40:39,388
but instead always have it on the head,

760
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:41,529
so you avoid the storage deficit.

761
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,230
That's a functional affordance.

762
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:46,007
and removes memory load.

763
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:49,549
When it's missing, you don't have that pinning functionality,

764
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,931
players actually have difficulty storing the ingredients,

765
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:54,692
even if it's just that one ingredient

766
00:40:54,732 --> 00:40:56,092
is just a few numbers to remember.

767
00:40:56,113 --> 00:41:00,675
It's just hard to just remember one number,

768
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:02,436
it's not just one.

769
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:06,298
So, of course it's not bad design.

770
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:13,821
Again, it's something that the dev team is hacking through so we can test it.

771
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:15,902
But here's what happened.

772
00:41:16,623 --> 00:41:17,963
So that's a very new feature.

773
00:41:18,664 --> 00:41:19,164
It's ugly.

774
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:20,645
It's going to be way better.

775
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:22,846
But right now it's the only prototype.

776
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:23,986
So it's the Outpost.

777
00:41:25,387 --> 00:41:29,209
It allows you to upgrade your pickaxe, which is the harvesting tool.

778
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:30,390
So it's super important in Fortnite.

779
00:41:32,462 --> 00:41:34,883
And so to do that, you need to have ingredients.

780
00:41:35,404 --> 00:41:37,505
And we don't have the pinning right now for that.

781
00:41:38,006 --> 00:41:40,808
So the player has to, it's actually hidden.

782
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:42,008
There's a lot of problems here.

783
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:43,189
Oh, we know about this.

784
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,131
And you need to look at the bill.

785
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:49,093
So he's looking at how many the item he needs.

786
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:51,415
So he gets it and he goes back.

787
00:41:52,556 --> 00:41:55,338
It's already the third time he's looking at that thing,

788
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:56,959
even though it's not that much in front.

789
00:41:56,999 --> 00:41:58,800
It's just one, he just needs one ingredient.

790
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:01,963
Goes back, get it, and lastly, he got it.

791
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:06,270
So you can see that even if it's just one information to retain,

792
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,470
it's not too heavy.

793
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,571
I know how to use that.

794
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:11,713
It's still very difficult to retain that information

795
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:12,713
because you're running around, you're

796
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:13,734
doing a lot of different stuff.

797
00:42:14,314 --> 00:42:16,835
So this is really showing how impactful

798
00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:20,838
it can be to have these sort of reminders on the head

799
00:42:21,058 --> 00:42:22,999
to have the player not store information.

800
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:27,761
About recall.

801
00:42:28,945 --> 00:42:32,086
So in Fortnite, in the first level,

802
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:34,226
we teach players how to craft in a deep way.

803
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:35,367
They have to do it.

804
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:36,827
So it's learning by doing.

805
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:38,507
So here's a video of it.

806
00:42:39,288 --> 00:42:41,228
Let's craft a better gun for Ramirez, Commander.

807
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:44,769
Open your inventory and select the gun sub menu.

808
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,971
Like, active learning.

809
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:57,151
Good.

810
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,271
Formation is encoded.

811
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:00,432
I had some great crafting.

812
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:01,873
Reward.

813
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,196
And then this is what happened about 20 minutes later.

814
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:09,499
The player is thrown into his outpost.

815
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,283
He loses all his ingredients because he swaps heroes.

816
00:43:15,323 --> 00:43:17,325
But anyway, so this is how it happens.

817
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,606
He doesn't have anything.

818
00:43:18,966 --> 00:43:19,927
And so we drop ingredients.

819
00:43:19,947 --> 00:43:20,587
Be careful.

820
00:43:20,788 --> 00:43:23,369
While it's in flux, your outpost is vulnerable to attack.

821
00:43:23,389 --> 00:43:24,370
So be ready to defend it.

822
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,652
You have to defend it.

823
00:43:27,756 --> 00:43:34,060
I only have a stick, but we're giving him ingredients!

824
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:40,745
With this you can craft a lot of cool shit.

825
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:45,248
The player's just taking the ingredients, not crafting anything.

826
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,831
He still has a stick.

827
00:43:50,432 --> 00:43:54,955
And so, a little bit later, he's combating.

828
00:43:54,975 --> 00:43:56,817
He's still just having a stick.

829
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:09,402
And so this is what the player said at the end.

830
00:44:09,422 --> 00:44:13,104
The student said, I could not remember how to get to the crash screen.

831
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:16,606
He knew he could do it, he just did not recall how to do it.

832
00:44:17,227 --> 00:44:22,030
So we should have given a reminder after dropping all the ingredients, we should have told the

833
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:27,093
player, hey, remember, press I to get to your inventory and craft a new weapon.

834
00:44:29,157 --> 00:44:31,977
So we saw that repetition is important to remember something.

835
00:44:32,117 --> 00:44:33,258
Remember the forgetting curve.

836
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,278
So this is projected forgetting curve.

837
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:37,899
So when you teach a feature,

838
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:41,320
you actually don't need to give repetition

839
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,841
at the same space.

840
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:47,622
You can actually space it out.

841
00:44:47,982 --> 00:44:50,923
Teach the feature A, you can give a reminder a bit later.

842
00:44:51,003 --> 00:44:53,223
Because each time you reteach about something,

843
00:44:53,543 --> 00:44:55,364
the forgetting curve is getting smoother.

844
00:44:57,163 --> 00:44:59,043
And so of course, in between these lapses,

845
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:00,444
you can teach another feature.

846
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:03,665
This looks super ugly, but you get the point.

847
00:45:05,885 --> 00:45:07,626
So reminders are more efficient when spaced out,

848
00:45:08,026 --> 00:45:10,086
but also when the context does not stay the same.

849
00:45:10,186 --> 00:45:11,547
For example, to teach your players

850
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:12,647
how to use a new weapon,

851
00:45:12,987 --> 00:45:15,068
first teach how to shoot still targets,

852
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:17,588
then move in targets, then partly occluded targets,

853
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,389
then move in targets while dodging, et cetera.

854
00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:21,629
You need multi-contextual repetition,

855
00:45:22,149 --> 00:45:25,230
and you combine with more mechanics to learn.

856
00:45:27,753 --> 00:45:29,217
Alright, I need to speed up.

857
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:32,766
We talked a lot about cognitive psychology and active learning principles,

858
00:45:33,468 --> 00:45:36,154
so let's briefly tackle behavioral psychology here.

859
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,104
to give you an idea of how you can use it.

860
00:45:39,705 --> 00:45:41,766
We're talking about classical conditioning.

861
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:44,729
It's when two events happen close to each other

862
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:45,990
repeatedly over time.

863
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,512
So you hear the bell, and there's the food going on,

864
00:45:48,572 --> 00:45:50,634
and you repeat, repeat, repeat, so then you salivate

865
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:53,176
only when you hear the bell, so that's good.

866
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:54,898
So you're learning you've been conditioned.

867
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:58,240
So you can please learn to link these.

868
00:45:59,101 --> 00:45:59,602
How about this sound?

869
00:46:04,547 --> 00:46:05,307
You feel conditioned.

870
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:10,728
So there's a lot of examples of classical conditioning in game,

871
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,589
usually with the music of sound design.

872
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:15,309
For example, the music stops in some games

873
00:46:15,429 --> 00:46:17,090
when there are no more enemies left to kill.

874
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,491
Conditioning can be very powerful to teach

875
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:21,291
some mechanics.

876
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:25,692
It can work very well, like really to a deep level,

877
00:46:26,352 --> 00:46:29,333
especially by associating sound with another event.

878
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,533
So be nice to your sound designers because you need them.

879
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,583
All right, so mind the memory load, mind the memory lapse.

880
00:46:37,903 --> 00:46:39,904
My main objective is to make it easy to learn,

881
00:46:40,385 --> 00:46:41,926
to do that deep context and meaning,

882
00:46:42,226 --> 00:46:43,427
and use learning principle.

883
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:45,708
All right, last part.

884
00:46:46,149 --> 00:46:49,070
To truly immerse your audience beyond removing the barriers,

885
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:50,451
you need to mind the game flow,

886
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:52,433
never too easy nor too hard.

887
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:56,776
Mind the emotions, including the game feel, and motivation.

888
00:46:56,956 --> 00:46:58,437
Today I only talk about motivation,

889
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:00,978
since game studios are increasingly interested

890
00:47:00,998 --> 00:47:02,019
in motivation mechanisms.

891
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:08,123
So motivation is not only cool because you're engaged

892
00:47:08,323 --> 00:47:10,963
and you want to do something, it also helps attention.

893
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:15,825
This is, I'm from cognitive development psychology,

894
00:47:16,145 --> 00:47:20,166
and Jean Piaget is a development psychologist

895
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:23,426
who is trying to understand how children learn

896
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:28,208
and how some cognitive mechanisms come to children.

897
00:47:28,808 --> 00:47:30,968
One of these examples is how number

898
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:32,803
comes to children.

899
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:36,007
So it was using a bunch of tasks to test the kids.

900
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:41,370
One of these tasks were to put two lines of tokens.

901
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,931
One line with more tokens, but it's more compressed,

902
00:47:44,191 --> 00:47:46,771
and another line with less tokens, but more spaced out.

903
00:47:47,251 --> 00:47:52,133
And he was asking kids, so which raw has more tokens?

904
00:47:53,613 --> 00:47:55,033
Until six to seven years old,

905
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:58,474
children are actually choosing the bottom line

906
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:01,155
because they say it's longer.

907
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:04,095
So they think they have more numbers in there.

908
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:07,603
So Jean-Pierre Giraud was like, OK, kids are a bit stupid.

909
00:48:07,623 --> 00:48:09,544
I consider them 67 years old.

910
00:48:09,685 --> 00:48:11,686
They don't really have a concept of number.

911
00:48:12,627 --> 00:48:14,368
Until another psychologist called

912
00:48:14,408 --> 00:48:16,289
Mellor changed a little bit the task.

913
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,031
Instead of tokens, he used candies.

914
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:20,352
Exact same thing.

915
00:48:20,372 --> 00:48:23,234
He said to the kids, hey, there are two lines of candies.

916
00:48:24,175 --> 00:48:25,556
Which line has the more candies?

917
00:48:25,796 --> 00:48:26,376
And guess what?

918
00:48:26,396 --> 00:48:28,278
You're going to take that line for yourself.

919
00:48:29,158 --> 00:48:29,939
Surprise!

920
00:48:29,979 --> 00:48:31,500
It succeeded at two years old.

921
00:48:34,447 --> 00:48:37,348
So we learn better when we are motivated,

922
00:48:37,408 --> 00:48:38,909
because we pay attention more.

923
00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:40,950
So that's one of the main reasons

924
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,351
why it's super important to get your players motivated

925
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:47,012
into learning one of your mechanics of your game.

926
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:50,530
So, how does motivation work?

927
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,011
It's complex, of course, like anything.

928
00:48:53,512 --> 00:48:56,733
But you have explicit motivation and implicit motivation.

929
00:48:57,674 --> 00:49:01,176
Explicit motivation is you have extrinsic motivation,

930
00:49:01,236 --> 00:49:02,777
the rewards, we know about that,

931
00:49:02,977 --> 00:49:04,138
you do something, get something.

932
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,579
But you have intrinsic motivation as well.

933
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:08,420
So.

934
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:12,536
Players' engagement is typically driven by extrinsic motivation,

935
00:49:13,256 --> 00:49:16,637
but players, because players want to achieve external rewards

936
00:49:16,897 --> 00:49:19,378
and avoid the opposite, typically the absence of reward.

937
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:22,939
However, intrinsic motivation is even more powerful

938
00:49:22,979 --> 00:49:24,139
for long-term engagement.

939
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:26,220
Research seemed to indicate that games

940
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:30,381
that satisfy basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy,

941
00:49:30,461 --> 00:49:33,202
and lateness, this is a self-determination theory,

942
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:35,302
will more likely be engaging.

943
00:49:35,947 --> 00:49:41,113
So people and players are driven by an increase of their competence, a sense of progression,

944
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:45,837
autonomy, meaningful choices and self-expression, and relatedness to social aspects.

945
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:51,177
Intrinsically motivating experience are known to be deeply engaging for children and adults alike,

946
00:49:52,037 --> 00:49:56,361
as in the experience of flow in which a person loses his or her sense of time while engaged in

947
00:49:56,421 --> 00:50:02,305
activity. Rings and meals? But there's also implicit motivation, how dirty little secrets

948
00:50:02,645 --> 00:50:08,830
such as life and death drives and power seeking. You surely also have heard of the brain pleasure

949
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:14,114
centered, triggered by learning and novelty among other things, and the brain reward circuitry,

950
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:15,555
well-known by casinos.

951
00:50:16,255 --> 00:50:17,997
So you need to mind all these things.

952
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:21,099
And again, we're just scratching the surface of them.

953
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,442
But here's an example of how you can do that.

954
00:50:24,462 --> 00:50:28,465
Nintendo is super good in that you can tease the players,

955
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,088
because it's more motivating to get a meaningful reward

956
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:35,891
than just a pat on the back, or to unlock an out-of-context

957
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:36,432
achievement.

958
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:37,673
Tutorial completed.

959
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:38,353
Congrats.

960
00:50:39,074 --> 00:50:40,295
So an example of Zelda.

961
00:50:41,776 --> 00:50:44,358
This is from Phantom Hourglass on DS.

962
00:50:45,236 --> 00:50:49,198
Before even learning about the existence of a grappling hook,

963
00:50:49,558 --> 00:50:52,779
the player starts encountering these poles everywhere.

964
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,241
Sometimes you even see a pole next to a chest you cannot reach.

965
00:50:57,781 --> 00:51:02,343
And then you get the grappling hook and then you have that eureka feeling.

966
00:51:02,403 --> 00:51:04,904
Yeah, this is what the poles were for.

967
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:12,748
Now I can use that new tool to reach the chest I remember from, you know, 10 minutes ago.

968
00:51:12,928 --> 00:51:14,168
So that's really important in design.

969
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:17,047
and this is the locks and keys.

970
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:20,608
Show the locks before giving the keys.

971
00:51:21,168 --> 00:51:24,530
The locks will tease and motivate players to figure it out,

972
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:27,391
give them agency, and once they get the key,

973
00:51:27,731 --> 00:51:29,632
it will feel way more rewarding

974
00:51:29,872 --> 00:51:32,653
because it's a more meaningful and intrinsic impact.

975
00:51:35,194 --> 00:51:37,135
Here's another way you can simply tease your players.

976
00:51:37,155 --> 00:51:41,296
Let's take a look at Fortnite's HUD here.

977
00:51:41,317 --> 00:51:42,777
So that's the new HUD.

978
00:51:44,044 --> 00:51:48,634
The previous heads from a year ago, you could actually do anything on the head.

979
00:51:48,654 --> 00:51:52,983
You can place your weapons and abilities and gadgets anywhere you wanted.

980
00:51:54,265 --> 00:51:59,851
But we saw that players they were gaining a new ability or a new gadget and they were not even using it

981
00:52:00,491 --> 00:52:07,278
So like what the fuck so what the designers did they read it the HUD and they compartmented

982
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:11,382
The different elements you have so you usually don't see the the names

983
00:52:11,823 --> 00:52:13,344
It's just when you open the inventory

984
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:17,308
but you see you have one slot for harvesting tool because there's just one harvesting tool and

985
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:19,170
And you have a slot for your weapons,

986
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,152
and a slot for gadgets, and slots for abilities.

987
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:24,234
And this is where you can actually see that,

988
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:27,257
hey, there's another slot that's empty.

989
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:28,878
It means that I can get something soon.

990
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:32,001
And once you see that the slot is now full,

991
00:52:32,521 --> 00:52:36,144
you are more motivated to actually try this new gadget.

992
00:52:37,526 --> 00:52:40,668
So that's an easy way to get the players motivated,

993
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:43,411
because you can see that it's empty,

994
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:45,172
and then you see that it's full, and so you try it.

995
00:52:48,437 --> 00:52:52,886
So, to get engagement and long-term motivation, you also need depth.

996
00:52:53,878 --> 00:52:55,898
So this is an example of short-term, mid-term,

997
00:52:55,978 --> 00:52:59,079
and long-term motivation with Pokemon.

998
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:03,580
So you see that at the beginning,

999
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,701
just to win the match, that's your short-term goal,

1000
00:53:06,121 --> 00:53:07,221
catch more Pokemon.

1001
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:10,122
Then mid-term goal is gonna be to beat the next trainer

1002
00:53:10,262 --> 00:53:11,462
and to evolve your Pokemon.

1003
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,242
And you always have that long-term goal,

1004
00:53:13,302 --> 00:53:15,703
you know, get to catch them all and be the elite four.

1005
00:53:16,483 --> 00:53:18,363
So that's really important to have these,

1006
00:53:18,383 --> 00:53:20,404
to convey all this depth.

1007
00:53:21,244 --> 00:53:24,046
But the risk is you don't want it to be too complex

1008
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:25,868
and overwhelming for the player.

1009
00:53:26,888 --> 00:53:30,051
So that's a bit complicated, but you do want to show

1010
00:53:30,071 --> 00:53:31,832
the depth and the long-term goals.

1011
00:53:33,653 --> 00:53:36,115
Lastly, I'd like to do a quick declaration

1012
00:53:36,175 --> 00:53:37,456
on social impact on learning.

1013
00:53:37,696 --> 00:53:39,377
Humans are highly social creatures.

1014
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:41,499
This is how we got to survive.

1015
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:44,321
Overwhelmingly, research and education has found

1016
00:53:44,361 --> 00:53:46,643
that cooperative and collaborative learning environments

1017
00:53:46,983 --> 00:53:47,583
are optimal.

1018
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:50,848
So games in general, and multiplayer games in particular,

1019
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,209
can really benefit from social learning.

1020
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,991
But simply having a social partner is not enough though.

1021
00:53:56,372 --> 00:53:59,754
The social interaction has to be of a high enough quality

1022
00:53:59,814 --> 00:54:02,556
that it does not detract from the learning situation.

1023
00:54:03,257 --> 00:54:06,078
So a good way to do it is mentorship in games,

1024
00:54:06,138 --> 00:54:08,460
such as EVE and Team Fortress 2.

1025
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,081
So think about how you can meaningfully enable

1026
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,743
social learning in your game, or even outside of the game.

1027
00:54:13,943 --> 00:54:16,104
After all, social learning with Minecraft

1028
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:19,026
happens mainly outside of the game, on YouTube or Twitch.

1029
00:54:21,448 --> 00:54:21,588
So.

1030
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:26,198
To get to immersion, mind the emotional response,

1031
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:27,840
the complexity versus depth.

1032
00:54:28,701 --> 00:54:30,562
The main objective there is to tease the player,

1033
00:54:30,722 --> 00:54:32,023
to show the progression path,

1034
00:54:32,684 --> 00:54:34,626
and you can use motivation principles.

1035
00:54:35,286 --> 00:54:38,469
Again, sorry, I'm just going through all that very quickly,

1036
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,612
but just to give you an overall understanding of this.

1037
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:43,314
So let's wrap this up.

1038
00:54:45,206 --> 00:54:49,408
Research in science of learning suggests that there are three kinds of engagement.

1039
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:52,730
Behavioral engagement, it's like following the rules and instructions.

1040
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:58,033
So in our case, it's very close from removing the barriers to making sure the game is usable.

1041
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,855
Cognitive engagement, investment in learning.

1042
00:55:02,376 --> 00:55:07,439
active learning, and emotional engagement, affective reaction, which is at the core of motivation.

1043
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:14,062
So each type of engagement is critical for learning because they all foster staying on task, staying engaged.

1044
00:55:14,422 --> 00:55:16,403
That's why you need to keep in mind these elements.

1045
00:55:18,484 --> 00:55:23,767
As always, keep in mind also the limitations of the brain and you can use UX guidelines as a checklist.

1046
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:25,710
But this is just a checklist.

1047
00:55:26,171 --> 00:55:28,452
These are just ingredients.

1048
00:55:29,012 --> 00:55:29,912
It's not the recipe.

1049
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:31,113
I'm sorry.

1050
00:55:31,193 --> 00:55:33,614
Sadly, all this knowledge can only get you that far.

1051
00:55:34,494 --> 00:55:36,235
What we saw are ingredients again.

1052
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:37,256
It's not the recipe.

1053
00:55:37,656 --> 00:55:39,477
The recipe, this is what you're going

1054
00:55:39,497 --> 00:55:42,278
to have to figure out by tweaking the ingredients.

1055
00:55:43,058 --> 00:55:50,641
Supercell recently said in an interview that it killed 14 games before it was able to successfully launch its fourth game, Clash Royale.

1056
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:51,821
Fourteen.

1057
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:58,923
This is another example. This is showing League of Legends beta versus now.

1058
00:55:59,003 --> 00:56:02,824
You can see they had a very huge and awesome UX team there,

1059
00:56:03,144 --> 00:56:06,525
and you can see all the iteration that went through to get there.

1060
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:10,423
at least with these ingredients,

1061
00:56:11,104 --> 00:56:12,165
it's gonna save you time

1062
00:56:12,185 --> 00:56:15,808
and have the right mindset to progress

1063
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:16,930
faster through iterations.

1064
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,311
So, good luck.

1065
00:56:20,455 --> 00:56:23,597
That's it. I hope this talk was useful to you.

1066
00:56:23,617 --> 00:56:25,839
I'll post these slides on my blog, Ace AP,

1067
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:27,120
and you will find the references

1068
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,341
to all the research I was talking about as well.

1069
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:32,103
I'd like to warmly thank the Fortnite and the Paragon teams

1070
00:56:32,403 --> 00:56:34,565
for letting me show their rough design and artwork.

1071
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:37,387
A special thanks to Pete Ellis, our art director on Fortnite,

1072
00:56:37,747 --> 00:56:40,069
who I know is dying a little bit inside

1073
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:41,710
each time I'm showing early artwork.

1074
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:44,052
Yes, he lets me do it.

1075
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:48,834
A big thank you for you all for waking up early

1076
00:56:49,374 --> 00:56:52,796
and to share some UX love with me.

1077
00:56:52,816 --> 00:56:55,057
So thank you, thank you very much.
