00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:07,295
My name is Brian Francis. I am a contributing editor at gamasutra.com and at GDC.

2
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:11,800
I'm the community manager slash video person in general,

3
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:16,644
uh, who's around the office, uh, figuring out how to make things like this happen.

4
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,267
Um, it's lovely to see you all today.

5
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:21,309
I hope some of you are coming here from the Gamasutra...

6
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:27,212
channel which is where some of you may know my face and voice from. We are here

7
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:31,695
today because for the first time ever we're going to be using the GDC Twitch

8
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:37,558
channel to host conversations with game developers as we get ready for GDC 2019.

9
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,381
I think our game's coming into demand so I'm gonna turn it down just a little.

10
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:47,564
Usually, oh that's why it's loud, that's different.

11
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:54,965
Okay, fix that. Right, if you don't know what GDC is, it's the Game Developers Conference.

12
00:00:55,505 --> 00:01:00,447
I can see in chat or can recognize CliftonB as someone who I've seen replying to our social media.

13
00:01:00,607 --> 00:01:02,427
Just going to give a shout out to NovenWorks2.

14
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:07,388
We are here today with our first ever stream with a game called Return of the Obra Dinn.

15
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:11,510
This comes from developer Lucas Pope and normally I'm the person who is

16
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:14,732
Invisible in these chats so that you can see our guests face

17
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:19,334
But today our guest has opted to remain in the shadows and speak from a distance

18
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:22,836
Lucas how are you doing? I'm doing great. Hey everybody

19
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:29,459
We are here this game came out Return of the Obra Dinn came out a couple weeks ago

20
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,921
It's been in development for how many years Lucas?

21
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:34,962
four and a half from start to finish

22
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,268
four-and-a-half years and it is uh... the the is perpetually mercantile a

23
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:41,229
actually have over here

24
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:41,289
uh...

25
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:41,870
the uh...

26
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:49,778
uh... mercantile mystery i think is the phrasing on your insurance inspector

27
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:54,220
checking out the ship uh... the overdue images returned to harbor and using a

28
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,681
mysterious tool that lets you

29
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,521
uh... relive

30
00:01:58,122 --> 00:01:59,722
uh... the events of certain people's death

31
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:02,523
to find out how they died and figure out what happened uh...

32
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,785
as you can see uh... today we're playing uh... we're playing the game but we're

33
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:09,606
looking at some footage i already captured of me playing it

34
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:11,227
so what you're seeing isn't

35
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:15,791
live, so you won't be able to yell at me if I'm getting stuff wrong, but you will be able

36
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:19,155
to ask Lucas about questions about what you're seeing if you had a similar experience.

37
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:25,301
Clifton, to answer your question in chat, this is the first hour of the game, we're

38
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:29,546
only going to go for an hour, so the only spoilers will be me figuring out a few of

39
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,227
the mysteries, or maybe I got them wrong.

40
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:34,090
Maybe the spoiler is that I am bad at video games.

41
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:42,977
In chat, quick shoutouts to Elka Hao, Sesshi, oh Sesshi we had you on the channel on the

42
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,558
Gamasutra a while back, I recognize your name.

43
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:49,181
Volkiller Games, Starlight Skies, a lot of great people in chat.

44
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:54,264
We really want your questions for Lucas today because as good as my questions are, if you

45
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:59,748
are in the business of making games yourself, you should absolutely be asking Lucas what

46
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:01,509
his experience was working on Obra Dinn.

47
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:06,511
Lucas, my first question for you today, I think a lot of people have heard of you because

48
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:07,332
of Papers, Please.

49
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:12,014
How did you transition from Papers, Please to working on Return of the Obra Dinn?

50
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:15,355
Good question.

51
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:19,197
I basically wanted to do something totally different from Papers, Please.

52
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:21,078
That's generally how I move on to the next project.

53
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:24,759
It's so tired of whatever I was doing before, I want to change everything up.

54
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:28,241
And Obra Dinn, Papers, Please was kind of designed first.

55
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:34,186
Projects where I had the idea for the mechanics and this one overden was visuals for some more art focused

56
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:39,493
I wanted to make something one bit. Mm-hmm and just kind of banging on that for a while ended up with this

57
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:46,242
Setting on the ship and then after a few months the core concept of figuring out how people died

58
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:52,617
Right on. I think it's actually, I think maybe it's worth stopping there on the art focus for a moment.

59
00:03:53,838 --> 00:04:01,523
We have an old feature from gamasutra.com talking to you about the 1-bit ditherpunk, is the way we phrased it.

60
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,185
I don't know if that's entirely accurate.

61
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:10,009
What exactly is this 1-bit aesthetic? What inspired you to chase to work on a game with it?

62
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:14,111
And how does it work? Because it's really beautiful.

63
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:18,579
Thank you. Yeah, so Daedalic Punk is a great word, actually. I love that word.

64
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:26,042
And that article is the first time I heard it. It's basically me taking what I played as a kid,

65
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:30,724
which is Macintosh Plus games, which were one bit. And for the time they were actually

66
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:36,586
high resolution. It was only 512 by 342 or something crazy like that, but it's on a nine

67
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:41,989
inch screen. So it was very sharp, very striking for me as a kid. And I played a lot of games that

68
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,950
way. And I.

69
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:50,846
Specifically remember never thinking it's hard to members and not thinking something but for me I never thought I want more colors here

70
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:54,728
I to me it always looked beautiful in one bit and

71
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:55,088
so

72
00:04:55,848 --> 00:05:00,970
Papers, please had some level of art in it, but it wasn't really art focused and I like to pretend I'm an artist

73
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,153
so I thought what I want to do is take this one bit style that I played as a kid and try to

74
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:10,875
Make it legible and playable now using modern technology. So that was

75
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:14,960
the idea and then I mocked up a few things which is interesting to me is

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,801
that title screen

77
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:19,102
for the game is the first thing I ever mocked up in one bit

78
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:22,683
in Photoshop. It's also the first thing that I made in Unity

79
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:25,784
and it didn't change for the entire four and a half years

80
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:29,066
so that basically once I got that working it taught me that

81
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:33,007
it was possible and it could look cool and that sent me four years down the line.

82
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:41,656
Nice. I think when I was doing some research for this game I found some great gifs about how you were trying to make this work for the ship itself.

83
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:48,057
We're looking now on screen at some really good people model, the architecture of the ship itself.

84
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:57,399
What's the process for starting at, it has to be a 1-bit ship, and making sure that these people, these objects are still legible.

85
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,420
Because you can kind of see a difference between the people and the gun.

86
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,381
Like the captain here, I guess it's a spoiler that he's the captain.

87
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:09,265
So careful about that. Literally everyone's identity on the stream is a spoiler, so if you're sensitive...

88
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:13,928
But yeah, the gun he's holding there is obviously very different from his own model himself.

89
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,770
What's... what's... what's... how come?

90
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:23,155
Yeah, okay, so the first thing I did was I played some old actual Mac first-person games,

91
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:25,257
and the best one that I could find was something called Colony.

92
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:30,361
And it's a very low-poly, just-the-walls kind of thing.

93
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:37,760
One of the things from playing that game and also playing some modern 1-bit games where they just take the render and they dither it.

94
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,503
And it looks cool, but you can't see what's going on. You can't see anything.

95
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:45,726
So in these modern games, in the colony you can see everything very clearly.

96
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:48,088
And I decided that everything is going to have an outline.

97
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,290
So geometric shapes are going to be outlined.

98
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,414
And if it's against white, they'll have a black outline. If it's against black, they'll have a white outline.

99
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:55,815
So there's always an inverse and there's always...

100
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,520
the shapes and geometry are always clear to see.

101
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,401
And the thing about that is that it removes any

102
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:05,942
mystery about where you are or the environment. Everything is perfectly

103
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:10,643
defined basically. Which was fine because I wasn't making a horror game so I

104
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:12,984
didn't want to hide things in the player. It was okay that everything was

105
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:16,845
was you could tell where you were at all times. It's kind of what I was going for.

106
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:20,266
So that's that that was on the surface a simple

107
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:23,347
thing that like how can I make this work? Okay everything is outlined.

108
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:25,348
But as the

109
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:32,935
the kind of production progress, the bigger problem became comfort, viewing comfort.

110
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:37,399
Because everything, you've only got two colors to work with and you need to make shades out

111
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,380
of those using dithering.

112
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:43,184
But dithering is not a technology that you want to use in a moving picture basically,

113
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:46,928
because it gives you a headache more or less.

114
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:49,230
There's too many flashing pixels, high contrast pixels.

115
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:55,979
The real magic for me in making this work was solving that dithering problem and figuring

116
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:01,883
out how to make it so people could play a four-hour game without getting massively uncomfortable.

117
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:03,884
Right on.

118
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:08,367
What were the first, you said it's uncomfortable to look at, what were the first solutions

119
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,630
that worked in terms of getting people, like in terms of lowering discomfort?

120
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,132
Which is, I don't think, usually I'm asking developers about that when we're in VR, but

121
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:19,534
I haven't asked a developer about that in conventional games in some time.

122
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,761
Yeah, the first solution is just to increase the resolution.

123
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:26,324
So your pixels are smaller, so that when you dither, your eyes

124
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:29,726
fold more into thinking it's a tone instead of just a bunch of

125
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:34,630
dots. But one of the other like, I want it to be one bit, but I

126
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,832
also want it to be low resolution. And that was partly

127
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:39,674
because of production, it makes it easier to create this thing

128
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:40,814
when it's not super high res.

129
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:47,024
But also, I just like that style more. I like the lower resolution. I like trying to do more with less pixels.

130
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:50,945
So when I decided I couldn't raise the resolution to solve that,

131
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:55,047
I put off the problem for a long time, a couple years.

132
00:08:55,568 --> 00:09:00,230
And then finally when I started, I had enough to sort of sit down and play a lot of it full screen in front of me.

133
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,911
I changed the dither pattern basically.

134
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:08,754
So it wasn't trying to be shade so much as it was trying to be kind of a woodcut,

135
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:10,715
more patterned style.

136
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,357
Which worked okay. It worked fine to me. It looked okay.

137
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:19,258
But in the TIGSource devlog, which I kept for the game, nobody else liked it. Everybody hated it.

138
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:28,680
So I kind of went back to the drawing board and devised a dithering technique that keeps the dither sort of fixed when you're looking around.

139
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,001
So when you turn your head, the dither pattern is not sort of sliding across as you would expect. It's moving with the scene.

140
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,122
And that took a lot of time to get right.

141
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:40,083
And in the end, you don't really notice it.

142
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:40,843
Except that...

143
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:45,385
My hope is that you don't get sick as much as you would have with the other one.

144
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:49,728
I'm not saying I fixed everything, but it makes it much more comfortable to look at

145
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:51,028
when you're just standing there looking around.

146
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:52,730
Right on.

147
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:59,294
Moving on from the art, although if folks in questions have chat, feel free to...

148
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:12,486
Feel free to ask them. Clifton points out that NUendo Studios talks about how the 1-bit graphics of Obra Dinn are sort of different than the 1-bit graphics of the Macintosh games.

149
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:24,557
My next question is going to be about that process of moving from this art style into the design of the game. Because it's interesting to hear about you going from design first to art first.

150
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:26,939
After you had the art style...

151
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,162
what was your process for figuring out the like what was what was fun about

152
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:35,504
this style like what where did the where did the design interaction come from

153
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:41,687
uh originally i had big plans for this game that you would actually go back in time and you would

154
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:48,170
relive the death but everything was moving you'd have to replay how they died so there was this

155
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,772
idea that you go back in time someone's got to die it's either going to be you or the person

156
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:57,035
that you're sort of embodying anyways that was way too much work nothing i could do

157
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:05,082
But once I started getting this rendering technique down and started getting some visuals up and some characters on screen, I realized it looks good just as it is.

158
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,525
If you could walk around a still scene, that would look good.

159
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:15,072
So the idea sort of changed to be, just go back and hear the audio and then see the frozen scene.

160
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:18,255
And that took me through the initial demo.

161
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:21,258
I think there were four people in the initial demo for this in 2014.

162
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,692
And that was easy. Whatever dialogue or characters or text I wrote then was with nothing else in mind.

163
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,792
I didn't have any of the story written at that time. Just kind of,

164
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:35,373
okay, these guys will be fighting over something and the captain ends up killing a bunch of them or whatever.

165
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:39,974
That worked for the progress I'd made at that time.

166
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:45,495
And I kind of stuck with this idea that the game would be about figuring out how people died.

167
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:47,276
I stuck with that for a long time.

168
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:53,589
until I realized that's not hard to tell usually. You can usually see how people die pretty

169
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:59,193
easily. Like this guy. Yeah, I mean he's getting hit by somebody so not much challenge there.

170
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:04,936
But it wasn't until I kind of had a lot more of the game done that I realized the real

171
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:09,619
fun part would be figuring out who they are. That would lead into ways I can create clues

172
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:14,682
in the environment and have the player kind of work out a clue-like or a Moriarty-like

173
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:17,444
puzzle, like this old game, kind of logic puzzle to figure out who people are.

174
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:22,645
that design shifted. That shift happened kind of late, I want to say, because

175
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:29,731
working out the narrative structure for this game was pretty tough. You can only tell the story when

176
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:35,395
somebody dies, first off, and then I also needed to have this kind of almost unbroken chain of bodies

177
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:41,820
going back through time, which, you know, probably isn't that normal. And so I decided to break it

178
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,924
up into chapters or disasters and then lay everything out like that. That structure was

179
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:47,305
extremely difficult to figure out.

180
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,515
which tied my hands a bit because I might have changed design in a different way if

181
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:55,557
I hadn't gone and put all that work into the story.

182
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:59,480
But once I put all the work into the story, I was stuck with it and I had to figure out

183
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,201
a way to make it work.

184
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:07,086
And that way was basically the book and focusing more on the identities than the means of death.

185
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,368
That's really interesting.

186
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:12,811
So kind of the order is art, revisiting a death.

187
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:21,194
Figuring out who the people are who died not how they died although as you can see how they died is still part of it

188
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:26,997
And then segmenting and splintering the stories, and I just want to point out for everyone at home

189
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:30,338
I'm about just I think I'm about to know I didn't wind up scrolling through the whole list

190
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:37,321
But um it's 60 plus people right on the boat. That's 60 plus bodies. Yeah, and that's a case where it's a lot

191
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:40,683
Yeah, when I decided that it's gonna be on a ship because I thought that would be easy

192
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:44,145
I can model a ship four decks of the ship no problem. That was my first

193
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:45,583
Big mistake on the game.

194
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:49,705
But once I decided that, I did a lot of research on these ships, and I started building the ship.

195
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:55,769
And then, I don't know why, but I looked at the number of the people that you would need to

196
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,452
sail one of these ships, and it was maybe 120 people, 200 people.

197
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:06,476
And obviously I knew, okay, I'm smart enough, I can't do 120 people, but maybe I could do 80.

198
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:08,418
So my first number was 80 people.

199
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:13,221
And then when I actually made all the characters, I realized, damn, the most I can do is 60.

200
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:16,392
I'm going crazy doing his characters, so I'll stop at 60.

201
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,314
But this was all before I'd worked out the story.

202
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:25,656
So if I'd worked out the story first, there'd be 12 people on the tiny sailboat, basically.

203
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:29,858
But because I worked on the ship and the reality of what you would need to sail these ships,

204
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:34,200
I started super high, and I felt like every time I cut it down, I was going to compromise

205
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,582
the game, not realizing that I was still going to kill myself to try to finish 60 people.

206
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:46,666
I'm gonna have questions about quote-unquote killing yourself later on because you know production quality of life

207
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:48,347
These are things that developers are talking about

208
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:50,087
2018 but

209
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:52,248
Just to keep us roughly on track here

210
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:55,789
so I had another game developer on the stream once tell me that the difference between

211
00:14:56,109 --> 00:15:00,390
Like the thing that I thought about especially when it comes to like the number of factors in making a game is

212
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,871
difference from zero to one is shorter than the distance from one to two

213
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:06,132
Um...

214
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:07,393
Uh...

215
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,335
And I guess I'm curious, every time, I mean...

216
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:13,078
You started off with 80 and then dropped down to 60.

217
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:17,361
How much does one character, like, increase the load, I guess?

218
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:20,143
Like, do you know roughly how, from a dev standpoint,

219
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:23,786
how much time that cutting those 20 people shaved off?

220
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:26,769
Uh, no, I couldn't say that.

221
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:29,291
Actually making the characters themselves is not hard.

222
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:34,795
The hard part is weaving that into a story that I felt wouldn't start dragging or...

223
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:35,276
Mm-hmm.

224
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:40,125
having too much for the player to worry about I mean at that point when I chose

225
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,286
60 I was awesome by the way sorry real just the scene right here when this pops

226
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:50,669
up this is incredible thank you yeah but continue at that time I wasn't I don't

227
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:54,950
know I wasn't thinking about much of arranging the story or the players

228
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,731
experience or anything I was just thinking about I need a bunch of people

229
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:02,053
for the ship and I'll figure out the rest later and I I had the manifest

230
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:02,333
still

231
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:05,592
And that's all I had, it was just a list of the names.

232
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:09,215
So the project kind of scaled at different times.

233
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:12,258
At some point, this doesn't scale, so I gotta scale it up.

234
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:14,139
And then I move over to some other thing,

235
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:15,741
and that doesn't scale, so I gotta scale it up.

236
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:17,122
And they all kind of scale in different ways

237
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:21,125
without really changing the other elements of the game,

238
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:22,326
because I didn't want to remake them.

239
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:24,528
Or I felt like I could still do something good with them,

240
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,490
so keep those and scale this guy up.

241
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,492
And that comment about zero to one and one to two,

242
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,355
for me, was absolutely true for the beginning of the game.

243
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:35,826
because I created the demo in just a few months, the initial demo,

244
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:39,329
but everything that I had for that demo did not scale.

245
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,252
So the fact that there are four characters there, I was already pushing

246
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,534
up against all the pipeline and tools, custom things I created to make those

247
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:48,437
four guys. So that there was no way that the tools and

248
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:51,519
the systems I had would scale up to 60 people. So

249
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,182
that added almost another year of scaling up to the point where I could

250
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,465
make the full game from the demo. And this is true of every game I've ever

251
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:00,987
worked on. If you look at like the first prototype of anything...

252
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:06,024
it's hard to imagine how much time it took to go from that to the final thing

253
00:17:06,064 --> 00:17:09,286
because in a lot of cases it looks just like the final game with some small

254
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:09,746
differences

255
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:13,748
but in most cases you had to change everything about your production and the

256
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:17,090
way you made the game in order to get from that first initial thing to the end

257
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:21,992
right on uh... i i could

258
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:26,894
kinda i want to uh... i guess i want to lean into

259
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:29,216
you know having now like from papers please

260
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:36,528
What is your guiding star when you have a cool idea, you begin working on the idea,

261
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:40,171
you work on the demo, the prototype, and you think you have these sets of tools that will

262
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,051
get you through the whole game.

263
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:48,336
What's your guiding star when moving between demo to full game, or proof of concept to

264
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:51,739
full game that you think other indie developers could learn from?

265
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,625
For me, it was potential. So once I had made the demo, if I feel there's potential there,

266
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:02,008
and if other people who play it feel there's potential there, it doesn't matter if I can

267
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:07,193
reach that or if I have any idea how to reach it. If it has potential, then it's enough.

268
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:10,295
Because that's enough for me to get thinking about it more.

269
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:10,716
So...

270
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:13,814
When I transitioned from Papers, Please to Obertin,

271
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:15,695
during the development of Papers, Please,

272
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:17,416
I had collected a lot of game ideas.

273
00:18:17,456 --> 00:18:18,917
I'm always writing down kind of game ideas

274
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:20,718
in a notebook somewhere or something,

275
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:22,659
just like quick, one-off ideas

276
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,120
of something that could become a game.

277
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,101
And the ones that I think about the most

278
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,082
are the ones that I work on next.

279
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,702
So even though there's lots of ideas there,

280
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,184
some of them, even without checking a notebook,

281
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:33,444
they keep coming back in my mind

282
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:34,245
and I'm thinking about them.

283
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,306
So that becomes the next game I work on.

284
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,307
And it was the case with this demo that,

285
00:18:40,514 --> 00:18:45,317
If I release a demo, people enjoy it and they think it has a lot of potential and I keep thinking about it.

286
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:50,081
I keep working through my mind what that potential could be or how it could be executed.

287
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:52,803
Then that's it. That's good for me.

288
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:58,127
Nice. I guess, let me go really quick while I'm going through my question bucket.

289
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,849
I'm going to remind chat that you can ask questions too.

290
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,091
And especially if you are working on a game of your own, please ask them.

291
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:12,835
My game working experience is... I've got some, but it's not as much as I'm sure some of you folks at home have.

292
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:18,317
And we'd love to ask them for you. That's what GDC and Gamasutra are all about.

293
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:26,401
Which, I guess I should... I guess I need to give the obligatory that GDC and Gamasutra are both owned by the same parent organization, blah blah blah.

294
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:40,998
One question that comes from my good colleague Alex Walro, who's normally with me when we're doing these streams, but is sadly not with us today, because the hour is late here in California.

295
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:53,945
What has proven interesting about the plebeian and the mundane in your design? You've now made a game about an insurance agent, you've made a game about a border agent, newspaper editors.

296
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:59,128
Why do these genres catch your attention and what do you think...

297
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:04,843
What do you think it takes to translate the boring into the interesting for game design?

298
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:14,368
For the first question, when it comes to design, I'm a big fan of rigid core mechanics.

299
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:19,210
So something very basic and simple that you're doing, and you're kind of filling out a matrix

300
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,952
of features or a list of identities.

301
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:24,513
Something simple and core.

302
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:27,574
Just as a kind of...

303
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,465
slightly OCD engineer, I like that.

304
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:34,485
So that's where I come from on the design side.

305
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:38,766
On the other side, I really like taking those things

306
00:20:39,086 --> 00:20:41,226
and making something interesting out of them, story-wise.

307
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:43,407
You know, there are people around the world

308
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,147
who do all kinds of jobs, all the time.

309
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,448
And many of those jobs are boring and mundane,

310
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:50,408
but those people have interesting lives to me.

311
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:53,689
So I like trying to capture the interesting parts

312
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:56,129
of a mundane experience.

313
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:56,689
And that's...

314
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:01,107
that works really well when you like mundane mechanics because the two of them

315
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:03,889
go together those two interests go together really well so that's kind of

316
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,893
what directs me to pick an idea and to develop it and then evolve it into a full game

317
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:15,898
and then the second part of that question was um uh or maybe you explained it was sort of

318
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:22,082
what is your mindset about taking those mundane parts or the the interesting parts of mundane

319
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:24,524
things and making them playable

320
00:21:26,615 --> 00:21:27,856
There's a nice challenge there, I guess.

321
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:32,458
In every project I do, I approach it like an engineer.

322
00:21:33,098 --> 00:21:36,139
So, as if there's a problem that needs to be solved.

323
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,380
So if there's no problem, then I'm not that interested.

324
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,322
But if there's a problem, if there's some restriction or some limitation,

325
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:42,462
then I'm interested suddenly.

326
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:44,083
That's why I have one bit.

327
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:46,124
That's why I have simple mechanics that you wouldn't expect

328
00:21:47,364 --> 00:21:48,285
to build a story out of.

329
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,425
I try to do exactly that.

330
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:52,446
Just because solving those problems are the most interesting

331
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:54,027
and fun parts of game development for me.

332
00:21:55,022 --> 00:22:07,948
Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I guess like it wouldn't, um, under that philosophy, it makes more sense to make games like this as opposed to games, you know, as opposed to like a very polished 2D side-scroller that, uh, that can do well on PS4, I guess.

333
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:16,952
Yeah, I wouldn't know how to make that kind of game, because I don't, I don't understand the problems that, yeah, I don't see the problems that would be fun to solve there, basically.

334
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:25,278
Right. Not to slam... my comment isn't to slam that genre of game, of course, because I really love those kind of games.

335
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:30,583
Like Owlboy is one of my favorites, for instance. But that was just a comparison.

336
00:22:31,904 --> 00:22:34,246
I have more questions, but we're going to give chat a shot.

337
00:22:34,326 --> 00:22:37,029
Starlight Skies says they work at IndieCade.

338
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:43,391
And they would like to know how much feedback from going to events has helped you out.

339
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:48,813
I would layer that question with how do you organize your event feedback so that it's useful,

340
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:54,475
and how do you make sure you're getting good feedback and not feedback from someone who would never buy the game in real life,

341
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:55,355
but they just happen to be there.

342
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:56,796
Oh, right, this scene.

343
00:22:58,696 --> 00:23:02,698
First off, HiStar. We've met a couple times at different events.

344
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:05,398
So, that's a good question.

345
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,219
I live in the middle of nowhere.

346
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:12,470
I was telling you earlier, and I don't see anybody basically related to games for most

347
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:12,910
of the time.

348
00:23:13,651 --> 00:23:20,136
So, I have an online presence, but physically I don't meet a lot of game developers or players

349
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:20,356
even.

350
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:24,180
So, events for me are mostly about getting feedback.

351
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,802
I don't publicize that much when I go to an event.

352
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,743
I don't do any marketing or anything.

353
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:30,125
I set up a booth and I try to watch people play the game.

354
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:32,026
And so, for me, that's critical.

355
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,708
And that's not necessarily perfect.

356
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:41,273
Showing a game at an event is very different than watching someone play it alone in their room or something like that.

357
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:46,318
But, it's for me a good way to gauge what's...

358
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:49,260
It's a good way to compare it against other games.

359
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,484
It's kind of a, are people playing this game compared to some other games?

360
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:56,366
In isolation it's not that useful, except if somebody gets stuck.

361
00:23:56,886 --> 00:23:59,108
If everybody's getting stuck somewhere, okay I need to change this.

362
00:23:59,268 --> 00:24:02,491
Or if everybody's confused about something, then I feel like okay I need to change that.

363
00:24:03,732 --> 00:24:04,353
But it's more...

364
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:08,488
how many people are playing this game, how many people are interested, how many people come over to check it out,

365
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:13,989
because it's surrounded by other way cooler games and lots of people playing lots of different stuff.

366
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:21,771
So to me, the value of an event is mostly in just determining how it fits with other games.

367
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:27,113
And as far as organizing that feedback, I don't really.

368
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,593
It's whatever kind of bubbles to the top.

369
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:34,568
is what I think about and think of fixing. I'll write down some things usually if people are

370
00:24:34,588 --> 00:24:41,030
getting stuck somewhere, but it's more kind of the general feeling of how it's going and how

371
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,951
the game is doing and what people think of it. And this ties in, this is kind of a general philosophy

372
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:54,353
of mine where I used to make games, I made a game for iOS called Helsing's Fire and back then, this

373
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:55,613
was in 2010 or something,

374
00:24:56,304 --> 00:25:01,605
Back then it was really important to get analytics to record what everybody was doing, how far

375
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:05,586
they got, basically all this information that lets you design a better game.

376
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:10,287
And so I recorded a ton of analytics for everybody who played this game and I never looked at

377
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:10,427
them.

378
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:15,267
So after that incident where I put all this work into collecting information but never

379
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:19,148
actually looking at it, because I was, I'm always on to the next thing, I don't really

380
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:22,829
want to make a Hellsing's Fire 2 and to improve and to fix everything, I just want to do something

381
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:23,329
totally different.

382
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:23,969
So.

383
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:29,007
I kind of got into the situation where I'm not going to really...

384
00:25:30,588 --> 00:25:34,569
I'm not going to do the analytic thing, basically, which a lot of people do for design.

385
00:25:34,629 --> 00:25:38,670
I'm just going to try to hear the problems, understand the problems, and fix them as they

386
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:38,990
come up.

387
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,731
And if I don't hear it, then I never fix it, you know, which is kind of the downside of

388
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:44,231
that whole thing.

389
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:49,293
But so far, it's worked out okay, and it will probably crash and burn for the next one.

390
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:57,760
Uh, once again, I hate to feel like I'm just overly praising, but that was like the way these

391
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:03,102
scenes start, like the really striking images that you bash into. Holy crap, cow, like playing this

392
00:26:03,122 --> 00:26:06,484
game, this experience that we're playing right here, you can see me just freeze and just stare

393
00:26:06,504 --> 00:26:11,327
at it a minute before and sinking it in before like actually starting to move around. Cool.

394
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:15,729
That was one of the things that, yeah, about the very first demo that told me that this could work.

395
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:19,611
The way that the basic structure of hearing the audio.

396
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,793
and then slamming into the 3D scene with the music at the same time, I felt, okay, I could

397
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:27,255
do some cool stuff with that from the very beginning.

398
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:33,379
Clifton B would like to know, is the Memento Mortum at all inspired by the memory amulet

399
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,260
from Myst IV?

400
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:37,262
I never played Myst, actually.

401
00:26:37,382 --> 00:26:37,622
Fair.

402
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,223
So, no.

403
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:46,568
It's a game that I wanted to play for a long time, but there's this thing where if you

404
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:49,170
miss a game when it first comes out, you almost never go back to it.

405
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,001
That was my case with Myst, unfortunately I never played it.

406
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:53,021
Um...

407
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:59,044
I guess that loosely wanders us over to game marketing,

408
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:03,865
because I assume, you know, it's very important for you to get Obra Dinn in people's hands now,

409
00:27:04,365 --> 00:27:10,488
because later there will be, you know, Red Dead Redemption 3 or whatever, and not Obra Dinn.

410
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:17,774
How much time and energy did you spend on game marketing?

411
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:21,316
Since you said you didn't use events to market, you used them primarily for feedback.

412
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:27,500
And how did you set a sales expectation that you knew could keep you fed so that you could

413
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,741
work on making Papers, Please 2, Electric Boogaloo?

414
00:27:33,783 --> 00:27:34,243
Let's see.

415
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:40,487
I didn't...

416
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:43,608
Papers, Please... so first off...

417
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:48,770
I'm not the marketing kind of guy. I didn't market Papers, Please at all and that was a huge success.

418
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:55,075
So, already I'm being trained that marketing is not critical to selling your game and to having people play it.

419
00:27:56,936 --> 00:28:00,619
And Papers, Please sold really well and it still sells well.

420
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:07,004
And so, there was no real pressure on me over DIN to say I gotta market this thing and it's gotta sell a lot.

421
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:13,389
And so I didn't. And I kept the devlog because I like to talk about the stuff I'm working on.

422
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:19,232
when I work on different stuff in the game, when I finish something, it's cathartic for me to write a devlog post about it.

423
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:22,254
So it feels good and I like sharing that information.

424
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:28,638
So the devlog is really the only thing that I did that I would consider marketing, even though for me

425
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:31,340
it was a more of an engineering thing than it was a marketing thing.

426
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:33,701
And

427
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:37,124
Obra Dinn for me,

428
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:42,307
so I had Papers, Please and it was selling well, and it's kind of the only game I've made that sold really well.

429
00:28:43,383 --> 00:28:47,604
But it's still selling well now. And so that tells me that if I can make the right kind of game,

430
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:50,605
then it's not something that needs to sell in the first three months only.

431
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:53,325
And then I don't need to make all my money at the beginning,

432
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:58,986
and I don't need to push this really hard to get it to sell or to make a return on it.

433
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:04,727
And so for Obra Dinn, I focus more on how can I make this game different enough from other games?

434
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:07,608
And Papers, Please is sort of like this too.

435
00:29:07,648 --> 00:29:10,488
Make it different enough from other games that if you want this kind of game,

436
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:15,890
you pretty much just got to buy this one game. If you want a game where you check passports,

437
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:19,673
you got, there's one game on the market that's like that and it's Papers, Please.

438
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:26,479
So if you want a one-bit mystery game based on deduction, you know, or whatever kind of category

439
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:31,003
I wanted to put this in, if you want that, then you got, I mean, there's Overden and there's maybe

440
00:29:31,043 --> 00:29:35,006
a few others, but really, like, I'm not competing with tons of different titles all the time that

441
00:29:35,026 --> 00:29:40,150
they're coming out every month. So the urgency of selling immediately and of doing the typical big

442
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,071
marketing push with.

443
00:29:41,534 --> 00:29:48,738
influencers and and whatever they do these days what was what was never really there for me from you know from internally it wasn't there

444
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:51,800
from my own personal satisfaction, and then I felt like

445
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:57,624
The way I was making the game over these years also didn't require that kind of that kind of push

446
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:00,966
right on I

447
00:30:01,187 --> 00:30:03,968
Think that's a very valid answer

448
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:08,111
Poor unfortunately for poor sky yes guys like no I do marketing so ouch

449
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:18,674
It's, it's, um, I, I, I guess that I have, I wanna, I guess I'll, Astrodongs, which is quite a name,

450
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:24,497
um, just wants to say, uh, thanks for one of their favorite game experiences in years, so, uh, and it

451
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:28,560
felt like a game catered to their particular interests, which kinda speaks to what you talked

452
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,502
about of, like, making something that will appeal to, uh,

453
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:37,626
Someone and trusting that there are multiple someone's out there. I guess that's a lot of what you said today

454
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,808
Yeah, it's oh that someone has always been me first

455
00:30:40,848 --> 00:30:41,028
Yeah

456
00:30:41,068 --> 00:30:45,832
I try to make the game that I because I I do play a lot of triple-a games and I love triple-a games and I

457
00:30:45,872 --> 00:30:52,156
Play all that stuff, but I I also really like these kind of very mechanical games that I make so

458
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:56,740
I'm always thinking okay. I would like this kind of game and I hope other people do too

459
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,261
And that's that was kind of a distant wish

460
00:30:59,949 --> 00:31:02,770
Originally, but since paper is please I realized well, okay

461
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,311
There are enough people out there who like the same kinds of things that I do that will

462
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:12,193
That will buy the games basically that will enjoy them just a fair warning for folks at home Liam has entered the room

463
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:16,194
Liam do you want to say hi?

464
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:16,734
Liam?

465
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:18,435
Everyone can actually say hi to Liam for once

466
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:24,597
He's here. He's yelling. He has opinions. You may hear him any questions any questions for the cat?

467
00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:28,319
I as a quick follow-up

468
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:33,478
It's interesting that you talk about how having there's only one passport checking game on the market

469
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,079
I guess there's two now because I don't know I don't know there might be more

470
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:42,280
I guess maybe a bunch of other people jumped on the papers. Please train that you built, but um for sure we streamed

471
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,320
Um not tonight

472
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,121
Forgetting the developer name, but it was published by normal robots

473
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:50,902
Which disclosure my boss Simon helps them out?

474
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:57,143
We gotta do a lot of disclaimers on this show. We're just trying to you know keep no Liam. Don't you that I need that controller

475
00:31:58,891 --> 00:31:59,592
Please don't chew that.

476
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:00,692
Hang on.

477
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:02,414
Come here.

478
00:32:03,274 --> 00:32:04,435
Okay, you're joining the stream now.

479
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:04,916
Okay.

480
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:09,619
Um, was there ever, this is something a couple other indies have been worried about now for

481
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,020
a couple years, like Donut County.

482
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:17,325
Was there ever any worry about, uh, about another debt, another company swooping in

483
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:20,688
and like also doing the one bit thing or also doing the detective thing?

484
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,050
Hmm, no.

485
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:23,350
No.

486
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:23,450
Okay.

487
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,090
I mean, I, I, yeah.

488
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,612
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

489
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:29,829
I for not tonight for example I mean I'm happy to see that kind of game I'm

490
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:32,930
happy to see all the games that were based yeah and I you know I wish them

491
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,672
all the best and to be clear I'm not accusing not tonight of stealing your

492
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:40,534
style I'm just like yeah right they aren't and you know when I said the only

493
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:43,856
passport came out there I'm speaking of when I started over Dan and what you

494
00:32:43,876 --> 00:32:47,298
know for the last couple years there are other games like it now but originally

495
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:49,799
if you wanted that kind of game you had to buy papers please so I get a couple

496
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:54,001
years of you know the only option out there which is what I was hoping for

497
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:56,382
over Dan and so if other people make one bit

498
00:32:56,998 --> 00:33:01,742
games or detect the games totally fine I I will probably just do something totally

499
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:06,747
different next time anyway so I'm not competing with them or myself or anything like that later

500
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:16,356
so I personally I I have no problem with that and on sort of another level I when I make a game

501
00:33:17,377 --> 00:33:20,600
I don't necessarily think about how hard it would make how hard it'd be for someone else

502
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,402
to make this game but I do think about

503
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:28,165
what other games could be transformed into this game and how hard would that be?

504
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:32,928
And I'm not aiming for something totally different because I'm always thinking

505
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:37,190
I don't want to compete with other people. I'm sort of always thinking how can I do this

506
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:41,633
thing differently than someone else would do it and that puts gives me a little bit more of a

507
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:48,717
buffer between my games and other games I think as well. Right on. I'm gonna I'm gonna quickly

508
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:53,420
check. Thank you all in chat for your love for Liam. He appreciates it. He's a sad boy.

509
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:59,264
ElCalho would like to know how experienced were you in Unity when you started development

510
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:02,165
and how much of the game's development time was spent learning Unity?

511
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:05,667
Unity I'd never used before this game.

512
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:08,468
Like I said, the title screen was the first thing I ever made in Unity.

513
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:14,591
I have written my own engines though, C++ engines, and I've been a programmer for a

514
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:18,873
long time in games, so picking up and using Unity was actually very quick.

515
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:25,629
And that quickness and speed with which I made the title screen convinced me that Unity was definitely the way to go for this project.

516
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:26,630
And

517
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,751
Based on my experience of making tools for AAA games and

518
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:36,132
Kind of working with lots of really good engines over time is that Unity is amazing

519
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:37,032
and

520
00:34:37,612 --> 00:34:40,193
especially for me on the editor side the fact that you can

521
00:34:40,993 --> 00:34:45,014
Add features to the editor and change things and then just alt tab back to the editor and in one second

522
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:47,475
It's compiled and updated and you can now use your new tools

523
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:54,607
was a revelation, and so learning Unity was easy because a lot of people use it, and then

524
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:57,828
using it was basically what allowed me to make this game.

525
00:34:58,028 --> 00:35:00,989
Even if we talk about how long it took, it wasn't because of Unity.

526
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:06,370
Unity shaved a lot of time off this game, and a lot of energy and effort was saved by

527
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,731
using Unity basically, and I'm extremely happy with it.

528
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:24,357
Right on. We're moving on to the next subject of conversation. I want to follow up. You did say that you had to put a lot of work into making these 60 characters happen at the top of the stream.

529
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:39,107
2018 and 2017 have been years where developers have talked a lot about crunch, they've talked a lot about overwork. I think it's interesting in that the reason I think these two years of discussion have been particularly notable is that

530
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:43,329
It seems like a two years where a lot of developers big and small are trying to make concentrated

531
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:48,291
efforts to say it does not take 100 hour work weeks to make interesting video games.

532
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:51,772
Like they're trying to unhinge causation and correlation there.

533
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:59,316
What was your work-life balance like working on Obra Dinn, and did you learn anything from

534
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:03,597
your previous games that helped you take it easier on this project, make right decisions

535
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:07,419
about working long hours? What was your experience?

536
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:18,008
Well, I worked a lot on this game. One of the problems with this game is that when I started it, I thought it would take me 3-6 months to finish.

537
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:20,770
Well, that escalated quick.

538
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:27,816
Yeah, unrealistically quick. I'm extremely bad at judging deadlines like that, or judging progress.

539
00:36:28,676 --> 00:36:33,920
So, imagine at 6 months, I'm basically crunching for a while to meet that first deadline.

540
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:39,164
I sailed past that, and things cooled down a little bit. But then I say, okay, I just need another 6 months.

541
00:36:39,704 --> 00:36:43,026
and then we're good. So the next six months I'm crunching again for a month

542
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:46,628
to try to hit that deadline and I miss it. So things cool down again.

543
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:52,832
And imagine that repeated for four years. So I crunched a lot on this game and I

544
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:56,154
worked a lot on this. So this is unfortunately not a poster for

545
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:02,518
for easy work. You know it's one person did everything, all the modeling,

546
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:03,698
design, programming.

547
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:08,537
Anytime that I got tired of doing one thing, I could switch to the other thing conveniently.

548
00:37:08,777 --> 00:37:16,102
Right? It's great. I could keep working all the time. But the unusual thing here is that it worked

549
00:37:16,142 --> 00:37:22,726
for me. I love to work. It was only near the very end of the project when I could see that the game

550
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:27,529
was pretty much close to done and just needed some little extra work to finish or some final

551
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:33,233
polish or some play testing. That's when it got really hard. But every other time, I loved working

552
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:34,373
on the game. And I worked.

553
00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:38,289
that was, you know, I define my own schedule, so because I love working on the game

554
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,312
I wanted to work on a lot. And then there was this other issue for me

555
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:46,575
personally, of this is my follow-up game after Papers, Please, which won some awards

556
00:37:46,615 --> 00:37:47,055
and everybody

557
00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:50,598
enjoyed it, so how am I gonna follow that up

558
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:54,601
basically, so that I can't just like quickly release some

559
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:58,103
some game I'm not happy with, I need to make it something that I like and I hope

560
00:37:58,163 --> 00:37:59,164
other people will like, and that's

561
00:37:59,604 --> 00:38:02,306
that ends up taking a little bit longer, I'll tell you.

562
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:08,870
Yeah, I think the only sort of bright side of that is that I define the schedule.

563
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,971
I'm the one who decided I'm going to work all these hours.

564
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:16,614
Personally, I work at home, so I could spend time with my family.

565
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,415
I wasn't leaving them behind all the time.

566
00:38:18,455 --> 00:38:21,816
I could still just pop downstairs or into the next room and spend some time with them.

567
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:26,498
So these long work hours for me were something that worked.

568
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:30,220
It was something that I didn't regret in the end.

569
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,441
I think they were important to making the game, even in four years.

570
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:36,488
uh... even though i made different parts of the game

571
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:40,132
well many times over and cut many things and threw a lot of stuff out i feel like

572
00:38:40,272 --> 00:38:40,352
it

573
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:42,515
generally worked okay for me

574
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:46,500
i have some regrets about working that much but

575
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,281
because

576
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:49,623
i am at home working at home

577
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:53,856
A lot of that stuff is just not as bad as it could have been if I had to go to office

578
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:54,156
somewhere.

579
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:57,079
I guess I was going to follow up what you sort of answered in there.

580
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:03,584
I guess there is a palpable difference between working at home and crunching for yourself

581
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:08,088
versus going to an office and crunching on a larger company's behalf.

582
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:08,849
Yeah.

583
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,250
I mean you can imagine like a hobby.

584
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,871
Imagine you have some hobby you really like.

585
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:12,311
Yeah.

586
00:39:12,632 --> 00:39:13,853
You just do that all the time.

587
00:39:14,373 --> 00:39:15,254
You're not killing yourself.

588
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,536
I mean it's hard physically as you get older.

589
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:20,688
you still enjoy what you're doing and that's kind of always my situation.

590
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:21,349
Yeah.

591
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:22,330
Um...

592
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:23,632
Uh...

593
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:24,313
Did you do the music?

594
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:26,520
Yeah, I did the music.

595
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,342
The cymbal crash, I was going to say, the cymbal crash that happens every time one pops up.

596
00:39:31,222 --> 00:39:35,245
The spirit, you know, wanders around the ship. I was very impressed by that.

597
00:39:36,305 --> 00:39:38,586
Speaking of people who want to talk about features they're impressed with,

598
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:45,050
Sasquatch, I'm assuming that's how you say your name, wants to say that they like the shake of the magnifying glass.

599
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:51,173
It helps clarify its use. Same with the stopwatch and the fade in time, which you can see the stopwatch doing that right now.

600
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:55,875
Talismaniac would like to know,

601
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,716
were you inspired at all by the vanishing of Ethan Carter?

602
00:39:59,736 --> 00:40:02,897
Oh, Liam's back on camera. Say hi to Liam.

603
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:06,839
Did vanishing of Ethan Carter

604
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,339
influence your design at all here?

605
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,221
That's a good question. So when I released the first demo,

606
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:17,302
or I think maybe when I started talking about the mechanics in the devlog, people

607
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:18,423
asked me.

608
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:22,097
if I was basing this on Ethan Carter, and then the other one was Cryostasis, if this

609
00:40:22,157 --> 00:40:23,138
is based on Cryostasis.

610
00:40:23,678 --> 00:40:26,639
Those are two games I've never played, so no.

611
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,661
I've heard good things about both those games, though, and over the years, let me say it,

612
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:37,743
so working a lot on this game, I had very little time for other things, so I would give

613
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:41,704
up, say, playing new games, and I have a huge stack of games that I'm going to try to get

614
00:40:41,744 --> 00:40:46,146
to now that the game is done, and two of those games are Cryostasis and Ethan Carter.

615
00:40:47,723 --> 00:40:49,164
He did Finch as well, I really wanna play that.

616
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:54,548
So all those games have similar concepts, but I was not influenced by those because I never played them.

617
00:40:55,588 --> 00:40:59,431
I think Liam knows he's on camera because he just walked off camera, but he's still hanging out here.

618
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:03,434
Sorry, this is the most engaged he's been with a game. I think he really likes you, Lucas.

619
00:41:04,314 --> 00:41:08,417
Yeah, cats when they hear my voice, man. My cat, too. If he hears my voice, he starts, yeah.

620
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:15,514
Liam belongs to my good friend Kelsey. We're catsitting him, so unfortunately he's not going to be here permanently.

621
00:41:16,114 --> 00:41:22,120
He's a very good pretty boy. These are very important discussions happening on the GDC Twitch channel right now.

622
00:41:24,242 --> 00:41:26,765
I have more questions. We'll take some more from chat as they come.

623
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:34,558
I remember, I think I was reading through one of these things when I was doing research

624
00:41:34,798 --> 00:41:37,798
and the dithering, to go back to the art and the dithering thing, since I think that's

625
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:40,579
something a lot of devs are curious about with this game.

626
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:45,180
How does, you said something that was a challenge early on, I think in some other interview

627
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,041
when it came to compressing video and being able to make trailers for this game.

628
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:55,042
How did that, how did the one bit resolution effect, like okay, it looks great when it's

629
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:57,982
running on a computer, but it's time to put a trailer up and oh no.

630
00:41:59,986 --> 00:42:01,727
the Amazon smart machine woke up.

631
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:08,071
The, like, did that have a thing at all? Is that something you had to be worried about?

632
00:42:08,312 --> 00:42:10,733
Yeah, for sure. This is one of the things where...

633
00:42:11,934 --> 00:42:14,115
This is a really cool problem for me, actually, to have...

634
00:42:14,636 --> 00:42:17,317
to realize there's a problem there and then to have to figure it out.

635
00:42:18,058 --> 00:42:20,960
So I've got a low-resolution 1-bit game with high contrast, so

636
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:25,022
that does not compress well in any scenario.

637
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:25,362
So...

638
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:28,725
I need to think about ways to fix that.

639
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:34,508
And the first way was, the first thing I did was, this will be kind of technical, but there's

640
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:39,471
Bayer dither, which is a pattern dither, and there's a blue noise dither, which looks like

641
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:40,431
random noise dithering.

642
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:44,133
And Bayer performs really badly for compression.

643
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:50,017
Because it's a regular grid, it happens to be aliased with the compression blocks of

644
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:50,617
a video.

645
00:42:50,697 --> 00:42:55,140
So, if you try to do everything Bayer dithered, pattern dithered, then it conflicts with the

646
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,360
pattern of the compression.

647
00:42:57,202 --> 00:43:00,804
and it looks really terrible. But if you use noise dither, then it still looks terrible,

648
00:43:00,824 --> 00:43:05,986
but it doesn't look as bad. So that was the first realization and first fix, and that

649
00:43:06,026 --> 00:43:10,289
gave me hope that maybe this could work. In the end, it doesn't actually work that well,

650
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,470
but whatever, it's good enough.

651
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,931
Don't play it in a movie theater.

652
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:15,732
Yeah, I kind of like the idea that...

653
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:20,865
The only way to really see this game as it is, is to play it on a computer.

654
00:43:20,985 --> 00:43:22,506
You can't watch a video of it.

655
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:24,127
To play the... oh yeah, I guess that's weird.

656
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:27,368
Like, I think a lot of... I mean, on the one hand, Twitch is good for marketing games.

657
00:43:27,408 --> 00:43:28,888
On the other hand, story-driven games...

658
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:32,750
You know, people... devs wonder if they're losing customers because they get...

659
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,371
Not in that sense. I don't mind that at all.

660
00:43:34,431 --> 00:43:36,652
Oh, yeah, no, I wasn't... I didn't want to...

661
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:38,372
People won't play it because it doesn't look good. I mean that...

662
00:43:39,073 --> 00:43:40,773
If you want to see it as it really is...

663
00:43:41,862 --> 00:43:46,612
You've got, you can't just keep cranking up the video res, you've got to play it on a real computer, which is...

664
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:48,175
It's kind of cool to me.

665
00:43:48,355 --> 00:43:52,483
Yeah, I guess you could say you need to play it on the smallest, like, machine possible? Maybe?

666
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:54,942
Yeah, right. A 9-inch screen.

667
00:43:55,162 --> 00:44:00,025
Yeah, I have a Windows Surface in the background. I should play it on that and see what happens.

668
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:02,547
It's probably fine. It's 1080p or whatever.

669
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,391
Actually, about that compression a little bit more.

670
00:44:08,671 --> 00:44:12,814
What I realized at some point during development is that compressors work a lot like the eye works.

671
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:19,778
So that if your game doesn't compress well, then there's a good chance that it won't work well with your brain, basically.

672
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:22,520
So that's what led me to my second round of...

673
00:44:23,317 --> 00:44:27,598
of dithering fix, which was to try to keep the dither from moving while you're looking

674
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:27,858
around.

675
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:29,498
Right on.

676
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:31,659
Diving back into the chat really quick.

677
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,800
Albino Gorilla, I'm going to ask the first part of your question, because we already

678
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,481
did sort of talk about the second part, but how do you stay motivated as a solo developer

679
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:41,942
long enough to actually finish the game?

680
00:44:44,802 --> 00:44:47,863
Well, like I said earlier, it's always games that I'm interested in, or concepts that I'm

681
00:44:47,883 --> 00:44:48,543
interested in.

682
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:51,787
If I'm not interested in it, that's a problem.

683
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:55,609
But so far I've been lucky that I've kept my interest in these games long enough to finish them.

684
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:05,893
And Sky, I think at the front, earlier you mentioned a couple of Mac games that you said directly influenced this game.

685
00:45:06,093 --> 00:45:07,094
What were those again?

686
00:45:08,654 --> 00:45:12,476
So visually, Beyond Dark Castle and Dark Castle were really an influence on me.

687
00:45:13,236 --> 00:45:14,617
Shadowgate was also a big influence.

688
00:45:14,957 --> 00:45:16,518
And there's another one called Fool's Errand.

689
00:45:18,872 --> 00:45:23,335
Is was the one that's like really just beautiful all the screens are they're still screened but

690
00:45:24,315 --> 00:45:28,657
the artist who created those was really really good and that's always been kind of a

691
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,579
Uh a milestone of what you can do with one bit for me

692
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:34,160
Right on. Um

693
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:41,504
I'm gonna dive back to my question sheet as the chat, uh fans freaks out about dark castle. Um

694
00:45:41,944 --> 00:45:43,365
I never heard of that game before to be honest

695
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:46,887
You can't play it now. It's unplayable now, unfortunately, but at the time

696
00:45:47,587 --> 00:45:47,767
It was

697
00:45:48,684 --> 00:45:53,412
I just mean the concept design concepts are too hard to deal with but at the time it was really really good and it used

698
00:45:53,432 --> 00:45:55,476
the mouse and the keyboard in the way that

699
00:45:56,137 --> 00:46:01,005
Made you feel like I own a Macintosh and I'm special because no one else can play this sort of game

700
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:09,905
Right on. I think I'll show it later in the video. Like I said, this is pre-recorded, so I can't just call this up on command.

701
00:46:10,906 --> 00:46:16,448
But also with Return of the Obra Dinn, you can pop in the options and change specifically what kind of monitor this is,

702
00:46:16,848 --> 00:46:21,050
which mostly affects the color and shading. It doesn't even change a lot for gameplay.

703
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:25,371
to taste, like what's your retro computer of choice, I guess.

704
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:28,972
Why'd you do that, how'd you do that, and

705
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:32,573
was it worth it? What do you think was really valuable about that?

706
00:46:36,114 --> 00:46:36,234
I

707
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:39,334
probably don't think through everything that well, actually. This was

708
00:46:39,874 --> 00:46:42,935
a case where I'd release a demo and then people said it would be cool if they could choose the two

709
00:46:42,975 --> 00:46:43,255
colors,

710
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,376
black or white. I'd choose two

711
00:46:47,356 --> 00:46:48,796
Mac Plus style colors, basically.

712
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:56,166
And I thought, okay, well, I don't want people choosing from like an RGB control their two

713
00:46:56,186 --> 00:46:59,669
colors because that's a lot of work to make a control and also most of those won't look

714
00:46:59,689 --> 00:46:59,869
good.

715
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:03,031
So I'll just pick some colors myself and then, well, what colors can I pick?

716
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:09,236
The default colors are based on Mac+, so I'll just pick some other monitors, cool old monochrome

717
00:47:09,256 --> 00:47:10,136
monitors from that period.

718
00:47:10,877 --> 00:47:15,460
And I cheated a little bit because the Commodore is not monochrome, but I used the two Commodore

719
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:18,282
colors, blue and cyan.

720
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,804
So it was more or less just.

721
00:47:21,265 --> 00:47:23,746
try to add a few in there and I researched a lot of those monitors and

722
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:28,629
there weren't that many color options so you know kind of just stopped where it was there and looked

723
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,633
and it was easy to put in it's only changing two variables in the shader so it was trivial to add

724
00:47:34,693 --> 00:47:41,377
it and then it adds a little bit to the game. When I was playing the game at the end before

725
00:47:41,397 --> 00:47:44,219
shipping we tested a lot one of the ways to sort of

726
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:50,629
change it up for me anyways, it's just to change the color filter while I play through.

727
00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:53,210
I was going to ask why do you think people wanted that?

728
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:57,232
Why do you think developers should know that people wanted it?

729
00:47:59,854 --> 00:48:00,474
That's a good question.

730
00:48:00,514 --> 00:48:02,155
I think probably because it's a PC game.

731
00:48:02,895 --> 00:48:03,875
PC gamers want options.

732
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:05,676
They just want to, because you can.

733
00:48:06,036 --> 00:48:08,978
On PC you can open up the game files and do whatever you want so just throw that sucker

734
00:48:08,998 --> 00:48:10,318
in the menu and save us all some trouble.

735
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:14,762
Right on. Let me see here.

736
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:16,603
I'm gonna grab some water real quick.

737
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,964
I'll be just give me like 10 seconds.

738
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:18,604
Oh, go for it.

739
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,405
Yeah, I guess I'll just hang out with chat.

740
00:48:21,906 --> 00:48:26,229
Everyone I guess is talking about everyone's talking about

741
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:29,310
Dark Castle and being able to play it again on other

742
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:31,011
another platforms.

743
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:38,039
CliftonB, I kind of appreciate that too. This is one thing that really separates game dev from software dev.

744
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:43,264
Some things just sound like a cool idea, they don't need to be focus tested to heck before implementing them.

745
00:48:43,905 --> 00:48:47,989
Yeah, if you guys want to cat count right now, Liam is just off camera.

746
00:48:48,377 --> 00:48:48,817
Hey Liam.

747
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:51,459
Um, and Grunt, who's actually my cat.

748
00:48:51,899 --> 00:48:54,601
Um, she walked into the room and she walked out of the room, so...

749
00:48:55,341 --> 00:48:55,522
Um...

750
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:56,522
Alright, I'm back.

751
00:48:56,962 --> 00:48:57,503
Welcome back, yeah.

752
00:48:57,683 --> 00:49:02,706
I guess maybe now that we're on GDC Twitch, maybe we'll get some work into getting custom emotes for all the cats who show up.

753
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:04,087
Who might show up on camera.

754
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:05,248
Um, that might be fun.

755
00:49:06,129 --> 00:49:06,249
Um...

756
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:12,187
Yeah, simply AJ we named grunt after grunt from Mass Effect, which I guess n7 day was yesterday

757
00:49:12,227 --> 00:49:16,488
So happy n7 day if you're a Mass Effect fan like me

758
00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:21,109
Let's see, I'm gonna quickly check my notes check my notes

759
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:27,031
Lucas I guess I've talked to a lot of developers lately and I've been talking to them about you know

760
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:29,912
Maintaining companies and you know figuring you know keeping them

761
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,252
Like, being able to successfully make one game after another.

762
00:49:33,812 --> 00:49:41,217
Um, a lot of developers I talk to talk about taking techniques, code, um, uh, gameplay lessons.

763
00:49:41,317 --> 00:49:43,899
Like, they take a lot of- when they move from game to game, they are...

764
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:50,244
adapting things they learned on their last game to their new game, either for marketability purposes,

765
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:55,766
because they know that their company's fans want, like, similar but different, or it's because it's

766
00:49:56,066 --> 00:49:59,548
the way they can keep the cost down, is they don't have to teach themselves, you know,

767
00:49:59,948 --> 00:50:01,769
going from a 2D to 3D, for instance, is...

768
00:50:02,835 --> 00:50:05,576
something that one developer might choose not to do because they know a lot about 2D

769
00:50:05,956 --> 00:50:10,577
and 3D would be very expensive to make. With your style of game making,

770
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:14,818
how do you, what do you retain between games that you think has proven most valuable?

771
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:23,040
Yeah, I don't, because I make different games every, I try to make different game every time.

772
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,101
There's nothing like, usually nothing like code. There are some snippets of code that I keep

773
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:29,562
around and I reuse, but...

774
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:37,284
And it's not assets, not much of the production gets reused, but some concepts get reused.

775
00:50:37,604 --> 00:50:42,805
I will say on Papers, Please, one thing I learned is that game has a certain level of

776
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:46,446
jank to it, where some stuff is just a little bit not great.

777
00:50:46,866 --> 00:50:50,567
And that was because I made the game in nine months and I wasn't thinking long term that

778
00:50:50,627 --> 00:50:52,227
it's going to be a huge success.

779
00:50:52,808 --> 00:50:59,949
So once that happened to me, I realized that a game does not need to be perfect to be good.

780
00:51:00,774 --> 00:51:03,555
There's a saying I think it's perfect is the enemy of good

781
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:05,216
so

782
00:51:06,637 --> 00:51:10,378
And I also learned that at Naughty Dog actually on uncharted 1 mm-hmm where?

783
00:51:11,178 --> 00:51:14,280
My previous self before working there. I would say we got to fix all this shit

784
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:21,883
This is just totally too janky and looks like crap, but now I would say this is fine. This is I'm not trying to to

785
00:51:23,984 --> 00:51:26,785
Make it perfect basically I what I have here is good and

786
00:51:27,747 --> 00:51:32,530
If there are some janky things or slightly inconvenient things in this game, leave it

787
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:32,590
in.

788
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,351
Don't try to fix everything.

789
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:37,633
Because a lot of times when you try to fix things, you break other things.

790
00:51:38,734 --> 00:51:41,376
In some way, you're messing with what you already have.

791
00:51:42,236 --> 00:51:47,039
So that's something I learned through the years and I keep with me.

792
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:53,123
Marketing wise, I'm not thinking...

793
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,082
Okay, I'm a little bit thinking that I didn't do much marketing, it worked out okay.

794
00:51:57,182 --> 00:52:00,805
So I don't need to do marketing next time. And the same is true of publishing as well.

795
00:52:02,347 --> 00:52:06,070
I used to work with publishers. I worked with publishers in the late 90s when they had the

796
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:11,834
print discs and I worked with them on Helsing's Fire for iOS. And one of the things I did with

797
00:52:11,874 --> 00:52:15,838
Papers, Please is I decided I'll just self-publish it. Valve is there, Steam is there now. It got

798
00:52:15,858 --> 00:52:19,080
through green light, so this makes sense. It's easy, technically.

799
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:24,526
And so I self-published that. And then for Oberdin, there were a lot of opportunities where I could have had a,

800
00:52:25,006 --> 00:52:27,569
could have worked with a publisher to do it and decided, well,

801
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:31,292
fuck it. I'll just self-publish it again. It's a lot of work and it's hard, but

802
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:36,857
there's a certain amount of satisfaction there just doing everything yourself. So I did it and it worked out.

803
00:52:36,877 --> 00:52:41,141
Okay, so that's another lesson that I kind of tested and it worked out

804
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:43,983
okay, and so I'll probably be self-publishing from now on, kind of thing.

805
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:51,913
Right on. Sky kind of agrees that publishers, I think, have just changed so much. You named

806
00:52:51,973 --> 00:52:55,197
three different eras of game publishing. And I think if there's one thing I've learned

807
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:59,801
interviewing developers is that each of those eras, the art of publishing and self-publishing

808
00:52:59,861 --> 00:53:06,287
is so different. Companies that were created in the CD era don't know anything about mobile,

809
00:53:06,868 --> 00:53:07,428
et cetera, et cetera.

810
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:14,414
Um, uh, Talismaniac, if you can't share this, you know, feel free to not feel pressured to share it.

811
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:19,638
But Talismaniac would like to know if, um, do you have any Steam analytics on the average age

812
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:23,301
of your purchasers? They are curious if it's higher than other games.

813
00:53:25,363 --> 00:53:29,106
Average? No, I don't know. Does Steam tell you that? I haven't looked. I don't know. I haven't.

814
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,348
The only stat on Steam I looked at was how long people play.

815
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:37,703
It was above average. I don't remember even the number now, but it was above average for Steam games, which was satisfying.

816
00:53:38,003 --> 00:53:39,083
Nice! Nice.

817
00:53:39,744 --> 00:53:39,924
Um...

818
00:53:40,724 --> 00:53:44,746
Let's see, we're coming up. I can't believe it, but we only have five minutes left in our hour.

819
00:53:45,126 --> 00:53:48,788
If you're like me and you're on the West Coast, you're probably either eating dinner or thinking about dinner.

820
00:53:50,212 --> 00:53:52,032
If you're on the east coast, thank you for sticking with us.

821
00:53:52,112 --> 00:53:55,933
If you're in Europe, goodness, did you just wake up?

822
00:53:56,413 --> 00:53:57,414
Do you need to go to bed still?

823
00:53:58,814 --> 00:54:01,055
In any case, we're thankful that you've all joined us.

824
00:54:01,455 --> 00:54:06,016
Now is the time to get your last questions in, because we'll try to get as many as we

825
00:54:06,036 --> 00:54:06,576
can answered.

826
00:54:07,836 --> 00:54:13,338
Ricardo DSC would like to know, what kind of software did you use to make the music?

827
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:17,239
I used Logic Pro X on the Mac.

828
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:24,423
Let's see, there's this orchestral library called Decapo by Sono Kinetic, which I use

829
00:54:24,443 --> 00:54:25,965
for all the, most of the orchestral stuff.

830
00:54:26,005 --> 00:54:28,888
I use some of the Logic built-in orchestral sounds as well.

831
00:54:30,629 --> 00:54:36,695
And let's see, I use Roland Integra 7 for some of the orchestral leads.

832
00:54:38,277 --> 00:54:39,358
And I think that's it.

833
00:54:41,235 --> 00:54:48,362
MXbug would like to know, they say that one-bit graphics were a deliberate restriction, but did you find it liberating at the same time?

834
00:54:48,763 --> 00:54:52,747
Like, once you pinned that down, did it broaden the scope of what you felt you could do graphically?

835
00:54:53,568 --> 00:54:56,251
Yeah, definitely. And one other thing to help is low resolution.

836
00:54:56,331 --> 00:55:01,777
So the game does not have a lot of particle effects, which is a common sort of special effects thing you see in games.

837
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:02,898
There's lots of particles everywhere.

838
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:07,624
But because it's one bit and because it's low resolution, it allowed me to use dots instead.

839
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:11,946
Just like one pixel particles, more or less, which you don't see in a lot of games.

840
00:55:12,006 --> 00:55:17,148
And that opened up a lot of ideas about how to do effects and how to make things look in the game.

841
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:21,270
When you're not working from the same palette as everybody else, it gives me a lot of ideas

842
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:24,671
about what I can do. And this one bit stuff was definitely a different palette.

843
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:28,473
Right on. And I guess...

844
00:55:30,184 --> 00:55:34,345
I guess before we go, uh, oh, we've got albino gorilla again.

845
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:38,326
Uh, are the raw assets created in monochrome or are they fully colored and textured and

846
00:55:38,366 --> 00:55:39,046
then down res'd?

847
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:46,228
They are, they're created in RGB, but I use the different channels for different things.

848
00:55:46,328 --> 00:55:50,409
So for instance, the texture would only go in the B channel and then the R and G channel

849
00:55:50,429 --> 00:55:52,950
would be used to define the dithering type.

850
00:55:53,864 --> 00:55:56,106
or to define where the outlines are going to be.

851
00:55:56,346 --> 00:56:01,089
So, I mean, if you look at them, my development view was this kind of multicolored view of the ship at all times,

852
00:56:01,189 --> 00:56:05,112
but it wasn't... there was encoded information in those colors.

853
00:56:05,152 --> 00:56:09,715
It wasn't necessarily the normal tones you'd expect from the textures.

854
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:13,377
That's interesting. So the colors were sort of, like, when you were working in Unity,

855
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:16,499
the colors were there to tell you that a certain other thing was sitting under the color?

856
00:56:18,023 --> 00:56:22,325
Yeah, I mean the shader itself will look at the different channels of the texture and say,

857
00:56:22,365 --> 00:56:26,646
okay, for this pixel I'm going to use this dithering, for that pixel use this other dithering,

858
00:56:26,766 --> 00:56:31,588
or they would define the edges of where the outlines are going to be. So if you just look

859
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:34,388
at it, it's hard to see that stuff because it's all combined into one RGB texture,

860
00:56:34,468 --> 00:56:36,269
but the shader can suss that out.

861
00:56:37,147 --> 00:56:46,210
Very cool. With that, I guess my last question, it's not different than one I ask a lot of game developers.

862
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:51,292
I guess, what do you kind of hope, you know, people pick up Obra Dinn, they play Obra Dinn,

863
00:56:51,352 --> 00:56:54,793
what do you sort of hope they walk away from the game with when they're done?

864
00:56:56,633 --> 00:56:57,494
I just hope they enjoy it.

865
00:56:57,994 --> 00:57:02,896
As I said, I made the game mostly because that's the kind of game I wanted to play,

866
00:57:02,936 --> 00:57:05,056
so if other people like it, that's a bonus on top.

867
00:57:07,516 --> 00:57:14,819
Yeah, I hope they enjoy it, you know, and one of the kind of lighter elements I tried

868
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:18,280
to show in this game is that there's a lot of people on this boat and they're just names

869
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:23,002
and faces, but by the end of the game, I hope that you kind of have a sense of that they're

870
00:57:23,142 --> 00:57:26,423
people with their own lives and stories and stuff like that.

871
00:57:26,883 --> 00:57:33,026
I mean, that's not a main sort of force of the game or focus of the game, but I do want

872
00:57:33,046 --> 00:57:33,466
to show that.

873
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:40,902
that a ship full of people from all over the world can both get along and fight and that

874
00:57:40,922 --> 00:57:46,025
they're all, can be interesting and that grows out of not knowing detailed stories about them,

875
00:57:46,065 --> 00:57:50,928
but sort of what you assign to them in your own playthrough. So that was kind of a thing that

876
00:57:51,348 --> 00:57:56,892
I tried to add to the game, I tried to make, I tried to give the game this sense of you first

877
00:57:56,912 --> 00:58:00,674
come on this and these are just names and you don't care, but in the end you kind of know,

878
00:58:00,854 --> 00:58:04,376
recognize these people and see them in a different way.

879
00:58:05,586 --> 00:58:12,053
Right on. Albino Gorilla adds that they appreciate that aspect of the game.

880
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:18,120
With that, thank you all for watching today. Thank you, Lucas, for coming on and talking with us.

881
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,903
Yeah, it was great. My pleasure. Thanks, everybody, in the chat.

882
00:58:22,231 --> 00:58:26,192
Right. Hey, I'm just here. I'm just here to pet the cats and ask the questions.

883
00:58:26,453 --> 00:58:30,734
Um, uh, you've been watching the GDC Twitch channel. Uh, thank you all for joining us on

884
00:58:30,754 --> 00:58:35,156
this new adventure. If you know us from the Gamasutra Twitch channel, please follow this

885
00:58:35,196 --> 00:58:38,877
channel now. Um, Gamasutra is mostly just going to be hosting this for the time being, though.

886
00:58:38,897 --> 00:58:43,279
We'll still, uh, you know, we'll still use that for discussions whenever the Gama editors just

887
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:46,540
want to get on the horn and talk about, you know, how things are going in the year.

888
00:58:49,343 --> 00:58:55,109
We would love it if you hit that follow button, because if you do, you'll get notifications when we go live,

889
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:59,254
and you can find out when you can ask questions to game developers.

890
00:58:59,795 --> 00:59:03,638
about who make the games that you like. In the next couple weeks we've got the

891
00:59:03,698 --> 00:59:06,661
Blackout Club. We're working on a chat with the...

892
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:08,863
What's this game called?

893
00:59:09,684 --> 00:59:12,146
Mutant Year Zero? It looks really cool.

894
00:59:13,067 --> 00:59:15,809
Mutant Year Zero Road to Eden. That's it.

895
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:19,873
I'm talking to some other PR and devs about getting their games on.

896
00:59:21,071 --> 00:59:31,695
It's been interesting, you know, the end of the year is always interesting because big games come out and obviously those developers kind of want to go home and take vacations after they've watched their games, but there's a lot of devs who are down to talk and we're trying to talk to them right now.

897
00:59:32,295 --> 00:59:35,076
Oh yeah, quick shoutouts to chat.

898
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:38,912
Alcahal Clifton B's sasquatch abana gorilla

899
00:59:39,552 --> 00:59:41,392
Ricardia

900
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:48,294
Ricardia Ricardo Diaz see says thank you from Brazil. Thank you Ricardo. Thank you for tuning in from so far away

901
00:59:48,374 --> 00:59:51,275
I honest to God um Lucas you're in Japan

902
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:55,996
I'm in California Ricardo's in Brazil if there's one thing that I've really been excited about doing these twitch streams

903
00:59:56,056 --> 01:00:00,157
Is that we all get to talk together about making video games even though we are all

904
01:00:01,132 --> 01:00:02,692
literally far away on the planet.

905
01:00:02,852 --> 01:00:06,673
And then the awkward pitch that follows up on that is that

906
01:00:07,693 --> 01:00:10,614
GDC will be March 18th to 22nd

907
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:13,334
in San Francisco. And if you'd like to join us at GDC,

908
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,495
you can scroll down and click the button,

909
01:00:15,795 --> 01:00:17,535
and you can register for your pass.

910
01:00:19,396 --> 01:00:20,796
There's all kinds of different pass options

911
01:00:20,836 --> 01:00:22,096
for people from different backgrounds.

912
01:00:22,156 --> 01:00:25,537
We sincerely hope to make sure no matter what kind of developer you are,

913
01:00:25,577 --> 01:00:26,717
wherever you're coming from in the world,

914
01:00:27,218 --> 01:00:30,421
that when you come to GDC you're going to get something super useful out there that

915
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:34,204
will help you make interesting and successful games.

916
01:00:35,505 --> 01:00:41,731
With that, Lucas, and I always like to give devs a chance, if the folks at home watching

917
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:46,455
would like to ask you more detailed questions about making this game, where can they contact

918
01:00:46,495 --> 01:00:46,596
you?

919
01:00:48,889 --> 01:00:51,451
Twitter! On Twitter. Twitter, find him on Twitter.

920
01:00:51,832 --> 01:00:55,116
Um, I think it's Duke Pope? Is that how you say it?

921
01:00:55,136 --> 01:00:59,000
Ducope. Ducope. Uh, that's how you can find him on Twitter.

922
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:02,684
Um, with that, have a good day everyone, or good night, good day, wherever you are.

923
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,486
Bye! Bye.
